David Cameron says successful deal would add up to £100bn to the EU economy and £85bn to US economy
Plans for an ambitious transatlantic trade deal have been launched by the European Union and the United States.
Negotiations will begin in Washington next month amid hopes of a speedy agreement that will help the world economy grow more rapidly.
Announcing the launch of talks, David Cameron said a successful deal would add up to £100bn ($157bn) to the EU economy and up to £85bn ($134bn) to the US economy.
"This is a once-in-a-generation prize and it must be seized," the prime minister said.
UK sources said that it was hoped the negotiations could be wrapped up within 18 months, but US president Barack Obama warned that there would be difficulties to overcome.
"This is a priority for the United States" the president said. "We will give negotiators a strong mandate but we will have to intervene to break through logjams."
France has already insisted that cultural industries are excluded from the negotiations, fearful that it would increase the influence of Hollywood.
Obama said: "We must resist the temptation to downsize our ambitions and avoid the difficult issues just get a deal."
José Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, said: "Negotiations might not always be easy but they will be worth it. We will find solutions to thorny issues, we will keep our eyes on the prize and we will succeed. We intend to move forward fast."
Cameron has made trade liberalisation one of the main themes of the G8 summit and said that a deal would mean extra jobs, lower prices and more choice. UK officials said an agreement could boost British trade by £10bn – worth £380 for each household.
The prime minister said it would be the biggest bilateral trade deal in history and "have a greater impact than all the other trade deals on the table put together", creating up to two million jobs.
He added: "The whole point is to fire up our economies and drive growth and prosperity around the world. To do things that make a real difference to people's lives. And there is no more powerful way to achieve that than by boosting trade."
The US president said: "The US-EU relationship is the largest in the world. We trade about $1tn in goods and services each year, we invest nearly $4tn in each other's economies and all that supports around 10 million jobs on each side of the Atlantic. This potential ground-breaking partnership would deepen those ties."
Although much transatlantic trade is already tariff-free, there are a number of sectors – such as financial services – where officials believe there is scope for liberalisation.
Washington and Brussels have warmed to the idea of a trade and investment partnership following the prolonged impasse in global free-trade talks, now into their 12th year.
The Blue Jackets are a mess.
This is not shocking. When you set your franchise mark for games in a row without a win, something is clearly not right. And, as frustrating as that is, the bigger problem is that we really don't *know* what this team is capable of, because it's fighting with at least one hand tied behind its collective back.
The Jackets could probably survive three players being injured. But, to have three of your top four centers out? For this team, it's almost impossible to expect them to have any success. Here's why.
Quite literally, everything starts with your centers. It's why every team is always looking for center depth, and the elusive "number one center" for their club. Frankly, it's why the Ryan Johansen contract negotiation was so big, and so tenuous at times. Every time there's a faceoff, the center touches the puck. The center has the biggest responsibility in terms of offense AND defense. And, with these people specifically, they play in all three phases of the game.
Faceoffs
This is where it all starts for Columbus. The three centers out are all pretty decent in the faceoff circle. To wit, their 2013-14 numbers:
Brandon Dubinsky - 586-for-1107, 52.9%
Mark Letestu - 374-for-730, 51.2%
Artem Anisimov - 476-for-965, 49.3%
TOTAL - 1436-for-2802, 51.2%
As a team last season, the Jackets finished 9th in the league in the faceoff circle with a 51.6% success rate. So far this season, they are 25th with a 48.0% success rate. Letestu has been great this season, with a 58.8% rate, though Ansimov has struggled a bit with a 46.8% rate. That said, Alexander Wennberg is currently struggling with a 39.1% success rate in 110 draws. Boone Jenner is at 41.4% in 87 draws. Michael Chaput is at 46.2% in 143 draws. Shoot, even Adam Cracknell of all people has taken 32 faceoffs, though he's won just over 40% of them. If you add all of that up... to think the club isn't missing these three guys in the circle would be crazy.
Faceoffs drive possession. How many times during this streak have we seen the Jackets' goalie freeze the puck, only to lose the faceoff and be faced with being pinned into their own zone again? How many times after an icing call does the team lose a faceoff, thus forced to try to regain possession and/or clear the zone with tired legs? It's all cumulative, and it has a way of wearing a team down throughout a game.
Speaking of possession...
Possession
I'll be the first to admit that I don't often delve into the depths of the Fancy Stats, because I think sometimes we can get too bogged down in the minutiae and miss what's actually in front of us. That said, a quick look at the Corsi On numbers (basically the net total of shots attempted while you're on the ice) of these three compared to the centers currently playing this season is a stark contrast. As a bit of a disclaimer, I think it's probably not an apples-to-apples comparison with Letestu, as he sometimes slots in as a wing, which skews his numbers in some ways. That said, let's take a look.
Even Strength Corsi On - 2013-14
Dubinsky: 2.94
Anisimov: 0.06
Letestu: -2.55
TOTAL: 0.45
Those number probably don't blow you away. After all, it's basically a break even in shots generated, right? Well, consider the numbers of two of their replacements this season:
Even Strength Corsi On - 2014-15
Wennberg: -16.88
Chaput: -12.95
TOTAL: -29.83
(In the interest of disclosure, the sample sizes are smaller, of course. Also, Jenner has played just four games, so again the sample size... but he's currently rocking a 25.41 Corsi On, which is pretty darn good. But, Letestu and Anisimov this season is a combined 15.11 as well, so the club is missing them.)
In short summary, the team is getting killed in the faceoff circle right now, and they're getting out-shot by an insane margin across the board, which amplifies the goaltending issues the team is currently facing. They're missing three guys that would mitigate those two problems in a very big way.
Defense
This one is more difficult to quantify in a way, but the fact is that the center is the most defensively responsible forward. And, as we saw in the playoffs, the ability to match up your one defensive stopper at center can completely change the way a game (and a series, in some ways) is played. Brandon Dubinsky had an amazing playoff series matched up with Sidney Crosby, effectively shutting Crosby down.
But it wasn't just that series.
Throughout the entire season last year, Dubinsky was the defensive stopper. Of all forwards that played at least 50 games, at even strength Dubinsky led the team in the Corsi Quality of Competition stat (average Corsi of opposing players, weighted by head-to-head ice time) which is a strong indicator of the role he plays. Buried in that stat are the effects of the faceoff and possession numbers highlighted above: Dubinsky wins more draws, and that in turn drives down the shot totals of the opponents he faces. But, not only is he doing that, he's doing it against consistently the toughest competition on the team.
This simply can NOT be over-stated: the importance of having your true defensive shut-down forward--not to mention a guy that plays and contributes in ALL phases--completely changes the complexion of the team that Todd Richards can ice. It frees up Johansen's line to go against weaker competition, which can unleash some of their offense (though we know that, all things being equal, Johansen is no defensive slouch himself). Speaking of "all phases of the game," what about special teams?
Special Teams
This is another area of concern. While the Power Play has been stable to this point (11th in the league at 21.0%, even with last night's futitlity), it could always be better. Consider that, during last season, of ALL forwards in ANY games-played, Dubinsky, Anisimov, and Letestu ranked first, sixth, and ninth respectively in TOI/60 on the Power Play. In terms of points/60 on the Power Play, these three again rank high: Letestu was 1st (6.59), Dubinsky was 6th (2.50), and Anisimov was 8th (1.53).
For a team struggling to score right now, those three guys would certainly add to a PP unit that is already solid, but could be even better. Remember the playoffs? *Sigh*
On the other side of the coin, the PK is where the team, in my opinion, is missing these three the most. All three play HUGE minutes. From last season, again of ALL forwards in ANY games-played, consider that these three players were literally 1-2-3 in TOI/60 on the PK. Letestu (2.19), Dubinsky (2.07), and Anisimov (2.05) were Todd Richards' MOST TRUSTED FORWARDS on the PK last season... a unit that finished in the top half of the league with an 82.1% success rate.
In addition to that, it's important to note something else: we'd debated Dubinsky's PIM issue early in the season last season, though he improved as the season went on. But, beyond that, again looking at all forwards from last season and filtering guys that played 50 games, these guys were some of the more disciplined. Dubinsky was the worst on the team with 1.50 penalties taken/60, but again, that was the tale of two halves of the season. When the team was winning, Dubinsky was much more disciplined. That said, the other two guys were second- and fourth-best at taking penalties. Anisimov took just 0.4 penalties/60, and Letestu just 0.6 penalties/60.
Summary
Obviously, this club's injury list so far has been atrocious. As Kyle Alexander and our friends at Raw Charge noted as Saturday's game started, with injuries there's a big difference between "an excuse" and "a reason" and we are most definitely in the latter category.
Missing Sergei Bobrovsky hurts, of course, as we've seen our backup goaltending flounder in his absence. But, by my estimation, the biggest thing hurting the Jackets right now is that they are missing arguably three of their most important players at their most important position. Missing these three guys--especially Dubinsky--is just flat-out killing this team right now.

Arsenal will wait for confirmation on the futures of Bacary Sagna and Lukasz Fabianski before finalising their summer transfer plans.
The Gunners are expected to announce manager Arsene Wenger's new three-year contract this week and are hopeful that Saturday's FA Cup victory over Hull will prompt a late change of heart in two players the club are keen to keep.
Sagna and Fabianski (right) both played the entirety of Arsenal's win with Wenger keen to show solidarity with the pair despite both indicating they are set to leave when their deals expire at the end of the month.
There was similar thinking behind the decision to allow Thomas Vermaelen to lift the trophy despite not playing. The Belgian has been linked with a move but Wenger was keen to ensure his captain was part of the celebrations, underlining his importance as a squad player.
Regardless of what Sagna, Fabianski and Vermaelen decide, Arsenal are expected to invest in at least two new players this summer but Wenger revealed that the club's outgoings must first be determined.
Arsenal Season Review 5 show all Arsenal Season Review 1/5 The manager Arsene Wenger has faced more questions about his suitability for Arsenal than ever before, prompting a season of introspection and a delay in signing his new contract while he evaluates his worth to the club.

A tricky category because his competition is a 21-year-old striker without a goal to his name (Yaya Sanogo) and a Swedish veteran who was injured for nearly half his time at the club (Kim Kallstrom). Ozil started well, faded and was peripheral in some important games but is a high-class acquisition and will surely improve next year.

“First, we have to wait for Sagna —what will he do? — and Fabianski,” he said. “After, we have to bring in two or three players. Unfortunately, there are many teams on the market at the moment.”
Arsenal have more than £100million to spend — a figure bolstered by the beginning of a new kit sponsorship with Puma which starts in July. That five-year agreement was frontloaded, just as the Emirates shirt deal was, meaning that Arsenal will receive the first tranche of £30m this summer to spend on players.
Wenger's priority is to sign a centre-forward. He continues to monitor Mario Mandzukic at Bayern Munich and Real Madrid's Karim Benzema. The club have scouted Diego Costa but their information remains that the Atletico Madrid striker will most likely join Chelsea. Mandzukic and Benzema are Wenger's preferred options but Alvaro Morata is under consideration while Queens Park Rangers's striker Loic Remy is a cheaper alternative. Wenger also retains a slight interest in Salomon Kalou.
Arsenal are also expected to sign a holding midfielder with enquiries made for Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender and Javi Martinez, of Bayern Munich. Should Sagna and Fabianski depart as expected, Wenger will consider reviving his interest in right-back Calum Chambers, of Southampton. Everton's Seamus Coleman is another option.
With Emiliano Viviano returning to Palermo after a season-long loan spell and Fabianski on the brink of leaving, Wenger will have only one senior keeper, Wojciech Szczesny. It is understood he is keen on integrating 21-year-old Damian Martinez, who has been on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, into the first-team group, while the club have considered moves for Barcelona's Victor Valdes and Real Madrid's Iker Casillas.

“General Solo, is your strike team assembled?”
–General Crix Madine, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi
Immerse yourself in Star Wars adventures that you create with Imperial Assault, a miniatures game of tactical ground combat for two to five players. You'll take up arms alongside the Alliance or the Empire in the midst of the Galactic Civil War. Whether you take potshots at Stormtroopers or pilot a massive AT-ST walker, Imperial Assault pulls you into the tension and excitement of the classic Star Wars films.
Within Imperial Assault, you'll find two complete game experiences. The first is a campaign game, allowing you and up to four friends to play as heroes in an elite Rebel strike team or command the legions of the Empire. Either way, you'll tell a cinematic tale that stretches across a series of missions. The other game is a skirmish game that invites you and a friend to muster your forces and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.
In our last preview, we explored movement and combat in Imperial Assault. These actions make up the heart of gameplay, and are shared by both the campaign game and the skirmish game. As we move forward, previews will focus on either the campaign game or the skirmish game within Imperial Assault. Today, we turn our attention fully to the campaign game as we preview heroes in the campaign, and two heroes in particular: the valiant commander and the sly smuggler.
Heroic Endeavors
In an Imperial Assault campaign game, the Rebel players aren't just any characters – they're heroes of the Rebellion! To reflect this, heroes are the only figures that can use more than one action to attack, but they also have access to certain special abilities and actions.
Heroes in a campaign can push their own limits by taking on strain. Many special abilities require the hero to suffer strain in order to trigger the ability. A hero may also suffer a strain to gain a movement point twice per activation. By using strain to gain movement points, you can conserve your actions for other tasks, such as attacking or interacting with the mission. Even strain has its limits, however. A hero cannot suffer strain beyond his endurance, which is shown on his hero sheet.
Fortunately, there's a way for heroes in a campaign to remove strain by using an action to rest. Resting removes strain tokens equal to the hero's endurance, freeing the hero to take strain once more. In addition, if you have fewer strain tokens than your endurance when you rest, any remaining endurance heals damage. For example, Jyn Odan has an endurance of four. If she chooses to rest when she has two strain, she removes two strain and two damage. You can even rest when you have no strain and recover only wounds! Resting is vital to keep your heroes in the fight, but it also consumes crucial actions, giving the Imperial player more opportunities to concentrate fire and bring you down.
Defeating a hero is also more difficult than defeating an ordinary soldier. Each hero has a health listed on his hero sheet, and when the hero takes damage equal to his health, rather than being defeated, he is wounded and flips over his hero sheet. A wounded hero loses a special ability and his speed, endurance, and attributes decrease. If a wounded hero again takes damage equal to his health, his grievous wounds force him to withdraw, and he is removed from the mission.
The Commander
Gideon Argus, a seasoned Alliance commander, is just one of the heroes you may play over the course of an Imperial Assault campaign. Well-trained in battlefield tactics, Gideon Argus possesses a fierce intellect and the sangfroid to command calmly in the heat of battle. Argus may not deal the decisive blow, but his squadmates never get far without his guidance.
Gideon Argus's hero sheet displays a variety of information about the hero, including his two abilities. The Command ability can be triggered by spending an action and suffering two strain, and it allows Gideon Argus to choose a friendly figure within three spaces. That figure interrupts Argus's turn to move or attack, allowing you to position the members of your squad or coordinate a decisive attack at the opportune moment.
Gideon Argus can also draw upon his years of experience with his Disabling Shot ability. Whenever Argus attacks with a ranged weapon, he may spend a surge to inflict the stunned condition on his target. If a figure is stunned, it cannot attack or exit its space, and must spend an action to remove the stunned condition. By stunning your opponent's figures, Gideon Argus can hamper the Imperial plan, even as Gideon's commands allow other heroes to maneuver and attack in concert.
Gideon Argus's Class cards allow his already formidable leadership skills to grow even more potent. Called Shot allows Gideon to grant a surge to himself or another hero attacking a target in Gideon's line of sight, while For the Cause! allows Gideon to suffer a strain to focus a friendly attacking figure. Other Class cards enhance the power of Argus's Command ability. Air of Command grants more health and allows Argus to choose any friendly figure in his line of sight with his Command ability. Masterstroke, one of Gideon Argus's most expensive Class cards, allows him to immediately use Command again after using it, doubling his ability to lead other heroes.
The Smuggler
After building a reputation on smuggling and gunfighting, Jyn Odan pledged her skills to the Rebel Alliance. She's fast on the draw and light on her feet, and she's left more than a few Stormtroopers watching helplessly as her ship blasts out of orbit. In your Imperial Assault campaigns, Jyn Odan might be just the hero you need to run rings around Imperial troops.
Jyn Odan bears two innate abilities that frame her gunslinging talents. The first ability is Quick Draw. By suffering two strain at the beginning of a hostile figure's activation, Jyn Odan can perform an attack with a Pistol that targets the activated figure, potentially dropping an enemy before he even takes an action. Being a crack shot is one thing, but even that can be useless if you don't have a way to escape enemy blaster fire. Thankfully, Jyn Odan also has the Opportunist ability. Whenever she attacks, if her target suffered damage, she may move one space, allowing her to get behind cover or set up another shot.
Jyn Odan's Class cards enhance her already prodigious skills. Quick As A Whip allows Odan to move one space immediately after an attack against her, giving her more opportunities to escape from harm or prepare for her next attack. The Sidewinder Class card gives her even more movement by allowing her to move up to two spaces after resolving an attack – an ability that stacks with the extra movement from her Opportunist ability.
Jyn Odan's gunfighter talents also benefit from her Class cards. Gunslinger allows Odan to trigger any of her Pistols' surge abilities when she attacks with a Pistol. In addition, she can suffer a strain and exhaust Gunslinger to apply an extra surge to her attack results, giving her even more options for Pistol attacks. Jyn can pull off seemingly impossible shots with Trick Shot, a card that allows her to draw line of sight for a ranged attack from any space within three spaces of her actual location.
Muster Your Squad
Call upon the talents of Gideon Argus and Jyn Odan, or use another hero included in Imperial Assault in your campaigns. We'll preview two more heroes from Imperial Assault in a future preview, but join us next week when we examine how your heroes grow and change throughout the campaign, gaining experience and credits.

Not to be confused with Abecedarium
Азбучна молитва ("Alphabetical prayer"). In this work, the first letter of each verse, highlighted in bold, is part of a series of letters that are in alphabetical order (from top to bottom). Transcription of Constantine of Preslav 's Bulgarian abecedarius("Alphabetical prayer"). In this work, the first letter of each verse, highlighted in bold, is part of a series of letters that are in alphabetical order (from top to bottom).
An abecedarius (also abecedary and abecedarian) is a special type of acrostic in which the first letter of every word, strophe or verse follows the order of the letters in the alphabet.[1][2][3][4]
Etymology [ edit ]
"Abecedarius" (or "abecedarium") is a Medieval Latin word meaning "ABC primer", derived by adding the suffix "-arius" (-a, -um) to the names of the first four letters of the alphabet (a+b+c+d).[2][3] According to the OED, the earliest use of its English cognate, "abecedary", dates back at least to the mid-15 century, preceding the first usage of "abecedarian" which, as an adjective meaning "arranged in alphabetical order", can be first attested in 1665.[5] The related adjective "alphabetic" (from Ancient Greek) has been used interchangeably with "abecedarian" since at least the 17th century.[6][7]
Origins [ edit ]
The abecedarius is most probably the oldest type of acrostic.[8] Its origins have been linked to either the sacred nature of letters and the mystical significance of these types of arrangements[8][2][3] or its didactic use as a mnemonic and instructive device for children.[2] Indeed, this second type of abecedarii, mostly in the form of rhythmic arrangements or songs, is still popular and widely used tool to teach children the alphabet or other concepts.
Use in literature [ edit ]
Ancient literature [ edit ]
The oldest abecedarii found are of Semitic origin.[2] In fact, all of the confirmed acrostics in the Hebrew Bible are alphabetic. These occur in four of the five chapters that make up the Book of Lamentations, in the praise of the good wife in Proverbs 31:10-31, and in Psalms 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, and 145.[9]
Notable[2][3] among the acrostic psalms is the long Psalm 119, which typically is printed in subsections named after the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, each section consisting of 8 verses, each of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet and the entire psalm consisting of 22 x 8 = 176 verses; and Psalm 145, which is recited three times a day in the Jewish services.
Some acrostic psalms are technically imperfect. E.g., Psalm 9 and Psalm 10 appear to constitute a single acrostic psalm together, but the length assigned to each letter is unequal and five of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet are not represented and the sequence of two letters is reversed. In Psalm 25, one Hebrew letter is not represented; the following letter (resh) repeated. In Psalm 34, the current final verse, 23, does fit verse 22 in content, but makes the line too long. In Psalms 37 and 111, the numbering of verses and the division into lines are interfering with each other; as a result, in Psalm 37, for the letters dalet and kaph, there is only one verse, and the letter ayin is not represented. Psalm 111 and 112 have 22 lines, but 10 verses. Psalm 145 does not represent the letter nun, having 21 verses, but one Qumran manuscript of this psalm does have that missing line, which agrees with the Septuagint.
Medieval literature [ edit ]
Written around 393, St. Augustine's well-known abecedarian psalm against the Donatists is the earliest known example of medieval rhythmical verse.[2] Another example is Old Polish poem Skarga umierającego[10] (A Dying Man Complaint). Such poems are important historical sources for development of orthography. They can be proofs that some letters were used long ago and later were totally forgotten. Bishop Constantine of Preslav's abecedarius from 9th century documents the early Slavic alphabet. Nowadays abecedariuses are written chiefly for children.[11] The most famous example of abecedarius in English literature is Geoffrey Chaucer's ABC.[12]
Modern literature [ edit ]
One of the most famous and complex[13] modern examples of alliterative verse in the English language is Alaric Watts's abecedarius The Siege of Belgrade which loosely chronicles the historical event in 29 lines, each of the first 26 not only beginning with the consecutive letters of the alphabet, but also composed only of words beginning with the respective letter:[14]
An Austrian army, awfully arrayed,
Boldly by battery besieged Belgrade.
Cossack commanders cannonading come,
Dealing destruction's devastating doom.
Every endeavor engineers essay,
For fame, for fortune fighting - furious fray!
Even though rarely used, some authors have preferred to use the term "abecedarius" for poems which follow Watts' arrangement, considering the "alphabet-in-acrostic" form just a loose application, as can be witnessed in these self-referential lines:[15]
An abecedarius always alliterates
Blindly blunders, but blooms:
Comes crawling craftily, cantering crazily,
Daring, doubtless, dark dooms.
Contemporary literature [ edit ]
In the words of the American poet and critic Edward Hirsch, "[t]he abecedarian has been revived in contemporary poetry with experimental force", because, "[p]aradoxically, the arbitrary structure triggers verbal extravagances".[3] Hirsch names Harryette Mullen's Sleeping with the Dictionary (2002), Carolyn Forché's poem "On Earth" (2003), Barbara Hamby's The Alphabet of Desire (2006) and Karl Elder's Gilgamesh at the Bellagio (2007) as few modern examples structured in accordance with different variations of the basic abecedarian sequence, where the adherence to the form produces unusual and interesting aesthetic results.
In the case of Forché's "forty-seven-page poem", for example, the rigorous alphabetical order "guides not only the stanzas, but also the words themselves":[16]
languid at the edge of the sea
lays itself open to immensity
leaf-cutter ants bearing yellow trumpet flowers
along the road
left everything left all usual worlds behind
library, lilac, linens, litany.
Mary Jo Bang's verse collection The Bride of E uses the abecedarian as an organizing principle, as do Jessica Greenbaum's “A Poem for S.”, Tom Disch's “Abecedary”, and Matthea Harvey's sequence “The Future of Terror/The Terror of Future”.[17]
Children's literature [ edit ]
Some of the best-known and loved abecedarians have been written for children, such as Dr. Seuss's ABC or the roughly half-dozen alphabet books of Edward Gorey, the most notorious among them The Gashlycrumb Tinies.[16] However, even the most experimental authors of the twentieth century have authored children's or quasi-children abecedarians. Written in an attempt to compose "a birthday book [she] would have liked as a child", To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays, Gertrude Stein's intended follow-up to her first children's book, The World Is Round, has been described as "a romp through the alphabet"[3] and an "unusual alphabet book".[18] Also, Djuna Barnes' last book, Creatures in an Alphabet is a collection of rhyming quatrains about different animals, ordered, albeit loosely, in an alphabet sequence.

Iroha mojigusari is a Japanese poetic form, a "specialized version" of the abecedarius, in which the first line begins with the first and ends with the second character of the alphabet, the second one begins with the third and ends with the fourth character of the alphabet, and so on, "until all the letters of the alphabet have been used in order".[3][2]
Alphabet poem [ edit ]
Invented by Paul West, a British-born American novelist, poet, and essayist, the alphabet poem is a stricter modern variation of the abecedarius. It consists of 13 lines, each consisting of two words, each word starting with a letter which follows the initial letter of the preceding word. West introduced the alphabet poem in his book Alphabet Poetry, a cycle of 26 poems, the first of which starts with AB and ends with YZ, the second one starting with BC and ending with ZA, and the last one starting with ZA and ending in XY.[19] Due to the constraints, West allows himself few liberties here and there, as can be witnessed in this example:[19]

Check out the picture above. Does that look like an image of a real location? Square Enix is hoping you think so.
At a press conference in Japan this weekend, Square showed off the first tech demos of Luminous Engine, its new next-gen technology that the publisher hopes will help create some of the best-looking games ever for minimal cost and technical problems. Check out the image below to see the shot above compared to a real photo.
While we don't have a ton of solid details on the Luminous Engine and Square has yet to announce any games actually using it, the publisher plans to offer the technology to other companies via something they're calling Luminous Studio. The really surprising part? Despite the high level of detail, Square expects this engine to lower the cost of games.
According to Square Enix chief technical officer Yoshihisa Hashimoto, Luminous Studio will reduce the cost of creating a game by "up to 30 percent" and should make the dev cycle faster. The publisher says Luminous was created to be used for any type of game from a casual title to a full-blown next-gen experience.
Here's hoping we can see a game using this exciting technology soon.

Surratt's response seems specious because Hansen wasn't proposing to house sports at the center, per the city's request. Sports activities would all be housed at Hansen's SoDo arena, which could also accommodate the larger concerts with minimal impacts because it's in an industrial/commercial neighborhood with almost no residences.
The abrupt back of the hand Surratt gave Hansen signaled the city's eagerness to do the Oak View deal without considering whether repurposing KeyArena is an idea whose time has come. It called to mind the letter sent in June to the city by AEG Facilities President Bob Newman. In withdrawing his company's bid, he excoriated the city for bias in the bid process. Newman wrote, “And we believe the city has failed to conduct a sufficiently thorough, objective and transparent process to properly evaluate the respective strengths and weaknesses of the two proposals and, most significantly, to identify the proposal best positioned to deliver a project consistent with the community's interests.”
Newman reserved a shot for Oak View, saying he was highly skeptical its plan could be pulled off: “If the city elects to proceed with that remaining proposal, to protect the public interests of Seattle, it is imperative that you closely and diligently monitor the process to ensure that Oak View Group is held accountable …”
It would be easy to write off Newman's complaints as sour grapes when he realized his company wasn't going to win. Indeed, AEG — which ironically has contracted with the city to manage KeyArena since the Sonics' departure in 2008 — was behind from the start because its bid included a request of the city for $250 million in bond financing for construction. The request was similar to one from Hansen in 2012 that he subsequently abandoned because, in Seattle's no-stadium-subsidy political culture, the hit on the public exchequer was radioactive.
At least some explanation for Newman's contempt likely is rooted in the profound animosity between Leiweke's company and AEG, where he was president from 1996 until 2013, when he had a falling out with owner Phillip Anschutz. A Denver billionaire and one of the most influential figures in global sports and entertainment, Anschutz hired Leiweke to build an empire, and he did. AEG owns and/or operates more than 100 facilities worldwide, including London's opulent The O2 Arena and the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
But after an unsuccessful attempt in 2013 to sell AEG for $10 billion, Leiweke was ousted, apparently the fall guy in the deal's failure. After a couple of years as president of Toronto's Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment in Toronto, which owns the NHL Maple Leafs, the NBA Raptors and the MLS Toronto FC, Leiweke partnered with music industry titan Irving Azoff and James Dolan, owner of Madison Square Garden and New York's NBA Knicks and NHL Rangers, to form Oak View.
Oak View set about to usurp AEG's hegemony in the entertainment world. This past summer, a turf battle broke out that typified the animus. Oak View/Madison Square Garden's tour operation announced it was forbidding from its arenas any acts that previously had appeared in AEG-operated buildings. Since Oak View/MSG has a partnership with Live Nation, the world's largest concert promotion company, the upstart has considerable leverage in the concert bookings business. Leiweke is quick to point out that Live Nation believes in the Seattle bid so much that it is taking an equity position in the project with Oak View.
Whether this acute business rivalry has added intensity to the Seattle drama isn't clear. But council members would be well served to consider whether the urgency with which the project is proceeding is driven more by Oak View's needs than the city's long-term interests.
The haste may be part of why Oak View insists on an exclusivity clause in the draft MOU, after Leiweke said early on that Hansen was welcome to build the SoDo arena in the hope (wink, wink) that the NBA prefers his place instead of Seattle Center.
Leiweke doesn't want the SoDo plan to disrupt his plan, so Oak View's executive summary in the MOU now states: “ … the city will not provide financial support, benefits or incentives … with respect to the construction of any live entertainment venue with a capacity of more than 15,000 seats within the city of Seattle.”
If Leiweke's MOU language is adopted, it would jeopardize Hansen's plan because Hansen needs a “benefit” from the City Council of vacating two blocks of Occidental Avenue South. Hansen has maintained the vacation approval comes at no cost or risk to the city, because he would begin construction only after an NBA team was secured, and would pay the city market value for the property, perhaps $20 million or more. Hansen needs the city's street vacation permission to receive a Master Use Permit to build, a vital turning point in his financial plan to induce investors wealthier than he to come forward as majority owners of an NBA team.
Business logic also says that if Hansen's bid is alive, the city can use it as leverage in gaining concessions from Oak View prior to signing a final MOU. But perhaps the city is less worried about the best possible deal than it is with no longer aggravating the Port of Seattle.
Oak View and its supporters in city government are not the only objectors to Hansen's SoDo enterprise. The neighbor to the west, the Port, and the neighbor to the north, the Seattle Mariners, have offered strident opposition to the location of Hansen's arena, fearing more traffic congestion. The Port claims the arena will be a threat to middle-class jobs because freight mobility will be degraded and shippers will go elsewhere. It seems a dubious claim, but it worked to help give five council members sufficient cover for the original 5-4 "no" vote in May 2016 on the Occidental Avenue vacation.
SoDo arena events largely would be held on nights and weekends, when the Port is closed. Economic threats to the Port far greater than a busy First Avenue South exist globally, nationally and regionally, which introduces the bigger question whether container shipping is the highest and best use of Seattle's spectacular, expensive shoreline. In the Bay Area, the port of San Francisco is Oakland; in Puget Sound, every bit of container-ship logic says Seattle's port should be Tacoma.
Independent of the arena but partly because of the attention the controversy drew, the Port over the summer won a landmark development: Funding was completed for the $123 million Lander Street overpass, which will carry freight unimpeded over nine railroad tracks, the way Edgar Martinez Drive does next to Safeco Field. The port has been pursuing the project for 15 years, long before it heard of Hansen. But the celebration was muted because Port backers didn't want the City Council and voters to think their freight mobility problems were solved independent of their anti-arena claims.
The Port's broader anti-arena lament, the gentrification of Seattle's last blue-collar industrial neighborhood, was torpedoed in October by none other than an ally: Mariners CEO John Stanton. Talking to reporters after another dismal end to the Mariners season, Stanton was asked his views on the arena. “If Chris does build in SoDo, we'll absolutely work with him,” Stanton said. “The fact is if [Hansen] doesn't build an arena, they're going to develop it in some way. I'm excited to see what that is.”
There goes the neighborhood, Port fans. Their comrade in arena bashing knows the middle-class worker's paradise is going to be scuttled regardless of the council's decision.

Speaking of neighborhoods, Hansen grew up in Rainier Valley and attended Nathan Hale and Roosevelt high schools, spending summers and weekends washing dishes in the restaurant kitchens of legendary Seattle barkeep Mick McHugh. He attended San Diego State and USC and lives near San Francisco, but his local origins have endeared him to many sports fans, some of whom are cool, maybe even cold, to the prospects of a return of big-time hockey to a glamorous new arena. Forty-one years of basketball have left a yearning in many that is not allayed by biscuits in the basket.
For a non-native, Leiweke is hardly a stranger to Seattle sports, and has often been curiously influential. Born in St. Louis, the fourth of six kids, he lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Bernadette. His daughter, Francesca, works for Oak View.
In 1994, he was president of the Denver Nuggets, who entered the NBA playoffs with almost no hope, yet eliminated the top-seeded Sonics — the first time in NBA history a No. 8 seed beat a No. 1. In 2004, while at AEG, he was also president of the MLS Los Angeles Galaxy when he fired Coach Sigi Schmid, who later became the first coach of the expansion Sounders FC. In 2013, when Leiweke was president of the Raptors, he joined 21 other owners' reps in voting to deny Hansen's bid to relocate the Kings from Sacramento to Seattle.
Most famously, he's the older brother of Tod Leiweke, considered the most successful sports executive (2003-2010) in Seattle's modern sports history. As CEO of the Seahawks and Sounders, Tod in 2009 needed a football coach after firing Jim Mora. He wanted USC Coach Pete Carroll but needed a clandestine place in Los Angeles for a meeting to assure secrecy. Tim offered Tod the backyard of his home for a dinner chat al fresco. As you may have heard, things worked out.
Tod Leiweke left the Seahawks in 2010 for the NHL, where he was CEO and part owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning, which reached the 2015 Stanley Cup finals. A longtime hockey player and fan, Tod put Tim onto the possibilities for the NHL in Seattle. Tod left his favorite sport in 2015 to become COO of the NFL, the No. 2 executive position behind Commissioner Roger Goodell.
It would be hard to find two people, let alone brothers, more knowledgeable about and experienced in the business of big-time global sports. Which explains much of Tim Leiweke's certitude when it comes to his plan.
“What I believe is, if we don't get an arena built first, [Commissioners] Adam Silver and Gary Bettman are always going to hesitate as to whether anything can get done in Seattle because of the history here,” he says. “Only by doing [a concert arena before sports] will we have the best chance to ultimately convince a league to bring a team here.”
That may be true. It is also true that Leiweke has never done a remodel like this in a place like Seattle, where process is king and the land and building remain public. And he has a patient competitor, even if city government doesn't seem to appreciate him as much as many sports fans do.
“Our goal is to bring an NBA team back to Seattle,” Hansen told KING 5. “No one can make us sell our land or do anything different. We're gonna sit here, patient, as long as it takes.”
The driving force for swift approval of Oak View's plan was former Mayor Ed Murray, who said he was eager for a legacy building that would make him “the first openly gay mayor to bring sports to his city.” No one has yet explained what those aspirations had to do with good public policy, but Murray's timetable was rendered moot when The Seattle Times reported three allegations he sexually abused minors more than 30 years ago. When another accuser came forward in May, Murray ended his reelection bid but insisted he would serve out his first term through December 31. When a fifth person, a family member, came forward with allegations, Murray resigned on September 12.
Murray's career collapse has not slowed the project, which is now in the hands of the council, as is the decision on whether to grant Hansen a hearing on his revised SoDo proposal. Following two interim mayors, either Jenny Durkan or Cary Moon will succeed Murray when the November 7 election is certified on November 28. Surratt and others on city staff are eager to have the council vote in the first week of December.
Neither mayoral candidate has said much during the campaign about the arena when more pressing matters are at hand. But even if neither has a dog in the arena hunt, if something goes haywire in the Oak View proposal, the new mayor will be thrust into the fray at the back end, which is never the place to be in a controversy.
As the council studies a report from independent consultants hired to vet the Oak View deal, there is nothing pressing the arena agenda other than the proposed opening date for the NHL season of October 2020. At this point, a question worth pondering is whether 2021 is a better aspiration if it results in better decisions in 2017, which would be aided by another hearing for the SoDo project.
Deborah Frausto is a leading member of the community group Uptown Alliance, which represents the neighborhood likely to be most affected by a large uptick in KeyArena activity. She agreed to be a member of the Arena Community Advisory Panel, which heard from Oak View and the city on their plans for surface-street mobility that was the highest priority issue for the neighborhood. Frausto was supportive of the process, but apprehensive about the pace.
“We can't sacrifice due diligence for [NHL] scheduling,” she says.
For a Civic Cocktail TV program broadcast on the Seattle Channel in September, Hansen was asked if he would sue the city if denied an opportunity to present to the council his case for SoDo again. He said he would not.
“I want what's best for Seattle,” Hansen said. “If Seattle goes through this process and they decide what to do, that's just the way the cookie crumbles. The chance of us suing the city is zero.”
Lawyers for the city might be disinclined to take him at his word. But it wouldn't have to come to that if the City Council can resist the gravitational pull of the fast fix for a slower deliberation, one that includes considering the SoDo option that's committed to the NBA and to repurposing the dowager queen for music and arts.
Besides, what would Leiweke do? Sue?

Police are hunting a man who punched a woman twice in the face during an unprovoked attack at a Tube station.
The woman was approached at Covent Garden and struck twice by the man for no reason, causing her to topple over and smash her head, police say.
She managed to get to her feet but the man attacked her again, according to detectives.
The woman needed hospital treatment after the blows left her with a broken nose alongside a cut to her head.
Police have now released CCTV images of a man they want to trace following the assault, which happened at around 12.50am on New Year's Day.
Investigating officer, Detective Constable Stephen Allen, from British Transport Police, said: “This was a nasty, unprovoked attack against a woman at a tube station.
“The offender arrived by train before the assault and then left by train afterwards.”
Anyone with information should call Det Con Allen on 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016, quoting reference 357 3/2/17.
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh took to airwaves Wednesday to blast President Barack Obama for thanking Native Americans for their part in Thanksgiving.
In a Thanksgiving day proclamation on the White House website, Obama declared, “This Thanksgiving Day, we reflect on the compassion and contributions of Native Americans, whose skill in agriculture helped the early colonists survive, and whose rich culture continues to add to our Nation's heritage.”
“…at their casinos and on their reservations,” Limbaugh added as he read the president's words.
“This spirit brought together the newly arrived Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe — who had been living and thriving around Plymouth, Massachusetts for thousands of years — in an autumn harvest feast centuries ago,” Obama's proclamation also said.
“So, we were the invaders,” complained Limbaugh. “We were incompetent idiots. We didn't know how to feed ourselves so they came along and showed us how and that's what Thanksgiving is all about.”
“This has got to be parody,” Limbaugh said. “Somebody is toying with me. Somebody is seeing if they can get one past me. Somebody is trying to take advantage of me being not as focused on the day before Thanksgiving and falling for this prank.”
“He says nothing about the Constitution in his Thanksgiving Day proclamation because he's got a problem with it,” Limbaugh claimed.
“Every cliche that is wrong about Thanksgiving shows up in his proclamation: The Pilgrims showed up at Plymouth. The Indians have been their for thousands of years. We get off the boats. We don't know how to feed ourselves. The Indians show us how,” he explained.
“Is it possible [Obama] believes it,” Limbaugh wondered. “I don't doubt that he believes it.”
“Obama believes this nation is fatally flawed since its founding, even before its founding.”
Then Limbaugh took credit for exposing the truth about Thanksgiving to the world. “I know that a lot of people did not hear the true story of Thanksgiving until I wrote it in my book in the early 90s,” he said.
The conservative radio host then welcomed a caller, David, who thanked Limbaugh for the historical perspective that he provides.
But the caller offered a slight correction to Limbaugh's attack on the president. “You may be reading too much into it to say that Obama is perpetuating the entire myth,” he said. “I wouldn't put it past him.”
“No!” Limbaugh exclaimed. “[Obama] said that Thanksgiving is about the Indians saving us… The true story of Thanksgiving is how socialism failed. Of course we showed them gratitude. We shared our bounty with them. Not because we didn't know how to make it. It's because we first failed as socialists. Only when we turned capitalists did we have plenty. The Indians didn't teach us capitalism.”
“We do illustrate absurdity by being absurd here and those that forget that quickly can lose their minds,” Limbaugh concluded.
Obama isn't the first president to thank Native Americans in Thanksgiving Day proclamations.
President Ronald Reagan's Thanksgiving proclamation noted that the Native Americans taught the Pilgrims “so much.”
On this day of thanksgiving, it is appropriate that we recall the first Thanksgiving, celebrated in the autumn of 1621. After surviving a bitter winter, the Pilgrims planted and harvested a bountiful crop. After the harvest they gathered their families together and joined in celebration and prayer with the Native Americans who had taught them so much. Clearly our forefathers were thankful not only for the material well-being of their harvest but for this abundance of goodwill as well.
In 2000, President Bill Clinton also mentioned Native Americans in his proclamation.
“Sharing in God's blessings is at the heart of Thanksgiving and at the core of the American spirit. At Plymouth in 1621, the Pilgrims celebrated their first harvest in the New World thanks to the generosity of their Native American neighbors,” Clinton declared.
This audio is from The Rush Limbaugh Show, broadcast Nov. 24, 2010. The clip was first caught by Mediaite.
Three protesters were arrested during Bernie Sanders' rally in Oakland, California today. They jumped the barricade, shouting something unintelligible, and were quickly arrested by Secret Service as the crowd booed. Then the crowd quickly changed its tuned and began chanting “Bernie! Bernie!”
You can watch the video of what happened below:
According to NBC News, the protesters were animal rights activists. This has some supporters confused, since Bernie Sanders is a strong supporter of animal rights and family farms instead of factory farms.
USSS covers @BernieSanders at Oakland event after animal rights protesters jump barricade-Protesters are apprehended pic.twitter.com/rwYloVMN0Q — Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) May 31, 2016
In fact, this press release from Direct Action Everywhere talks about dozens of animal rights activists rushing Sanders' stage and yelling “Animal Liberation Now!” On the video, you only see three or four before they are arrested.
Sanders didn't seem intimidated at all by the protesters. As a Secret Service agent rushed to the platform, Sanders didn't even flinch. He was very calm about the entire incident and even seemed reluctant to stop addressing the crowd at first:
After they were arrested, Sanders told the crowd, “We don't get intimidated easily.” And someone yelled back, “We love you Bernie!”
Sanders has a strong record with animal rights, receiving a 100 percent rating from the Humane Society Legislative Fund. This has caused his supporters to wonder why, out of all the candidates, the animal rights activists would choose to protest at one of his rallies.
Direct Action Everywhere has members who support Sanders, but protests at some of his rallies in hopes of bringing attention to different aspects of legislation. According to the press release from Direct Action Everywhere, they were protesting Sanders' support of “good farms,” because they believe that no farms are “good” for animals. Matt Johnson, a member of Direct Action Everywhere, said that he would ultimately push for a Species Equality Act that would end the commodity status of animals, and “transition away from animals as property, food, clothing, and entertainment,” according to a publication called Munchies.
Mhris Carco, who is the founder of SF Vegans, told Heavy that she didn't agree with Direct Action Everywhere's methods and was concerned about any media coverage given to the group.
“I run a local vegan group with about 1800 members and I have been both a vocal critic of Direct Action Everywhere and one of their many victims of harassment…,” she wrote. “Direct Action Everywhere is abusive and destructive, both to individuals and the larger vegan/animal rights community.”
On a SF Vegans Facebook page about Direct Action Everywhere's protests at Sanders' rally, other vegans voiced concern that the group was embarrassing them. They said they would have preferred if they handed out pamphlets about their beliefs to the rally attendees, rather than jumping barricades and getting arrested.
Bernie Sanders has a strong history of supporting animal welfare. Sanders has called for improving the rural economy and supports family farms instead of factory farms.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will offer support and assistance for Myanmar's follow-up efforts after a military plane crashed off the Southeast Asian country's southern coast with 122 people on board, state media said.
China, as a friendly neighbor, shares Myanmar's sorrow over the incident, President Xi Jinping told his counterpart U Htin Kyaw in a condolence message, state news agency Xinhua said late on Friday.
“Xi mourned the dead and extended sincere sympathy to the government and people of Myanmar, especially the families of the victims,” the agency added.
The aircraft, a Chinese-made Y-8-200F transport plane, lost contact 29 minutes after takeoff on Wednesday, while at a height of 18,000 feet (5,485 meters), about 43 miles (70 km) west of the coastal town of Dawei, the Myanmar military has said.
Soldiers, family members and crew were on board the weekly flight from several coastal towns to Myanmar's biggest city of Yangon when it went missing.
Search teams have found one more body, taking to 32 the tally of those pulled from the sea, the military said in a statement on Saturday, adding that high waves and stormy weather continue to hinder recovery efforts.

US woman accused of plotting to murder unnamed Swede and raising money for her cause on the internet
An American woman who called herself Jihad Jane has been charged over an alleged plot to murder a Swedish man.
Colleen Renee LaRose, 46, from Philadelphia, is also accused of conspiracy to provide support to terrorists, making false statements and attempted identity theft.
Irish police yesterday arrested seven people over an apparent plot to kill Lars Vilks, a Swedish cartoonist who had a bounty put on his head after depicting the prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog – though Vilks has not been named as LaRose's alleged target.
Garda sources said the four men and three women were in their mid-20s to late-40s. Some of them arrested hold Irish citizenship and some are from the Middle East. Converts to Islam were among them, the Irish police said.
Vilks's cartoon, drawn in 2007, prompted al-Qaida to place a $100,000 (£67,000) bounty on his head and offer a 50% bonus to anyone who slit his throat to ensure he was "slaughtered like a lamb".
At least three Swedish newspapers – Dagens Nyheter, Expressen and Sydsvenska Dagbladet – published the cartoon today.
The US justice department declined to comment on whether the two cases were connected.
David Kris, the head of the department's national security division, said: "The indictment, which alleges that a woman from suburban America agreed to carry out murder overseas and to provide material support to terrorists, underscores the evolving nature of the threat we face."
LaRose, who also called herself Fatima LaRose online, allegedly posted a comment on YouTube in June 2008 saying she wanted to help "the suffering Muslim people".
According to the indictment filed in a federal court in Pennsylvania she sent emails to unnamed co-conspirators offering to become a martyr as well as to use her American background to avoid detection.
The indictment accuses LaRose of agreeing in March 2009 to marry a co-conspirator from a south Asian country who was trying to obtain residency in Europe. He is alleged to have urged her to go to Sweden, find the unnamed Swedish man "and kill him". The indictment claims she tried to raise money over the internet, lure others to her cause and lied to FBI investigators.
LaRose was arrested after returning to the US in October 2009 on a charge related to the theft of a US passport, according to court documents.
If convicted on the four counts in the indictment, which was dated 4 March 2010, LaRose could face a sentence of life in prison and a fine of $1m (£670,000).
Michael Levy, the US attorney in Pennsylvania, said the case showed that terrorists were looking for Americans to join their cause. "It shatters any lingering thought that we can spot a terrorist based on appearance."
The Obama administration has grown increasingly worried about Americans and foreigners living in the US taking up the cause of anti-American militants.
Two recent cases have fuelled those concerns: the arrest of a Chicago man accused of helping plot the 2008 Mumbai attacks and an Afghan immigrant living in Colorado who pleaded guilty to plotting a bomb attack on the New York subway system.
Following the news that the next Bourne movie was moved from an August 14, 2015 release to July 15, 2016 comes word from Universal that the August 14 date will instead go to Straight Outta Compton, the movie about N.W.A.
In the mid-1980s, the streets of Compton, California, were some of the most dangerous in the country. When five young men translated their experiences growing up into brutally honest music that rebelled against abusive authority, they gave an explosive voice to a silenced generation. Following the meteoric rise and fall of N.W.A., Straight Outta Compton tells the astonishing story of how these youngsters revolutionized music and pop culture forever the moment they told the world the truth about life in the hood and ignited a cultural war.
Starring OShea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell as Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E, Straight Outta Compton is directed by F. Gary Gray (Friday, Set It Off, The Italian Job). The drama is produced by original N.W.A. members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, who are joined by fellow producers Matt Alvarez and Tomica Woods-Wright. Will Packer serves as executive producer of the film alongside Gray.

HOW TO ADMIN: SCENARIO ONE
One should never drive over another person
HOW TO ADMIN: SCENARIO TWO
Admin disrespect.
Oh boy, you have encountered your first troublemaker.Your friend, '1337m43str0' was just run over by a car, and he was running on the roads. You have teleported the perpetrator, and you have him on a roof of a building. What do you do?First of, make sure you disagree with everything he says. No exceptions!Don't believe me when I say it works? Don't trust me, trust the FBI. Constant disagreeing is an old FBI trick, that will disorient the criminal and makes their speech slurred and confused, and you can tell if they're lying or telling the truth!, and there are no excuses! You can clearly see this in your MOTD.Maybe he is admitting to have driven a little too fast. and maybe he claims that your friend was walking on the road, which resulted in his demise. This is against the in-game laws and would result in a jail time, if he was caught by the police.There is no other option than tosince manslaughter is a crime.Another example could be this: You spawned in a lot of cash, and maybe a few weapons, and you are defending your own base against attacking raiders. Well, that's okay, that's part of the game, right?So when the 2 raiders breach your front door, you immediately shoot them both with your volatile ray gun. They both fall dead in an instant, and 3 other surrounding civilians.They then have the audacity to accuse you of admin abusing.people are just constantly criticizing you! Freeze them, gag them, and teleport them to the top of your favourite building (as before), and explain them their rights in this situation.You didn't admin abuse, because you bought admin for 10 dollars a month, money which you aquired from your mothers credit card, and you are therefore allowed to spawn weapons. If you didn't gag them and they start to threaten you with reporting you on the server forums.You do remember those forums right? That's where you went when you applied for admin.Always remember, however - whenever anybody raises their voice when speaking with you, or say anything to you that will make you sad, there is one golden rule for you.One rule which you should always remember.Instantly ban one of these people, because a banned person cannot threaten you.We don't negotiate with terrorists
Authorities in Iceland have revoked a 400-year-old law that allowed citizens to kill Basques on sight.
For the past four centuries, people in Iceland have been permitted to kill anyone from the Basque region of northern Spain and southern France should they step foot on the North Atlantic island.
However, last week authorities decided it was finally time to abolish a law that resulted in the killing of 32 Basque whalers 400 years ago.
Back in the summer of 1615, three Basque whaling ships entered an Icelandic fjord after coming to an agreement with Icelanders; however, on their departure they were shipwrecked in a gale. The West Fjords commissioner at the time, Ari Magnusson of Ogur, then demanded that the survivors were hunted down and killed after stories they had become entangled in a bitter dispute with locals.
In October that year, 32 Basque whalers were killed by Icelanders in what remains the only recorded mass murder in the country.
But on 22 April this year, the West Fjords district commissioner Jonas Gudmundsson officially revoked the law at a special event to commemorate the ‘Slaying of the Spaniards', joking that it was now safe for people from the Basque region to travel to Iceland. He explained that repealing the order was mainly for “fun” because it had obviously not been carried out for many years.
Among the attendees at the event were the Icelandic Minister of Education and Culture Illugi Gunnarsson and the Basque Gipuzkoa Governor Martin Garitanoand.
Meanwhile, Basques in Spain praised Iceland for the move, with MP Jon Inarritu from the Basque pro-independence party Amaiur saying the ceremony marked a public homage to those that were killed all those years ago.
TRENTON -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took a softer stance immigration during a television interview Friday, saying he believes in a "merit system" for undocumented immigrants already living in the U.S.
Trump also said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that the Republican party is now treating him "nice" after his recent comments that the GOP has jilted him, leading him to more strongly consider running as a third-party candidate.
And the outspoken real estate mogul suggested it's possible his sudden rise in the crowded Republican race could end for a simple reason: People might "get tired" of him.
Trump spoke via phone a day after he visited Laredo, Texas, to tour the U.S.-Mexico border -- a trip that grabbed headlines because of controversial comments he made earlier in the race saying that "rapists" and "killers" were entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico.
During Friday's interview, Trump said the U.S. should take a two-step approach to the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the country.
RELATED: Trump says he may run for president as third-party candidate
"Well, the first thing we do is take the bad ones -- of which there are, unfortunately, quite a few," said Trump, who owns three New Jersey golf courses and once owned three Atlantic City casinos. "We take the bad ones and get 'em the hell out. We get 'em out."
But he said the country should take a different approach with "the other ones" -- i.e., undocumented immigrants who have "done a good job" since arriving in the U.S.
"I'm a very big believer in the merit system," Trump said. "I have to tell you: Some of these people have been here, they've done a good job. You know, in some cases, sadly, they've been living under the shadows. ... If somebody's been outstanding, we try and work something out.
"But before we do anything, we have to secure the border because the border is like having no border," he added.
Trump has led his 15 Republican presidential rivals in many recent polls, but he has faced criticism from some opponents for running a confrontational campaign not worthy of the White House. The Republican National Committee also criticized him in the wake of comments he made mocking U.S. Sen. John McCain's war record.
The businessman told The Hill, a Washington newspaper, that he would be more likely to run as a third-party contender if the party didn't treat him better -- a move that experts say could siphon off Republican voters and severely hurt the GOP's chances of regaining the presidency.
But Trump said Friday that the RNC has been "very, very nice" over the last few days.
"They see what's happening," he said. "They've reached out, they have talked to me, they have talked to my people.
Trump stressed once again that he is a "conservative" and wants to run as a Republican.
"The best way to win is to win as a Republican," he said. "I do not want to do independent at all. If I'm treated well and with great respect and don't win, I would not do that."
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a fellow GOP presidential candidate who has been sharply critical of Trump's campaign, said he does not expect Trump to win the party's nod.
"Donald Trump's not going to be the nominee of the Republican party," Rubio said during an interview with CBS News. ""These polls, at this point, basically are measuring who people are hearing about on the news, and Donald Trump is benefiting from that."
Asked on "Morning Joe" what would prevent him from becoming the nominee, Trump said: "I don't know. You know, I'm just chugging along. I mean, maybe people will get tired of me -- who knows?"
"I mean, this press is crazy," he continued. "When they interview other candidates, they only ask([them) Trump questions, so I don't know -- maybe people get burned out. I don't know what could happen."
Still, Trump did complain that "Morning Joe" is not covering him enough.
"Well, I'm leading in all of the polls by a lot," he said. "But I was listening to you talking about (Jeb) Bush and Rubio and a couple of others, and you sort of forgot to mention my name, even though I'm creaming them in the polls."
"Donald, what are you talking about?" Scarborough said. "How thin is your skin? I've been talking about you for a week."
"You aren't really that thin-skinned, are you?" the host asked.
"Yes, I am thin-skinned!" Trump insisted.

The high-calorie burrito chain Chipotle likes to pretend to be something it isn't to consumers. Chipotle pretends to be all about local food when in fact it ships in beef from Australia and pork from the UK. Chipotle pretends to be anti-GMO but has no problem with GMOs being used to sweeten its soda or fed to animals used for food. Chipotle pretends to be “humane” but bans farmers from giving their livestock antibiotics as a means of preventing illness.
Now, Chipotle has launched a PR campaign called “Friend or Faux?,” implying that other restaurants that use safe but hard-to-pronounce ingredients are worse than the holier-than-thou Chipotle. Keep in mind Chipotle uses some of these hard-to-pronounce ingredients, such as propionic acid and benzoic acid, so clearly the chain doesn't honestly think they're bad. In fact, Chipotle says of the latter on its website, “Benzoic Acid is used to preserve the freshness of tortillas by inhibiting the growth of mold, yeast, and some bacteria,” and separately the FDA considers this preservative Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS).
Sounds great to us! So what's the problem?
What's going on is that Chipotle is taking advantage of Americans' discomfort with eating “chemicals.” Never mind that everything from dihydrogen monoxide (water) to ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has a chemical name and formula. Chipotle is just trying to find a new way to make a 1,500-calorie burrito seem healthier. Facts be damned.
Thanks to the USDA's nutrient database and FlavorNet, we have an idea of just what kinds of chemicals are loaded into Chipotle burritos. It's a lot. And we can't pronounce most of them. But if Chipotle wants to open that door, then we're happy to tell people that Chipotle's burritos are full of chemicals. (Click to enlarge.)
Archbishop Tutu suggests using violence to remove Mugabe Agence France-Presse
Published: Wednesday December 24, 2008
Print This Email This Nobel Peace Prize laureate says he's 'ashamed' of South Africa for not acting
LONDON (AFP)  Archbishop Desmond Tutu launched a stinging attack on South Africa Wednesday, accusing it of failing to stand up to Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and betraying its apartheid legacy.
Tutu, the retired archbishop of Cape Town, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and anti-apartheid campaigner, told BBC radio he was "ashamed" of his homeland.
He suggested that South Africa had surrendered the "moral high ground" which it gained in the post-apartheid era.
Tutu also told BBC radio that violence could be used to remove Mugabe, who should then be indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
His comments came amid rising international pressure for Mugabe to quit and an outbreak of cholera which has killed over 1,000 people, according to UNICEF.
The top US envoy for Africa Jendayi Frazer said at the weekend that it had lost confidence in the power-sharing pact between Mugabe and the opposition, remarks dismissed as "stupid" by Mugabe.
"I certainly am ashamed of what they've done (South Africa) in the United Nations," Tutu said.
"For the world to say no, we're waiting for South Africa's membership of the security council to lapse and then we can take action, that is an awful indictment of a country that has had this proud record of a struggle against a vicious system in the way that we did, that we should have been the one who for a very long time occupied the moral high ground.
"I'm afraid we have betrayed our legacy... I mean, how much more suffering is going to make us say no, we have given Mr Mugabe enough time?"
South Africa is due to leave the UN Security Council within days after two years in a non-permanent seat and commentators say this could remove one major obstacle to UN action against Mugabe.
Tutu raised the prospect of using violence to remove Mugabe.
"If Mr Mugabe remains obdurate and as intransigent as he has been about the formation of this government of unity, then he must be asked to step down," he said.
"If he refuses, I really do believe that we have to invoke this new doctrine of responsibility to protect".
Asked whether that meant using force to remove Mugabe, Tutu said: "Yes, yes, or certainly the threat of it".
"He needs to be warned and his cronies must be warned that the world is not just going to sit by and do nothing, it's going to try and remove them and in addition he is going to be charged before the ICC," he added.
Tutu said he hoped "against hope" that the African Union would take action, adding that some parties "can be shamed into taking a more firm stance", including South Africa.
Shyam (10) is unable to walk properly after four years of sitting at just one place 22 hours a day. Lucky (10), could not open his eyes when he saw the sunlight first time in four years. They were beaten with hammers for reasons such as cooking extra rice, dozing off at work and even trying to go to the washroom during work.
Their job was to cut threads of jeans and pack it. The task was to pack 10 pieces in 10 minutes and the one who finished last used to be beaten with a hammer by the employer. The tale of extreme torture was disclosed by the 26 boys, in the age group of 8 to 13, who were rescued from a jeans factory in northeast Delhi's Seelampur area last month.
“We were allowed to sleep at 5 am and the employer used to wake us up at 7 am. In between work, if we fell asleep, he used to wake us up by hitting us with a hammer. For four years, we were having two meals in a day - potato and rice. The menu never changed and we were not allowed to go out of the room even for a second,” said Raheem, a 7-year-old boy, who was brought in to the factory six months ago.
Shyam, who has seen at least five new boys coming every month, could not move on his own when he was rescued. “He had to be lifted. Now, we are giving him physiotherapy and he has started moving his feet. Almost every boy has injury marks on their body and has vitamin deficiency. We have never seen this kind of torture in our life,” said a member of Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO run by Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi. The NGO runs a children home ‘Mukti Ashram' in north Delhi's Burari, where these boys are staying and getting treatment so that they can lead a normal life.
“We were kept in a small room and I have not seen the sunlight in four years. When, I was rescued, I could not open my eyes as I was not used to it. We were not allowed to take bath or go to washroom since every day we used to pack 5,000 pieces of jeans,” said Lucky.
All boys are from Motihari district of Bihar and were brought to Delhi around six months ago. Six of them are from the same village, indicating that they could have been victims of child trafficking.
“I am furious. Twenty six child slaves were rescued and most of them have not even seen daylight in four years. I recall a similar case from 1983 when all 27 children we freed from the carpet industry in Mirzapur were beaten, branded, hanged upside down on trees,” said Satyarthi.
He said there is little change even after three decades. Each child rescued from Seelampur has faced the worst form of slavery. Their hands are scarred, they carry burn marks all over their bodies and their arms have signs of torture.
“Are children not safe anywhere, not even in the capital of the country? Slavery is not a myth. Child abuse and violence against children are all harsh realities surrounding us. We have to wake up to this bitter truth. I strongly demand fast track courts, child friendly court procedures and time bound trials so that our children and their childhoods do not have to wait,” said Satyarthi.
The case began to unravel after six children roaming at Anand Vihar railway station were noticed by NGO Childline on February 3. The children said that they had fled from the factory and wanted to go back to their hometown. They also told the NGO that there are many other children trapped in the factory.
The matter was brought to the notice of the Child Welfare Committee which asked police and NGO to conduct a raid at the location described by the children.
A joint team conducted the raid in Seelampur and 20 more children were rescued on the same day. The children were confined in one room and were living in pathetic conditions. Police also arrested the owner of the jeans factory.
According to a global survey report, India has the largest population of modern slaves in the world, with more than 18 million people trapped as bonded labourers, forced beggars, sex workers and child soldiers. The Global Slavery Index by human rights organisation Walk Free Foundation said the number was 1.4% of India's population.

Or maybe not so much. When the state told the Court about its “humane” procedures, it didn't even know what three drugs it had on hand. Shortly before Glossip's scheduled execution, in fact, Fallin learned that an autopsy showed Oklahoma had already used the wrong drug to execute another condemned inmate, Charles Warner, in January. Warner was originally a petitioner in Glossip's case. The Supreme Court denied him a stay, then accepted the case after Warner had been killed.
Justice Stephen Breyer, in a separate opinion for himself and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, announced in Glossip that, in his view, the death penalty could no longer be administered fairly, and thus was unconstitutional. That didn't sit well with Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote in a separate opinion that Breyer's “argument is full of internal contradictions and (it must be said) gobbledy-gook.”
A week after Fallin's revelation, the Court heard the first of the four death-penalty cases it has granted this term. The hard feelings in Glossip have apparently not healed.
Kansas v. Gleason and Kansas v. Carr challenge Kansas trial judges' instructions to two juries mulling death sentences for murderers. Under existing precedent, the jury is supposed to consider a statutory set of “aggravating factors,” which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant may ask the jury to consider “mitigating factors” (such as a defendant's limited mental capacity or history of mental illness, a past history of abuse, or anything else—including the desirability of mercy—that his lawyers can think of). Unlike the prosecution, the defendant doesn't have to prove that these factors exist “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and the jurors don't have to find them unanimously.
Many states, and the federal government, explain these different burdens to the jury; but the courts in Gleason and Carr did not. Since those decisions, Kansas has changed the “pattern instructions” used by its judges; the Kansas Supreme Court ordered the two courts to go back and resentence the defendants using these instructions, because, it said, the instructions used might convince jurors that the defendant also had a “reasonable doubt” burden.
Soon after argument began in Kansas v. Gleason on October 7, Scalia used his best tell-frogface-to-pass-the-salt voice to ask Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt whether “Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think the death penalty is unconstitutional and indeed very much favor it.” For that reason, he suggested (“I'm just speculating of course”) that the Kansas Supreme Court had actually lied by claiming that that the Eighth Amendment, rather than their own squishy liberal prejudices, required granting the defendants a new sentencing. Alito seemed to agree: “[P]resumably, the Kansas Supreme Court understood that it had the capability of basing its decision on Kansas law. But if it did that, it would have to take responsibility for the decisions in these cases, which involve some of the most horrendous murders that I have seen in my 10 years here.” The Kansas court, however, “didn't take responsibility for that. It said ‘it's the Eighth Amendment, and we have to apply the federal Constitution.'”

AKP MP prepares legislative motion to label German killings of Nama people ‘genocide'
ANKARA – Anadolu Agency
AA photo
AKP Istanbul deputy Metin Külünk noted that the population of Nama people in Africa decreased during clashes with Germans in the early 1900's in Namibia, vowing that he would propose parliament approve of the killings as “genocide.”
“Germans led three out of four of the population to perish and the withdrawal of those who left behind to their current living spaces during the struggle against exploitation efforts of the region in the early 1900's. Therefore, Nama people and Herero people here were sacrificed to the exploitation mentality of the Germans. With the bill I will submit to the Grand National Assembly [TBMM], I will propose the German genocide of Herero and Nama [people] in Namibia to be described as ‘genocide,'” Külünk said.
He also said that global powers wanted to take over Turkey and used the Armenian issue as a tool in this cause.
Külünk also claimed that Europe was the homeland of genocide.
“If historians want to learn how genocide is done, they will look at Norway, Germany and England. They will look at what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 90's. When they look, they will see the culture of genocide was born, grown up and realized in Europe. Because it is at the center of the European culture to liken humanity to itself, not to accept as it is,” Külünk said.
A deputy from the ruling Justice and the Development (AKP) has prepared a legislative proposal over the German killings of locals in Namibia in the early 1900's to be described as “genocide,” following the German parliament's approval of a resolution that described the 1915-16 killings of Armenians by Ottoman forces as “genocide.”

Perry James' home is flooded with ash and mud in Harriman Tenn., where a 40-foot retention pond broke early Monday morning. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 2.6 million cubic yards of slurry flowed out of the pond.

Flood of sludge breaks TVA dike
HARRIMAN, Tenn. — Millions of yards of ashy sludge broke through a dike at TVA's Kingston coal-fired plant Monday, covering hundreds of acres, knocking one home off its foundation and putting environmentalists on edge about toxic chemicals that may be seeping into the ground and flowing downriver.
One neighboring family said the disaster was no surprise because they have watched the 1960s-era ash pond's mini-blowouts off and on for years.
About 2.6 million cubic yards of slurry — enough to fill 798 Olympic-size swimming pools — rolled out of the pond Monday, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleanup will take at least several weeks, or, in a worst-case scenario, years.
The ash slide, which began just before 1 a.m., covered as many as 400 acres as deep as 6 feet. The wave of ash and mud toppled power lines, covered Swan Pond Road and ruptured a gas line. It damaged 12 homes, and one person had to be rescued, though no one was seriously hurt.
Much remains to be determined, including why this happened, said Tom Kilgore, president and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
"I fully suspect that the amount of rain we've had in the last eight to 10 days, plus the freezing weather … might have had something to do with this," he said in a news conference Monday on the site.
The area received almost 5 inches of rain this month, compared with the usual 2.8 inches. Freeze and thaw cycles may have undermined the sides of the pond. The last formal report on the condition of the 40-acre pond — an unlined, earthen structure — was issued in January and was unavailable Monday, officials said.
Neighbors Don and Jil Smith, who have lived near the pond for eight years, said that nearly every year TVA has cleaned up what they termed "baby blowouts."
Ashen liquid similar to that seen on a much larger scale in Monday's disaster came from the dike, they said.
"It would start gushing this gray ooze," said Don Smith, whose home escaped harm. "They'd work on it for weeks and weeks.
"They can say this is a one-time thing, but I don't think people are going to believe them."
The U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation were among agencies that responded to the emergency.
Toxic irritants possible
Coal is burned to produce electricity at the Kingston Fossil Plant, notable for its tall towers seen along Interstate 40 near the Harriman exit in Roane County.
Water is added to the ash, which is the consistency of face powder, for pumping it to the pond. The ash is settled out in that pond before the sludge is moved to other, drier ponds, Kilgore said.
Coal ash can carry toxic substances that include mercury, arsenic and lead, according to a federal study. The amount of poisons in TVA's ashy wastes that could irritate skin, trigger allergies and even cause cancer or neurological problems could not be determined Monday, officials said.
Viewed from above, the scene looked like the aftermath of a tsunami, with swirls of dirtied water stretching for hundreds of acres on the land, and muddied water in the Emory River.
The Emory leads to the Clinch, which flows into the Tennessee.
Workers sampled river water Monday, with results expected back today, but didn't sample the dunelike drifts of muddy ash.
That could begin today, officials said, and the potential magnitude of the problem could make this a federally declared Superfund site. That would mean close monitoring and a deep, costly cleanup requiring years of work.
"We'll be sampling for metals in the ground to see what kind of impact that had," said Laura Niles, a spokeswoman for the EPA in Atlanta.
"Hopefully, it won't be as bad as creating a Superfund site, but it depends on what is found."
Stephen Smith, with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy in Knoxville, said those concerned about water and air quality have tried for years to press for tighter regulation of the ash.
The heavy metals in coal — including mercury and other toxic substances — concentrate in the ash when burned, he said.
"You know where that is now," he said. "It's in that stuff that's all over those people's houses now."
Chemicals and metals from coal ash have contaminated drinking water in several states, made people and animals sick in New Mexico, and tainted fish in Texas and elsewhere, according to Lisa Evans, an attorney with Earthjustice, a nonprofit national environmental law firm that follows the issue.
"It's discouraging because this is an easy problem to fix," she said.
Ash could be recycled by using it to make concrete and at the very least should be placed in lined, state-of-the-art landfills, she said.
Plant is still operating
TVA's Kilgore said that chemicals in the ash are of concern, but that the situation is probably safe. The power plant is still operating, sending the ash to a larger pond on the site.
"There are levels of chemicals in there that we are concerned about," Kilgore said. "We don't think there's anything immediate of danger because most of that's contained, but that's why we have sampling folks out."
Officials were monitoring a water intake that serves Kingston City and is only a few miles downstream from the Kingston plant, but said no problem had been noted there as of Monday afternoon.
The power producer, which oversees the Tennessee River system, had slowed river flow in the area, releasing less water from key dams, so the pollution might be better contained for possible cleanup.
TVA has insurance for an event like this, spokeswoman Barbara Martucci said, but what the cleanup cost is and how much insurance will pay remains to be determined.
Otherwise, ratepayers in Tennessee could bear much of the costs. TVA provides virtually all the electricity in the state, along with parts of six others.
Officials test TVA sludge
HARRIMAN, Tenn. — Neighbors overlooking hundreds of acres of potentially toxic sludge from TVA's ruptured coal ash pond are waiting for everything — to trust the water, to clean up the muck, to simply restart their lives.
Scores of onlookers and residents crept up to the edge of the 250- to 400-acre spill Tuesday, curious but worried about risks while officials continued sludge and water testing.
"It doesn't look healthy to me," said local fisherman Jody Miles, examining a thin layer clouding the top of his favorite fishing spot on the Clinch River.
"Do you reckon they can bring all this life back that's going to die from all this mess?"
In the wee hours of Monday, 1.82 million cubic yards of wet ash spilled out of a Tennessee Valley Authority retention pond next to its Kingston coal-fired power plant — lower than officials' original estimates but still enough to fill 558 Olympic-size swimming pools.
The spill sent sludge into the Emory River, which flows into the Clinch; damaged 12 houses in the Swan Pond community; and littered yards with dead fish. No one was seriously injured, but three houses are probably beyond repair, officials said.
TVA and other teams continued water sampling in the Emory River and the Clinch, as well as the Tennessee a little farther downstream Tuesday. Monday's testing showed water treated through normal means would be safe to drink, and concentrations of toxic metals were below state limits to protect fish.
A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staff member and an EPA contractor arrived to test the ash plastering the land for toxic metals and mercury, a neurotoxin that concentrates in coal ash.
"We're going to have people work through Christmas," TVA President and CEO Tom Kilgore said. "This is a 24-7 operation."
Swan Pond resident Chris Copeland and his family said they had not heard any message from TVA as of Tuesday evening about health concerns or disease, although Kilgore said the agency had advised residents along a replaced water line to boil their water before using it.
"It would be nice to find out something," said Deanna Copeland, Chris' wife.
Nearby, half of a hot tub was flung next to a broken tree, while a TV/VCR combination sat perfectly unscathed just yards from the wall of a damaged house.
"My wife and I were in bed asleep, and it woke me up out of a dead sleep, the sound of the crashing and limbs breaking — just a real incredible noise," said Chris Copeland. "I woke up and looked out the window, and I could see waves of water going through the cove."
The Copelands' boat dock was washed away, but they were lucky compared with neighbor Perry James. His house was almost completely destroyed, covered with mud up to the second floor as the sludge rushed into an inlet.
The sewage-like stench from the water worries Copeland, who is concerned for his wife and two daughters.
Kilgore said that weekly meetings after the holidays would keep residents informed.
He downplayed any concerns about the ash on land.
"I don't think they have a problem being in their houses," Kilgore said. "I wouldn't pick any up or wade in it."
The ash was not expected to dry out and present an airborne risk because of rain expected tomorrow and Saturday night, Kilgore said. A barrier of rocks has been placed in the river to try to contain any more ash that flows into the waterway when it rains.
Cleanup time unknown
Although many of TVA's 11 TVA fossil plants use dredge pools to settle out ash from a watery slurry, the Kingston plant is the only one with pools raised high above the ground, said TVA manager Missy Hedgecoth.
That's due to a lack of space in what has become a residential area, unlike around TVA's other coal-burning power plants in the state. The agency had its choice of moving the plant or building the ash pool higher, Hedgecoth said.
Kilgore said the agency would explore ways of separating ash, including a dry system used at five of the agency's sites.
He did not give estimates as to how much cleanup of the spill would cost, but the agency said initial cleanup could take weeks. Residents doubted that timeline, saying they expected the first signs of recovery to take months to complete.
That time could stretch much further if testing of the ash on the ground proves to have high levels of arsenic, lead, mercury and other toxic materials that coal ash is known to contain.
Clearing inlet is priority
An inlet near Swan Pond Circle Road had almost completely filled with ash by Tuesday morning, shoving boats downstream and pushing fish into residents' yards.
Clearing that inlet will be the first water project for TVA engineers, Kilgore said, along with clearing the road of mud and debris.
Monday's pond failure followed two incidents in 2003 and 2006, in which TVA officials had to repair small "blowouts" in the dike. Each resulted in spills of similarly gray, ash-laden water.
In those instances, Kilgore said, TVA reinforced the dike and had no further problems. Initial investigations indicated Monday's failure came from a different section of the dike.
Kiril Galloway, a newlywed, had just bought a house near the lake, and had hoped to continue enjoying the water where he had grown up fishing and swimming.
He looked out, describing what he used to see when he would come out to the area that now offers nothing more than large chunks of dirt, of the pond wall that failed his community.
"You'd see a lake out there, an island with several trees — nothing like it does now," Galloway said. "It's amazing all the damage that has been done here."
TVA coal disaster is toxic wake-up call
Please Tennessean, report correct facts! The Inlet you speak of is the EMORY RIVER. The Emory River is a beautiful river that is over 600 square miles of drainage area at the point of the sludge filling. From your aerial photos, one can see about half of the channel is filled with sludge. The Emory has good flow and current at this point and is actively moving the ash downstream to the Clinch R and the Tennessee River. As we speak, the material has moved into Watts Bar lake.The Emory River receives a good bit of its flow from the Obed River watershed. To put things in perspective the Obed River watershed starts at Crossville and neighbors the Caney Fork watershed that flows to the Cumberland River.TVA, USED, NOV, TDEC, EPA, DHS are a few acronyms you should look at with respect to major players in this spill. I estimate several years of clean up. main question is, where is the material going to be landfilled?????*******
According to numerous studies, coal ash contains mercury, lead, and arsenic. And nearly 800 Olympic-size swimming pools of that toxic mix is flowing into the waterways of Tennessee now. As the Knoxville News Sentinel reported Tuesday:
Viewed from above, the scene looked like the aftermath of a tsunami, with swirls of dirtied water stretching for hundreds of acres on the land, and muddied water in the Emory River.
The Emory leads to the Clinch, which flows into the Tennessee. Workers sampled river water Monday, with results expected back today, but didn't sample the dunelike drifts of muddy ash."
For the millions of people downstream in Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky, a spill estimated to be several times bigger than the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska is creeping into their waterways and aquifers.
But here's the nightmare coda: Coal ash is more toxic and radioactive than nuclear waste. According to recent studies:
... the waste produced by coal plants is actually more radioactive than that generated by their nuclear counterparts. In fact, fly ash -- a by-product from burning coal for power -- contains up to 100 times more radiation than nuclear waste.
According to some surveys, people living near coal-ash dumps have 900 times the national cancer rates.
Let's hope not only that the TVA, EPA, and appropriate government agencies deal with this spill in a swift and wise manner, but also that the new Obama administration recognizes the dangers of dirty coal and accelerates its clean energy program. source

Under Mexico 's current president Enrique Peña Nieto, the country's murder rate may have dropped, but kidnappings have soared.
Big drugs kingpins have been detained, but the splintering of cartels has in some cases only served to increase the lawlessness.
And corruption continues to plague the country, as exemplified by the disappearance of 43 students from the town of Iguala on September 26.
It is thought that they were seized by corrupt police on the orders of the mayor, and handed over to criminal gangs.
Of the 75 people arrested in connection to the Iguala abductions, 21 of them are police.
And while ministers claim the case had been handled with "boldness, absolute openness and transparency", the public does not seem to agree.
Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets holding banners proclaiming: "They were taken alive, we want them back alive."
But this single case, though tragic, is just one among countless kidnappings every day.
Across Mexico 54 people have gone missing every week since 2007, totalling 22,610 missing in eight years, as the above graphic shows.
UPDATE: On Tuesday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations and National Iranian American Council called upon Apple to change its policy and take appropriate steps to guarantee further enforcement of the policy will not impede on Iranian's rights in the United States.
The press releases: CAIR
NIAC 9to5Mac contacted Apple and the councils and will update again if they issue a comment.
An Apple Store in Georgia apparently refused to sell iOS devices to an Alpharetta woman and her uncle, because they spoke Farsi to each other.
Sahar Sabet, 19, is a United States citizen and student at the University of Georgia. She and her uncle were recently shopping for an iPad and iPhone at an Apple Store in the North Pointe Mall. They were conversing in Farsi, a Persian-Iranian language, when an employee overheard them and asked what language they were speaking.
According to WSBTV, the woman answered, but then the Apple employee said, “I just can't sell this to you. Our countries have bad relations.”
Another customer, Zack Jafarzadeh, apparently received the same treatment at a different Apple Store in the Perimeter Mall in Atlanta. He recently accompanied a friend who tried to buy an iPhone.
“We never talked about him going back to Iran or anything like that. He was just speaking full-fledged Farsi and the representative came back and denied our sale,” said Jafarzadeh to WSBTV. “I would say if you're trying to buy an iPhone, don't tell them anything about Iran. That would be your best bet.”
Sabet returned to the North Point Apple Store on Monday with WSBTV's Amy Napier Viteri, and they caught the same employee describing an Apple policy on camera that allegedly prohibits the sale of products to Iranians. A manager even presented the duo with the policy, which said the exportation, sale, or supply of Apple products from U.S. to Iran is not allowed without prior authorization by the federal government. The manager explained Apple Stores have to “rely on customers to be honest.”
Sabet and Jafarzadeh asserted that the Apple Stores in question racially profiled Iranians and discriminated against them, while noting Apple's policy is both confusing and inconsistent. Sabat even called corporate customer relations to complain. An employee apologized and suggested she purchase the iPad online.
A representative for the U.S. State Department clarified to Viteri that it is illegal to enter Iran with “laptops or satellite cellphones” without U.S. consent, but she also admitted being unfamiliar with “Apple enforcing that law.”

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian police on Tuesday arrested a presidential aide and two ex-governors as part of an investigation into the 2014 World Cup's most expensive stadium, another black eye for the country's political establishment that adds pressure on beleaguered President Michel Temer.
Tadeu Filippelli, a special adviser in Brazil's President Michel Temer's Cabinet, is pictured at his house before he was arrested, in Brasilia, Brazil, May 23, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino
Tadeu Filippelli, a special adviser in Temer's Cabinet, and former Federal District governors José Roberto Arruda and Agnelo Queiroz were taken into custody early in the day, a police communique said.
Temer's office said in a statement that it would fire Filippelli.
Reuters could not immediately reach Filippelli, Arruda and Queiroz or their representatives. The Federal District encompasses the capital Brasilia.
Renovation of the Brasilia stadium for the 2014 World Cup cost about 1.5 billion reais ($459.38 million), prosecutors and police said in a statement, and an auditing court has said the construction included rampant overbilling.
It was the second-most expensive soccer arena in the world after the reconstruction of Wembley Stadium in London, according to the local World Cup committee's documents on spending.
Temer has resisted growing calls for his resignation after the disclosure of a recorded conversation in which he appears to condone the payment of hush money to a jailed lawmaker in a separate corruption probe.
That investigation is related to a sprawling probe into bribery and kickbacks at state oil company Petrobras that helped topple former President Dilma Rousseff last year and has sent dozens of senior politicians and business to jail.
Suspicions that many of the 12 stadiums built or renovated for the 2014 World Cup were overpriced led to street protests before and during the tournament.
Executives of construction group Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] in a plea bargain deal made public last month offered evidence that builders and politicians sought to fix contracts for World Cup arenas in at least six cities.
The evidence provided by Odebrecht corroborated the testimony of three executives of rival construction conglomerate Andrade Gutierrez, prosecutors said in a statement.
Brasilia does not have any soccer team in the first division of the national league so the 72,800-seat stadium is almost never filled even when games are played there.
Last week, Paramount and CBS released “guidelines” for fan films, and a lot of questions have been asked of us at OTW, including Support and Legal, as well as in other areas online, what this really means for creative fans.
The Guidelines do indeed seem limited to fan films and even from Paramount and CBS's perspective; they don't apply to crafts, fanvids, cosplay, fan fiction, fan games, fan art, or anything else. Of course we have no idea what Paramount and CBS's plans are for the future, and historically Paramount has not always done the best job of understanding fan culture, but at this point there's no indication that Paramount or CBS would have any interest in taking action against fan creations other than fan films, even though the guidelines themselves are phrased very broadly. For a long time, Paramount and CBS have stayed away from challenging most fan activities—especially noncommercial ones like the fanworks posted on the Archive of Our Own-and we have no reason to think that would change.
We should also add that the fan film guidelines that Paramount and CBS put out are not actually expressions of law. They're not even a contract between Paramount/CBS and any fan film-makers.
The guidelines lay out “guidelines for avoiding objections,” but an objection is a very different thing from a valid legal claim. The guidelines talk about, for example, restrictions on length, title, use of clips, use of reproductions, compensation for service, fundraising, and distribution. Their language on “amateurs” doesn't even have definitions, and if it did, the question of amateur-vs-professional status is not something the courts take into consideration when doing Fair Use analysis; two of the most high profile cases involve findings of fair use by the rap act 2 Live Crew, and Google – neither of whom would ever be considered “amateurs”.
At present, US law is much more open to fan productions than Paramount and CBS would be. As Legal Staffer Heidi explained in a recent post on the FYEAHCOPYRIGHT Tumblr, the question of whether a fan film is legal will depend mostly on copyright fair use law, and fair use law takes several factors into account. These factors include whether the new work is distributed commercially, whether it transforms the meaning or purpose of the original, how much of the original it copies, and whether it substitutes in the market for the original work. No one of these factors will answer the question completely, and in fact many courts have found fair use in cases when (for example) a work was commercially distributed or even when it copied the entire original (as long as additional content was added, and transformative). So we can envision plenty of fan films—even commercial ones—that would qualify as legally permitted fair uses that would not meet Paramount and CBS's “guidelines”.
Therefore all the guidelines really signal is what Paramount and CBS would prefer from fan films—not what the law would allow. We are, of course, keeping an eye on this, but even if Paramount and/or CBS tried to extend guidelines to other kinds of fannish creativity, we would stand up for the authors and creators whose works we host, and we do not expect that we would be standing alone.
Last week, the State Council issued a new policy opinion for promoting the development of Chinese information technology and information security. In the State Council's view, “international competition over the acquisition, use, and control of information is increasingly fierce” and China faces urgent challenges. In particular, the policy opinion notes the disparity between China and developed countries in broadband infrastructure; a low degree of information sharing between the government and industry; the control of core technologies by foreigners; inadequate strategic planning for information security and weak basic network defense capabilities; and the rapid growth of mobile Internet and other new technologies.
The policy opinion has a slight “ripped from the headlines” feel, reflecting the threats that must be looming large for Chinese policymakers. There is a large section that deals with strengthening industrial control systems for nuclear facilities, aviation, oil and petrochemicals control networks, electrical systems, and transportation systems that immediately brings Stuxnet to mind. Another section focuses on securing government and other confidential information systems that could be the target of espionage exploits like Flame, or Anonymous and other political hacktivists. And the large-scale data breaches that were part of the attacks on Tianya, China Software Developer Network, and 360buy.com are covered in a section on protecting personal information and user data. There is, however, also a great deal of continuity with earlier plans for information security. The 2003 “Document 27: Opinions for Strengthening Information Security Assurance Work,” for example, also stressed the protection of critical infrastructure, and both the 2003 and 2012 opinions note the need for dynamic monitoring of the Internet as well as talent development and greater leadership and coordination.
By contrast, the United States‘ ability to move forward with its own cybersecurity policies and plans does not look particularly promising right now. On Thursday, President Obama wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal urging the Senate to pass the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. A number of Senators opposed an earlier version of the bill that empowered the Department of Homeland Security to define security standards for critical infrastructure and required power grid, gas pipelines, and water supply companies to meet a certain level of security. A new compromise version makes industry participation voluntary; best practices will be created and companies offered incentives to adopt them.
Even with the compromise, the bill's future in the Senate and in the House is uncertain (uncertain may be kind—Jessica R. Herrera-Flanigan and Paul Rosenzweig think legislation is basically dead, and Senator McCain said on Monday that the bill “has zero chance of passing in the House or ever being signed into law”). Still it would be premature, if not misguided, to tout the State Council opinion as one more piece of evidence of China's ability to get things done. For one, the opinion is a grab bag of vague policy proposals, spanning tens of different policy arenas. Some will work out, some will be dropped. Moreover, these proposals are not always internally consistent. There is, for example, a strong government hand involved, but the opinion also “advocates for industry self-regulation.”
And politics are unavoidable in China too. As Jimmy Goodrich notes, after the introduction of the 2003 opinion different parts of the Chinese bureaucracy launched competing policy initiatives and waged fierce battles over their policy turf. The 2012 opinion highlights the leadership of the national leading small group for informationization and national coordinating small group for cyber and information security, but strong leadership is needed at the top and it is a real question if any of China's top leaders are focused on cybersecurity right now given the state of the economy and the fallout from the removal of Bo Xilai. There is no doubt the United States could be doing more at home, and another year passing without any legislation to address what the President calls “one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face” does not look good. But developing smart information security policies is hard, even for China.

Two weeks ago, I watched Justin McLeod, founder of the dating app Hinge, give a talk on the future of dating. “The story of Hinge starts with Kate, my on-and-off college girlfriend,” he said, standing in front of a projector screen slide of a broken heart. The couple's college relationship was so tumultuous that Kate transferred schools to avoid him. “By the time I'd graduated from business school, I felt more together,” he said. “I reached out to her then, but she'd moved to London and a met a guy.”
That's when, in 2012, McLeod founded Hinge. Initially, the app was very similar to Tinder except that it aimed to pair users with friends of Facebook friends. In 2015, McLeod read Nancy Jo Sales's story in Vanity Fair about how Tinder had created a “dating apocalypse,” and he changed his vision for the product entirely. The article argued that Tinder and apps like it had destroyed daters' ability to commit to any one person. Sales diagnosed what McLeod believed to be a real problem in the online dating industry. “We realized lots of people were looking for a serious relationship, but most apps aren't designed for this,” McLeod said on stage.
When that dating apocalypse story went viral in 2015, I was a data scientist and engineer at OkCupid. In the two years that followed, dating companies vied to fill the niche of creating an app that would help millennials find not just hookups but relationships. Aiming to cast itself as younger and hipper than Match.com or eHarmony but less superficial than Tinder, OkCupid changed its slogan to “You're more substance than just selfie.” Hinge nixed its Tinder-like swiping interface and relaunched, calling itself “the relationship app.”
McLeod ended his talk with a picture of a message he sent to Kate eight years after the last time he'd seen her in person: “Meet me for 15 minutes, coffee?” it read. “Just to say hi/goodbye?” At the time, Kate was living in London and was planning to marry her then-boyfriend. But McLeod persuaded Kate to call off the engagement, move back to New York and marry him — which she did this past February. Kate, who was in the audience at McLeod's talk, stood up as the crowd erupted in applause.
The pair's love story is cute — it even landed a spot in the New York Times's Modern Love column. But what does it say about online dating that even the founder of a popular dating app didn't need his own product? I sat down with McLeod and talked about his relationship, how to be authentic in a dating profile and the future of Hinge. Here's our conversation, edited for length and clarity.
Washington Post: When I worked at OkCupid, I had access to an entire database of single guys, but I ended up dating my co-worker. You created a dating app but married your college sweetheart. Is there something in the back of your head that says: I could have optimized more?
Interesting. In a sense, no. I met Kate in college, and the types of people that end up going to college with you are already curated. But the other thing is, increasing people's pool size to a point is very helpful. But past that, it becomes a paradox of choice. You could probably be happy with a lot of people, but how do you focus on having a real and authentic connection with one person? You worked with someone day after day. I went to college with Kate. You got to see a different side of your boyfriend and then you fell in … well, I don't know … are you guys still dating?
Yes.
So then you fell in love or whatever. Kate and I happened to meet in the so-called real world. But there's no doubt Hinge works for a lot of people. By happenstance, I had already met my person.
But it wasn't just that I saw a different side of my boyfriend offline than I would have through a dating app. It was also that spending so much time with him made me like him more.
Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, you can certainly be with the wrong people. But there's probably a large pool of people that you can be very happy with, if you are forced to cut out the rest of your choices. Can we optimize and find that exact right person? I think you probably believe what I believe, which is that it's a fool's game. I'm not sure it's possible and even if it were, it's not necessary — it's about finding someone who's good for you and then nurturing your relationship.
Part of Hinge's re-branding involved adding profile questions that would allow users to highlight their more authentic selves. How did you decide which questions would do that?
We optimize the Hinge profile questions over time to be the ones that people are both willing to answer and those that are likely to lead to a conversation. We found that most people don't think some super-special algorithms that knows their Meyers-Briggs type and what type of ketchup they buy would be able to find their right person.
Really? People don't believe in algorithms?
Yeah, they don't. Instead, we try to bring forward as much as we can about a person. What we lack in precision, we make up for in volume: We can show you 20 people and let you figure out which ones resonate with you. So much of attraction is X factor — the particular way a person looks or the way they answered a question you thought was cute. Maybe this registers in the algorithm that runs in your brain which figures out whether you're a good mate with someone. But in terms of a computer being able to represent this accurately, I don't think we're there yet.
What does it mean to be authentic on a dating profile?
It's vulnerability. Not putting three Snapchat filtered photos and a simple tagline like: “Australian guy living in Montreal.” That's not helpful. Authenticity is allowing a little bit of that vulnerability in the way we fill out our profiles and engage with people. It's not authentic to just swipe right on someone's face. I have no idea whether you're swiping right on everyone, or if you're really thoughtful. The new Hinge interface [which replaces swiping with a system that lets users comment on photos and profile essays] adds cognitive load that forces me to think: What do I like about this person and what do I want to say about it? That's a signal to me that this person actually cares and is interested.
Speaking of swiping, a recent Hinge blog post reported that the distribution of likes on Hinge is pretty skewed, especially for heterosexual men: Only 15 percent of men receive more than half of all the likes. How do you handle that bottom tier of users who get fewer likes?
One of our key performance indicators is what percentage of our user base gets into a full conversation, not how many conversations happen per user on average. Our algorithm is designed to spread the love around as much as possible, without overexposing super-hot people. Ultimately, some users are going to get liked by every person that sees them and others by not as many … but by a few. And so we match those people up as best we can. We actually found in a previous study that this is actually a worse story for women, because men have more homogeneous taste than women do. Most men agree on what's a hot girl and what's not, whereas women don't.
On that note: Do you think it's better to be a man or a woman on a dating app?
It depends on which app and what your purpose is. It's great to be a guy looking for hookups on Bumble, because you don't have to do anything except swipe right on everyone. Women have to do the work to show they're interested, which sounds like a great role for guys. I think it's pretty good to be a woman on Hinge, because you have a much better filtering mechanism to figure out who liked your profile photo versus who was thoughtful enough to engage with one of the prompts you answered. That helps you figure out where you should focus your time.
It's been a year since Hinge's relaunch. Do you think we're past the dating apocalypse?
Not past it yet. But I think the leading edge of innovation is moving away from it. Apps like Tinder and Bumble are still really big. But I don't think that's where the future is. There's certainly a group of people who don't like dating apps, and I've seen some data that says their antipathy toward dating services has only increased over time. Before, they thought, “not for me.” Now they're like, “I would never touch that.” I hope we can make the technology more accessible by making the technology a bit more humane. If we can show that apps can help you find authentic connection even better than you can in the real world, maybe we pull some of those people back into it.

DC Comics' Batwoman has proposed to her girlfriend in the latest instalment of the comic strip, amidst controversy surrounding the publisher's decision to hire a writer with anti-gay views to write for another title.
Kate Kane, also known as Batwoman, proposed to her girlfriend, Maggie Sawyer, in the latest episode of the comic.
Batwoman was reintroduced as a lesbian by DC Comics in 2006, in a new title which aimed to reflect modern society more accurate than previous comics.
DC Comics have been heavily criticised recently for its decision to hire anti-gay writer, Orson Scott Card, author of Enders Game, to write the first two instalments of its new digital-first comic, Adventures of Superman. Some fans called for a boycott of the company, and of the comic.
DC Comics had responded to the criticism, defending “freedom of expression”, stating that Mr Card would not be a regular writer for the comic, just two episodes.
An AllOut petition calling for DC to dump Scott Card had received almost 16,000 signatures.
Some critics accused DC of not making a bigger deal of Batwoman's proposal because of the controversy surrounding Card, others commended the publisher, praising it for what was seen as an attempt to normalise the same-sex proposal.
Others have questioned whether Orson Scott Card will complete the work for DC, given his opposition to equal marriage.
Last year, after it was revealed that a major character of DC Comics would come out as gay, lesbian or bisexual, one of the company's oldest characters, Green Lantern, was reintroduced as a gay man.
Marvel‘s Northstar, the first openly gay hero, tied the knot with his boyfriend Kyle Jinadu in an issue of ‘Astonishing X-Men', last year, and recently the creators of Judge Dredd suggested that he could be gay.
The narrow re-nomination victory of six-term Republican Senator Thad Cochran in the Mississippi primary run-off may well mark a watershed moment in politics in the South. In his desperation to overtake Tea Party favorite Chris McDaniel, who beat him in the first round of the primary, Cochran hit upon a novel idea: to invite the black community into the final stage of the Republican Party nomination battle. On the campaign trail, Cochran said he had never been averse to helping out the African American community. By bringing home the bacon – federal spending and grants – to one of the most pork-laden states, Cochran bragged that he had helped buoy the interests of the poor in general and the state's large black community in particular.
Can Democratic African American voters participate in a GOP primary? In Mississippi, election rules excluded only those voters who had already voted in the Democratic primary from voting in the Republican Party run-off. Since the Democratic candidate, Travis Childers, was uncontroversial but has almost no chance of winning statewide in the November 2014 general election, turnout in the Democratic primary was even lighter than normal. Thus, the vast majority of Mississippi's black residents, roughly 40 percent of the population of the state, remained eligible to vote in the Republican primary run-off.
Although the complete story remains to be told, it appears that Mississippi's black leaders recognized and took advantage of this historic opportunity, by urging their compatriots to vote in the GOP contest to gain a measure of meaningful clout in Mississippi politics. Since winning the right to vote in the 1960s, Mississippi blacks have voted as a bloc for Democratic candidates, while Mississippi white voters since the introduction of Nixon's southern strategy have lined up as a bloc for Republicans. The whites outnumber the blacks, so blacks have always been marginalized in Mississippi politics. But by voting in this year's contentious and evenly divided Republican primary, they have found a way to gain influence.
With the emergence of the Tea Party movement, somewhat more moderate Mississippi Republicans have found it increasingly challenging to win primaries. Yet now it is apparent that they have a new path to victory – one that runs through the African American community. Cochran's re-nomination sets an example that other Republicans of his ilk may follow.
Will this moment bring policy changes to benefit Mississippi's blacks and their communities? Here is the key point: African American voters don't have to change their politics to participate in Republican Party primaries, but the GOP candidates may need to adjust to attract black votes. Tellingly, Cochran spoke in favor of full voting rights and participation in the course of his last-minute appeal for votes in African American areas. At the very least, Cochran will now have to be cognizant of who kept him in office – and if he keeps the pivotal support of African American constituents in mind, he may well moderate his politics to inoculate himself against pressure from the far right. Possibly, some of his allies in the Mississippi Republican establishment that worked so hard to defeat McDaniel will also be more willing to make policy concessions to African American citizens in their state.
Where else could less extreme Republican candidates successfully adopt Cochran's strategy? Most likely, in states like Texas and South Carolina that combine a highly conservative general electorate with a large minority population. Should moderate Republicans succeed in using minority support to defeat Tea Party extremists in those states, the Cochran reelection in Mississippi could represent quite a watershed. It would not only be a remarkable sea change in what has become the sclerotic racial politics of the South, but the beginning of the end of the outsized influence of Tea Party forces on national Republican Party politics.

Senator David Leyonhjelm to introduce same-sex marriage legislation in private members bill
Updated
The Federal Parliament is facing another debate on marriage equality, with a private members bill to legalise same-sex marriage being introduced to the Senate today.
Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm is hoping parliamentarians from both the Coalition and Labor will back the proposed legislation.
He said the bill would allow ministers and celebrants to refuse to preside over ceremonies if they objected to same-sex marriages.
Previous attempts to pass legislation for marriage equality failed, but Mr Leyonhjelm said he hoped his legislation would win widespread support.
"All my bill does is prevent the Government from stopping two people from getting married on the grounds that they are not a man and a woman," he said.
"It does nothing more, and it requires nothing more than tolerance."
Mr Leyonhjelm said he did not believe the state had a role in relationships and that he and his wife had never formally married.
But he said given there was regulation of marriage, it should not exclude people who were lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex (LGBTI).
"When the law says that LGBTI people can't marry, in an important sense, it is diminishing their liberty. A major choice is closed off," he said.
"The state is interfering, intervening, telling certain people that they can do what they want, except when they can't, while everyone else, of course, can."
Last December the High Court unanimously ruled ACT laws allowing same-sex marriage were inconsistent with the federal Marriage Act and were therefore unconstitutional.
The ruling was a victory for the Commonwealth which had launched the appeal against the laws.
Two years ago the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted against legislation that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry.
Just 42 members of Parliament supported a private members bill put forward by Labor backbencher Stephen Jones, while 98 voted against.

Chicago registered colder temps than Mars on Dec. 19, 2016. View Full Caption Nasa
CHICAGO — Brutal cold has many Chicagoans thinking about getting away to some place warmer.
How about Mars?
Chicago is currently one of the coldest spots on the planet and is even colder than Mars. According to NASA, the current temperature on Mars is minus 2 degrees. Chicago was minus 6 degrees with a wind chill of minus 20 degrees as of 9 a.m. Monday.
The city nearly beat a record for low temperatures, but fell 1 degree shy of the 1983 record when a temperature of minus 13 was recorded at O'Hare International Airport overnight Monday, according to the Tribune.
That means that it was colder overnight in Chicago than in the South Pole, Antarctica, which was at minus 12 degrees at the local time of 3:57 a.m.
There are a few spots on Earth more chilly than Chicago. The North Pole is at minus 18 degrees, and Siberia, home of the coldest town in the world, is currently at minus 31 degrees.
A wind chill advisory will remain in effect until 10 a.m. Monday.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Israel says the men were tracking Mr Lieberman's convoy
Four Palestinians have been arrested by Israeli security forces over an alleged plot to kill Israel's foreign minister with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).
Israel's Shin Bet security agency said the group planned to assassinate Avigdor Lieberman during the Israel-Gaza conflict of July and August.
It said the men belonged to Hamas, the group which runs Gaza. Hamas said it had "no information about this issue".
The summer war lasted 50 days and ended in a truce between the two sides.
The conflict cost the lives of more than 2,100 Palestinians - mainly civilians, according to the UN - and 67 soldiers and six civilians on the Israeli side.
According to Shin Bet, the cell planned to buy an RPG and fire it at Mr Lieberman's convoy near his home in the settlement of Nokdim in the occupied West Bank.
The agency said the group had the minister's convoy under surveillance. They are said to have timed and measured different sections of the convoy's journey to calculate the most effective point for the attack.
Shin Bet said three of the suspects - Ibrahim Salim Mahmoud al-Zir, Ziad Salim Mahmoud al-Zir and Adnan Amin Mahmoud Sabih - came from the West Bank village of Harmala, about 2.5km (1.5 miles) from Nokdim.
Ibrahim Salim Mahmoud al-Zir allegedly masterminded the plot and recruited his brother Ziad, Adnan Amin Mahmoud Sabih and another Hamas member Youssef Ibrahim Youssef al-Sheikh, from the Bethlehem area.
'Message to Israel'
The group were arrested two weeks ago, Shin Bet said.
According to the agency, the men had said they hoped that killing Mr Lieberman "would relay a message to the State of Israel that would bring about an end to the Gaza war".
The release of the information about the alleged plot comes at a time of heightened tension between Israel and Palestinians.
Palestinian militants killed five Israelis in an attack on a synagogue in Jerusalem on Tuesday - the latest in a spate of deadly attacks in the city by members of militant groups, including Hamas.
Tensions have also soared over a disputed major holy site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, and incidents including the killing by Israeli forces of an Israeli-Arab and a Palestinian in Hebron.
From a pure basketball standpoint, there are very few fans and GMs who would take Raymond Felton over Jeremy Lin (and Jared Jeffries!). But Houston's offer sheet to Lin, with that massive $15 million salary in the third year, makes this about a lot more than basketball, or Linsanity. As the Knicks are currently constructed, Jeremy Lin would cost them about than $58* million in 2014-2015.
That's what Carmelo Anthony was referring to when he called Lin's contract "ridiculous," and it's sort of hard to argue.

Here's how $14.8 million in Lin's pocket skyrockets to $58.3 million in James Dolan's checkbook. It starts with a loophole in the Gilbert Arenas provision, which penalizes a team looking to match an offer sheet. In this case, the Rockets can average Lin's salary against their own cap—roughly $8.4 million a year. But the Knicks, if they were to match, would take a hit on each year's actual salary. So in 2014-2015, they'd be on the hook for all 15 million.
There's a very good chance every dollar of that would be above the cap. 2014-2015 is the final season on the deals for Carmelo Anthony, Amar'e Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler, and the three are set to make a combined $61.5 million that season. Expect the salary cap in 2014 to be close to this season's cap of around $58 million.

The Knicks are allowed to surpass the soft cap, but it'll cost them. Considering 2014 will be the Knicks' third straight year over the cap, they'll come in for the highest tax rate allowed in the new CBA. Take a look at the "repeat offender" taxes:
The first $5M of Lin's deal, as long as it's all over the cap, would cost the Knicks at a 2.5-to-1 ratio. So that's $5M for Lin, $12.5M in luxury tax, $17.5M all told.
The next $5M would be taxed at 2.75-to-1. So, $18.75M in total.
The final $4.8M, at a 3.5-to-1 tax, would cost $21.6M by itself.
All told, that's $57.85 million for one year of Jeremy Lin—$43 million of that in pure luxury tax payments. (This is exactly how the salary cap and luxury tax are supposed to work. Want to lock up three players to max deals? Don't expect any flexibility in signing the rest of a team.)

You can make that point that Lin's expiring deal would make a pretty appealing trade chip. Or that the Knicks have only themselves to blame for being in luxury tax hell. (Remember re-signing Chauncey Billups just to waste the amnesty on him a few months later?) But this is where the Knicks are now, and the choice they're faced with. You can't exactly call Dolan cheap, since he already committed to blowing past the salary cap before Lin even entered the picture. 58 million dollars is a lot of money. The last time the Knicks broke the bank on a player based off a good month of basketball, his name was Jerome James, and he barely cost half this much.
Update, 5:20 p.m. EDT: We got the luxury tax rate wrong, as the Knicks were over the salary cap this past season, but not over the luxury tax threshold. So the "repeat offender" hike would kick in in 2015-2016. ESPN, after consultation from Larry Coon, downgraded the maximum Lin would cost the Knicks to $43 million.
A Nepalese woman who lives in Malta bit off a piece of a man's tongue when he tried to kiss her as she was walking home last Saturday.
Crispin Grima, 35, of Sta Lucia was this morning given a four month jail term suspended for a year after he pleaded guilty to the violent indecent assault of Shanti Shrestha at around 3.15am.
The court heard that Ms Shrestha was on her way home from work walking along Testaferrata Street in Gzira.
She noticed she was being followed by Mr Grima, who called her and tried to touch her but she pushed him away.
However, he grabbed her from her throat and tried to kiss her. He put his tongue in her mouth and she bit him hard biting out a piece of his tongue.
She then started shouting and screaming. A woman helped her and he ran off.
Mr Grima later went to hospital where he was picked up by the police.
The average bill paid for broadband, TV and smartphone use in Ireland is considerably down on 2013, with both bundled and non-bundled packages seeing drops of varying amounts, according to a new report.
The ICT Consumer Survey, conducted by Red C for ComReg, looks at everything from consumer sentiment to knowledge and price. ComReg's latest peek into the lives of consumers revealed that, among other things, monthly landline and broadband bundles are, on average, €51 a pop now, down from €57 in 2013, with landline, broadband and TV bundles (€88) down €4 in the same time.
Landlines on their own are €45 (€49 in 2013), mobile contracts €29 (€36) and mobile broadband €27 (€33), with only fixed broadband (€36) remaining the same in the two years.
Savings everywhere
That equates to massive savings, with more than €70 saved on some bundles, €84 on phone contracts and €72 on mobile data plans throughout the year.
It turns out just one-fifth of us receive higher-than-expected bills, compared to over a third two years ago, with too many voice calls primarily to blame for this.
Indeed, a third of us (down 6pc on 2013) get those ‘you are close to exceeding your data allowance' warning texts, with almost half of us then continuing on eating up data regardless.
Three, it's the magic number
Three is the overwhelmingly dominant mobile broadband provider in the country, representing 59pc of the entire market, bolstered by its purchase of O2 for around €850m last year.
Over a third of us have switched mobile phone service providers, primarily because prices elsewhere (as new operators enter the market) come on stream.
Despite the changes, though, one-third of us are with the same operator for more than three years, meaning the upgrades are keeping us sweet.
Eircom is the country's dominant broadband provider, representing 35pc of the whole market, although its advantage over UPC is decreasing. Sky, though, is the main winner, after rising from just 1pc of the market in 2013 up to 12pc now.

Joanna Jedrzejczyk followed up an incredible performance Saturday night with a surprising turn of events.
The UFC strawweight champion departed the UFC 211 post-fight press conference early when asked about her wrestling coach, Kami Barzini, leaving her American Top Team gym. Jedrzejczyk clearly became emotional and left the dais, leaving the room in a silence.
On Monday, Jedrzejczyk explained why she did that on The MMA Hour with Ariel Helwani, the same reporter who asked the question Saturday night.
Jedrzejczyk said she hadn't spoken or talked about Barzini leaving much before her fight with Jessica Andrade, because she wanted to focus on her training and not be distracted. But it all hit her Saturday night, seemingly every bit as hard as Andrade did.
“It's amazing how he changed my wrestling, how he changed my takedown defense,” Jedrzejczyk said. “You can see that in my last fight. That's the thing. I'd like to work with him. And he's such a good person. He's a master of wrestling — he's my master. But he's like such a good spirit. He's like a doctor.
“Before this fight, he said I'm like a lion. I felt like a lion.”
Jedrzejczyk beat Andrade by unanimous decision (50-45, 50-44, 50-45) in a complete performance. She avoided Andrade's power and stuffed her takedowns. When she was taken down, Jedrzejczyk got right back up and resumed picking the Brazilian slugger apart on the feet.
That ability is owed in part to Barzini, who has had major influence on the careers of such big names as Robbie Lawler and Muhammed Lawal.
Jedrzejczyk, 29, said in years past she would see Lawler and Barzini at UFC events and Barzini would always say one day she should move to American Top Team. Last year, it finally happened. Jedrzejczyk made the move to Coconut Creek, Fla., leaving behind her fiancé and family in Poland. She believed she found the right fit, with coaches like Barzini, Mike Brown and Katel Kubis. Jedrzejczyk called it the best decision she's made in her career.
“It's not just about the work,” Jedrzejczyk said. “They really take care of me. They're with me all the time. They ask me how I feel after the training, before the training. We hang out together.”
After she left the press conference, Jedrzejczyk said she went back to her room and had a talk with Barzini. It was “amazing,” she said, and she's hoping to continue working with him in the future even if he'll no longer be at ATT.
“Good people connect with good people and this is what happened to us,” Jedrzejczyk said. “Maybe I'm the baddest chick on the planet, maybe I'm the baddest woman in the Octagon, but I'm definitely emotional. I believe in people so badly and I love when people treat me the same way. It's not just about the money.”
Jedrzejczyk (14-0) has come a long way since debuting in the UFC in 2014. She's arguably the best female fighter in the world and has won eight straight under the UFC banner. Jedrzejczyk is lauded as perhaps the best technical striker in the promotion, male or female.
But it's not all about that in-cage excellence and Jedrzejczyk made that abundantly clear Saturday night.
“It's all about the right relationships with people,” she told Helwani. “To all of you, remember — one day you can be a champion, you can be the richest person in the world, you can be the boss or the director of some big company, but remember the next day you can be at the beginning again. So, respect people and it's all about the right relationships.”

(CNN) A cholera outbreak in war-torn Yemen continues to spread at a rapid pace. Over 124,000 cases have been recorded as of Tuesday, with 923 people -- a quarter of them children -- dead in the current outbreak, the United Nations Children's Fund said in a statement Tuesday.
Cholera is an infection caused by ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria in water or food contaminated with feces. Symptoms include sudden onset of watery diarrhea that can lead to death by severe dehydration. According to the World Health Organization, cholera is widespread in the Middle Eastern nation of Yemen, with the number of cases surging since late April.
"The fact of the matter is, this is really a dire humanitarian situation and seemingly is only getting worse, particularly for children," UNICEF spokesman Christopher Tidey said.
Aid workers say Yemen, which has weathered civil conflict and terrorism for the past two years, is experiencing a humanitarian crisis. Not only are millions of civilians living in the crossfire, but they can no longer afford food, shelter or medicine, as the violence has devastated the economy.
Millions in need of assistance
Of Yemen's population of 27.4 million, UNICEF estimates that 18.8 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, Tidey said. Two-thirds of the population does not have access to safe drinking water or adequate sanitation. Of the country's 12.6 million children, 1.6 million are displaced while nearly 80%, or 9.6 million, require humanitarian assistance, Tidey said.
No age group can avoid cholera. People over 60, for instance, represent 33% of all fatalities from the disease, according to UNICEF. Cholera has an extremely short incubation period of just two hours to five days, and unlike other diarrheal diseases, it can kill even healthy adults within hours, according to the WHO.
While adults in Yemen are suffering, half of all cholera infections there are occurring in children, said Meritxell Relaño, the UNICEF representative in the country.
"Children continue to bear the brunt of the war in Yemen. Many who have become ill or have died from cholera were suffering from malnutrition," Relaño said.
In fact, more than half of the population is food-insecure, according to the CIA's World Factbook
About 2.2 million Yemeni children are malnourished, 462,000 of them severely so and thus currently at risk of death, Tidey said.
"When you have children already in that precarious situation in terms of their own health and well-being and then you have a cholera outbreak on top of that, well, that obviously makes them more vulnerable," he said.
Efforts to help
Countries facing complex emergencies are particularly vulnerable to cholera outbreaks, according to the WHO. That includes Yemen, where the disease has affected about 268 districts in 19 of its 22 governorates, the organization says. Yemen's cholera fatality rate, 0.8%, is nearing what is considered the emergency threshold, 1%.
To stop the spread, the WHO and UNICEF are honing in on the areas reporting the highest number of cases. The WHO has established four cholera treatment facilities and 16 oral dehydration centers in the country. Along with training health workers to manage cases, the WHO is providing emergency medical supplies to treatment facilities.
Dr. Nevio Zagaria, head of the WHO's office in Yemen, said in a statement that the organization has identified hot spots. "Stamp out cholera in these places, and we can slow the spread of the disease and save lives," Zagaria said. "At the same time, we're continuing to support early and proper treatment for the sick and conducting prevention activities across the country."

UNICEF is involved in providing water and sanitation services and support, including disinfecting water tanks and wells, as well as getting clean water to children.
More than two years of conflict also means damage to societal infrastructure. Medical supplies are flowing into Yemen at a third of the rate of before the conflict began, Tidey said, adding that UNICEF has "95 verified attacks on health facilities, including personnel."
"We know that health and sanitation haven't received their salaries in about nine months," Tidey said. "Nearly half of all the health facilities in the country are not functional. So those two things combined with the ongoing conflict itself makes it very difficult for people who need treatment to access it."
House Speak­er John Boehner went off on out­side con­ser­vat­ive groups Wed­nes­day morn­ing for push­ing against the new budget deal.
“They're us­ing our mem­bers and they're us­ing the Amer­ic­an people for their own goals,” he said. “This is ri­dicu­lous.”
Sev­er­al key con­ser­vat­ive groups are against the se­quester re­lief with­in the new budget deal.
“Though con­ser­vat­ives sup­port more spend­ing re­straint, the dis­cre­tion­ary spend­ing lim­its defined in the Budget Con­trol Act rep­res­ent a prom­ise to the Amer­ic­an people to mar­gin­ally slow the growth of gov­ern­ment,” reads a let­ter signed by the heads of Her­it­age Ac­tion, the Fam­ily Re­search Coun­cil, and the Amer­ic­an Con­ser­vat­ive Uni­on. Her­it­age Ac­tion's Mi­chael Need­ham penned an op-ed in USA Today on Tues­day call­ing the deal “a step back­ward.” The Cato In­sti­tute called the deal a “huge Re­pub­lic­an cave-in.”
Dan Holler, the com­mu­nic­a­tions dir­ect­or at Her­it­age Ac­tion, re­spon­ded to Boehner's com­ments Wed­nes­day morn­ing:
Amer­ic­ans are deeply con­cerned about the dir­ec­tion of the coun­try. Over the next few days, law­makers will have to ex­plain to their con­stitu­ents, many of whom are our mem­bers, what they've achieved by in­creas­ing spend­ing, in­creas­ing taxes and of­fer­ing up an­oth­er round of prom­ises wait­ing to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home. Mean­while, we'll con­tin­ue fight­ing to achieve our goal, which is created an Amer­ica where free­dom, op­por­tun­ity, prosper­ity and civil so­ci­ety flour­ish.
Rep. Paul Ry­an also ad­dressed his con­ser­vat­ive crit­ics Wed­nes­day, call­ing the at­tacks from the right “a strange new nor­mal.” Ry­an, for his part, is do­ing everything he can to re­mind his crit­ics that he's a con­ser­vat­ive.
Boehner has a tough path ahead of him as he tries to get this deal passed with Re­pub­lic­an sup­port. But, so far, he's mak­ing it clear that he won't go down easy.
New Delhi: Plans are underway to form a pair of state-owned joint ventures (JVs) that will oversee the construction of renewable energy projects, contributing to India's energy security and reducing reliance on conventional sources of fuel such as coal.
The oil and renewable energy ministries are working on the proposal, which sees them setting up one JV to oversee large-scale, grid-integrated projects and the other for off-grid projects, according to documents reviewed by Mint.
These new public sector units (PSUs) will, in turn, be JVs between state-owned oil sector firms such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), Oil India Ltd and Solar Energy Corp. of India and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency. While one of the JVs will be led by ONGC, IOC will lead the other.
The initial funding for the new firms will come from the JV partners that will implement the projects. The money they put in such projects will be considered part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions. Under India's new companies law, corporate entities are supposed to spend a certain percentage of their profit on CSR, essentially charitable activity.
A government official confirmed the plan.
“The project report for the joint venture companies has been prepared by Engineers India Ltd. Even some projects have been identified for development by the new firms. A background note on the same has been prepared," the official said on condition of anonymity.
Spokespersons for IOC and Bharat Petroleum also confirmed the proposal.
Queries emailed to the spokespersons for the ministries of petroleum and new and renewable energy, Hindustan Petroleum, ONGC, Oil India, Solar Energy Corp. and India Renewable Energy remained unanswered.
India's National Action Plan on Climate Change recommends that the country generate 10% of its power production from solar, wind, hydropower and other renewable sources by 2015, and 15% by 2020.
India has a power generation capacity of 245,394 megawatts (MW), of which only 13%, or 31,692MW, is contributed by renewable sources.
“The ministry of new and renewable energy resources has the technical expertise. Also, the oil sector, public sector units have large funds available under their corporate social responsibility programmes. This will be ploughed towards the new firms," said the government official quoted above.
The Bharatiya Janata Party that swept to power in the April-May general election under the leadership of Narendra Modi has stressed the need for reinforcing energy security.
The Modi-led government's energy security plans include harnessing renewable sources such as solar energy, biomass and wind power along with coal, gas, hydropower and nuclear power to bring about an “energy revolution" in the country.
India, which is dependent on imports to meet its energy demand, has an energy import bill of around $150 billion. This is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030, requiring a $3.6 trillion payout by 2030.
“My government will come out with a comprehensive National Energy Policy and focus on development of energy-related infrastructure, human resource and technology," President Pranab Mukherjee told Parliament on 9 June. “The aim of the government will be to substantially augment electricity generation capacity through judicious mix of conventional and non-conventional sources."
Developing renewable energy will also help reduce dependence on coal, which is in short supply domestically, requiring imports of the mineral to fuel most of India's power plants.
India is also exploring options to make it compulsory for conventional power project developers to build renewable capacity at the same location, a move that can provide an impetus to ecofriendly electricity. There is a need to integrate conventional and renewable power generation as India's overdependence on coal needs to be reversed.
President Obama's pick to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency once said that a “majority of white voters” would never vote for a black candidate and that they should be excluded from “the democratic process.”
The White House announced Wednesday that Obama will nominate Democratic North Carolina Congressman Mel Watt to take over the FHFA, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the country's government sponsored mortgage companies.
Watt, the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, has in the past accused white Americans of racism.
“There would be a substantial majority of white voters who would say that under no circumstances would they vote for an African American candidate,” Watt said Oct. 14, 2005 during a Washington hearing held by the National Commission on the Voting Rights Act.
The Voting Rights Act should be expanded to “adjust districts to take [racially motivated voting] into account,” Watts said.
Such voters “need to be factored out of the equation,” Watt said, because “I've got no use for them in the democratic process.”
According to a contemporaneous report of the hearing published by the Cybercast News Service, Watt said that black voters — unlike whites — don't have “an absolute commitment” to voting for a candidate based on race.
“Black people have not had the luxury of being able to say, ‘Under no circumstances will I vote for a white candidate,'” Watt said in his remarks.
Obama would win 43 percent of the white vote in 2008 — the largest share for any Democrat in a two-man race since 1976 — along with 95 percent of the black vote.
In 2004, progressive independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader claimed that Watt hurled a “racial epithet” at him during Nader's meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, which urged Nader to suspend his campaign and support John Kerry.
Nader alleged in a letter that Watt said, “You're just another arrogant white man – telling us what we can do – it's all about your ego – another f–king arrogant white man.” Nader demanded an apology from Watt.
Watt will replace acting director Ed DeMarco, who has served in that post since 2009. DeMarco has become a punching bag for the administration's liberal critics who have hammered him for his unwillingness to enact principal reduction, which would reset many underwater Fannie and Freddie loans to fair-market value.
Principal reduction would reportedly provide disproportionate relief to minority homeowners.
In 2008, following the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, Watt said that a government task force should be established to combat racial discrimination in housing lending.
“[T]here needs to be a more coordinated approach to dealing with these issues of discrimination, failure to be fair in loan terms,” Watt said in June 12, 2008 remarks before the House Judiciary Committee.
Watts said that minorities were “disproportionately more” encouraged to take on subprime, rather than prime, loans by housing lenders.
“When you're black, and you live in the world for 63 years, it is — I don't need empirical evidence to tell me discrimination exists.”
As The Daily Caller has reported, progressive activists from the liberal New Bottom Coalition targeted DeMarco with the fierce “Dump DeMarco” campaign, interrupting DeMarco's testimony before a congressional panel and likening him to the “Dr. Evil” villain from the “Austin Powers” movies.
“New Bottom Line's #DumpDeMarco campaign helped drive Ed DeMarco, a virtually unknown appointee from the Bush administration, into being known as ‘the biggest roadblock to our country's economic recovery,'” according to a New Bottom Line Coalition statement released Wednesday.
“New Bottom Line also urges Congressman Mel Watt to support principal reduction at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in his new position, as well as supporting the vital role they play in ensuring homeownership and rental housing opportunities for all communities,” according to the Coalition's statement.
Watt is the second African-American to be handpicked for a Cabinet position this week, following Charlotte mayor Anthony Foxx's nomination for Transportation Secretary.

Carli Lloyd put an exclamation point on her country's stunning four-goal barrage in the opening 16 minutes with a hat-trick strike from the halfway line as the United States demolished Japan 5-2 in the Women's World Cup final on Sunday in Vancouver.
Lauren Holiday and Tobin Heath had the other goals for the Americans, who claimed their third title after previously winning in 1991 and 1999.
"It's been amazing," said Lloyd. "We just wrote history today and brought this World Cup trophy home, which is unbelievable."
Julie Johnston put a ball in her own net in the second half, while Yuki Ogimi had the other goal for Japan, which won its only World Cup by beating the U.S. on penalties four years ago.
This one wasn't nearly as close.
In front of a raucous pro-American crowd of 53,341 at B.C. Place Stadium that included U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, Lloyd opened the scoring in the third minute on a nicely worked corner kick, guiding home Megan Rapinoe's low drive after making a strong run to the penalty spot.
The American captain then made it 2-0 with her fifth of the tournament just two minutes later by poking home Holiday's free kick after it was flicked on by Johnston in a chaotic penalty area.
- American Carli Lloyd on her hat-trick goal from midfield
Holiday went from provider to scorer in the 14th minute, jumping on a terrible mistake by defender Azusa Iwashimizu to volley it home past helpless Japanese goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori.
Lloyd then completed her hat trick two minutes after that on a goal that will be replayed over and over. She picked up the ball in her own territory and moved towards half before unleashing a shot towards goal. Kaihori stumbled as she tracked back and could only watch as the ball went off her hand, off the post and in.
"I've dreamed of scoring a shot like that," said Lloyd. "I did it once, I think, when I was a little bit younger on the national team in a training environment.
"Very rarely do you just wind up and hit it."
'Start fast, finish strong'
As the Americans on the pitch and in the stands celebrated, Kaihori lay on her back with her hands covering her face.
"We talked about trying to start fast," said U.S. head coach Jill Ellis. "That's been one of our mantras — start fast, finish strong."
When play resumed, Lloyd could have easily scored a fourth goal on a header moments later that went just wide.
Japan eventually steadied its ship and got one back in the 27th minute when Ogimi collected a ball in front of Hope Solo and beat the U.S. 'keeper with a high shot she could only get a finger to.
The goal was the first the Americans had conceded since their opening game, a span of 540 minutes.
Japan subbed on veteran midfielder Homare Sawa and striker Yuika Sugasawa later in the half, but the Americans took a 4-1 lead into the break.
Japan cut the lead to 4-2 in the 52nd minute when Johnston accidentally headed an Aya Miyama free kick into her own goal, but Heath got that one back just two minutes later on another scramble off a U.S. corner.
American striker Abby Wambach, a member of the national team for 15 years who has a record 183 goals for her country, has had a reduced role in her final World Cup, but came on in the 79th minute to a rousing ovation.
Downtown Vancouver was awash in red, white and blue in the days and hours leading up to the game as American fans descended on the city by the thousands. The crowd inside B.C. Place was no different, although there were pockets of Japanese supporters who did their best to be heard.
U.S. fans cheered and chanted "U-S-A! U-S-A!" 90 minutes before kickoff, and it only got louder as the afternoon wore on under a haze of smoke from forest fires raging across the province.
HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii has returned to federal court with a new motion in its challenge to Trump administration travel ban rules regarding citizens from six majority Muslim countries.
In the motion filed late Friday, Hawaii officials asked U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to enforce or modify the injunction he issued in March blocking the ban altogether.
On Thursday, Watson denied a request to clarify who is exempt from the restrictions, saying that question was best for the U.S. Supreme Court, which has allowed parts of the ban to go into effect until it considers legal challenges.
A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Friday it did not have jurisdiction to address or clarify the Supreme Court ruling, but Watson could interpret and enforce it. That appeared to give Hawaii an opportunity to reframe its request.
Hawaii contends the Trump rules improperly omit grandparents, aunts and uncles of U.S. citizens from the list of people who can travel to the U.S.

Fifteen ISIS militants were killed during an airstrike in al-Hadar region in Nineveh, western Mosul, Iraqi government announced.
Iraq's Defense Ministry's War Media Cell said in a statement on Wednesday that “an airstrike targeted a gathering of ISIS militants in al-Shaihan village, al-Hadar area, depending on federal investigations and information.”
“The raid left 15 IS militants including three leaders killed including security and administrative officials of the so-called Wilayat al-Jazeera. Others were injured as they were intending to launch attack at several areas,” the statement added.
Iraqi army's elite Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) announced storming two districts of al-Abar and al-Tanak located in western Mosul.
As a result, seventeen ISIS militants were killed and also six female members of different Arab nationalities were injured.
Earlier on Wednesday, Iraqi government forces announced resumption of military attacks against ISIS in central Mosul, following a suspension that lasted a few days.
Following Iraqi army's military campaign that was launched in October 2016, Eastern Mosul was recaptured in January. After the success, another operation was launched in February to retake the western part of the city.
According to reports, defeating ISIS in western Mosul is much more difficult because of the population density of residential areas and the high number of civilians who are used by ISIS terrorists as human shields.
The environmental movement is in love with the word 'sustainable'. Admittedly, it's a wonderful word in the purest sense, meaning; 1. capable of being sustained, 2. capable of being continued with minimal long-term effect on the environment.
Who doesn't want those capabilities? Yet, 'sustainability', like everything else good and pure, has seemingly been hijacked by the ruling oligarchs as a way to impose more top-down control of society. Passionate environmentalists are beginning to realize that the only way to affect real change is by becoming sustainable individuals through self-sufficiency. This focus on individual empowerment will naturally lead to increased liberty, as it minimizes the tactics used by mega-cartels and government to control our core needs of food, electricity, or medicine. Living in an environmentally and socially sustainable world should be an obvious goal, but it won't work if imposed at the barrel of a gun.
Removing individual liberties through restrictive legislation can never amount to sustainability, since much of the proposed legislation doesn't even 'minimize the long-term effect on the environment.' Banning incandescent light bulbs, for example, in favor of more energy-efficient but chemically-poisoning CFLs, demonstrates that our leaders have no genuine desire for the environment, but only wish to control consumer choice. It's similar to favoring nuclear power because it seems cleaner today, yet when the reactors meltdown, or waste needs to be disposed of, it irrevocably ruins Mother Nature. Legislating something as petty as what type of light bulbs we are allowed to purchase only indicates the tyrannical level of micromanagement intended for their view of a sustainable society.
Those who are trying to force lifestyle modifications on the public, while they jet-set and limo around the world, have forever stained the authenticity of the 'sustainability movement'. However, if we, as environmentally-concerned individuals, focus on becoming self-reliant, we will not only break our dependency on many of the establishment's control mechanisms, we'll also limit our impact on the environment and gain the ability to 'be sustained' -- the two core definitions of sustainable. That's the real triple bottom line for environmental activists: sustainable self, sustainable environment, and genuine independence.
If the current oil spike continues, the industrial food and big box store machine will grind to a halt, or at least make non-local food impossibly expensive. Perhaps then the masses will discover how much power this system has over them. We're already seeing the makings of a global food crisis. By producing some of your own food and buying the shortfall from your local organic cooperative, you can come close to food self-reliance. This type of food production/consumption is healthier for us, it reduces the impact on the environment in countless ways, and it breaks our dependence on factory food.
Furthermore, when we apply some level of alternative energy, we not only stand in defiance of the corporate energy state and the endless resource wars, we commit to cleaner energy technology. When we can harvest our own fresh water, we can survive without chemically-altered "public" services. When we become a producer instead of a consumer, we inch closer to breaking free from the rat-race economy while limiting our rubbish. And when we learn to make and apply natural health remedies, we discover a level of freedom from the toxins of Big Pharma.
By the very nature of becoming more self-sufficient, we'll limit our individual footprint on nature by maximizing the use of all resources. Instead of being 'sustainable' by taking things to the recycling center, anything useful is re-used. Mason jars are used for canning, shampoo bottles are refilled with homemade or castile soap , empty milk jugs are used to start seedlings in, and so on. In short, very little waste is produced when we are committed to becoming independent from the consumer culture.
Because the only genuine path to sustainability in any broad sense is through one person and community at a time, the environmental movement must shift its focus to personal self-sufficiency. And because sustainability cannot be achieved through forced coercion, gently educate your peers when they express interest. On a broader scale, propose ideas to make your neighborhood or town less dependent on outside influences and seek like-minded volunteers to assist in projects.
Ultimately, in order for environmentalists to affect real change we must do as Gandhi said and "be the change you want to see in the world." This doesn't mean preaching, picketing, or protesting. It means living the change. And the most effective way to live a more sustainable existence is to dedicate ourselves to breaking free from the poisonous system itself.﻿
Anyone who spends any time on FaceBook reading the arguments between trainers who train mainly with positive reinforcement and those who don't have seen this question. Just lately I have seen three different versions of it:
But what if your dog runs out into traffic? Are you going to save him by throwing cookies at him? But what if your dog runs out into traffic? You're going to pull on the leash. That's negative reinforcement and the same as using a shock collar. But what if your dog runs out into traffic? If you grab him that could cause stress, and I thought you're supposed to be 100% stress free?
I'm going to answer these questions. Perhaps it will help others formulate their thoughts in these kinds of discussions.
The traffic question is an interesting meme. The underlying message is, “When push comes to shove, positive reinforcement training is ineffective. It's dangerous because you have no acceptable way to control your dog. Your dog could die.”
There are further messages:
In #1, juxtaposing “cookies” with this life and death situation is both mocking and implies we have no methods of controlling our dogs.
of controlling our dogs. In #2, the implication is, that although we can prevent our dogs by pulling the leash, if we do, then we are hypocrites because that causes pressure and that's aversive. These folks are claiming that the bottom line is that there no way to distinguish between what we do and what shock trainers do.
because that causes pressure and that's aversive. These folks are claiming that the bottom line is that there no way to distinguish between what we do and what shock trainers do. And in #3, the subject is stress. This writer got the idea that we try to completely eliminate stress from our dogs' lives, and that therefore we would let them risk their lives rather than grab them.
Here are the briefest responses I could come up with to the three versions of the question. I'm also going to describe an actual conversation I had about one of these that turned out all right.
No, throwing cookies at a dog running into traffic would not be an effective way of stopping him. But with “cookies” (or more properly, positive reinforcement of all types) I can do the following: train him that staying by my side is the best thing ever;
use classical conditioning to teach him not to flinch from a collar grab or quick movement from me;
train a beautiful recall;
teach him a great “leave it,” which often generalizes well; and
train him to lie down on cue in all sorts of situations. I can use the “distance down” when coming to me would not be a good solution. Also I can use common sense. I don't know anyone personally who would have their dog offleash in busy traffic, whatever kind of trainer they are. Those whose dogs are reliable offleash are likely to be very careful where they do that, plus they have all the above tools at their disposal. Likening pulling on a leash (in an emergency no less) with the habitual use of a shock collar to force a dog's compliance is an example of the logical fallacy called the continuum fallacy. I will be discussing this further in a future post. But the short version is that the continuum fallacy erroneously claims that because there is a range of possibilities between two extremes, there is no meaningful difference between them. In this case the extremes are pulling on a leash to remove a dog from an emergency, which can constitute negative reinforcement, and using a negative reinforcement protocol with a shock collar as a training method to make them come when called and perform other behaviors. It doesn't matter that these have a small commonality (negative reinforcement). The respective quantities of aversive used (as a one time emergency move vs a regular method of training) are hugely different. You can see Jean Donaldson's elegant rant on this subject here. The question about being 100% stress free misrepresents most trainers' outlook and constitutes a straw man fallacy. That's when you argue against a version of your opponent's position that you or someone else made up, instead of what they are actually saying. Valuing kindness to our animals is quite different from claiming we can and should provide them a completely stress-free existence. And similarly to #2, what a person does habitually (try to make their pets' lives as pleasant and fun as possible and build up a relationship of trust) and what she might have to do in an emergency (grab them in a potentially startling way) are completely different. You can break a person's ribs doing CPR, but that doesn't mean you condone going around punching them the rest of the time.
A trainer who promotes prong collar use recently asked question #3 on a FaceBook thread. He said that his question was genuine. He asked, “Do you allow your child to run into the street because holding their hand stresses them?” He said he really wanted to know because he was trying to understand. So I answered. Here is a slightly edited version of what I said.
I am going to take you at your word that your question is geniune. Good for you for asking and really wanting to know. But I find the question about allowing a child to run into the street rather than holding their hand very, very strange. Like [the previous poster], I would have established a long time before that moment that holding my hand had very positive associations. But I will add that in any life or death situation, I would do whatever it took with a kid or a dog to physically prevent themselves from running into harm. Including something that might startle or even hurt them if necessary. The point is that a training session is not a life or death situation. It is a controlled environment. There is no analogy between these two situations. And in the training I do with dogs I want them first to learn that I will protect them. I won't hurt them. They can come to me for help. I am going to set them up to succeed from the beginning. The second thing I want to teach them is confidence and competence in problem-solving. Training does sometimes introduce stress. But it needs to be added in a very controlled way. It is well documented with many, many species that fear and/or excessive stress are impediments to learning. So I will indeed, like other posters, be watching my dogs for signs of stress. The more I learn about dog body communication, the better I can do that. I find the argument that we need to hurt or startle our dogs to help them develop life skills completely empty. (Not sure you said that exactly, but I certainly hear it a lot.) A mature dog has the cognitive ability of what, a two year old child? We are not preparing them to go out in the world on their own. (And even if we were, we wouldn't have to hurt them.) We are trying to prepare them for things they will likely encounter. And pain associated with or dealt out with by me (or other humans) is something they will encounter very infrequently as long as I have any say about it! It is something they can be specifically conditioned about, for instance receiving shots at the vet and other husbandry skills.
My correspondent wrote back and said he appreciated my answer. He said he had recently seen some parents do the very thing he described (give up on grabbing their child in a potentially dangerous situation because it might upset her, and she did run into the street) and that's why it came to mind. He said that he understood the other point of view better now, and pointed out that we even had some common ground: that some stress is OK and should be introduced gradually.
I panicked a little internally, wanting to write back “But our definition of stress is completely different!!” Then I thought to myself, just back off. We actually have a point of agreement. Don't ruin it.
This person is not going to stop using a prong because of a Facebook conversation. My friends are not going to condemn me for my comments about stress that could be taken amiss or quoted out of context. Instead, why not just enjoy the moment and figure that one person out there who uses prong collars may stop believing force free trainers are like permissive parents? And that might lead to some other realizations, who knows? I really did appreciate his politeness and apparent interest.
Besides the irritation of hearing it with such repetition, I do not like the “traffic” question because I don't think it is kindly to bring it up lightly as a point of argument. I have known of accidents to happen to dog belonging to the most prudent people and the most careless. I'm sure none of them appreciate hearing the subject thrown up as a threat.
So I will end this by asking for comments about safety behaviors. What do you teach your dogs that could save their lives? I wrote a short post with a couple of videos about what I do: Safety Behaviors: Down at a Distance and Recalls. I hope for comments about some other important behaviors and perhaps some videos. (Does anybody train extreme collar grabs?)
Here is a demonstration of Clara's down at a long distance. I can't claim that much credit for it. It's a huge advantage with a ball crazy dog that they learn that the reinforcement can happen “out there” as well as near their handler, so it's not a big leap for them to do stuff at a distance.

It's the offseason and we miss baseball. To help us forget that four months separate us and the peak of draft season, 13 members of the Pitcher List staff gathered to take part in a “way-too-early” mock draft, which concluded just last week. Here are the results:
A few notes:
23 round with a 5×5 roto league in mind
Position slots: C (Gray), 1B (Brown), 2B (Green), SS (Black), 3B (Light Blue), OF, OF, OF (Orange), UTIL, UTIL (Dark Teal) | SP SP SP (Red) RP RP RP (Dark Blue) P P P | 4 Bench Spots
13 teams with no strict draft clock as we drafted over two weeks
Through the next few weeks, each writer will have an article detailing their thoughts behind each pick of this 23 round draft and we'll be updating this article to link to each piece as they are released:
Let's dive into it in the comments below and check out the thread on Reddit's /r/Fantasybaseball to dive in further.
Across the country, there has been no shortage of restaurant employees losing their jobs after staging what could be construed as anti-police protests while on the job. In Dallas earlier this year, an employee of Genghis Grill was fired after refusing to serve police, among other incidents. Now, it would appear as if Houston has its very own officer-involved restaurant controversy.
In a now-deleted Facebook post, Houston-area police officer Shane Cates went to Going's BBQ in Crosby on Monday with a few fellow officers for lunch. When he got there, he heard music playing from behind the restaurant's counter that just so happened to be N.W.A.'s “Fuck Tha Police,” and he wasn't happy.
Going's BBQ owner Rigo Berto Ruiz told the Houston Chronicle that a 17-year-old dishwasher at the restaurant intentionally played the song when he saw the police officers enter the restaurant. Not surprisingly, the dishwasher has since been fired.
The controversy went viral online, and was picked up by Complex and the Dallas Morning News. In response to their newfound fame, Going's BBQ posted this statement on Facebook:
Whether or not the free meal for police officers at Going's BBQ in Baytown and Crosby will be enough to repair the damage remains to be seen.
Growing up as both an American and a Jewish person, it was a given that I would someday circumcise my children.
I didn't really question it. When I was pregnant with my son, my husband, who is circumcised, but not Jewish, told me that he wanted to circumcise him because he wanted them to ‘look the same.' It was reasoning that I couldn't really argue with. I didn't know much about circumcision, and I wanted to respect my husband's feelings on the issue. And, if I'm being totally honest, it was a relief to defer this decision – my two previous miscarriages had sucked any joy and spontaneity out of this pregnancy, and the anxiety over it happening again, and the overabundance of information that I buried myself in as a distraction, left me exhausted and overwhelmed. Circumcision was very low on my list of concerns at that point.
My doubts began when the nurse at the hospital came to take my son. It hit me that I was trusting strangers to take my newborn child, the one we'd gone through hell to bring in to this world. And now strangers would be performing minor surgery on him without my supervision.
I had only been a mum for around a day, and every instinct I had told me not to do this. I didn't even take the time to question whether this was important to me, although it obviously wasn't. I'm not particularly religious - I married a Catholic, meaning our only collective reason for circumcising our child was for cosmetic purposes. But I had deferred the decision, so I let the nurse take him.
When they brought him back, he was crying. The nurse dismissed it by saying that the procedure didn't hurt, but that he was just ‘pissed off.' Words of a medical professional, people! It wasn't that surgery on his genitalia was painful, just that a day-old newborn was angry. Over the rapidly rising rate of unemployment, no doubt. Or maybe petrol prices? Lord knows, that really boils my onions. Or, more likely, his parents had sent him alone into a room of weirdos who think that babies can't feel pain. Yup, it's that one.
LISTEN: The hosts of Mamamia's parenting podcast This Glorious Mess get a performance review from their kids. (Post continues...)
So the question is, if you aren't circumcising your child for religious reasons, is there any point to circumcision? Many of the older arguments for circumcision, such as hygiene and sexual function, have long been debunked. Similarly, circumcision only provides partial protection to HIV, and evidence that it decreases the chance of contracting human papillomavirus, UTIs, and penile cancer is negligible.
Risks of circumcision are the same risks of any minor surgery: bleeding, infection, and removing too much or too little skin. But the largest concern among most is an ethical one.
Since the procedure is elective and only in very few cases medically necessary, shouldn't the child be the one to give consent? After all, the child's body is now altered for life. Not to mention the pain the child endures, which, while fortunately temporary, is still very real. Ultimately, there are few compelling reasons to argue that circumcision either helps or hurts.
When last we left our heroes Samwell Tarly and Bran Stark, they were having a chat about a Game of Thrones wedding that didn't immediately end in bloodshed — that we know of anyway. In a departure from the standard operating procedure for HBO's fantasy series, the nuptial-tied death and mayhem was delayed until a later date.
Sam and Bran's talk in the finale of season 7 (released this week on Blu-ray and DVD) confirmed Jon Snow's parentage and his claim to the Iron Throne, which will be a critical plot point for the last season. Sophie Turner, who plays former wannabe princess–turned–political operative Sansa Stark, recently broke fans' hearts worldwide by revealing to Variety that the series will return for its eighth and final season in 2019.
In the meantime, we spoke to John Bradley, who plays cerebral Sam — best friend to Jon and AWOL from maester-training center, the Citadel — and Isaac Hempstead Wright, who appears as Bran — aka the next-gen Three-Eyed Raven and the youngest of the surviving Stark family.
The duo's characters have met before, so the cozy scene in front of the fire at Stark HQ in Winterfell was a reunion. It's also a pivotal moment in the series. Here's what they had to say about that and being part of the most-watched episode of one of TV fans' top shows of the past 20 years.

Isaac Hempstead Wright on the Limits of Bran's Power and Losing Littlefinger
Debbie Day for Rotten Tomatoes: Your last scene of the season showed us some limitations of Bran's special powers, of his sight, and I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about those limitations.
Isaac Hempstead Wright: Basically, as I understand it, the way Bran's power works at the moment is — it's like he's got a dictionary in front of him, the whole of time. And he's got access. He can look up anything he wants and that's kinda what the old Three-Eyed Raven was doing, he was saying, “Look, these are some important dates, these important events, you have to see this, you have to see this,” and that Three-Eyed Raven had been in the cave for a thousand years, and had looked through every single page, has memorized every single page, whereas Bran now he's just been given this huge book, and he's been looking through it, he's gone through the sort of key dates, but hasn't looked through all time, just yet. He doesn't have access to every single thing that's happened, he still needs to be reminded of places to go and still needs to be told what to look up.
And that's kind of Bran in season 7, is almost in many ways, a bit overwhelmed, as the new Three-Eyed Raven with all this information. And I think that's almost why he's almost in those first episodes almost emotionally void, and focused, because he's just trying to spend every minute looking through everything in time and knowing how the whole universe fits together.
In the flashback, he bears witness to an incredibly touching and beautiful moment: the marriage of two people who love each other very much. At the same time, he's probably seeing a lot of horrific, terrible things. Do you think about about how affected he is by that? Does he have PTSD from seeing all of these horrible things?
Wright: I think the job description of being the Three-Eyed Raven requires you — in order to not have some kind of PTSD total trauma — to switch off a lot of your human traits, because if you were a human who was forced to live every single thing that's ever happened in the world, your brain would fry, you'd go completely mad, and you'd just break down and stop functioning. And I think when you become the Three-Eyed Raven, it's sort of a little bit like, the human in you has been pushed to the back and you are now a vehicle of, like, time in many ways. You are the keeper of the history of the world. And therefore, you have to be strong enough not to let it completely break you apart.
And I think that works on the flip side as well. It means that when you do see wonderful, beautiful and amazing things, you're not standing there jumping for joy, and going, Oh, this is so lovely. You're just responding to it, on a kind of just objective — you're an observer to all time, good and bad, and it's that union, I think, that you're not totally traumatized by it, and you're not totally thrilled by it either. You're just a steady keeper of history.
Both as a performer and in the mind of the character, were you glad to get back to Winterfell after all of the snowy, snowy scenes?
Wright: Yes! Yeah well actually, I'd been in a set for a little while, which was nice; I was in the cave with the Three-Eyed Raven. I was quite happy in the warm there. To come back to the — it was quite a muddy set, the Winterfell set. I was not thrilled to be honest. [Also], that set has got a lot of history for me, being the first I literally sort of stepped foot on, back in those very, very early days, and so it was emotional to be sort of properly back there, especially after all that had happened there, getting burnt down and pillaged, to then Ramsay taking it over.
But as Bran, I think, there's not such significance to places anymore, I think he appreciates it because it's an important historical epicenter; it's a place where a lot of interesting things have happened, not only for him, but for lots of other characters throughout the history of Westeros, and so he's interested to be back. But it's not like he came back nostalgic, “Oh, it's good to be home, guys! Welcome back.” So again, there were so many things that Brandon sees in season 7 that were bittersweet … You'd expect huge excitement, you know, floods of tears, and of course we don't get that with Bran, because the part of him that Bran Stark is, makes up a very small segment of the entirety of his new identity now. So yeah, it was bittersweet to return to Winterfell.
You were also part of one of the most satisfying scenes of the series for fans: the execution of Littlefinger. Did you and the other actors in the scene feel as much satisfaction in reaching that moment as it was for viewers watching that moment?
Wright: It was a shame actually to lose Aidan Gillen, our lovely actor who plays Littlefinger. And it was, more than anything, just amazing to watch him working on the set that day: that whole arc, within that scene, of how he's casually sitting on that wall, and getting to watch him panicked, responding, reduced from his perch — where he thinks he looks over everyone and has everything put down and everything pegged down, and understood — to watching in a matter of minutes descend to the lowest position he's ever been in his entire life, begging for his life, from Sansa. It was spectacular to watch. And yeah, certainly satisfying — and Arya, when she sweeps with that effortless [slice] — watching this man effectively get tumbled down. All the words he put into managing people, and all of his conniving couldn't help him in those last seconds.
With all the prequels in development and given Bran's gifts, he could show up at any time.
Wright: That's what I'm hoping.
I hope so.
Wright: I'm hoping I'm in every single prequel. I never have to work on anything that isn't Game of Thrones again, for the rest of my life. [Laughs.]
Seriously or are you just saying that?
Wright: I'm joking. I mean, it would be fun. There's so much in the history of Westeros I would love to be involved in, and I've got to be a small part of some of those bits and get to sort of observe some of those early things going on in the world. I would love, yeah love, to be able to be a part of any of it, any of the history. So if they offered me to come back for a day and sort of, pop by, and have a look at some scene back from King Aerys or whatever, I wouldn't say no.
Do you have a favorite moment outside of the immediate series, any part of Mr. Martin's many, many stories?
Wright: I mean, the whole [civil war] era of the Dance of Dragons — that's a really real cool time in Westeros' history. To me, I've been most fascinated with the very early days, the First Men and the Andals… My favorite vision was getting sent back to the creation of the first White Walker. That was so cool. I love those very, very early evolutionary days in Westeros' history, which set up that conflict in that country.
And I'd also like to know — because we've seen a map of the world and, I don't know, is that the whole world? Is there something that's further east of Essos or further west than Westeros? I'd like to see either. I'd like to see what George R.R. Martin comes up with about that.
We all miss Hodor so much. If Bran needed to like to relax, would he just go back in time and visit Hodor? As sort of, like, a Bran vacation — a Bran-cation?
Wright: I mean yet, the power is sort of being wasted on Bran. If you gave it to anyone else, he could go out and chill out at a nice beach or wherever, or like, hangout and play some tennis or something, because Bran's never been able to walk, but unfortunately he's aware he's got a higher purpose. Everything he does has to have a reason.
Like the times when he just wanted to spend more time with his father —
Wright: In season 6 when Three-Eyed Raven was showing him back in time with his father, Bran was so, so enthralled in it and was mortified every time he was pulled out of the vision, what the Raven was trying to tell Bran is that, “You can't stay under the sea for too long, because you'll drown. You can't live in the past, you have to learn from it and move on from there.” And I think that wisdom has been passed to Bran, and he's not just using his powers to go and stay back in time and escape from the grim reality they all face. So yeah, with the biggest power in all of Westeros comes huge amount of responsibility. It changes you from — when you become the Three-Eyed Raven, you do become the Three-Eyed Raven, it's not just you know, it's not just an added little power, it's all consuming, you have to dedicate your whole body to it.
I think that maybe makes people — including me — just a little sad.
Wright: Yeah, I know. I mean there is still a hint of Bran in the back, and I think perhaps also by the end of the season, with Samwell, I certainly felt like Bran was starting to become a character again. I think it was a bit overwhelming at the start, suddenly having this huge information overload and it kinda did, zombify him, and turn him into just a computer, but as he sort of comes to grips with it, he will become wiser and more like the sort of Max von Sydow Raven we saw.

Game of Thrones: The Complete Seventh Season is now available on Blu-ray and DVD.
We all expected the Oscars to get political. What we didn't know was that we'd all witness the pop-culture equivalent of “DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN.”
Warren Beatty looked puzzled as he opened the envelope containing (or so he thought) the name of the winner of the Best Picture Oscar. But that's nothing to do with his age (79). Warren Beatty has always looked puzzled. Looking puzzled made him one of the most adorable leading men of the 1970s, and one of the most famed ladykillers in Hollywood history. As the critic Clive James once put it, “Beatty's acting style was based on modifications to a basic look of puzzlement.”
But this was something different: Beatty apparently had the wrong envelope. Puzzled beyond puzzlement, he peered and squinted and finally handed the envelope to his “Bonnie and Clyde” co-star Faye Dunaway, who read the fateful words “La La Land.”
Hey, way to let your lady take the bullet for you, Warren!
We were several minutes into the thank-you speeches when — oopsie! Let's just say the last time we were all this surprised, Hillary Clinton was biting the top off a bottle of the hard stuff. Millions must have gone to bed already: The Oscars were over except for a few thank-yous. Or so it seemed.
When “La La Land” producer Jordan Horowitz interrupted his own crew to say “Moonlight” had actually won Best Picture, it at first seemed like a dull replay of the Grammy Awards, where Adele said Beyoncé deserved to win and almost (but not quite) said she was going to give Lady B the award.
But — hey! No! — “This is not a joke, ‘Moonlight' has won Best Picture,” Horowitz said, holding up the card (as though we could all read the tiny writing on our TVs.) The “La La Land” folks suddenly looked as forlorn as the Atlanta Falcons at the end of the Super Bowl.
All those observers who spent three hours saying the Oscars were boring and predictable (OK, me) were made to look foolish.
I'll say it right now: Thanks to the last 10 minutes, this was the craziest, most exciting Oscars — the craziest, most exciting awards show — ever. For the first time ever, I'd like to thank the academy — for giving us all the “Holy s–t” moment we'll be telling our grandchildren about.

News Release — Sen. Bernie Sanders
Feb. 20, 2014
BURLINGTON – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today welcomed White House assurances that President Barack Obama will not call for cuts in Social Security benefits as part of a budget blueprint that he will submit to Congress on March 4.

“I applaud President Obama for his important decision to protect Social Security,” Sanders said. “With the middle class struggling and more people living in poverty than ever before, we cannot afford to make life even more difficult for seniors and some of the most vulnerable people in America. I look forward to working with the president to support the needs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor.”
Sanders is a member of the Senate Budget Committee and founder of the Senate's Defending Social Security Caucus.
On Feb. 14, Sanders and 15 other senators sent a letter to the White House urging Obama to spare Social Security in the budget that he is preparing for the coming fiscal year. The letter emphasized that Social Security has not contributed to the deficit. In fact, the retirement system's $2.7 trillion surplus can pay all benefits owed to every eligible American for the next 19 years.
One year ago, a cut in Social Security benefits was part of the budget blueprint that Obama sent to Congress. He proposed changing how the consumer price index is calculated to lower future cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients. The change also would have affected benefits for disabled veterans, noted Sanders, who chairs the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
Budget writers on Capitol Hill rejected the proposal.

The Dallas Mavericks will fill their freshly-vacated 15th roster spot by calling up Iowa Energy point guard Chris Wright from the D-League, according to sources familiar with the decision.
Sources said Wright will receive a 10-day contract before Tuesday's game at Milwaukee to fill the opening created by Saturday's release of 2011 championship alumnus Dominique Jones.
Wright was a McDonald's All-American in high school and then starred at Georgetown before going unselected in the 2011 NBA draft. He went to training camp with the New Orleans Hornets in October and then joined the Energy after failing to stick.
The 6-foot-1, 210 pounders averaged 15.5 points, 7.0 assists and 4.3 rebounds in 37.0 minutes per game for Iowa, earning a spot in last month's D-League All-Star game in Houston.
In March 2012, Wright was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but he has continued to play in the wake of the M.S. findings and was widely considered overdue for an NBA callup based on his development at the point.
Knowing she had only days to weeks left to live, Christine Hagan gave her daughter Jessica, 19, who had Down syndrome, a lethal dose of drugs in September.
On Thursday, Calgary police announced Jessica's death was a homicide but said no charges would be laid because her mother had recently died of cancer.
"We're just trying to get over the loss of two integral family members and we're strictly in the grieving process," Brian van Vliet, Christine's brother, told CBC News.
Christine, who was in her 50s, was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in May and though she prayed for a miracle, she knew in her heart she didn't have long to live, according to her brother.
"She was weak and very, very ill and it was just a matter of days before her passing," van Vliet said. "Christine was always a family first person, very caring, very boisterous, giving, loving."
Van Vliet said he believes that in her final days, his sister was very upset about what she had done to her daughter.
Body found in home
Jessica was found dead inside her Cranston home on Sept. 8. Christine was also found in the home, in medical distress, and was taken to hospital and kept in "medical custody" until her death on Nov. 21.
The family is mourning both deaths while grappling with the information that Christine killed Jessica, according to van Vliet.
Adding to the family's torment was a recent Alberta Health Services privacy breach.
Dozens of staff at Calgary's South Health Campus were disciplined for accessing Jessica and Christine's personal health information, van Vliet confirmed on Thursday.
One employee was fired and 47 more were disciplined.
NEW MUNSTER, Wis (WSAU-Wheeler News) Wisconsin's first spring flood warnings have been issued in the southeast corner of the state -- while 400 miles away in the northwest, another big snowstorm is in the offing. The National Weather Service says 6-to-14 inches of snow are possible close to Lake Superior in Iron, Ashland, Bayfield, and Douglas counties. A winter storm warning is in effect there from midnight tonight until 6 am Wednesday.
Meanwhile, most of the snow is gone along the Fox River in Kenosha County -- except for the flood waters left behind. The Fox at New Munster was one-and-a-third feet above its flood stage at 11 last night.
The rest of Wisconsin is supposed to get mixed precipitation today and tomorrow. North central and far northeast Wisconsin can expect 1-to-3 inches of new snow today, and 4-to-6 more inches tomorrow. Central areas can expect lesser amounts of snow, with freezing rain thrown in. Only rain is forecast for much of southern Wisconsin.
“I accidentally killed it” (and evaporated $300 million)
Michael Yuan Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 10, 2017
Github user devops199 said on Twitter “I accidentally killed it”. Before anyone can blink an eye, his “accident” has “killed” Ethereum accounts holding over $300M in crypto assets. On average, each of his 4 words cost $75M.
One of those Ethereum accounts belongs to the Polkadot project, and it held close to $90M before it was “killed”.
Someone asked devops199 after the incident: Why did you do it? His response? “I am just a beginner poking around the system!” In another word, he did not know what he was doing. A newbie experiment cost people $300M.
The fact that this is even possible shows us the sad and amateurish state of Ethereum Smart Contract development. It desperately needs help. Ironically, the old-hand enterprise developers know how to do this the right way — if only the “cool kids” and “programming bros” can listen.
How is it possible to make money disappear?
In the world of cryptocurrencies, you can have one or more “wallets” to hold your money in the distributed ledger known as the blockchain. Traditionally, each wallet is simply a pair of public and private keys. Those keys are created in pairs. You can create a pair at any time using software on your own computer.
The public key is like the wallet's account number. You can display and advertise it to the world. People can send cryptocurrencies into your wallet through its public key. For example, here is the public key for one of my Ethereum wallets. You are welcome to send some ETHs or other ERC20 tokens to this address if you enjoyed this article!
0xD69b30FAdf81882253329Ab0149131c67602eEd1
However, in order to spend the money in the wallet (ie to send some to another wallet), you must know the private key and use this private key to digitally sign any spending request. But,
Question: what happens if the wallet owner forgets or lost her private key?
Answer: In that case, no one can spend or touch the fund in that wallet. The money has simply evaporated (or lost, or frozen, depending on your favorite metaphor).
Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone. — Satoshi Nakamoto
Multi-signature wallets
The public / private key wallets are useful for individuals, but very hard to use for companies or projects. The private key should never be shared between multiple people. It should only be known by one person — the private key is just a piece of string data. If it is shared once, it can be shared many times without detection. However, it is also dangerous to have one person control company wallets that contain millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies. Besides the obvious risk of embezzlement, there is a risk for physical violence (i.e. abduction) against the private keyholder.
A clever solution to this problem is to leverage Ethereum support for accounts based on Smart Contracts. In this case, the Ethereum wallet is not directly associated with a public / private key pair. Instead, it's access is controlled by a piece of software residing on the blockchain, known as a Smart Contract. The Smart Contract could require multiple private keys at the same time before it can execute commands to access funds in the wallet.
So far so good! It is obvious that many companies and projects have great needs for multi-signature wallets. Parity developed this Smart Contract and puts it on the Ethereum public blockchain for anyone to use as a library function. In another word, you can also easily write your own multi-signature wallet Smart Contract by simply having your Smart Contract calling key functions in the Parity Smart Contract. Parity itself is using this Smart Contract in this fashion in its own high profile ICO projects such as the Polkadot.
Features become bugs
However, as we recall, Parity wrote its multi-signature Smart Contract as a regular standalone Smart Contract. It was not intended nor declared as a library function. Because of that, it has two “features” that should never exist on a library function.
First, it allows for an “owner” of itself. A properly declared library function should not have an owner as it is used by many. To make matter worse, the function to set owner is not protected and can be called by essentially anyone on the Internet.
Second, as the case for standalone Smart Contracts, the owner can delete the Smart Contract it owns via the kill function.
Now, we know that devops199 poked around random Smart Contracts on the Ethereum public blockchain. He just called the public functions to set himself as owner and then killed the contract to see what happens. He stumbled on the Parity Smart Contract, killed it, and now rendered all Smart Contracts wallets that relied on the Parity Smart Contract inoperable. For now, there is no way to access the funds in those accounts since the Smart Contracts can no longer verify the multi-signature requests without the Parity library functions devops199 killed.
A new hope
Now, isn't all software system created by humans? Why can't we just roll back the change or reinstall the Parity Smart Contract as a library to solve this problem? Well, that is precisely the kind of operations the blockchain is designed to prevent! In a decentralized world, there is no “we” to make this change.
A common used analogy in the real world is a bank hack. Say, someone hacked a bank and stole money by making electronic transfers to himself. The bank must ask the police to investigate and convict this person in order to get their funds back. The bank cannot just “revert the database change” simply because it is feasible to do so.
A central idea behind the blockchain Smart Contracts is “code is law”. It takes the fragile and unreliable human out of the decision-making process. What's written in the software code is faithfully and irreversibly executed by the blockchain. One person's bug is another person's feature. In a decentralized world, without a central authority, who to judge what is a bug and what is a feature. The software code as they are written is the only objective representation of any agreement.
Having said that, there are two potential remedies for the Parity bug (we will call it a bug since that's what most people agree on at this time). Neither of them is ideal.
First, there is a year-old issue on Ethereum development roadmap called EIP 156: Reclaiming of ether in common classes of stuck accounts. Since the Parity bug causes the fund to stuck in accounts, this appears to offer some hope. However, a close reading of the proposed specification shows that EIP is intended to address simpler stuck account problems. But perhaps we can expand the scope of this EIP to resolve the Parity bug as well? There is currently a very active debate in the comments section of this issue on Github. The arguments range from political to technical. Check it out if you are interested.
Second, the majority of the community can always create a hard fork to recover the funds for the frozen accounts. This is not the first high profile hack on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, Ethereum suffered from the infamous DAO hack and lost tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH. That incident ended with a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, which allows the majority of the community to come to an agreement to revert the ledger and recover the fund. However, today the Ethereum network has grown much bigger. The consensus and technical risks of a hard fork have all increased significantly. It is highly doubtful whether the community will support another hard fork when similar software bugs will for sure occur many times in the future.
What do we learn here?
Parity is one of the best-known software developers in the Ethereum ecosystem. It creates core infrastructure software and tools used by many in the community. It also implements blockchain pilot projects for banks. To see such obvious bugs from Parity is very disappointing.
The Smart Contract library that caused this problem is open source. Linus Torvalds once said: “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”. Open source software achieves security through transparency. But the hundreds of organizations that relied on in the Parity Smart Contract library to handle critical financial assets have apparently never audited the code. That is a huge failure for the community as a whole.
However, an even deeper problem is why Ethereum is plagued by bugs and hacks? The Turning complete Ethereum Virtual Machine to execute Smart Contracts sounded great, but it is very hard to program. Without high level tools and frameworks, developers often compare writing Ethereum Smart Contracts to writing assembly language code. As years of experiences in enterprise computing have taught us, secure and high quality software is produced by sophisticated tools, frameworks, and reusable software components. Enterprise stack of frameworks and tools are “bloated” for very good reasons! In contrast, the current Ethereum virtual machine and its software stack appear to be very amateurish.
A code quality review on deployed Ethereum smart contracts reveals 100 “serious” bugs per 1000 lines of code. In contrast, the Microsoft's released codebase contains only 0.5 serious bugs per 1000 lines of code, and the NASA code contains 0 obvious bugs. The code quality for Ethereum smart contracts us very low.
I believe that blockchain technology can only be adopted by enterprises after we solve the problems of poor developer productivity and software quality. As a community, we must innovate on making Smart Contracts easier to create and making it easier to write high quality / secure code. Our project, CyberMiles, aims to solve this problem by bringing the full stack of enterprise software frameworks to blockchain nodes and have a smart contract language heavily optimized for e-commerce applications. We believe Ethereum's one-size-fit-all is not the future of public blockchain networks. I see a future of several specialized blockchains, each optimized for a special type of smart contracts (i.e., CyberMiles aims for e-commerce optimization), and those specialized block chains will form an Internet of blockchains through Cosmos or ironically even Polkadot.
Officers responded to reports of gunshots on the 3600 block of Emerson Avenue North before 1:30 a.m. When they arrived, the officers found two people in a front yard with gunshot wounds. One was the teenager, and the other was a 33-year-old man who is being treated for non-life threatening injuries.

A third victim, a 36-year-old man, was also found injured in the nearby alley. Michal said he is in stable condition at the hospital.
While officers were at the scene, they were notified that another man had been dropped off at Hennepin County Medical Center with a gunshot wound to his shoulder. His injuries are not considered life-threatening.
A handgun was found at the scene. Michal said investigators believe an argument took place between the shooter and the victims, but no arrests have been made.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The swift rounding up of judges and others after a failed coup in Turkey indicated the government had prepared a list beforehand, the EU commissioner dealing with Turkey's membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said on Monday.
Following a failed coup attempt on Saturday, Turkish authorities on Sunday rounded up nearly 3,000 suspected military plotters, ranging from top commanders to foot soldiers, and the same number of judges and prosecutors.
“It looks at least as if something has been prepared. The lists are available, which indicates it was prepared and to be used at a certain stage,” Hahn said.
“I'm very concerned. It is exactly what we feared.”
The 1948 Donora smog was a historic air inversion that resulted in a wall of smog that killed 20 people and caused respiratory problems for 6,000 people of the 14,000 population of Donora, Pennsylvania,[2] a mill town on the Monongahela River 24 miles (39 km) southeast of Pittsburgh. The event is commemorated by the Donora Smog Museum.
Sixty years later, the incident was described by The New York Times as "one of the worst air pollution disasters in the nation's history".[3] Even 10 years after the incident, mortality rates in Donora were significantly higher than those in other communities nearby.[4]
Incident [ edit ]
The fog started building up in Donora on October 27, 1948. By the following day it was causing coughing and other signs of respiratory distress for many residents of the community in the Monongahela River valley. Many of the illnesses and deaths were initially attributed to asthma. The smog continued until it rained on October 31, by which time 20 residents of Donora had died and approximately one third to one half of the town's population of 14,000 residents had been sickened. Another 50 residents died of respiratory causes within a month after the incident; notable among the fatalities was Lukasz Musial, the father of future baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial, the 1948 National League MVP.
Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide emissions from U.S. Steel's Donora Zinc Works and its American Steel & Wire plant were frequent occurrences in Donora. What made the 1948 event more severe was a temperature inversion, a situation in which warmer air aloft traps pollution in a layer of colder air near the surface. The pollutants in the air mixed with fog to form a thick, yellowish, acrid smog that hung over Donora for five days. The sulfuric acid, nitrogen dioxide, fluorine, and other poisonous gases that usually dispersed into the atmosphere were caught in the inversion and accumulated until rain ended the weather pattern.[3]
Two of the heroes to emerge during the four-day smog were Chief John Volk of the Donora Fire Department and his assistant Russell Davis. Volk and Davis responded to calls from Friday night until Sunday night, depleting their supply of 800 cubic feet (23 m3) of oxygen, borrowing more from all nearby municipalities, including McKeesport, Monessen, and Charleroi. "I didn't take any myself. What I did every time I came back to the station was had a little shot of whiskey."
The eight doctors in the town, who belonged to the Donora Medical Association, made house calls much like the firefighters during the period of intense smog, often visiting the houses of patients who were treated by the other doctors in town. This was a result of patients calling every doctor in town in the hope of getting treatment faster. It was not until mid-day Saturday that Mrs. Cora Vernon, executive director of the American Red Cross, had it set up so that all calls going to the doctors' offices would be switched to the emergency center being established in the town hall. The smog was so intense that driving was nearly abandoned; those who chose to continue driving were risky. “I drove on the left side of the street with my head out the window. Steering by scraping the curb.” recalls Davis.
It was not until Sunday morning, the 31st of October, that a meeting occurred between the operators of the plants, and the town officials. Burgess Chambon requested the plants temporarily cease operations. The superintendent of the plants, L.J. Westhaver, said the plants had already begun shutting down operation at around 6 a.m. that morning. With the rain alleviating the smog, the plants resumed normal operation the following morning.
Researchers analyzing the event have focused likely blame on pollutants from the zinc plant, whose emissions had killed almost all vegetation within a half-mile radius of the plant.[3] Dr. Devra L. Davis, director of the Center for Environmental Oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, has pointed to autopsy results showing fluorine levels in victims in the lethal range, as much as 20 times higher than normal. Fluorine gas generated in the zinc smelting process became trapped by the stagnant air and was the primary cause of the deaths.[4] Further research was conducted by Mary Amdur about the effects of the smog; she was pressured to withdraw publication of these results but refused to be bowed.[5]
Aftermath [ edit ]
Preliminary results of a study performed by Dr. Clarence A. Mills of the University of Cincinnati and released in December 1948 showed that thousands more Donora residents could have been killed if the smog had lasted any longer than it had.[6]
Lawsuits were filed against U.S. Steel, which never acknowledged responsibility for the incident, calling it "an act of God".[3] While the steel company did not accept blame, it reached a settlement in 1951 in which it paid about $235,000, which was stretched over the 80 victims who had participated in the lawsuit, leaving them little after legal expenses were factored in. Representatives of American Steel and Wire settled the more than $4.6 million claimed in 130 damage suits at about 5% of what had been sought, noting that the company was prepared to show at trial that the smog had been caused by a "freak weather condition" that trapped over Donora "all of the smog coming from the homes, railroads, the steamboats, and the exhaust from automobiles, as well as the effluents from its plants."[4][7] U.S. Steel closed both plants by 1966.[3]
By 1949, a year after the disaster, the total value of the predominantly residential property in Donora had declined by nearly 10%.[7]
The Donora Smog was one of the incidents where Americans recognized that exposure to large amounts of pollution in a short period of time can result in injuries and fatalities. The event is often credited for helping to trigger the clean-air movement in the United States, whose crowning achievement was the Clean Air Act of 1970, which required the United States Environmental Protection Agency to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to hazardous airborne contaminants.[3]
The incident was little spoken of in Donora until a historical marker was placed in the town in 1998, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the incident. The 60th anniversary, in 2008, was commemorated with memorials for the families of the victims and other educational programs. The Donora Smog Museum was opened on October 20, 2008, located in an old storefront at 595 McKean Avenue near Sixth Street, with the slogan "Clean Air Started Here". Fewer than 6,000 people still live in Donora.[3]
Media coverage and influence [ edit ]
An account of the smog was published in 1950 by the noted medical writer Berton Roueché in The New Yorker under the title "The Fog".[8] Together with another short story, "A Pig From New Jersey", this story won him the 1950 Albert Lasker Medical Journalism Award.[9] "The Fog" was later included in his celebrated collection of short stories Eleven Blue Men.[10] Devra Davis' 2002 novel When Smoke Ran Like Water starts with the Donora Smog.
The 2009 novel Don't Kill the Messenger by Joel Pierson features a fictional town, Wyandotte, Pennsylvania, which became a ghost town after a smog incident, based on the Donora Smog.[11]
An hour-long documentary, Rumor of Blue Sky, produced by Andrew Maietta and Janet Whitney, aired on WQED TV in April 2009. The film features archival images and interviews with survivors of the environmental tragedy.
The Donora smog incident was mentioned in Netflix's The Crown in 2016, when it depicted a similar incident in London in 1952.
The Weather Channel produced an episode of When Weather Changed History on the Donora smog incident. The incident would be revisited in a later Weather Channel series, Weather That Changed The World.
In 1995, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker noting the historic importance of the event.[1]

A report issued by Human Rights Watch this week has revealed abuse, torture and ill-treatment of both trans and gay people by Lebanese internal security forces, including physical violence, intimidation, humiliation, and forced confessions.
Human Rights Watch interviewed 52 individuals that were beaten, threatened, or humiliated at the moment of arrest or during investigation.
Among the victims, a transgender woman, Tamara, and a gay man, Nadim, have spoken out about their experiences.
Tamara had fled from her family in the south of Lebanon to Tripoli, a city in the north. Male members of her family visited her apartment several times in an attempt to convince her to return to the family home.
She told Human Rights Watch that when her neighbours saw men visiting her, they complained to the police that she was a sex worker and that the men coming to her house were her clients.
Although these men were in fact family members, not clients, police arrested her in early 2010.
They took Tamara to a police station in Beirut.
She said: “I saw blood and people being beaten, and I was terrified. They took me into an office and three police officers started hitting me: punching me with their fists and kicking me.
“They didn't even tell me what I did or why I was there. When they found out I was transsexual, they started asking me really personal questions in very insulting ways.
“They asked me how I get fucked and told me that if I denied that I have anal sex with men they'll imprison me. I was so scared and did not want to get beaten anymore that I said yes to everything. Every time I denied something I would get hit, what other option did I have?”
While Tamara was initially arrested for sex work, a Lebanese court eventually found her guilty of “unnatural sexual acts,” and sentenced her to three months in prison.
By the time her trial started, she had already spent five months in a pre-trial detention.
Nadim, speaking out about his experiences, also revealed the extent of the tortures committed by Lebanese police, including physical violence, intimidation, humiliation, and a forced confession.
He was arrested in October 2010 when the police could not find his brother, who they suspected was guilty of drug dealing. When they found no evidence that Nadim had engaged in drug dealing, he said, they changed the charge to homosexuality.
Nadim recounted his story: “They accused me of dealing drugs. I denied it, so one of the officers hit me hard across the face. He then accused me of having a gun and covering for my brother, just crazy accusations out of nowhere.
“The intimidation and the beatings never stopped. In Hobeish, the officer told me if my drug test came out positive he would beat me senseless.
“When the results came back, he asked the officer carrying them whether it was positive. The other officer raised his eyebrows to indicate that it wasn't. He assumed I didn't see that and said: ‘Oh, positive for coke and heroin?' as if to justify beating me more. He took me into a room and made me crawl under the bed to humiliate me.
“He then asked me why I had a condom … I asked him in turn whether it was illegal to carry a condom, so he hit me again. When he asked me why I had messages and names of gay men on my phone, I asked him whether it was illegal to speak to gay men. He hit me again so hard my eye split and I began bleeding.
“I begged him to stop hitting my face but this egged him on further and he hit me even harder. He forced me to sign a confession that I have sex with men, all the while hurling punches and abuse at me. He then made me take off all my clothes and looked at me, told me I'm a faggot, insulted me, threatened me.
“The next day, two more men came in and interrogated me again. By this time the drug issue was dropped, the case was now about homosexuality. I was allowed a phone call this time, so I called the LGBT rights organisation Helem.
“The officer took the phone from me and told them that a lawyer is not allowed in Hobeish during interrogation, and if they wanted to see me they should go to the public prosecutor's office.
“The exam turned out negative, and so they had no choice but to release me without charge. They had no evidence of anything.
“Still, they told me that they would release me only on condition that I become an informant for them and snitch on my brother and on other drug dealers, users, gay men, and prostitutes.”
Other forms of torture reported to Human Rights Watch included beatings on different parts of the body with fists, boots, or implements such as sticks, canes, rulers, or other devices.
Eleven individuals said that officers in police stations and detention centres forced detainees to listen to the screams of other detainees being beaten in order to scare them into cooperating or confessing.
In 2012, it was also revealed how Lebanese security authorities imposed a crackdown on a gay cinema in Beirut, arresting 36 male attendees and performing anal probes on them.
According to Human Rights Watch, Lebanese police officers did little to hide their disdain of LGBT people
The report said: “The ways in which laws that criminalise sex work, homosexuality, and personal drug use are implemented exacerbate the problem and present a major obstacle to reporting police abuse.
“This can only be addressed through a re-examination of these laws.”
One of the most highly anticipated changes arriving in War's Onset is the rebalancing being done to Skyforge's various classes to help bring them more in line with each other as well as reevaluate how some of the classes function. Establishing what needs to be changed isn't nearly as black and white as some may expect, and the developers have been actively collecting statistics on each class (Popularity in each activity, PvP Victories, completion speed, deaths, convenience, and so on) since the start of Skyforge.
Popular Classes
Most prominent is the obvious demand and popularity of specific classes over others. In PvE, for example, Knights are by far the preferred Tank role while Kinetic or Berserker are chosen more frequently to fill in the Damage slots. Skyforge was created with the principle of equal demand for classes in all activities, so it was decided to make the classes that are in lower demand more useful for a larger variety of content.
To get started, let's look at what makes the Kinetic popular, as it's very straightforward. In terms of inflicting damage, it's one of the strongest and, most importantly, the simplest classes while at the same time providing useful support capabilities. Kinetics inflict their main damage within a short window (Burst), making them ideal for enhancements such as Injection, Blessing of Light, Energy Shower, and so on. These may only last for a short duration but if used when the Kinetic inflicts maximum damage, it proves very effective. Currently, there are no equal classes in terms of ability to inflict such high damage in a short space of time and make good use of secondary stats (strength, valor, luck, and spirit). There will be changes introduced that will bring the classes closer together based on these parameters. Two notable changes include:
Adding bursts to classes that did not have them prior, and reducing the amount of damage for classes where they were very strong (Their average Damage-Per-Second will not change).
Adding a dependence on certain secondary and additional stats to the skills and talents of each class.
In addition, by adding new mechanics to classes and balancing the parameters themselves, we can make some stats more effective than they currently are.
Support Classes
The capabilities of the Alchemist and Lightbinder will be undergoing changes, resulting in some of their abilities having the same efficiency as they do now while others will become more effective. For instance, the mechanics of the Alchemist and Lightbinder's auras will be changed. Luck, Strength, Spirit, and Valor on allies will be increased by a certain percentage of the Alchemist or Lightbinder's Spirit.
Alchemist
Stimulant Injection: Might will be added as usual while Luck, Strength, Spirit and Valor will increase by a certain percentage depending on the Alchemist's Spirit and Luck.
An additional weapon will reduce the recovery time of Alchemic Terminal depending on the percentage of the Discharge Recovery stat (depending on the quality of the weapon).
A Main weapon with bonuses to Stimulant Injection will reduce its recovery time by several seconds (depending on the weapons quality) upon each Impulse Charge activation. Charges with the Double Discharge symbol will also be counted.
The Biotrap ability will increase damage by a certain percentage for every “several percent” of the Alchemist's Critical Hit Chance stats.
The Accelerated Synthesis talent will restore more Catalyst by a certain percentage amid regular hits of Acidic Solution and by a higher percentage amid critical hits.
The Series of Experiments talent will enable the use of the following two abilities for free with a chance equal to the Alchemist's Critical Hit Chance stats.
Lightbinder
Flood of Light: Luck, Strength, Spirit and Valor will increase by a certain percentage of the Lightbinder's Spirit and Valor for every level of the effect.
The Warden's Gift talent will reduce Sacred Barrier recovery time in accordance with Discharge Recovery stat.
Rain of Fire talent: Now every “several percent” of the Discharge Recovery stat will reduce the charge recovery time of Unstable Shield by 1 second.
The Blessing of the Sun ability will increase damage by a certain percentage and increase with the Temper stat.

For the past few weeks, Jesse has been on the hunt for a more practical and spacious daily driver. He's been looking for something that can haul tons of stuff and a car seat. He's talked about Volvo and Mercedes wagons and while both can be great cars, I keep telling him he needs something more unique, but still dependable for the coming winter. Well I think I've found him the perfect winter beater for hauling junk, heck it could even be used to pull our own finds out of barns. This 1961 Mercedes was converted into what can best be described as a luxury monster truck. Its chassis was borrowed from a 1978 Chevy Blazer 4×4, so it shouldn't have any problems getting around this winter! Take a look at this monster Mercedes here on eBay out of Hardy, Arkansas.
While this might be a hilarious sight and possibly even a great winter beater, it seems like a bit of a waste of a Mercedes 220s. Of course I see the irony of a jacked up Mercedes and I appreciate the work that goes into building a machine like this, I just hate seeing a fintail modified to this extent. Speaking of modifications, the seller doesn't give the exact details of how they built it, but I would assume the work done can't easily be reversed. They didn't provide any photos of the underside, the interior, or the engine bay, but they are willing to provide more photos to interested parties. It is currently powered by a 350 cui V8 and with 35″ tires, it is going to need as much power as possible to turn those big wheels. So what do you guys think, should Jesse get a plan old wagon or this beefed up Mercedes 4×4?
McClean in frame for Republic of Ireland Euros call-up after Trapattoni boost
Sunderland winger James McClean has been told he has a '90 to 99 per cent' chance of making the Republic of Ireland squad for this summer's Euro 2012 finals.
The 23-year-old former Derry City player has made a significant impact in the Barclays Premier League this season since being thrown in at the deep end by manager Martin O'Neill in December.
Ireland boss Giovanni Trapattoni handed him a first senior international cap as a substitute in February's 1-1 friendly draw with the Czech Republic to a rapturous reception at the Aviva Stadium.
All smiles: McClean could be heading to the Euros after his breakthrough season
The 73-year-old Italian has insisted all along his squad for Poland and Ukraine will comprise largely of those men who got the Republic there.
Bbut having indicated that there is still room for the likes of McClean, Wigan's James McCarthy and Everton midfielder Darron Gibson to force their way into his plans, he has provided a further tantalising hint.
Trapattoni told the Irish Independent on Sunday McClean has a '90 to 99 per cent chance of going to Poland.'
McClean scored his sixth goal of the season, a powerfully-struck free-kick, in his club's 2-2 Premier League draw with Bolton at the Stadium of Light on Saturday.
Trapattoni will name his 23-man squad a week on Monday.
Italian job: Ireland boss Trapattoni has raised McClean's hopes
He received a boost on Saturday when central defender Richard Dunne started Aston Villa's 0-0 draw at West Brom on his return from a fractured collar bone.
Trapattoni, who has monitored the 32-year-old Dunne's progress since his misfortune struck in February, said: 'I was worried. I said, "Be careful, we need you".
Less than 24 hours after a terror attack that killed eight people on a New York City bike path, Trump is doing precisely what you expected of him: blaming others, talking tough, scrambling the facts -- and making himself the center of attention.
The behavior is familiar to anyone who's followed -- and who, even if they wanted to, could avoid it? -- the first nine months of his inescapable presidency
Trump's opening volley of tweets, late Tuesday afternoon, telegraphed all that's followed.
"We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere," he wrote, capping off the message with his signature exclamation, in this case: "Enough!"
After then offering his "thoughts, condolences and prayers" to the victims and their families, Trump announced — at 9:26 p.m. ET — that the days of "politically correct" anti-terror policy were over: "I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program," he tweeted, reviving talk of what might have sounded like an existing program. But there is no such thing as a proper "Extreme Vetting Program."
Perhaps he meant the travel ban? Or changes to the US refugee policy? Asked about the term Monday by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, chief of staff John Kelly was unable to give a strict definition . No matter, it had us asking.
By early Wednesday, Trump was up and parroting Fox News talking points, tagging @FoxandFriends in his tweets, and attacking New York's senior senator, the Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
"Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europes problems" said Col.Tony Shaffer. We will stop this craziness! @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017
We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter). @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017
At issue, what Trump called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," an immigrant entry path Schumer supported back in 1990 but, in pushing for an ultimately doomed comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, would have written out of the law.
Lame duck Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, one of the "Gang of 8" that pushed the legislation through the Senate, reminded the President of this in a tweet of his own:
Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms. I know, I was there https://t.co/QQFJzPyRzC — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 1, 2017
Asked on Wednesday during his first on-camera appearance since the attack to explain "how the diversity program fit into (the alleged terrorist's) plot," Trump skipped past the nut of the question.
"They say he came in through that program, so we'll see, we're looking at it," Trump replied. "But they say he came in -- I don't want, look, it's very simple, what we are demanding is merit-based immigration."
Earlier in his remarks, Trump blustered about his plans for the alleged New York City terrorist.
"We have to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now," he said. "They'll go through court for years. At the end, they'll be -- who knows what happens?"
Again, the President here crafted a kind of ominous mystery -- who knows?!? -- where, in fact, there are some very distinct, and defined, possibilities. The suspect could be charged and convicted, for one. But that might have sounded, as Trump might put it, weak. Instead, he delivered something out of his campaign speech.
First calling for a system that delivered "quick justice" and "strong justice," because what "we have right now is a joke and it's a laughingstock," he suggested more deliberative measures might've been to blame. "No wonder," he said, at close of his lament, "so much of this stuff takes place."
Then, as a reporter pressed for more information on rumors the administration would seek to send the suspect to the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Trump, as if it to insist to the world that the decision was his alone, left the room hanging.
"I would certainly consider that, yes. I would certainly consider that." Trump said. Then, without breaking for air, he declared, "Send him to Gitmo," before pausing to add, again: "I would certainly consider that, yes."
Was it confusing? Certainly.
Surprising? Not in the least.
From the time he entered office (and really, well before that), Trump's behavior has been predictable in at least one way: when the cameras are on and the country, if only by habit now, turns to the White House for some kind of guidance or authority, there stands Trump -- front and center.
Chuck Schumer has had some harebrained ideas, but this is one is probably one of the most far fetched.
Schumer thinks that President Donald Trump should allow illegal aliens to vote in order to prove that he is not a white supremacist.
That is absolutely the dumbest thing to ever come out of his mouth as of lately. How on earth would allow people who are not citizens of the United States to vote, in elections they have no part in, suddenly “prove” that Trump isn't joining the KKK.

Trending: ACLU Prepping for MASSIVE Lawsuit in Case Trump Gets Elected
Trump has already condemned and denounced the alt-right time and time again. He condemns all the hate and violence. We already know he isn't a white supremacist. This is just a ploy for liberals to incite more chaos and demand things that would only make our country worse.
Free Beacon reports:
They argue Republicans aim to restrict voting rights in order to impact voters—including minority voters—who more often vote Democrat. In July, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez expressed this view in an op-ed. “There seems to be no limit to how far Republicans will go to disenfranchise certain voters,” Perez said. According to the White House, the purpose of the commission is to study vulnerabilities in the U.S. voting systems. It planned to evaluate voter suppression and voter fraud, both in terms of registration and actual voting. Republicans have argued some voting requirements are “common sense,” and action is necessary to ensure those who vote do so legally. Schumer nonetheless condemns any action taken by Trump's commission. “They are a ruse,” Schumer wrote in reference to the commission's actions. “Their only intention is to disenfranchise voters. This is how the appalling failure to use the right words and stand up to hate in the aftermath of Charlottesville is made in the form of policy; they are two edges of the same sword.”
And if @POTUS won't disband the Election Integrity Commission, @SenateDems will try to do it on a must-pass bill in September. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) August 24, 2017

Yousuf Raza Gilani says Hillary Clinton has assured him there will be no more unilateral raids, contradicting US officials' claims
Pakistan's prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, says he has received US assurances there will be no repeat of the unilateral raid that killed Osama Bin Laden in May.
Gilani's remarks, in an interview with the Guardian, contradict assertions by the US president, Barack Obama, and other American officials that US forces would take similar action against other al-Qaida leaders if necessary.
Gilani was speaking in London at a time when Pakistani relations with the west, particularly the US, are at a low in the wake of the raid on Bin Laden's hideout in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad on 2 May.
After the special forces operation, US officials voiced suspicions that Bin Laden must have had a network of local supporters, possibly inside the Pakistani state, while Pakistani leaders were outraged not to have been consulted over the raid inside their territory.
"Since we were sharing information with US and there was a tremendous relationship with the CIA and ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence], therefore we could have done a joint operation in Abbottabad, but it didn't happen. Therefore we had a lot of reservations," Gilani said.
He added: "They have assured us in future there will be no unilateral actions in Pakistan, and there would be co-operation between both agencies."
The Pakistani prime minister said he had received the assurance personally from the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. In her public statements, however, Clinton has declared the US would strike unilaterally against other top militants if others did not.
She said in May: "We've made it clear to people around the world that if we locate someone who has been part of the al-Qaida leadership, then you get him or we will get him."
Speaking to the BBC just before his visit to Britain the same month, Obama was equally blunt on the issue. He said: "We are very respectful of the sovereignty of Pakistan. But we cannot allow someone who is planning to kill our people or our allies' people – we can't allow this kind of active plans to come to fruition without us taking some action."
On Thursday, however, Gilani said any repeat of the Abbottabad raid would be "totally unacceptable".
"Public opinion would further aggravate against the United States and you cannot fight a war without the support of the masses. You need the masses to support military actions against militants," he said.
He said another raid would damage "not only our relationship, but also our common objective, to fight against militants. We are fighting a war and if we fail that means that it's not good for the world. We can't afford losing."
After the raid against Bin Laden, the Pakistani government said it had stopped the US launching drones from its territory in pursuit of militants in tribal areas. Nevertheless, drone strikes on the Pakistani side of the border with Afghanistan have continued.
"We don't allow our bases to be used. They have other bases they use," Gilani said. Asked where those bases were, he replied: "I don't know. You ask the Americans. This is a question to put to them."
The prime minister said: "Drone attacks are against our strategy too, because we have been isolating the militants from the local population and when there are drone attacks they get united again."
Gilani deflected questions on some of the other irritants in US-Pakistan relations. On the allegation this month by the US chairman of the joint chief of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, that the Pakistani government had "sanctioned" the killing of journalist Saleem Shahzad, the prime minister said Mullen should present his evidence to the inquiry into the killing. He said he was not aware if the American had done so.
On FBI allegations this week that the Pakistani military, including the ISI, had spent $4m (£2.4m) on trying to influence US policy on Kashmir in Pakistan's favour, and the arrest of a Kashmir separatist lobbyist alleged to have been involved, Gilani claimed he was not sufficiently well informed to comment. "I have been travelling. I don't have full information," he said.
On Wednesday night, Gilani told an audience of British and Pakistani business leaders at a London hotel that his country's most important foreign relationship was with China.
"China is a rising power and Pakistan's all-weather friend. This is a relationship that has no parallel. Uniquely, there are no downs but only ups in Pakistan-China relations. China is a source of pride and strength for us," Gilani said.
The emphasis on the Chinese relationship has been a Pakistani government theme since the raid on Abbottabad and the cutting of US aid to Pakistan, but Gilani denied Islamabad was playing one world power off against another.
"We want to have relationships with both China and the United States. We don't want to lose our relationship with the United States. We want to improve our relationship with the US [on the basis of] mutual respect and mutual interest," the prime minister said.
However, he made it clear there was some way to go before that state was achieved. "It will take some time," he said. "There can't be a quick fix."
Amid near-constant sniping from Washington, Gilani's government found support from General David Petraeus, the departing US commander in Afghanistan who is soon to become CIA chief.
"I do believe they want to eliminate the al-Qaida presence and I do believe they want to eliminate the Taliban Pakistani presence," Petraeus told journalists in Paris.
According to Reuters news agency, he said "it is credible [Pakistan] did not know" Bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad.
By Jason Davis – WASHINGTON, DC (Sep 12, 2014) US Soccer Players – For Orlando City Soccer Club and their fellow MLS expansion team New York City Football Club, the next step in the process has finally arrived.
On Wednesday, MLS will hold a priority draft between the two unfinished teams. The draft determines who will get first choice in a myriad of MLS player-acquisition mechanisms. Which club grabs which top spot might matter to the way they fill out their rosters ahead of their first MLS campaign next season. Ultimately, however, the process is just another of the unique ways in which North American soccer creates new clubs. Nowhere else on the planet do new soccer clubs come into being quite this way.
This really is the ridiculousness of the MLS rulebook crystallized in one strange afternoon. A draft of drafts, featuring a cheeky (unintentional) meta acknowledgement of all the hoops that American and Canadian top-level teams must leap through just to sign a player they like.
Having the wherewithal (i.e., the money) to do so is just one small part of the equation. The balance (or semblance, at the very least) of parity must be maintained. There is even parity within the exercise of the priority draft, since an easy alternative would be to flip a coin for each of the eight areas of player acquisition on the list. Parity inside parity. The priority draft is the Russian nesting doll of MLS operations.
MLS will stream the event on its website in the interest of transparency. This is without question a public statement of intent after the “controversy” surrounding the allocation of Jermaine Jones to the New England Revolution via a draw no one outside of the MLS offices and the two competing clubs (the other being the Chicago Fire) witnessed. Commissioner Don Garber admitted that MLS needs to be more open with the application of its rules, a reaction to the surprising uproar over the Jones signing.
For most of its history, and particularly in recent years when the ins and outs of the league are of more interest than ever, MLS has operated behind a cloak of passive secrecy. Over a decade plus, “transparency” wasn't necessary as an operating directive because so few cared. As MLS has grown, so has the scrutiny on how it administers those sacrifices to the gods of fair and balanced competition.
This again, however, looks like MLS getting it its own way. Parity prevails because it guarantees a greater number of engaged fans over a greater portion of the season, at least in theory. However, the opaque labyrinth of rules and regulations frustrate the average fans. It shouldn't take this much effort to understand how MLS builds their expansion teams. By extension, why does MLS choose to make it so hard for fans to understand how their teams might get better?
Webcasting the process of two new teams burning through their selections of the various player acquisition mechanisms will not actually clarify anything, even if the exercise is important for appearances.
When the draft of drafts is over, NYCFC and Orlando will each know their positions in the Expansion Draft, the SuperDraft, the Allocation Rankings, the Discovery Rankings, etc. It will still require an MLS adept to make sense of how any of those choices will impact how strong a team either will have in 2015 for waiting fan bases.
Anyone who says they can predict how good New York or Orlando based on Wednesday's event is lying or fooling themselves. The overall effect will be minimal at best, especially when compared against the further business of identifying which players to sign/draft/acquire via the drafted mechanisms.
Still, the “MLS Expansion Priority Draft” does represent a milestone for the expansion teams. The new franchises will have their names listed among the established MLS teams. They're part of the same process, full participants in the sometimes odd world of Major League Soccer. There are still months to go, but that day creeps a little closer, and seems a little more real, than ever before.
The waiting goes on, but the preparations continue. Opening day means presenting a fully formed product, ready to take its place among teams that have a 19-year head start. For both expansion teams, year one looms with all the issues and problems that will undoubtedly arise. First, they have to fill out their squad sheet.
Wednesday's conference call is a lot of bluster with little substance. Additionally, it is excuse for MLS to prove its newfound commitment to transparency. For NYCFC and Orlando City's coaches and executives, it's another step.

More From Jason Davis:
Synthetic cannabis is being sold under many names spice, Black Mamba, fake pot, K2, K3, K4, herbal incense and many others. It was even sold legally on Amazon up until about 2011 (I can't find the exact date Amazon removed these products) meaning that Amazon have promoted and popularized this product. Despite the fact it is not on Amazon any more spice is still easily found and picked up MUCH cheaper than cannabis. It is also much stronger and much more dangerous than Cannabis.
I actually tried some a few years back before I knew what it was. A kid approached me in Wolverhampton when I was walking my dog. He noticed I was smoking a spliff as I regularly did when I was walking the dog. He told me that he could not get weed but they were selling this stuff in a shop in Wolverhampton and passed me a bag of it. It looked similar to weed but I remember it was darker and did not smell anything like weed. He pulled out a spliff he had rolled and asked me to try some. I had a couple of hits and I remember being surprised of how strong it was considering it was being sold legally on Amazon and in shops in Wolverhampton city center. The effects it gave me were cannabis like effects but lucky enough for me I only had a couple of little hits of it.
I have since been educated about this drug and this is a truly dangerous drug. In fact the hospital local to me say that they have seen five deaths in one year as a direct result of this drug. The real numbers will (as always) be much worse than that as they were not even including accidents that people may have had after taking this stuff. Amazon should be forced in to pay HUGE AMOUNTS compensation for this. This drug has had such of a negative impact on the poor (looking for a cheap alternative to cannabis) and many families around the country have lost people to this drug.
I'm not only talking about the homeless and the poor but also the millions of Amazon customers that would have assumed that if Amazon are selling it is must be safe.
Synthetic marijuana users report experiences similar to those produced by natural marijuana — elevated mood, relaxation, and altered perception. Often, the effects can be stronger than those of natural marijuana due to the synthesized chemicals. Some users report psychotic effects like extreme anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations.
Amazon have removed the products from their website but the damage has already been done! Thanks to Amazon this extremely dangerous product is now being used all over the country on a disturbing scale. The damage this drug has already caused is shocking and unseen by the masses and It's going to get worse. Many of the homeless are currently using this drug because of its low cost and easy access.
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - An influential Texas scientific panel recommended on Thursday that bite-mark analysis not be admissible as evidence in courts, a decision experts said could lead judicial systems in other states to exclude it too.
The Texas Forensic Science Commission panel recommended a moratorium on bite-mark evidence until there is science to support its admissibility. The decision will go to the full body as early as Friday, where it will likely be approved.
Bite-mark evidence has been used in U.S. courts for decades, most often to identify suspects in murders, sexual assaults and child abuse through marks on the flesh of victims.
But techniques to determine the source of marks is unreliable, and human flesh is not a good source to record the marks, studies presented to the panel showed. In some studies, experts were often divided on whether they were seeing human bite marks, let alone matching them to a specific individual.
“This commission's findings are incredibly significant because no other agency or scientific body has ever opined on the admissibility of bite mark analysis,” said Chris Fabricant, director of strategic litigation for the Innocence Project, which sought the review.
“It has been admissible as evidence for more than 50 years and thousands have been convicted as a result,” he said.
Texas has one of the best-funded forensic science commissions in the United States, and its findings are often cited in criminal cases nationwide.
The panel recommended bite-mark analysis be put on hold until there are scientific standards to determine what is a bite mark and proficiency testing of individuals who analyze them.
It also recommended a review of cases where convictions were largely based on bite mark evidence. There was no indication on how many cases that might be.
While bite marks analysis is used less frequently in U.S. courts now due to DNA testing, it is still used in other countries.
“Today is the beginning of the end for the use of bite-mark analysis in courts all over the country,” said Peter Bush, a forensic dentistry expert at the University of Buffalo.
But Dr. David Senn, a bite-mark analysis proponent at the Dental School of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, said the panel's recommendation was off the mark.
“Bite-mark evidence is too important in the investigation of certain situations and in the courtroom to be set aside,” he said.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Health Commissioner Tonio Borg outlines plans for DNA tests on processed beef
The EU is urging members to conduct random tests to tackle a widening scandal over mislabelled horsemeat.
All members should carry out DNA tests on processed beef for traces of horsemeat for three months from 1 March, the health commissioner said.
Horsemeat should also be tested for the presence of the veterinary medicine phenylbutazone ("bute"), he added.
Tonio Borg was speaking after a meeting with ministers from the UK, France and other affected countries in Brussels.
"This is a Europe-wide issue that needs a Europe-wide solution," Irish Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney said.
"This is about someone in the food supply chain selling horsemeat as beef and making money in a fraudulent way by doing that," he added.
Mr Borg said the programme of random tests should report after 30 days, but testing should continue for three months.
Supply chain
Analysis There is a growing sense of urgency to reassure the public. The problem is that the European Commission and the ministers do not have all the answers. How could they? The supply chain is global, convoluted. Yes, there may be "traceability." But even with a paper trail that stretches from Romania to the Netherlands, to the South of France, to Luxembourg, it is complex and deciphering where it went wrong is extremely difficult. What they must develop is a picture of how wide-scale the problem is. And that is where this new testing regime comes in. Hopefully by the end of March when they collate the first preliminary results we will get to just how many of us have unknowingly eaten horsemeat - and whether the reassurances that this is a fraud issue, rather than a health issue, are in fact correct.
Ahead of the meeting, the UK had called for EU-wide DNA testing of beef products, and welcomed developments.
Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: "It is completely wrong that consumers are being presented with a product marked beef and found it contained horse."
The measures follow the discovery that meat sold in up to 16 European countries labelled as beef contained horsemeat.
The scandal has raised questions about the complexity of the food industry's supply chains across the 27-member EU bloc, with a number of supermarket chains withdrawing frozen beef meals.
In the UK, the supermarket giant Tesco, frozen food firm Findus and budget chain Aldi received mince containing horsemeat from Comigel, based in north-eastern France.
Horsemeat has now been confirmed in some frozen lasagne on sale in France too.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta said the scandal was a 'clear case of fraud'
In Germany, officials announced that a shipment of frozen lasagne suspected of containing horsemeat had arrived in the country. They were notified of the delivery by authorities in Luxembourg on Tuesday.
Comigel denied wrongdoing, saying it had ordered the meat from Spanghero, a firm in southern France, via a Comigel subsidiary in Luxembourg - Tavola.
The supply chain reportedly led back to traders in Cyprus and the Netherlands, then to abattoirs in Romania.
There are now calls for more specific labelling on processed meat products in the EU, to show country of origin, as in the case of fresh meat. But the cost of doing that may trigger opposition from food manufacturers.
Romania has denied claims that it was to blame for the mislabelling of horsemeat.
"There are plants and companies in Romania exporting horsemeat but everything was according to the standards, and the source and the kind of meat was very clearly put as being horsemeat," Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta told the BBC's Newsnight programme.

Dave Price, who always wears a suit and tie, leans across the table at Mirto, a rustic Italian restaurant on Toronto Street.
“When you apply for a job these days, people don't look at your CV. They Google you,” Price says. A Google of “Dave Price” coughs up news stories about Price's time as director of logistics for Mayor Rob Ford during the height of the crack tape madness. All of them are bad.
Price, the stories say, was unsuited and overpaid ($130,000 a year) for his job in the mayor's office. He was “Dave from Scarborough” or “Dave from Georgetown” who repeatedly called Rob and Doug Ford's radio show, never disclosing that he was their friend. After those stories appeared, Price screamed at a Toronto Sun reporter, and the mayor suspended him for a week without pay. Price then, reports say, called a radio reporter a homophobic slur, over the same stories. Plus he lost his temper again after his Presto card malfunctioned and he missed a GO train from Georgetown to Union Station.
At the height of the Ford crack scandal I mailed a letter to Price's home in Georgetown, requesting an interview. Twenty months later, he called.
“I received your letter,” he says. “It just took me awhile to get back to you.”
Today Price wants to rebuild his image. He travelled to Old City Hall several times this spring to testify at a pre-trial hearing in the criminal case against Sandro Lisi, Rob Ford's friend, who is charged with extortion over alleged attempts to get back the famous Ford crack tape. While in the city, Price met me twice. He later sent an eight-page letter.
“Until recently I was shell-shocked,” says Price over lunch at Mirto.
His time in the mayor's office serves as a reminder of how the Ford years widened the divide between the two Torontos: the suburbs, of which Price is a product, and the downtown, where one must learn to do business in order to govern. His story helps explain the psychology of Rob Ford, offers a look at the chaos in the mayor's office and hints at an alternate outcome of last fall's mayoral race.
Price was the author of some of his own misfortune. He also had supremely bad timing to join the mayor's office just as Rob Ford became a joke around the world.
He grew up in Etobicoke. In Grade 10 at football practice he met a 9th grader named Doug Ford, the future city councillor. Price and Ford played on the Scarlett Heights Red Raiders senior football team that won two Etobicoke championships, in 1982 and 1983.
Youth, mud, football, hockey, soccer, jobs at Canada Packers and, yes, smoking pot and hash in high school, Price says, cemented a lifelong friendship between them.
When the Fords were kids, Rob Ford's older brothers, Doug and Randy, used to pick on him “because he was the youngest sibling,” Price says. “That's why he identifies with the little guy.” Price, the eldest of three brothers, says he was “kind of like the older brother that Rob got along with.”
A graduate of York University with a BA in economics, Price spent his career in financial services. In 2013, he had a job for L&T Infotech, an Indian software giant, when the Fords asked him to join them. He says he took a 50 per cent pay cut.
“It seemed like the opportunity of a lifetime,” says Price, now 51. “We were a year and a half out from what should have been a fairly standard re-election campaign.” His main job would be to replace city-supplied software to improve communications with Ford Nation.
“I was personal friends with Doug,” Price adds. “He was a challenge for whoever was running Rob's office, Mark [Towhey] or Earl [Provost]. Doug would say stuff without being well co-ordinated with Rob's office. Part of my value proposition was I could help them manage that, perhaps.”
Earl Provost, Ford's deputy chief of staff when Price joined, and later chief of staff, said the Ford brothers, and no one else, hired Price.
“It was definitely done by Rob and Doug. Nobody else was involved,” says Provost, now executive director of the Ontario Liberal Party. “I'm certain that Rob and Doug were very pleased with his job performance.”
Even as Price negotiated with Ford for the job in the spring of 2013, he learned that reporters had contacted the mayor asking whether Ford had been drunk at the Garrison Ball.
“Rob was really emotional. He was flipping out. I questioned him face to face, and he swore up and down that he wasn't drinking every day,” says Price. “So it's at that point that I joined.”
Price now knows that, “Those exiting from the March 2013 Garrison Ball may have seen Rob with Mark Towhey in a headlock outside of his Cadillac Escalade, and Sandro inside the vehicle with Rob's two kids.” Ford's executive assistant, Kia Netjian, called Tom Beyer, the receptionist in the mayor's office, at home to come and deescalate the situation.
Once Price joined Ford's office, he says, “For the first six weeks, he was not drinking every day. It wasn't until (news of a crack tape) hit the fan May 16 (2013) when he sort of slid off the cliff. From then on he was frequently not sober during the day.”
[H]e sort of slid off the cliff. From then on he was frequently not sober during the day
The crack story erupted the same day Price and Provost, deputy chief of staff, met with Vivek Kundra, Barack Obama's former chief information officer, to discuss beta-testing Salesforce software in the mayor's office. Price says the crisis dashed those plans.
From that day on, “it was all playing defence,” Price says.
On the morning of May 17, even as the mayor denied he smoked crack, Price went to 15 Windsor Rd., which he recognized, he says, from the photo published that day with the crack tape story. Price wanted to learn more about the crack tape.
“I'd known Fab (Basso, who lived in that house) for 20 plus years. He went to high school with my two brothers. I had a little bit of an interaction with his sister, (Elena Basso). I only knew her as Princess. She said something like, ‘Get the F out of here. F you this and that. Oh, I'm taping you.' So then she threw the phone at me. I was probably in there for a minute. The police are interested that I went there. But I didn't threaten anyone, I arrived there to try to find out some information. Based on Princess's reaction, she probably had something to do with (the crack tape).”
In November when city council cut Ford's staff in half and removed his powers, Price lost his job.
Fast forward to one year ago: May 2014. Rob Ford finally agreed to enter rehab. Price says Doug and Rob agreed at that time that Rob would run in Ward 2 and Doug would run for mayor. The mayor changed his mind when a Toronto Sun poll found voters preferred Doug to Rob for mayor.
“He was at rehab. He had backed out. I did my utmost to try to talk him into going back into the deal, and he said ‘No, that's it, I'm running.'
“Rob's got an inferiority complex. Doug's his older brother. Doug and I won two football championships and he was forever living that one down. Rob won once when he was in junior and never when he was in senior. He got to the finals four times, never won. The fact that Doug might have done what he couldn't do just didn't sit well with him at all.”
In September doctors diagnosed the mayor with cancer. Rob and Doug did switch places. Price, Doug's campaign manager for council in 2010, earned commission raising money for the Fords in 2010 and 2014. Had the Fords switched places in May Doug could have won, he says.
“We sent out a (Rob Ford fundraising) mailer to 3,000 people in spring of 2014. We got in maybe $15,000. These were the people who had given us $1.5 million in 2010.” By contrast, “we raised about $300,000 for Doug in five weeks. That's almost $10,000 a day. If we had five months instead of five weeks, I am not saying he would have won, but he would have done a whole lot better.”
Price says he is sorry for his outburst to a GO ticket-taker. He says he called a CBC reporter a “f—ing a–hole,” not a homophobic slur. Even so, he says, “it was inexcusable. I'll apologize to him right here.”
Price still sees Doug Ford “about five times a week;” they watch the hockey playoffs in Doug's “man cave” at the family business, Deco Labels & Tags. Price is also in Rob Ford's hockey pool. Even so, he regrets that he ever darkened the door at the mayor's office.
“At the time I joined if I knew the depths of depravity that Rob was involved with, alcohol and substance abuse on a daily basis, I definitely would not have joined his employ.”

With VeloCity succeeding in fostering the entrepreneurial spirit on UW's campus, the need for a space to incubate early stage companies became obvious. So an incubator opened in the Communitech Hub when the former Tannery building was converted into a high-tech office space in 2010. Two years later, it expanded into the present 7,200-square-foot Velocity Garage.
There currently are five hardware companies in the Garage and a number of others are ready to move into the Velocity Foundry when that opens.
In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the startup of technology hardware companies, Kirkup said. Investors are very interested in companies with tangible technologies that they can see and touch, he said.
Thalmic Labs, which makes a wireless armband that reads muscle movements and can be used to control computer interfaces with gestures, is a good example. It started in the Garage and recently moved into its own space. It now employs about 40 people and has raised $14.5 million in venture capital funding.
Voltera, another Garage hardware startup, is developing a printer that can print low-cost circuit boards within minutes. "That's very exciting technology," Kirkup said.
Another company, Lumotune, is creating new display technology that consists of clear plastic sheets that sandwich nanotechnology and can be seamlessly integrated into store windows or buildings. "We are making a whole new generation of displays that use very low power," said Hooman Safaee, one of the firm's co-founders.
Entrepreneurs come to the Garage from different parts of UW's campus.
The founders of Marmot Labs started the business while they were in the master of business, entrepreneurship and technology program. Marmot developed a cloud-based platform that takes the pain out of managing applications for things like grants and awards. The service is already used by Canadian consulate offices in Boston and Silicon Valley and local incubators and agencies that need to manage applications.
Matthew Miner, who co-founded gaming analytics company Lumos with Brad Keys, started in the VeloCity residence on campus and then moved into the Garage.
Popy Dimoulas-Graham, founder of Charity Republic, said the Garage is the perfect environment for young entrepreneurs. The startup licenses a service that school boards use to match high school students to volunteer and co-op placements, and track and validate the students' volunteer and co-op hours.
Dimoulas-Graham said being in the Garage gives her access to support and mentorship. Her company also has been able to partner with Desire2Learn, a large educational software company that has offices in the Tannery building.
Kirkup said in VeloCity's first five years, the startups it worked with have raised more than $90 million in funding from investors and now employ hundreds of people.
The most important measure of success is the number of "great companies," Waterloo Region has because of VeloCity, he said.

The United States controls the most lethal nuclear arsenal on the planet. We have nearly 7,200 nuclear warheads, and when combined with Russia's total, our two countries possess more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. We could literally destroy the world many times over.
Yet with election day just over four weeks away, the American people still know very little about Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's views of nuclear weapons.
ADVERTISEMENT
Americans deserve to know what their next Commander in Chief thinks about these weapons of war. This Sunday, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, CNN's Anderson Cooper and the attendees at the second presidential debate in St. Louis have a unique opportunity to rectify this failure.
At the debate, Trump must be asked two crucial questions about nuclear weapons: first, when would he use them? And second, how would he prevent their global proliferation?
Why does this matter? Unlike any other issue, the president has total control of the nuclear codes. No other American — not a general, not a cabinet member, not a Supreme Court Justice — can stop him or her from using them. There are no real checks and balances when it comes to using the nuclear arsenal.
Yet the statements Trump has made about nuclear weapons during this campaign are simply terrifying. When questioned about their use, Trump has meandered between protestations about how he would never use them to refusing to answer the question.
However, he has dropped certain confusing hints about his views. He's suggested that he may encourage countries like Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to develop their own nuclear weapons. And MSNBC's Joe Scarborough has even reported that Trump asked during one national security briefing: “If we have them [nuclear weapons], why can't we use them?” — sending a collective shiver up the spines of everyone who fears nuclear annihilation.
In a world with multiple nuclear weapons states, Trump's erratic rhetoric fuels the type of uncertainty that leads to major miscalculation — and potential disaster. Take for example the Cuban Missile Crisis. At that time, President Kennedy didn't know Soviet Premier Khrushchev's intentions, and it led to near catastrophe. Only when the two leaders had direct communications about their intentions — and their desire to not have a nuclear war — did cooler heads prevail and was war averted.
Leaders must be clear and credible, not intemperate and unpredictable, to avoid a calamitous miscalculation.
If Trump's plan is to leave our nuclear state adversaries guessing, then it's more likely that he'll scare them into taking preemptive nuclear action against us. And if Trump believes that he would use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear state actors — such as the Islamic State, which he has hinted about — then he would be using them against millions of innocent civilians without either justification or proportionality, turning the United States into a nuclear aggressor.
Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE has taken a starkly different approach. As Secretary of State, she played an important role in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons around the world. As a presidential candidate, Clinton has called for a new Nuclear Posture Review to ensure that our nuclear arsenal is prepared to meet present and future threats. She is thinking deeply about ways to better manage our nuclear arsenal while keeping the American people secure.
This is exactly the type of leadership we need and that Clinton provides. What we don't need are leaders, such as Trump, who view nuclear proliferation as either inevitable or beneficial to our national security. It is not.
For the past half century, ever since President Kennedy's administration, the goal of American nuclear weapons policy has been to prevent their spread while avoiding ever having to use them. And we've had successes in the past half dozen years on President Obama's watch. We've concluded a diplomatic agreement to prevent a new nuclear state in Iran. We've concluded an agreement with Russia to slash both our countries' nuclear stockpiles. And we've pressed the international community to adopt a nuclear test ban treaty. Hillary Clinton played a central role in all of these successes.
The moderators at the next presidential debate must therefore put these issues front and center. We need a Commander in Chief who not only has the temperament to handle the challenges of the nuclear arsenal, but also one who understands what it's all about.
Let's get this right on Sunday. Because once you drop the bomb, you can't take it back.
Rubin is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Legislative Affairs for the U.S. Department of State. He was responsible for building support in the House of Representatives for the nuclear agreement with Iran. Rubin has also worked with the Ploughshares Fund, an organization dedicated to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.

The Palinization of the Republican Party proceeds apace and party insiders openly tremble as they should. And it's not only the Tea Party extremists. It's Sharron Angle hiding from the press. And Rand Paul doing the same. Or Meg Whitman ducking her own press conference. Or Chris Dudley ducking a debate.
And then there are the liars and cheats. Serial plagiarist Scott McInnis. And serial liar Mark Kirk, who also, understandably, literally runs from the press. And then there's Dudley's dishonesty, too.
Not only are Republican candidates hopelessly extreme and/or inept, they or their backers know that they're hopelessly extreme and/or inept. These people are attempting to follow the Bush model of avoiding mistakes while not letting voters know the truth about who and what they are or where they stand on the issues. It's politics by obfuscation and avoidance, a deliberate strategy of dishonesty, because they know that truth is their worst enemy. Traditional Republican avoidance of scientific facts, such as on evolution or climate change, has created an alternate universe. They depend on myths and lies because it's who they are, desperately hoping that the voters believe false narratives, don't pay attention to issues, and are motivated more by fear and idolatry than rationality.
As Steve Singiser has pointed out, this is an odd election year for polling. Generic ballots and approval ratings and direction of the nation polls don't look so great for Democrats. People are worried and restless. Recovering from the many Bush disasters has not been easy, and on some issues, the Democrats should have been more aggressive in pursuing substantive change. A lot of people aren't happy with the Democrats, and are seeking something different. But once the voters take a look at the different that is offered, the present approach of slow incremental progress doesn't look that bad. It could be better, and it should be better, but the offered alternative certainly isn't better. Not only is it worse, it's frightening, and at times disturbing. What's offered by the Republicans isn't progressed, not even slow incremental progress. It's regression, rapid regression. In some cases, it's back to Medievalism regression.
The Democrats need to do a much better job of convincing voters that they stand for the people and for a better future. Being better than a train wreck isn't much of a standard, but for now the best thing the Democrats have going for them is the quality of the opposition. Or, more accurately, the lack of quality of the opposition. That could be enough. As the unhinged extremists increasingly come to dominate their own party, even many traditional hard right Republicans are just plain scared.
On Thursday, Taylor Swift released the “…Ready for It?” video, the second music video from the Reputation era. Given that the lyrics are all about a man that Taylor finds extremely fascinating — probably Joe Alwyn, her current boyfriend — you might have assumed that the video would have been all about their relationship. Maybe you thought it would be sexier than Taylor's past work because of lines like, “You should see the things we do, baby, in the middle of the night in my dreams.” That thought in particular may have been bolstered by the teaser, which showed Taylor in a nude bodysuit à la Ghost in the Shell.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
Bodysuit notwithstanding, it turns out the “…Ready for It?” video has absolutely nothing to do with Joe Alwyn, or any other anonymous person Taylor may or may not be dating. This video is all about Taylor Swift's relationship with Taylor Swift — specifically the Taylor Swift whose reputation has been tarnished by Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, and Katy Perry. This is presumably the same “old Taylor” referenced in “Look What You Made Me Do,” but this time, Taylor's fans (and her pointed Tumblr likes) indicate that there's a less obvious target in her crosshairs: the media.
In the video, a black-clad, possibly robotic Taylor does battle with the bodysuit-wearing Taylor, who lives in a glass box and seems to be trapped there. The Taylor in black is the "bad" Taylor, and Bad Taylor isn't real — she's just bad because the media portrayed her that way. Good Taylor is imprisoned by Bad Taylor until she sets herself free using lightning bolts and confidence. In the end, Good Taylor prevails and reclaims the narrative from those who would do her wrong.
This is all subject to interpretation, of course, until you start looking at the posts Taylor has liked on Tumblr in the past 24 hours (and her album cover, which features her name repeated over and over in various newspaper fonts). Here's an excerpt from a post Taylor liked, written by Tumblr user Stillgotscars: “Ready for it illuminates how the media/society have so tirelessly tried to absolutely sabotage taylor swift's soul, ravage her kind disposition and quite overtly vandalize her reputation.” Another Taylor-approved missive from Columbusswift: “THE GIRL IN THE BLACK IS HER REPUTATION THE MEDIA GIVES HER.” And one more from Yourlittlegames: “I feel like this video is all about her breaking free from this manufactured robot the media has made her out to be.” The “media is the enemy” narrative is playing out on Twitter too, even if Taylor's not quite as active there as she is on Tumblr.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
This is, in a word, bullshit. “The media” is not some monolithic entity out to destroy Taylor Swift's reputation, and for a very long time, “the media” was firmly in her corner. Consider the wave of “In Defense of Taylor Swift” pieces by women standing up for Taylor's songwriting skills, or the almost universal critical praise for 1989. Rolling Stone, The New York Times, Pitchfork, Billboard, and Complex all included 1989 on their best of 2014 lists (and so did I, before you @ me). When Taylor's friend Ryan Adams decided to cover 1989 in full, some critics argued that it was a pointless and possibly sexist endeavor, because Taylor's songs were just fine as they were without a stamp of "highbrow" approval. And just this past summer, Taylor got a ton of well-deserved good press for delivering a powerful, unflinching testimony in her sexual assault trial.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
But Taylor doesn't focus on the good, and neither do her fans. She wants to stomp out the dissent, the criticism, the possibility that she is anything but perfect. This has been Taylor's M.O. for years, but in 2017, it's no longer just wearing thin — it's downright dangerous. Who else do we know who's obsessed with good press, who constantly lambasts “the media” for “inventing” stories and creating their own narrative? Oh, right — the president.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
This is not to say that Taylor Swift getting upset about some false dating rumor is as bad as Donald Trump accusing entire news organizations of lying about his very real misdeeds and dangerous policies — of course it isn't. But all you have to do is scroll through Tumblr and Twitter to see that her fans have absorbed the exact same message that Trump has drilled into his supporters: “Journalists are liars and everything they say is biased against me.” In a more normal era, this might read as nothing but Taylor's fans developing a healthy skepticism for tabloids. But this isn't a normal era, and “media bad, Taylor good” is a tone deaf message for Taylor to be sending right now. When the president spends his entire day telling anyone who'll listen that the media is responsible for making up stories about him, the last thing we need is someone with as much as cultural capital as Taylor taking the same tack.
Plenty of other celebrities — the Kardashians, Nicki Minaj, Lana Del Rey, and many more — have had public spats with specific journalists or the media at large about some perceived slight or another, but none have taken it quite as far as Taylor seems to be doing with Reputation. But if anyone's responsible for Taylor's “reputation,” it's Taylor Swift. She's the person who called out Kanye West, who dated Tom Hiddleston and Calvin Harris, who used her squad for publicity, who espoused a shallow feminism that does nothing to help women in any tangible way. “The media” didn't do those things. Taylor did, and to say otherwise is to discourage her millions of fans from thinking critically.

Homewood, AL — Homewood police department has launched an internal investigation after video of their officers assaulting a 59-year-old mother in Walmart has gone viral.
The victim, Brenda Rivers had done nothing wrong, committed no crime, and was minding her own business when she was targeted by police who mistook her for a criminal.
Without a warrant or reasonable articulable suspicion, as Rivers did not match the description of the actual suspect, police detained her and demanded they be allowed to search her belongings.
Knowing she had done nothing wrong, Rivers refused.
“He just accused her,” Rivers' husband said, trying to explain to cops that they had just entered the store. “He wanted to go through her purse without a search warrant or anything. Our rights are being infringed.”
For demanding police get a warrant to search her, Rivers was assaulted, wrestled to the ground, placed in handcuffs, and humiliated as police detained her for nearly thirty minutes. All the while, her husband is demanding they stop the abuse.
Instead of simply reviewing the Walmart security camera footage, police went off half-cocked and just started grabbing and searching people. Rivers was the second woman to wrongfully be accused by police.
According to the bystanders in the video, even the woman who had her wallet stolen tried to tell police that it was not Rivers. However, they had already smelled blood in the water.
“I felt very emotional watching this go on. I had to record it because it's time for something to be done about the mistreatment from police,” Jasmine Thomas, the woman who filmed the abuse, told AL.com. “This is unacceptable and the officer violated her rights. It's very sad that we have to endure things like this or even witness it. I really hope this open everyone eyes and make them aware of what's really going on now.”
According to Homewood police, officers were dispatched to Walmart around 8 p.m. after a woman who was shopping with her daughter claimed her wallet was stolen from her cart while she looked at toys. A wallet theft is apparently a felony in Homewood, Alabama.
However, the felony charge is irrelevant considering the fact that Rivers was not the one who committed the crime.
The video of the incident in Walmart has quickly begun to go viral as the excessive force used on this poor innocent woman is nothing short of blood-boiling.
“My mama is traumatized and my daddy is very disturbed at what happened,” said the couple's daughter, Monica Dawkins. “She's in a lot of pain. That was excessive force.”
“What if it was your mother?” Dawkins asked an officer as she protested Friday night. “How would you feel if it was your mother, 30 years older than you right now, and somebody body-slammed her to the floor? How would you feel? Would you not be angry? Would you not be hurt? Would you not want answers?”
In a press conference Friday night, Homewood police Lt. Eric Hampton said Homewood police want to be transparent. “We would like to ensure and foster trust, and also mutual respect, between the community, the Rivers family and our agency,” he said.
According to AL.com, activist Carlos Montez Chaverst Jr. said Rivers' clothing didn't fit the description of the suspect. The victim told police the suspect was wearing a skirt and boots, and Rivers was wearing burgundy pants and shoes. “She shouldn't have been detained to begin with. There's a lot of missing pieces to this deal,” Chaverst said.
“We're ready to galvanize,” he said. “We want the mayor to speak out, we want the police chief to speak out. We're asking for transparency. We want honest and full, complete details as to what happened.”
When AL.com asked about Chaverst about the police statement that accused Rivers of failing to comply with police, Chaverst said, “Comply? Police make up their own policies. Comply is whatever they say comply is. That's how comply works.”
Egyptian state TV reported Sunday morning that the Al Jazeera office in Cairo is being shut down and Al Jazeera reporters are losing their press credentials in Egypt.
Al Jazeera correspondent Dan Nolan tweeted the news at about 11 a.m. local time, adding that Al Jazeera's licenses were revoked, per state media.
Nolan quickly added, "Don't worry we'll still report what's happening in #Egypt no matter what new restrictions they put on us."
Another Al Jazeera employee Evan Hill put the news this way: "State TV announces Al Jazeera's broadcasting license and press cards are being revoked. Our bureau is packing up."
Al Jazeera released a statement on Sunday that it "strongly denounces and condemns the closure of its bureau in Cairo by the Egyptian government." The network says it received notification from authorities on Sunday morning that information minister [Anas al-Fikki] had ordered the suspension of Al Jazeera. It also vowed to "continue its strong coverage regardless."

In the wake of President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accords, California is more determined than ever to reduce CO2 emissions. It has said that it would increase its use of renewables to 100% by 2045 while also trying to tie its cap-and-trade system to that of China's emerging trading plan.
Both are bold goals that won't come easy. But the overriding point that the state's governor and its legislators are trying to make is that environmental progress — cutting CO2 releases — does not necessarily require the support of the president.
Specifically, Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has said he will raise the topic of merging California's cap-and-trade program with that of China's when it is developed. Its program is already linked to that of Quebec, Canada. Meantime, the California Senate passed a bill to set a renewable portfolio standard at 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2045.
“Transitioning to a 100% carbon-free future in an economy the size of California's requires persistence, commitment, and vision,” Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director for California Solar Energy Industries Association said. The association “stands at the ready in creating the local jobs, carbon-free electricity, and grid reliability that comes with this cleaner future.”
California wants to reduce CO2 levels by 40% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Transitioning to renewables is one way. Using its existing cap-and-trade system is another, although that program needs to get reauthorized in 2020.
And by 2050, California hopes to have cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 80%, which would not just make it an example for other states but also for other countries. In the end, it will be a job creator, say advocates. To get there, the state will also employ other strategies such as vehicle emissions limits, energy efficiency standards for buildings and renewable portfolio standards for utilities.
Cap-and-trade works like this: Governments set pollution limits and then credits are either auctioned or allocated to industry. Those companies that are able to exceed the expectations can either bank their allowances for future use or sell them to other businesses that are unable to meet their obligations. As the ceilings come down, overall emissions then fall.
“We want to make sure it has full integrity and know exactly what's going on. And we can't say that today,” Governor Brown told Reuters. ”Maybe we don't put it right in the same cap-and-trade regime, maybe some parallel regime.”
California and Quebec have been working together though the so-called Western Climate Initiative. Quebec's program got going earlier this year. The province has a goal of cutting its CO2 emissions below 2005 levels by 2030.
“We're willing to be partners with whoever is going to take serious action on climate change,” Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna told the Globe and Mail. “I'm going to keep making the case that there is a real economic opportunity that climate action brings, that we are creating good jobs right now in renewable, in clean energy, innovation and that's what governments want.”
In the past, Republicans have favored using the states as the testing grounds for new ideas and even those that may run counter to what the central government is espousing. While California's strategy to achieve carbon cuts is multifaceted, some parts of it — such as setting emissions standards on vehicles — would need federal approval.
As far as California connecting with China's pending cap-and-trade program, well, that could be a different matter. For starters, the technical aspects may be hard to overcome. But it may also be unconstitutional: Section 10 of the US Constitution says: “No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection Laws …”
The Chicago Bears and Cleveland Browns will wrap up the 2017 preseason on Thursday night at Soldier Field. Things will be interesting, at least for a little while, because Mitchell Trubisky will be starting his first game in a Bears uniform. Usually, the fourth preseason game is a rough one to get through, but Thursday night may be an exception.
Let's take a closer look.
Mitchell Trubisky
As I stated above, Trubisky will get the start Thursday night against the Browns. That right there is enough reason to watch the game. I want to see how Trubisky handles starting. The three times he has played this preseason he has come in off the bench.
Trubisky needs as much reps as he can get because it doesn't look he will see any during the early portion of the regular season. Yes, that does mean more likely than not Mike Glennon will be the team's starting quarterback heading into week one vs. the Atalanta Falcons.
Hopefully, Trubisky can have some success against the Browns defense.

After being released by the New York Giants, Victor Cruz was looking for a new team to join. He eventually chose the Bears. He felt there could be a role for him in Chicago, but things haven't exactly worked out this preseason.
Cruz has played very little with the first team offense and has had trouble holding onto the football.
https://twitter.com/_MarcusD2_/status/901896093964881921
When the Bears cut their roster from 90 to 53 on Saturday it is unknown if Cruz will be a member of the final roster. After the Cameron Meredith injury, Kevin White has become the team's number one wide receiver (believe it or not). Kendall Wright will be the starter in the slot, while Markus Wheaton will be third on the depth chart, when healthy.
After building a solid relationship with Trubisky, wide receiver Tanner Gentry has also solidified a roster spot because of his play on special teams. That leaves the Bears in a tough spot when it comes to Cruz. I expect him to play on Thursday and he needs to show something to avoid being one of the many players cut on Saturday.

Connor Shaw
When John Fox decides, Connor Shaw will replace Trubisky as the quarterback. Shaw had a solid preseason last year but suffered a gruesome leg injury in the third game against the Kansas City Chiefs.
#Bears Connor Shaw update
Broken leg . Out for season
Terrible injuryhttps://t.co/GhuaQ8WTje — Sports Recall (@SportsRecall) August 28, 2016
Shaw would have made the Bears roster if he never broke his leg and would have probably played last season given all of the injuries the Bears had at the quarterback position. Now, he will be auditioning for the Bears practice squad or other teams on Thursday night.
Adam Shaheen
The second round rookie tight end has been fairly quiet this preseason. He has been solid on special teams though. Last week, he almost recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown. He has also been an above average run blocker thus far.
Shaheen growing as a blocker- gets hands placed and stays blocked. Sticky – good job by Adam- Sowell again excellent on cut off #Bears pic.twitter.com/1PchNJbXAM — Draft Dr. Phil (@FulphilO) August 21, 2017
Thursday night is a good opportunity for Shaheen to make some plays in the passing game, especially with fellow rookie Mitchell Trubisky getting the start. He has just three catches for 18 yards this preseason. I expect Shaheen to see several red zone targets tonight against the Browns.
Roy Robertson-Harris
One of my favorite players to watch this preseason has been Roy Robertson-Harris. In the offseason, the Bears decided to move him from outside linebacker to defensive end. So far, the move has paid off big time.
Robertson-Harris has been good against both the run and pass this preseason.

At this point, Robertson-Harris should make the team. He has another opportunity to prove he belongs tonight against the Browns.

Recap
Without Kidd, Mavericks hand Knicks worst home loss ever
By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com
Posted Sunday January 24, 2010 4:33PM
NEW YORK (NBA.com exclusive) -- No Jason Kidd and no Erick Dampier. No problem.
Even without Kidd (personal reasons) and Dampier (knee), the Dallas Mavericks hammered the Knicks, 128-78, at Madison Square Garden and handed New York its worst home loss and second-worst loss in franchise history.
"The last time I had a 50-point win? I don't think I had a 50-point win. I don't care if we won by one point. A win is a win," said Dallas forward Shawn Marion, one of seven Mavericks in double-figures with 15 points.
The loss was so lopsided, Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni spent more time chuckling during his postgame press conference than expressing anger or frustration.
"It's hard to even comment on this game. It was so bad in every area. It's regretful, but it happened. We just try to flush it down the toilet and get ready for the next one," he said.
Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry scored 20 points apiece for Dallas, which outshot New York, 58 percent to 34 percent. Drew Gooden added 15 points and Rodrigue Beaubois scored 13 off the bench.
Kidd returned to Dallas after its loss in Philadelphia on Friday night, team officials said.
Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said it was a family matter.
"We knew it was a possibility," Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said before the game. "You lose a guy like that, it's gonna change the way you play."
The 36-year-old Kidd had started all 43 games for Dallas this season, averaging 8.8 points and 9.2 assists.
Yet the Mavericks (29-15) didn't seem to skip a beat without him. Dallas won for the third time in four outings.
Third-year guard Jose Juan Barea started in Kidd's place and played effectively, finishing with 11 points, four assists and no turnovers. He and Beaubois combined for nine assists and five turnovers.
"J-Kidd has spent a lot of time mentoring [Beaubois] in certain situations," Carlisle said. "He stepped in tonight. He ran the team well. He defended. You can see his hard work has paid off."
The Knicks, coming off Friday's loss to Kobe Bryant and the Lakers, hung close early and trailed just 27-25 after one period. At that point, Jared Jeffries led the Knicks with 12 of his 14 points and Nowitzki, the Mavs' All-Star forward, had yet to score.
But the Mavs took control of the game by outscoring the Knicks 32-18 in the second quarter, when they made 5 of 9 3-pointers to seize a commanding 59-43 halftime lead.
"The more we shot, the better on defense we got," Marion said. "We were clicking on all cylinders. It's a great win."
At the half, Dallas was 8-for-13 (62 percent) from beyond the arc, with Terry and Beaubois each making 3 of 4.
The Knicks (17-26), by contrast, shot 1-for-11 (9 percent) from deep in the first half.
The Mavs then outscored the Knicks 38-13 in the third quarter, when they made 15 of 19 shots, including 3 of 4 from beyond the arc. Nowitzki scored 13 points in the period, going 5-for-6 with virtually no defense being played against him.
"They were very good," D'Antoni said. "They were much more athletic than we were today. They played harder. They shot the ball extremely well. You see why they're one of the top teams in the West."
The Knicks played without guard Nate Robinson (hamstring), who has been a valuable sparkplug off the bench averaging 12.6 points.
New York has lost four of five and dropped to 1-2 on its current five-game home-stand, with games remaining against Minnesota (Tuesday) and Toronto (Thursday).
"We're not gonna dwell on it. We got a game on Tuesday," D'Antoni said. "Tuesday we need to get a win and get back."
Notes: D'Antoni says center David Lee (11 points, 14 rebounds) deserves to make the All-Star Game as a reserve. "Without a doubt, without question," D'Antoni said of Lee, averaging 19.4 points, 11.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists. "He's played as well as anybody. His game is getting better all the time. He's not only a scorer. He's a play-maker. His assists are way up. He's added the outside shot and he's added the play-making abilities. He's more of a complete player. The only thing that's hurting him is we're not winning enough."
A memorandum of understanding, aimed to shore up Qatar's counter-terrorism efforts, was signed between the United States and the Gulf nation on Tuesday.
The agreement was signed during US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's visit to the energy-rich country.
His trip to the Gulf is an effort to end a rift between Qatar and four Arab states, namely Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
Senior Tillerson adviser RC Hammond said the deal outlines “future efforts Qatar can take to fortify its fight against terrorism and actively address terrorism funding issues.”
Tillerson also visited Kuwait on Monday and held talks with the country's ruling emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah, who has been acting as a mediator between Qatar and four states lined up against it.
Know more: Trump claims credit for Qatar's 'isolation'
It is pertinent to mention that US President Donald Trump, wading into a deep rift among Arab states, had said last month his trip to the Middle East was “already paying off”, as governments there took a hard new line in accusing Qatar of funding militant groups.
Trump's blunt remarks cast the anti-Islamist speech he gave at a Riyadh summit in May as the inspiration for a decision by Arab powers to sever ties and transport links to Qatar in protest at what they say is its support for terrorism.
“So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!” Trump said on Twitter.
The feud between the Arab states had erupted on June 5, when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic and travel links with Qatar, accusing it of courting regional foe Iran and sponsoring terrorist outfits.
Qatar denied the allegations.
The four countries later sent Doha a list of 13 demands, including closing the state-funded Al Jazeera television station and reducing ties to Iran, with a 10-day deadline.
Doha, however, said it was ready to discuss "legitimate issues" with Arab states to end the crisis but some demands were impossible to meet "because the underlying accusation was untrue".
"We cannot 'sever links with so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda and Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah' because no such links exist," their foreign minister had said.
"And we cannot 'expel any members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard' because there are none in Qatar."
“The response the four states got was overall negative and lacked any content. We find it did not provide a basis for Qatar to retreat from its policies,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said after the deadline expired.
“The political and economic boycott will continue until Qatar changes its policies for the better,” Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference.
The United States later said some demands on Qatar by its Middle East neighbours “will be very difficult to meet.”
Tillerson said in a statement that a list of demands from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates included major areas that “provide a basis for ongoing dialogue leading to a resolution.”
He also called for Qatar and the other Arab countries to “sit together” to work through the list.
Tillerson also called for a “lowering of rhetoric” to “help ease the tension.”
Kuwait, which retained ties with Qatar, is trying to mediate in the dispute with the support of the United States.
It has been a few weeks since Oracle CEO Larry Ellison publicly challenged Amazon Web Services (AWS), declaring that Oracle would be “price competitive” in the “commodity infrastructure as a service marketplace.” It's as laughable now as when Ellison first said it.
Oracle is an exceptional company. What it isn't is a low-margin, commodity business.
AWS Has Dropped Prices How Many Times?!?
By my count, AWS has dropped pricing 32 times. It's like one of those crazy “EVERYTHING MUST GO!” liquidation sales. Amazon tries to figure out just how low it can go on prices and eke out a razor-thin margin…and then it goes even lower.
This is not a one-time pricing gimmick, in other words. It's Amazon's business model.
Oracle, for its part, already started hedging its bets a few seconds after declaring that it would be price competitive:
It is not going to be just infrastructure as a service. Our intention is to sell our customers infrastructure as a service and the same customer a highly differentiated platform as a service will let us get better margins and highly differentiated suite of enterprise applications for the cloud.
So we are going to be cost competitive and price competitive at the infrastructure level while being highly differentiated at both the platform level and the application level. Already we have more enterprise SaaS applications than any other cloud services provider. We will continue to expand our footprint and use our size as an advantage.
In other words, Oracle's master plan is to give away the infrastructure as a loss-leader and make up for it by charging for high-margin, expensive software that runs on top. If that sounds exactly like its current business model, well, it is.
Oracle's New Business: Same As The Old Business
Oracle is intent to own the low-margin platform, rather than cede it to someone else. Back in late 2002, I attended the Enterprise Linux Forum, where Oracle presented its Linux strategy. As then Oracle vice president Rene Bonvanie described, Oracle's strategy was to make its high-price software seem cheaper by running it on Linux-based, commodity hardware.
To illustrate this, Bonvanie had a chart showing everything in the database stack—from hardware to the operating system—getting cheaper… except for Oracle.
Fast forward to 2014 and Oracle's strategy is pretty much the same, except this time it's the cloud that makes running Oracle cheaper. Also, rather than cede control of the underlying platform to someone else, as Oracle originally did with Linux, Oracle is now intent on owning its pricing destiny, at all levels of the stack.
Fitting A High-Margin Peg Into A Low-Margin Hole
It's unlikely to work.
As cloud expert Bernard Golden queries, “Who at at Oracle is going to be motivated to sell a commodity?” Answer? No one.
In fact, no one at Oracle has the experience or DNA to compete in a low-margin business. It's simply not what Oracle does—not even in supposed commodities like Linux.
Oracle, worried by Red Hat's dominance of Linux, eventually got into the game itself, releasing Oracle Unbreakable Linux and vowing to undercut Red Hat pricing. But as Golden goes on to suggest, Oracle has never delivered on this promise. Everything at Oracle, from its salesforce to its balance sheet, is structured to sell high-margin software.
Which means it will never be able to compete with Amazon, which is miles ahead in the IaaS market, and extending its lead every day, as cloud pundit Simon Wardley notes:
It's understandable that Oracle would want to avoid another Red Hat moment, but competing with a commodity platform by charging a little for the actual platform but a lot for everything else that runs on it is a recipe for failure against Amazon.
Old Dog, New Tricks
Still, you've got to feel for Oracle. Nestled in the heart of Silicon Valley, Oracle sees a generation of companies like Facebook that don't really need it anymore. As the world shifts to open-source infrastructure to tame Big Data and the cloud to run it all, Oracle risks getting left behind. But to compete in IaaS, Oracle will need to change how it operates, and how it thinks.
Other cloud providers have tried to beat Amazon with higher-margin, differentiated services, like improved security or better performance; so far, they haven't dented Amazon's momentum or market share. Oracle, with far more to lose from commodity pricing than anyone else, simply can't afford to be both Amazon and Oracle in its approach. The two mentalities simply don't mesh.
Lazing on a sunny afternoon, Easter Sunday to be precise, we decide to head back from the beach to our apartment in Corralejo, on the island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. Hey - even ESPN FC scribes are allowed a vacation and besides, it's freezing cold in northern Europe and wet and windy in northern Spain. Here, some sun is guaranteed.
On the outskirts of the town, the grand stadium Vicente Carreño Alonso (capacity 2,000) sits square and squat to the side of a large roundabout, corralled inside a low white wall and surrounded by brown desert scrub. There are six skinny sets of floodlights sticking up, needle-like, into the cloudless blue sky, and the fists of brown mountains shimmer behind in the hazy distance.
There is nothing better than casually investigating a Spanish football team, all the better for being stuck near a roundabout on the outskirts of a town with a population of 14,000, on an island better known for hordes of English and German tourists than for its footballing traditions. I know from Wikipedia that Club Deportivo Corralejo are in Tercera, Spain's third division, which is actually the fourth division - but more of that later.
I haul the car off the main road onto a dirt track that leads to the stadium's main green gate, closed today because there is no game on Easter Sunday in Group 12, the division in which the minor Canary Island clubs compete. After Tenerife, Fuerteventura is the second biggest island in the archipelago, 100 km off the west coast of Africa, but its snoozy, tranquil feel makes you wonder whether human habitation was ever really intended to take root.
The stadium walls sizzle in the afternoon heat. My son climbs onto an electricity hut to take some shots of the pitch over the height of the walls. As we walk back to the car, a sporty-looking 40-something chap pitches up in a loud yellow football bib and begins to open the green gate with a key. I wander over and ask if we can go in to take some shots. The man has a striking, weather-beaten face, with long hair and a noble jawline. He seems overwhelmed by our request and ushers us eagerly over the threshold. Once inside, the green expanse of the pitch is blindingly colourful compared to the dusty dun exterior.
We walk out onto the pitch. The man's name is Jorge, and I ask him if he is an ex-player. He laughs. "I wish I were! I'm the groundsman. I look after the place, make sure everything's OK. But that's not too difficult," he says, gesturing at the artificial surface. "Much easier for maintenance. But I like to come here in the afternoons, run around the perimeter a bit, kick a ball around for a while. Keeps me going, you know."
As if on cue, a ball is already on the pitch, about 30 metres from the goal. My son Harry, starved of one for the last few days, shakes off his flip-flops, jogs up and hits the ball barefoot. He doesn't catch it quite right, but the ball still arrows up into one corner, and nestles nicely into the net. Jorge approves. "He's good," he coos. "You can tell by the way someone approaches a ball. I used to do some scouting," he continues, as Harry fishes the ball from the net. "The problem here is that nobody really stays. Why would kids want to come and watch this club or even play for us? There's no future in it. The best ones all go to the mainland."
He changes tack. "Hey - you're not Spanish are you? You speak well. Your son speaks even better!" I explain that we live in San Sebastián, and that Harry was born there. "Ah - they say that's a nice place," he replies, with a slight note of lament in his voice. "Ha - I'm Spanish, and I've never been to Spain!" he laughs. "I've never been on the mainland. No call for it. We have everything here now. My parents suffered - no electricity, not much running water, but now we have everything, apart from good football."
This is not entirely true. Corralejo were founded in 1975 but, after a series of fusions, have ended up as the present side, and in their first season in Tercera, in 2009-10, they finished top, only to lose out in the play-offs to a Catalan side. Down the road in the capital, Puerto del Rosario, the team is in Regional Preferente, a ladder further down.
A relative metropolis of 34,000 people, the town produced Braulio Nóbrega, who now plies his trade for Hercules, but who scored the famous back-heel for Getafe against Spurs in London in 2007. Subsequently transferred to Zaragoza, his career almost fell apart in 2011 when he was arrested on charges of sexual assault.
Jonathan Sesma, once of Valladolid, was a native of Las Palmas but is the only vaguely famous player to have turned out for Corralejo, back in the 1997-98 season.
Jorge doesn't seem to recall this, but begins to wax eloquently on the topic of Canary players in general. "Valeron, Silva, Pedrito, Ruben Castro - they're all the same types. They don't use speed or strength. It's too hot for that here. They had to use their brains. It made them think better than other players. Look at Valeron. He's still going. Que bueno es (he's fantastic)!"
He forgets to mention Valeron's team-mate Manuel Pablo - also a son of Gran Canaria, the island that, along with Tenerife, seems to have produced the most players. Pedro and Jeffren both moved to La Masia from the latter, and the Canary scene in general has proved a good breeding ground for intelligent players. Jorge's theory may be correct. At a distance, Harry plays competent keepie-ups in his bare feet, and Jorge asks what position he plays. When I tell him he's a central midfielder with Real Sociedad's feeder club, he says: "We need one like him here. Bring him over here for next season. We'll look after him!"
Tercera is a complex labyrinth of a league structure, and is really the fourth tier after La Liga, Segunda A and Segunda B. Several of the professional reserve sides cut the teeth of their young players there, but the grand majority of teams are part-time. Some teams pay their players a nominal match fee, some pay win bonuses only and some pay nothing at all.
I ask Jorge how they cope in Group 12, when they have play on the other islands. "Yes, it's expensive. We can go by boat to Lanzarote, but to the other places we have to fly. We cut deals, but it's still too much. The worst thing is" - he shakes his head at the injustice - "the worst thing is that when we got to the play-offs, there were people at the club who didn't want us to go up to Segunda B, for that reason." He rubs together his middle finger and his thumb in the Spanish gesture for money.
There are 18 groups in Tercera, making up a morass of 361 teams. The groups almost tally with the country's 17 autonomous communities, but the sheer size of Andalucia means there are two groups there, which explains the slight discrepancy. The 18 group winners play a two-legged play-off series, with the nine winners promoted to Segunda B, which itself contains four groups of 80 teams. All of that means it's difficult to make comparisons with the fourth level of say, English football, where the 24 teams are all professional and usually represent larger urban centres. Nevertheless, Corralejo are technically a mere three consecutive promotions away from the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona. It seems strange to contemplate this on a sunny afternoon in a tiny, deserted stadium.
The night before, we'd driven into town and sought out some distant Spanish football, apologetically chalked onto the viewing list of a bevy of English-style pubs offering a mix of English Premier League, Celtic and Rangers fixtures, and the occasional rugby union game.
In the gloomy cavern of a pub, each corner seemed to have a different screen and game being played, and the cacophony of mixed ESPN and Al Jazeera commentaries blended into a sort of incomprehensible mass. The English owner seemed happy that we wanted to watch Zaragoza-Madrid, but failed to tempt us with further offers of fish, chips and mushy peas. We left in the 80th minute, since my beer had run out and I didn't fancy another one, and we were fairly convinced that it was going to end in a draw.
Indeed it did, the 1-1 scoreline denying Madrid any false optimism about cutting into Barcelona's lead after the Catalans' 2-2 draw at strugglers Celta an hour earlier. The games' chief interest - apart from Leo Messi's 19th consecutive scoring appearance - resided in their role as warm-ups for this week's Champions League action, with the opposition relegated to the roles of mere sparring partners.
Of course, neither Celta nor Zaragoza could afford to drop points, since their reality is very different from planet Barcelona-Madrid and, although both will be pleased at avoiding defeat, Deportivo's 3-2 win at fellow strugglers Mallorca means it's getting a bit tighter down there at the bottom. Canary-born veteran Juan Carlos Valeron played 88 sublime minutes at the ripe old age of 37, and Manuel Pablo, of the same vintage, managed to last the whole game.
Last week, Pedro scored the goal that gave Spain their vital 1-0 win in Paris, and David Silva scored for Manchester City in their home win over Newcastle. The Canary Islands continue to wield their influence. And, of course, next Sunday tiny Corralejo (population 14,000) take on Union Deportivo Telde from Gran Canaria (population 90,000) in a mid-table clash in Spain's colourful and obscure Division Three, Group 12.
I'll be back in San Sebastián, but Jorge will be there, and perhaps another 500 hardy souls, baking in the sun on the open terracing. It's always worth remembering that - without these games, these places, and folks like Jorge - the professional game would collapse in on itself and cease to exist in its present form. That's why I always stop and have a nosey, to remember the roots. Sometimes, the fruit at the top of the tree gets a bit too heavy.
If you only use one essential oil, this is it!
Lavender (lavandula angustifolia) is the most versatile of all essential oils. Most commonly known for its relaxing effects on the body, therapeutic-grade lavender has been highly regarded for the skin. It may be used to cleanse cuts, bruises and skin irritations. The fragrance is calming, relaxing and balancing – physically and emotionally. Carrying a bottle of lavender around with you is like having your own personal first aid kit, perfume and pick-me-up.
Here are 13 ways you can incorporate lavender in to your daily life:
1. Calming
Rub 2-3 drops of lavender oil in your cupped palms, then use the inhalation method to draw the scent all the way into your amygdala gland (the emotional warehouse) in your brain to calm the mind. Then, rub on the feet, temples, wrists (or anywhere) for an immediate calming effect on the body. Great for use in crowded areas like planes or subways to carve out your own personal oasis.
2. Sleep aid
Again, use the cupping and inhalation method. Then, rub a drop of Lavender oil on your palms and smooth on your pillow to help you sleep.
3. Bee sting / Insect bite
Put a drop of Lavender oil on a bee sting or insect bite to stop itching reduce swelling.
4. Minor burn
Put 2-3 drops Lavender oil on a minor burn to decrease pain. I recently did this after I spilled scorching hot tea on my hand at Starbucks and luckily had my lavender with me. Result: NO redness, swelling or pain. NO sign of any burn. Lavender works wonders!
5. Cuts
Drop Lavender oil on cut to stop bleeding, clean wound, and kill bacteria.
6. Eczema / Dermatitis
Mix several drops of Lavender oil with a nut or vegetable mixing oil (coconut, sesame, etc) and use topically on eczema and dermatitis. I have a dear friend who suffers from severe eczema and swears by this.
7. Nausea or motion sickness
To alleviate the symptoms of motion sickness, place a drop of Lavender oil on end of tongue, behind the ears or around the navel.
8. Nosebleed
To stop a nosebleed, put a drop of lavender oil on a tissue and wrap it around a small chip of ice. Push the tissue covered ice chip up under the middle of the top lip to the base of the nose and hold as long as comfortable or until the bleeding stops (do not freeze the lip or gum).
9. Dry or chapped skin
Rub lavender oil on dry or chapped skin.
10. Chapped or sunburned lips
Rub a drop of lavender oil on chapped or sunburned lips.
11. Hay fever.
Rub a drop of lavender oil between your palms and inhale deeply to help alleviate the symptoms of hay fever.
12. Dandruff.
Rub several drops of lavender oil into the scalp to help eliminate dandruff.
13. Cold sores.
Put a drop of lavender oil on a cold sore.
***BONUS: Flavor booster!
Add a few drops of lavender to any recipe you want to enhance. Favorites: add to your water or tea (especially sparkling!), brownies, bars, cookies, dessert recipes, raw chocolate or salad dressings. Enjoy!
As you can see, Lavender is an essential oil (get organic lavender oil here if you don't have it yet) that can uplift your life (and mood), heal and entice in a variety of ways. It's a great secret weapon to have on hand at all times!
Core Data programming is hard. Apple warns as much in their document Core Data Core Competencies, "Important: Core Data is an advanced technology that is not required for creating simple applications". That doesn't sound so severe perhaps but it does contrast greatly with the rest of the developer documentation that seems to suggest that iOS/OSX programming is made easy by all the frameworks and widgets ready for us to customise and use in our applications.
Compared to many other Apple frameworks, Core Data seems to be considerably less developer-friendly. Compare it then to the elegance of the RubyMotion framework and the constrast becomes more stark. How are we to define our models, relationships and migrations without the tools that Xcode provides?
In this book we set out exactly how you can create Core Data-powered apps using RubyMotion that are ready for the app store, including preparing for the future by learning the ins and outs of schema and data migrations. Below is an outline of the topics we cover:

If it seems like things are moving pretty quickly with this sequel, there's a reason for that: not only is the film set for release in 2016, but it has already started filming and there are still holes to fill in the cast. It is for this reason that we have seen so much casting news over the past few weeks. Here's a rundown of the new casting decisions that have been made recently.
If you can believe it, there is even more to come, as we have yet to see who will be playing Bebop or Rocksteady, both of whom have been confirmed for this movie. There are some speculations as to who might be cast in at least one of these roles, but no official word as of yet. That being said, of those who have been recently cast, they are already starting to show up on set for principal photography and even a few action scenes.
As we revealed earlier, Stephen Amell has already shown up on set alongside Megan Fox as April O'Neil. We don't know whether or not this scene is a good representation of what to expect from his look during the whole movie, but even if it is, it's fair to say that he looks enough like Casey Jones to pull off the role.
We've also seen Megan Fox wearing a blonde wig and glasses, presumably as an undercover disguise, but we don't know whether or not this has anything to do with the foot. For all we know, these undercover photos could be part of a simple story she is doing for her job. By the way, does anyone else get that Michelle Pfeiffer vibe (a la Batman Returns) from her when she's wearing that costume?
As noted in a previous article, Megan Fox was seen running from the foot clan while holding a canister of purple ooze. Being that the original mutagen in the first film was green, fan speculation has it that this could be retromutagen, which would fit in pretty well with the story of the Ninja Turtles.
In addition to the photos of April and Casey, recent leaked pictures reveal our first look at Tyler Perry as Baxter Stockman. To be honest, I think this might be some of the best casting yet, as Perry looks so much like the Stockman we knew from the original comics that it's almost eerie. He's even got that nerdy scientist thing going for him, which is always nice for a role like this.
As if that weren't enough, there were also photos of the chairs being used on set. If you recall the controversy over the title for the first film, these pictures will probably seem somewhat familiar. Although there are some people saying that the film will be titled “Half Shell,” the on-set pictures of these chairs reveal the title “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II.” My suspicion is that we won't know the official title for the film until we start to see posters and trailers, which is pretty much the same thing that happened with the first movie.
Whatever the case may be, these on set photos of both new and old cast members are pretty revealing. What do you think? Does Tyler Perry fit the role of Baxter Stockman? Will Stephen Amell make a good Casey Jones? Is the title really going to be Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!
Cannabis is still the one medicine doctors can't use
Vices By Reilly Capps
There's one medicine doctors are not allowed to use, at least not on themselves — cannabis. If they do, they risk losing their right to practice medicine.
This was the case with Denver's Paul Bregman, who lost his medical license after admitting to the state government that he was using cannabis to treat his bipolar type II.
To this day, any doctor who admits to being a medical marijuana patient risks the same loss of livelihood, since many states prohibit any doctor from using cannabis "habitually."
"You cannot have a medical card and an active medical license," Bregman says. All those pot doc shops you see? The docs inside probably aren't medical cannabis users themselves.
Bregman's story brings up a basic question: is cannabis a medicine, or isn't it? If it isn't a medicine, why can doctors recommend it? If it is a medicine, why can't doctors use it?
Bregman is a bald, glasses-wearing guy with a talkative, outgoing demeanor, chatting up servers in restaurants and bad mouthing some recent film he thinks is overrated. Cannabis lets him be this active and outgoing, he says — otherwise he'd be on the floor. "Cannabis is my other people's prozac," he says. "For me, it's malpractice for doctors not to use cannabis."
His story is a common one in the cannabis world, a world of unexpected medical benefits. Bregman worked as a radiologist at Denver's county hospital from 1988 to 1995, before depression forced him to retire. After that, he spent a horrible decade thinking about suicide half the time, and, every winter for six years, getting electrodes hooked up to his skull for electroshock therapy. Bregman tried dozens of medicines, from lithium to seroquel to prozac to abilify. All of this helped somewhat, but he was still depressed and thinking of suicide.
Bregman says he first tried cannabis for his bipolar in 2005, and it "changed my life." He's not anti pills; Bregman still uses depakote and valium, pharmaceutical drugs, to manage his mood. "Everybody needs a cocktail of medicines, and also add on structure and exercise and therapy," Bregman says. "Cannabis should be right up there with the other ones." If he had known about cannabis earlier, he says, he would not have have had spent a decade in mental hell, and he would have been productive.
Medical boards, which regulate whether doctors can practice, don't see cannabis as a medicine for doctors, they see it as a vice. And there's no sign they're changing their tune. Just last year, the national organization that advises state medical boards included marijuana on the list of substances that impair ability, and call for disciplinary action. So now doctors using cannabis "habitually" fall under the same "unprofessional or dishonorable" category as doctors who, for example, have sex with their patients or milk dying people out of money by claiming an incurable illness can be cured.
This isn't just a Colorado thing. In 2007, agents from California's medical board walked into the Los Angeles clinic of Dr. Allan Frankel, who was using an ounce of marijuana a month for back pain, and said they were investigating him. They eventually let him keep his license after they worked out an agreement. A call to Dr. Frankel's office has not been returned as of press time.
“The practice of medicine is fundamentally the practice of good judgement," emails Anisha Gianchandani, spokesperson for anti-pot group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, and "statistics show marijuana use linked with impaired memory and attention."
Doctors who are using cannabis are doing so under the radar, perhaps scared by stories like Bregman's. When Bregman told the state in 2011 that he was using cannabis successfully for his problems, with the approval of his psychiatrist, he assumed they would be supportive that he had found something that worked. They weren't. After a 3 year fight over his license, it's now inactive. He says he's angry that the board made him choose between being a doctor and using the medicine that works for him.
"Instead of helping me, they would have rather seen me suffer and, ultimately, commit suicide," Bregman says.
These days, Bregman is doing well. Even if the official medical world hasn't changed its tone on cannabis, the wider world has. And so, Bregman is working as a consultant at Medical Cannabis Consulting, advising the thriving new marijuana industry about how to use a drug that helped him so much — and ultimately cost him his career.
A call to the Colorado Medical Board to discuss the issue of doctors using pot has also gone unreturned.
Appearing on Fox News Sunday this week, National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre was pressed about the controversial ad the group created in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre that referenced the armed protection President Obama's daughters receive.
Even as host Chris Wallace belittled as "ridiculous" the ad's premise that all children deserve the same kind of protection that the president's children have, LaPierre defends the ad and said, "Tell that to the people of Newtown."
"So they should have Secret Service"? Wallace asked.
In response, LaPierre propagated a favorite falsehood of the pro-gun media lobby [emphasis added]:
LAPIERRE: No, but what they should have is police officers or certified armed security in those schools to keep people safe. If something happens, the police time -- despite all their good intentions, is 15 to 20 minutes. It's too long. It's not going to help those kids.
In the wake of the Newtown shooting, LaPierre bemoaned the fact kids aren't safe at school, in part because it takes police 15 to 20 minutes to respond to a deadly shooting like the one in Connecticut.
But that's not true and it's time the news media start calling out anti-gun control extremists like LaPierre and Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, among others, who keep peddling the obvious falsehood in the press.
Fact: The Newtown police station is located approximately two miles from the Sandy Hook Elementary School. There's no way it would have taken law enforcement 20 minutes to respond to the first 911 calls reporting gunfire at the school. (Local cops could have run from the station and been at the school in less than 20 minutes.)
Fast-acting Newtown officers "made it in under three minutes, arriving in the parking lot while gunfire could still be heard," according to New York Times interviews with the first responders that day.
But if you listen to LaPierre as well as other anti-gun control advocates who are making the media rounds, you're led to believe gunman Adam Lanza roamed the hallways of Sandy Hook for nearly half an hour, killing people at will before law enforcement finally arrived; that terrified teachers and students were "waiting 20 minutes for the cops to show up," as one pro-gun blogger claimed.
It's not true. The claim is pure gun lobby propaganda.
The frightening specter of defenselessness is projected to boost the NRA's claim that the only way to combat gun violence in school is not to control the sale and distribution of guns, but to put armed policemen in 98,000 schools in America. Other gun advocates use the phony 20-minute premise to bolster calls for allowing concealed weapons in schools.
Since the December 14 massacre, the 20-minute myth has been widely repeated among right-wing media outlets.
• "It took the police 20 minutes to arrive at Sandy Hook. By the time they got there, it was over. [National Review Online]
• "In the short run, stopping the next Sandy Hook means ending the deadly policy which gave the killer 20 minutes (until people with guns, the police, finally arrived) to fire 150 shots and repeatedly change magazines, murdering at leisure." [Volokh.com]
Unfortunately, the 20-minute myth got an early boost from CNN.com, which posted an inaccurate timeline of the school massacre. CNN's faulty claim that first responders arrived at Sandy Hook "about twenty minutes after the first" 911 calls was quickly embraced by right-wing bloggers who mocked the police's slow response time.
But that single, erroneous report certainly can't justify the continued misuse of the 20-minute myth, since the vast majority of Newtown reports got the facts right. Contrary to CNN timeline, it was widely reported last December that police and first responders arrived at the Newtown crime scene "instantaneously," "within minutes" of the first 911 call, and "minutes after the assassin began his rampage."
And two days after the shooting rampage, audio from Newtown police scanners was made public. It confirmed that officers were reporting back from the school just a few minutes after the first school calls came into the dispatcher that day.
Still, the 20-minute myth serves a political purpose, so people like factually challenged gun extremist Larry Pratt have used the concocted claim repeatedly in the media:
• "The solution is for people to be able to defend themselves at the point of the crime and not wait for 20 minutes for the police come after everybody is dead." [Dec. 18, CNN]
• "And Newtown was the same, a school where nobody was able to have a gun, even if they had a concealed carry permit, which you can get in Connecticut. Nobody was able to shoot back. They had to wait some 20 minutes for the police to get there. That's unacceptable." [Dec. 28, Fox]
• "Especially if you're telling the potential victim you can't be armed. You have to wait for the Cavalry to get here five, 10 or in the case of Newtown 20 minutes later. I find that unconscionable." [Jan. 12, CNN]
• "Well, the armed teacher is going to have a lot more chance stopping a mass murderer than the police who take 20 minutes to get there, as they did in Newtown, and that's not an extraordinarily long response time." [Jan. 17, Australia Broadcasting Corporation]
Pratt's sinister assertion is pure fabrication. If gun advocates continue to peddle the lie, it's up to journalists to call them on it. The falsehood purposefully hinders attempts to debate the pressing issue of gun violence, and serves an insult to the Newtown police officers on duty that dark day in December.

The Federal Reserve took extraordinary actions Tuesday to revive the feeble U.S. economy. USA TODAY reporters Sue Kirchhoff and John Waggoner answer questions about the Fed's moves: Q: What's the good news in the Fed's actions? IN WASHINGTON: Fed cuts interest rates to near zero A: The Fed's decision to nudge its key fed funds rate to a range of zero to 0.25% — along with its plans to buy securities that are backed by mortgages — should mean lower consumer interest rates, particularly mortgage rates. Low mortgage rates mean that more people can afford to buy houses, which will help revive the moribund housing market. A drop in mortgage rates will also allow homeowners to refinance their loans at lower rates, easing some of the burdens of their debts. Low rates also make it cheaper for companies to borrow and expand. That, in turn, is a powerful economic stimulus. Most major banks, including Bank of America and Wachovia, lowered their prime lending rate to 3.25% from 4% Tuesday. The Fed also signaled that it is willing to try other things to stimulate the economy, including buying Treasury securities. "They're saying, 'We're going to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes,' " says John Silvia, chief economist for Wachovia. Q: What's the bad news? A: The Fed wouldn't lower rates this far and signal its willingness to take a host of unconventional actions if the economic situation weren't so dire. The nation is entering the 13th month of a recession, and the unemployment rate hit 6.7% in November, up from 4.7% a year earlier. The Fed is worried about an extremely severe recession and the outlying possibility of deflation — a persistent decline in prices. In a deflationary period, the value of assets falls, but debt payments become more onerous. At this point, deflation is not a major concern. But the Fed is monitoring conditions. Q: Aren't such low rates and policies inflationary? A: In theory, they can be. But at the moment, inflation is deader than King Tut. The government's consumer price index fell 1.7% in November, the second-consecutive record decrease. Q: Will lower rates hurt the U.S. dollar? A: They did on Tuesday: The dollar weakened against the euro and Japan's yen. Should those countries lower their interest rates, however, the dollar would likely rebound. Money typically flows to the currencies with the highest interest rates and the greatest safety. Q: The Fed has never targeted an interest rate range before. Why now? A: More as a practical matter than anything else. A zero-percent interest rate is hard to achieve. The range gives them a small margin of error. Further, as the Fed has dramatically expanded lending to financial firms and its balance sheet, it has also become harder to manage the funds rate. Q: Does the Fed have a target in mind for mortgage rates? A: No, but there's little doubt that the Fed would like lower mortgage rates, which is why the Fed is considering buying mortgage-backed securities. If banks can sell their mortgage loans to investors — including the Fed — they will have more money to make new mortgages. A senior Fed official, who would not speak for attribution, told reporters Tuesday that it could be self-defeating for the Fed to set a target for mortgage rates. Instead, the Fed will monitor housing and economic developments to determine future actions. Q: What does this mean for savers? A: Lower returns. Rates on bank CDs and money market mutual funds closely follow the fed funds rate. Money funds, which invest in short-term, interest-bearing securities and distribute the income to investors, might be particularly squeezed. The average taxable money fund aimed at individual investors charges 0.86% a year in expenses. Three-month Treasury bills yield 0.03%. Q: What is the Fed trying to do? A: The Fed is pulling out all the stops to revive business and consumer lending and get the economy moving. The central bank is particularly focused on the wide difference, or spread, on interest rates between supersafe Treasury bills, for example, and market-based loans for autos, homes and other purchases. Fed officials think the wide spreads are due to a lack of liquidity, as lenders pull back. They hope that by flooding markets with cash, using such strategies as buying mortgage-backed bonds, they can bring interest rates down and relieve such pressures. The Fed has so far confined its programs to making loans by using high-grade securities as collateral. It could consider dipping into some riskier markets going forward, but only with backing from the Treasury Department to absorb some losses.

"I think by being truthful and transparent as he has every single day," Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of how the president would address uneasiness on Capitol Hill. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo Sanders: ‘Congress' inability to get things passed' hurting Trump's agenda
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday an "inability to get things passed" in Congress is the main impediment to President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, not distrust of the White House among Republican lawmakers.
Sanders was asked about comments made Tuesday morning by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on NBC's “Today” show that called the credibility of the White House into question.
Story Continued Below
"I think what's hurting the legislative agenda is Congress' inability to get things passed," Sanders said in response.
Graham had referred to a Washington Post report that said Trump had dictated a misleading statement issued in July on behalf of his son regarding a meeting last year with a Russian lawyer. Trump's attorney had previously said the president was not involved in crafting the statement. Graham pointed to the difficulty in working with the White House on legislation, saying when "you get caught in a lie about one thing, it makes it harder to say we'll just let the other stuff go."
In a follow-up, Sanders was asked how Trump would address a lack of trust on Capitol Hill.
"I think by being truthful and transparent as he has every single day," Sanders responded before moving on.
Former executives of a chemical company responsible for a January spill that triggered a ban on drinking water for 300,000 West Virginia residents have been indicted on pollution charges.
The indictment unsealed Wednesday charged ex-Freedom Industries presidents Gary Southern and Dennis P. Farrell and two others with failing to ensure that the company operated the steel storage tank that leaked the coal-cleaning chemical in a reasonable and environmentally sound manner.
Southern also faces federal fraud charges related to the company's bankruptcy case. Freedom filed for bankruptcy eight days after the Jan. 9 spill of the chemicals into the Elk River in Charleston. West Virginia American Water uses the river for its water supply a mile and a half downstream.
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that the tank conditions at Freedom Industries "were not only grievously unacceptable, but unlawful. They put an entire population needlessly at risk. As these actions make clear, such conduct cannot, and will not, be tolerated."
The others charged are William E. Tis and Charles E. Herzing, who along with Farrell owned Freedom until December 2013. They sold it to Pennsylvania-based Chemstream Holdings for $20 million, after which Southern became president.
Farrell, 58, served as Freedom's president from October 2001 until the sale, after which he continued to work at the terminal in a management role.
Herzing, 63, also was Freedom's vice president and Tis, 60, served as secretary.
All four, along with Freedom Industries, were indicted for alleged violations of the federal Clean Water Act.
In addition, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said Freedom environmental consultant Robert J. Reynolds and tank farm plant manager Michael E. Burdette were charged in federal information with Clean Water Act violations. Federal information typically signals a defendant's willingness to cooperate in the investigation.
"It's hard to overstate the disruption that results when 300,000 people suddenly lose clean water," Goodwin said in a statement. "This is exactly the kind of scenario that the Clean Water Act is designed to prevent.
"This spill, which was completely preventable, happened to take place in this district, but it could have happened anywhere. If we don't want it to happen again, we need to make it crystal clear that those who engage in the kind of criminal behavior that led to this crisis will be held accountable."
During their time as Freedom corporate officers, Farrell, Tis, Herzing and Southern "approved funding only for those projects that would result in increased business revenue for Freedom or that were necessary to make immediate repairs to equipment that was broken or about to break," the indictment said.
The men ignored or failed to fund other projects to repair, maintain and improve equipment and systems needed for compliance with environmental regulations, including addressing drainage problems in the containment area.
Southern's attorney, Robert Allen, didn't immediately return a message left at his office Wednesday.
More than a dozen aboveground storage tanks at the facility were removed. The World War II-era tank that leaked had two holes, just a few millimeters each, and had subpar last-resort containment walls.
The federal Chemical Safety Board is conducting its own investigation.
According to health officials, after the spill, more than 400 people were treated at hospitals for symptoms that patients said came from exposure to the chemical, known as MCHM.
Southern, 53, was arrested last week, accused in a criminal complaint of lying about his role with the company in bankruptcy court hearings and meetings to protect his personal wealth of nearly $8 million from lawsuits.
If convicted of all charges, Southern faces up to 68 years in prison.

Risks and challenges
There are many challenges and difficulties in making video games. Video games are costly to make due to the time and effort needed to make them and a number of assets used.
For a small studio like ours, the biggest difficulty lies in the fact that since we are not as big or as established as AAA studios or even most Indie studios that we can't command the power of publishers and huge marketing campaigns, which is why we came to Kickstarter to ask for your help!
Also, we can't make huge games in the fashion that AAA studios do and we have to be extra creative and witty to solve our problems.
Our strength also happens to lie in our size, since we are a small team costs are relatively low and if we need to ever take a directional change in production it is a lot easier for us to do so (think about how much easier it is to turn a small boat compared to something like an oil tanker.)
Another advantage we have is that we own our offices and all our equipment so our only costs are everyday running costs like electricity, food, and water. We have also been operating as a business for more than a year, therefore chances of bankruptcy and is closing shop are very low.
Sapphire Dragon Productions has a proven track record in producing Visual Novels and Adventure games. We have continued to deliver title after the other when promised. We also have experience and expertise fulfilling and supplying customer physical orders through other businesses.
The team comes from a very mixed professional background and that is our greatest strength as we are bringing so much from so many different industries (IT, software engineering, music industry, the advertising industry, live events) that we make a truly unique team with a vast body of knowledge.
A California man, in the midst of a domestic dispute on Christmas Eve, allegedly threatened to 'eat' his roommate and then killed her small dog.
Alan Evans, 35, of Santa Rosa, was arrested Tuesday evening on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, battery, terrorist threats and cruelty to an animal.
According to the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office, deputies were dispatched to Evans' home after his female roommate called to report an alleged assault.
When deputies arrived the victim, who has not been identified, told the officers Evans had been talking incoherently before he attacked her. She said he pulled her hair and slapped her before grabbing a kitchen knife and threatening to "eat her," police said.
The victim fled to a neighbor's house before calling police and reporting the attack, which she said was unprovoked, according to the sheriff's office.
Deputies found Evans in his living room and took him into custody without incident. At the time of the arrest, officers allegedly observed blood on Evans' hands and clothing, prompting them to search the area for additional victims.
During a search conducted outside the residence, deputies found the body of a small Terrier dog under Evan's vehicle. The pet, which belonged to the alleged victim, had been stabbed to death by Evans, police said.
Evans was booked into the Sonoma County Jail, where he remains on a $250,000 bond. Jail records do not indicate whether he has an attorney.

Automagicly detects and runs experiments that have science available, when they are available. (Even those special biomes around KSC.)
Automagicly collects the data from those experiments into a science container (command pod).
Automagicly resets experiments that are "run once", when you have a scientist onboard. (mystery goo, sci jrs)
What it does not do:
Give you science you could haven't gotten otherwise.
Run experiments that do not implement the stock science modules.
Run "run once" experiments without a scientist on board.
How to Use:
The Green FS toolbar icon means it is running.
The Red FS toolbar icon means it is not running.
No toolbar icon means you have no containers onboard, (And that it is not runnning).

Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton arrive at the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2017 in Washington, D.C., for the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. (Getty Images)
Why did Trump win — and Clinton lose — the 2016 U.S. presidential election? That's been debated widely, to understate the case. Nominees include each campaign's ground game , messaging , FBI Director James B. Comey's last-minute letter to Congress , and defections from the “Obama coalition . ”
Here, we offer new data to show that shifts in which racial groups went to the polls may have made the difference.
Using data from the voter file vendor Catalist and information from the U.S. Census Bureau, we examine the change in turnout rates for different racial/ethnic groups between 2012 and 2016. Black turnout declined dramatically; white turnout increased noticeably; and Latino and Asian American turnout went up even more. In the key swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, those shifts were especially strong. How strong? Without those shifts in turnout from various racial and ethnic groups, these pivotal states might have gone not to Trump but to Clinton — giving Clinton an electoral college victory.
How we did our research
It is surprisingly difficult to estimate levels of voter turnout by race. Unlike the forthcoming report from the Current Population Survey, Catalist's estimates are based not on self reports but on actual turnout records. Since most states do not ask voters about their racial/ethnic background, Catalist usually estimates this information from the voter's name and neighborhood.
According to recent research, Catalist correctly predicts race/ethnicity about 91 percent of the time. Further, we use Catalist's estimates of voter race for both 2012 and 2016. If Catalist's estimates are wrong, they're likely wrong in a consistent way — and so any differences we find in the electorate's racial composition are accurate.
The denominator we use to calculate turnout rates is an estimate of the citizen voting-age population (CVAP) by race in November 2012 and November 2016, respectively. To construct this estimate, we use the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program data to calculate the voting-age population in each state by race, and then use American Communities Survey information on citizenship rates to remove the (often substantial) noncitizen population for each racial/ethnic group.
How voter turnout by race changed between 2012 and 2016
Nationally, turnout rates for these racial/ethnic groups changed noticeably from 2012 to 2016, as you can see in the figure below.
Voter turnout among whites — the racial/ethnic group most strongly in Trump's corner — increased by 2.4 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2012. In stark contrast, turnout among African Americans — the group most loyal to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party — fell by 4.7 percentage points nationally. Latinos and Asian Americans, both groups that are generally Clinton supporters, were more likely to vote — by 3.8 and 3.0 percentage points, respectively.
These national averages obscure important patterns. Here's what stands out: while the decline in black turnout was stark across the board, it was sharpest, on average, in the states that determined the outcome of the election. Black turnout fell by 4.3 percentage points in non-battleground states in 2016 compared to 2012. But it fell by 5.3 percentage points in states where the election was decided by a margin of less than 10 points.
Given how important African Americans are to the Democratic coalition, the swing-state collapse of black turnout seriously hurt Clinton.
Let's take an even closer look at particular states. The figures below show state where at least 3 percent of the population was African American or Latino, and shows the changes in African American and Latino voter turnout rates between 2012 and 2016.
As you can see, the national average hides dramatic differences among states. For example, as we've said, the African American turnout rate fell by 4.7 points nationally. But in Michigan and Wisconsin — two key Midwestern states where, to analysts' surprise, Trump won — black turnout fell by more than 12 points.
Similarly, overall white turnout increased by only 2.5 points nationally. But in several states it surged by more than 5 points. In the critical battleground state of Florida, white voter turnout jumped by 4 points — and black turnout fell by 4 points. Trump won Florida by a margin of just 1.2 points.
At the same time, Latino voter turnout jumped especially in Connecticut, Florida and Illinois. Nationally, as noted above, the increase was 3.8 points. But in Florida it went up 5.4 points — which may suggest the Clinton campaign did effectively mobilize Latino voters there.
Just as notably, in Texas the Latino turnout rate was up by 4.9 points, a state never expected to be close. But Trump won Texas by only nine points, a dramatic drop from Romney's 16 point victory in 2012. And Arizona's 2.7-point increase in Latino turnout helps to explain why Trump won that state by only 4.5 points, half of Romney's 9 point margin in 2012.
Were these changes in voter turnout enough to decide the race?
To find out, we used the Cooperative Congressional Election Study to estimate the 2016 presidential vote choices of whites, African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans in each state. Then we set the turnout rates of each of these groups to their 2012 level, while keeping everything else as it was in 2016. You can see the results in the figure below.
But if groups had gone to the polls at the same rates as in 2012, Clinton would likely have won Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin in 2016 — though in the last two cases by razor-thin margins.
If we changed nothing but the turnout rates of various racial and ethnic groups, in Michigan, the actual Clinton loss by .2 percentage points would have become a victory by 1.5 percentage points. Clinton's actual loss by 0.7 percentage points in Pennsylvania would have been a 0.5 percent victory. And instead of Trump winning Wisconsin by 0.8 points, Clinton would have won by 0.1 percent. Clinton's electoral college total would have been 278 votes, putting her in the White House.
Of course, these measures are estimates and subject to error. Interpret cautiously. But what's clear is that the jump in white turnout in key swing states and drop in black turnout may well have handed the presidency to Trump.

For at least the last five centuries, people from the region near the Qinling Mountains in central China went into Dayu Cave to retrieve water and pray. Some of them marked their visits with graffiti—bold black text against the yellow-brown walls—that recorded the droughts that sent them to the cave's Dragon Lake. Now scientists have matched those chronicles with chemical data compiled from the cave itself and found evidence that more hard times could be ahead.
Liangcheng Tan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered the inscriptions by accident in 2009 when he and his colleagues visited the cave to collect samples of mineral deposits called speleothems. Graffiti on the walls recorded at least 70 visits to the cave by locals. Seven inscriptions were special, though, and noted events tied to droughts in the 1500s, 1700s and 1800s. For instance, one reads: “On June 8, 46th year of the Emperor Kangxi period, Qing Dynasty [or July 7, 1707 on the Western calendar], the governor of Ningqiang district came to the cave to pray for rain.”
Humans around the world have marked their visits to caves with graffiti, but these are the first known cave writings to record details about drought, Tan says.
Even without graffiti, caves can hold records of local climate. Rain trickles through the rocks above, dripping into the cave and creating stalactites and stalagmites. The water carries oxygen, carbon and other elements that get incorporated into the cave deposits over time. Similar to the technique of examining tree rings, analyzing those deposits for ratios of various elements or their isotopes can help scientists determine past climate events, including droughts. Tan and his colleagues found a stalagmite less than a mile from the cave's entrance that covered the period from 1265 to 1982. Analyzing it revealed that each drought recorded in graffiti matched up with changes in the composition of the mineral deposits.
“It's very interesting that people came in such large groups of 100 and more to pray for rain, and repeatedly so. Also, it's amazing that the geochemical reconstruction follows so closely the historical evidence,” says Sebastian Breitenbach of the University of Cambridge, one of the coauthors on the paper, published today in Scientific Reports.
The historical droughts are known to have been devastating to the region. Droughts in the 1890s, for instance, led to social unrest and a conflict between civilians and the government in 1900. And the 1528 event saw harvests fail for two years in a row. Many people starved to death, and some of those who survived resorted to cannibalism.
Using the stalagmite data, the researchers extrapolated how patterns of precipitation might change in the region through 2042. Their model predicts a drought in the 1990s—which matches instrumental data for that time—and another one in the late 2030s.
“We find in our record a stark reminder of the influence climate has on us as society, and the vulnerability of civilization to even relatively small changes in climate,” says Breitenbach. “That our highly industrialized lifestyle is quite different from pre-industrial society in China is clear, but bearing the drought in California in mind, it is evident that sustained shifts in hydrological pattern can very severely impact large populations.” And even if the local people are not affected, future droughts could threaten panda habitat in the Qinling Mountains, he notes.
Such events probably won't be recorded in Dayu Cave, though. People still go to the cave to get water when there's a severe drought, Tan notes. But to protect the cave, no one is allowed to write on the walls.
Women with depression may be much more likely than men to get relief from a commonly used, inexpensive antidepressant drug, a new national study finds. But many members of both sexes may find that it helps ease their depression symptoms.
The persistence of a gender difference in response to the drug - even after the researchers accounted for many complicating factors - suggests that there's a real biological difference in the way the medication affects women compared with men. The reasons for that difference are still unclear, but further studies are now examining hormonal variations that may play a role.
The study involved citalopram, a commonly used antidepressant that is available both as a generic drug and under the brand name Celexa.
Researchers from the University of Michigan Depression Center and their colleagues from around the country tested the drug's ability to help depression patients achieve remission, or total relief from their symptoms, in a multi-year study called STAR*D.
The gender differences emerged from a detailed analysis of data from 2,876 men and women who had a clear diagnosis of major depression, and took citalopram over a number of weeks, with the doses increasing over time.
In the end, women were 33 percent more likely to achieve a full remission of their depression, despite the fact that women in the study were more severely depressed than the men when the study began.
The study showed no differences between men and women in side effects, the amount of time that patients stuck to taking the drug, or the amount of time it took for them to achieve remission of their symptoms.
The new findings, which represent the largest and most rigorous analysis ever of gender differences in response to an antidepressant, are published online in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.
Elizabeth Young, M.D., a professor and associate chair of psychiatry at the U-M Medical School and member of the Depression Center, is the study's lead author. "Other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants, but the evidence has been conflicting," she says. "This study is large enough, and we were able to control for enough complicating factors, that we feel confident there is a true difference. These results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression."
Young and her colleagues, including Susan Kornstein, M.D., of Virginia Commonwealth University, and John Rush, M.D., formerly of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, conducted the analysis of data from men and women between the ages of 18 and 75, many of whom were being treated by primary care physicians and not psychiatrists. All of the patients had been experiencing depression for years, with the average length of experience around 12 years.
The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. Unlike many previous industry-sponsored studies of antidepressants, it included a "real world" sample of people with major depression, and did not exclude people who had a history of suicidal thinking. The study did not include people with bipolar disorder. Participants in the study could continue with psychotherapy that they had been undergoing before the start of the study, but could take no other antidepressants.
Citalopram is one of a class of medicines known as SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In earlier decades, gender differences had been seen in studies of patients taking an older generation of drugs called tricyclics, with men tending to respond better to such medications. But for more than 15 years, SSRIs have been the first choice for treating depression.
Although the current study didn't look at hormonal variations between men and women that might account for the difference in response to citalopram, Young and her colleagues note that animal studies have shown that estrogen modifies the brain systems involved in the activity of serotonin, a key brain chemical.
Kornstein is leading further analysis of the STAR*D results to look for possible differences among women according to their menopausal status and their use of hormone replacement therapy. Meanwhile, Young's research as a member of the U-M Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience Institute focuses on the interactions of sex hormones and stress response in depression and other mood disorders.
Overall, women are more affected by depression than men, with about 12 percent of women suffering from some form of depression in a given year compared with 6 percent of men. Depression and other mood disorders are the leading cause of disability among women under the age of 45.
But the study's authors are quick to caution that their findings don't mean that citalopram should only be used in women. Raw data from the study show that 24 percent of men achieved remission with the drug, compared with 29 percent of women. The difference in remission rates grew larger once the researchers adjusted for other factors, but the fact remains that many men were helped.
Rather, they note that STAR*D and other studies have shown that many people with depression need to try several treatments to find the one that's right for them and will produce lasting results.
That's why a new study called CO-MED has begun. Young and colleagues from U-M and around the country are now enrolling people with depression for this study that will assess the impact of combinations of medications. One of the medications in that study is escitalopram, a cousin of citalopram, but it also includes other common SSRI antidepressants.
More information on the CO-MED study is available at www.depressioncenter.org/research/co-med.asp. Information on STAR*D is available at www.nimh.nih.gov/health/trials/practical/stard.
In addition to Young, Kornstein and Rush, the study's authors include Sheila Marcus of the U-M Depression Center, Madhukar Trivedi and Diane Warden of UT-Southwestern, Anne Harvey of Via Christi Research, Stephen Wisniewski and G.K. Balasubramani of the University of Pittsburgh and Maurizio Fava of Harvard Medical School.

OTTAWA — A New Democrat MP has quit the caucus over what she felt was an excessively pro-Israel stance on the current conflict in Gaza and demeaning party demands to toe the line.
Sana Hassainia, who represents the Montreal-area riding of Vercheres-Les Patriotes, was specifically critical of NDP Leader Tom Mulcair in a blog post that appeared online Wednesday.
Hassainia alleged that she was “punished” for supporting Mulcair rival Brian Topp for the party leadership, including losing her position on the Commons committee on the status of women. She also said she was forced to stay quiet over her views on the Middle East and accept a position that didn't align with her values.
[np_storybar title=”John Ivison: Tom Mulcair brings NDP new maturity over Israel
” link=”http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/07/24/john-ivison-tom-mulcair-brings-ndp-a-new-maturity-over-israel/”%5D
Israel has always been the litmus test by which to measure the degree of lunacy emanating from Canada's left-wing.
Back in 2002, when former MP Svend Robinson was the NDP's critic on the Middle East, he issued a pro-Palestinian manifesto that justified taking sides – “life over death, peace over war, justice over tyranny and dehumanization, the oppressed over the oppressor.”

[/np_storybar]
“For me, a party leader should be loved like [former leader] Jack Layton and not feared,” wrote Hassainia, who is originally from Tunisia.
“Today, I have the courage to make a significant gesture, to take a weight off my shoulders and stand by my convictions.”
However, NDP sources said Hassainia has never before voiced concern over Mulcair's position on Israel and accused her of simply looking for an excuse to cover the fact that she rarely shows up for work.
So far this year, Hassainia has the worst voting record of all MPs, showing up for only 8.7% of votes in the House of Commons.
Since winning election in 2011 as part of the so-called “orange wave” that swept Quebec, the 39-year-old has given birth to two children.
A source close to Mulcair said the party bent over backwards trying to accommodate Hassainia's need to be with her young children, even letting her use the leader's office to breastfeed. But still the party's whip, Nycole Turmel, was frustrated in her efforts to get Hassainia to show up for votes and perform other parliamentary duties.
Hassainia had been preparing to announce next week that she would not seek re-election.
In a draft of that announcement, prepared last month and obtained by The Canadian Press, Hassainia cites the need to spend more time with her young family as the sole reason for her decision. And she says she intends to remain an active and proud member of the NDP.
In a brief July 25 email to an NDP staffer who was helping craft the announcement, Hassainia says she wants to make “some small changes” to the document. She gives no hint that the changes involve disavowing the party or taking issue with Mulcair's stand on Israel.
Mulcair has been more unequivocal in his support for Israel than previous NDP leaders but he's walked a fine line on the conflict in Gaza.
He has supported Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas missile attacks but has simultaneously pushed the federal government to help Palestinian children injured by Israeli missiles.

A 52-year-old man was arrested in the killing of an Upper Fells Point man over Labor Day weekend, Baltimore Police said Sunday.
Eric Jones was taken into custody Saturday by warrant apprehension detectives, K-9 officers and members of the SWAT team, police said. He was transported to Central Booking and charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 52-year-old George Yurek.
Yurek, of the 1900 block of E. Pratt St., was found bleeding from the head in an alley in the 1000 block of Brentwood Ave. on Sept. 3. He told police he had been beaten by an unknown man the night before. He later died at the hospital, and the medical examiner ruled his death a homicide by blunt-force trauma.
Baltimore Police sought help from the public in identifying a man in reference to the homicide, and the information they obtained led to an arrest warrant. Jones, who is waiting to see a court commissioner, also has open warrants for first-degree assault and failure to register as a sex offender, according to police.

STANFORD — After some anxious hours, Stanford received positive news on the injury front. Starting defensive linemen Aziz Shittu and Brennan Scarlett and all-conference left tackle Kyle Murphy are expected to play against Arizona, coach David Shaw said Tuesday.
All three were hurt during the victory at Oregon State last week. Shaw didn't disclose the nature of the injuries, but they are believed to involve knees and ankles.
The news on Shittu and Scarlett was particularly important for the 18th-ranked Cardinal given the state of the defensive line. Thin to begin the season, the unit has already lost starting nose tackle Harrison Phillips to a season-ending knee injury. A serious injury to either Shittu or Scarlett would have created a dire situation.
“They're very fortunate,” Shaw said. “X-rays showed no broken bones and no torn ligaments. Both are extremely sore, but we anticipate both of them playing.”
The Cardinal used a makeshift defensive line at Oregon State after Scarlett and Shittu hobbled off the field. Reserves Nate Lohn, Jordan Watkins and Torsten Rotto got extensive playing time, while outside linebackers Joey Alfieri and Mike Tyler also played hybrid end positions.
“It's hard when guys are down,” said redshirt freshman Solomon Thomas, the only starter on the line who currently is healthy. “But it hasn't affected us terribly.”
Outside linebacker Kevin Anderson (undisclosed injury) will be held out for the second consecutive week. He is expected to be ready for UCLA on Oct. 15. Alfieri, who had five tackles against Oregon State, will start in Anderson's place. Quarterback Kevin Hogan sustained no further damage to his sprained left ankle, and the swelling has subsided. He will be limited in practice but is expected to start.
Arizona is also dealing with injuries to significant players. All-America linebacker Scooby Wright won't play because of a foot injury suffered in the loss to UCLA, while quarterback Anu Solomon is questionable because of a concussion. If Solomon doesn't play, the Wildcats will use senior Jerrard Randall, a transfer from LSU who is a gifted runner but raw passer. “It won't change our approach too much,” Shaw said. “The biggest issue is RichRod (Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez) and going against his scheme. It's tough to deal with because it puts you in so many conflicts, so many run-pass conflicts.”
Stanford has used seven true freshmen thus far. The other members of the rookie class are expected to redshirt unless injuries dictate otherwise. One veteran who hasn't played yet is senior Luke Kaumatule. The former tight end and defensive end has moved to outside linebacker; he's eligible for a redshirt season. “There have been a lot of internal conversations,” Shaw said. “It sounds great to redshirt Luke, but if we need him to win a game, we're going to throw him in there.”
Project expects to generate $17.2M in private investment, create 50 jobs in Holland. In return, the company is getting a $500,000 state performance-based grant and local property tax abatement.

Kraft Heinz is bringing its premium mustard production to Holland by making all of its well-known Grey Poupon mustard in the state.
State economic development officials said the project will generate $17.2 million in private investment and create 50 jobs in the city. In return, the company is getting a $500,000 Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant and a property tax abatement from the City of Holland.
“Heinz has a long history in the Holland community, providing jobs, supporting local agriculture and industrial businesses, and playing a vital role in west Michigan,” Michigan Economic Development Corp. CEO Steve Arwood said in a statement Wednesday. “The decision by Kraft Heinz to expand further will mean even more jobs for area residents for years to come.”
Any incentive of $1 million or less does not need to be approved by the full MEDC board, officials said. Those projects are approved by Arwood, who acts as a delegate of the board.
Kraft Heinz came about when Kraft Foods Group merged with HJ Heinz in July 2015. The company is now the world's fifth-largest food and beverage company and the third-largest in the U.S.

Grey Poupon achieved pop culture status in the 1980s with its iconic commercials featuring a pair of Rolls-Royce passengers in which one passenger asks the other, "Pardon me, but would you have any Grey Poupon?" The response? "But of course."
The company now plans to expand operations at the Heinz manufacturing plant in Holland by consolidating 100% of the production of Grey Poupon mustard and insourcing the majority of Heinz Yellow Mustard to Michigan.
Grey Poupon mustard production will be moved to Michigan, company officials announced May 18, 2016 (Photo: Kraft Heinz)
According to an internal April 28 MEDC briefing memo, Kraft Heinz has been moving toward global consolidation of its operations to increase profitability and eliminated redundancy. To support additional Grey Poupon production, the company would need to upgrade its own water treatment facility in Holland, a move not required by a move to a competing Illinois facility, according to the memo.
The state incentive grant, according to the MEDC, would help the company justify the move to Michigan over Illinois. State economic officials did not say what kind of jobs from the project may be available and the expected wages offered. People interested in jobs with Kraft Heinz should visit here or visit the company in Holland to apply in person.
“Back in 1897, Henry John Heinz had the vision to expand his operations into Holland, Michigan, driven by the area's rich agriculture and eager workforce,” Kraft Heinz Factory Manager Brian Baculik said in a statement. “The community embraced the opportunity. Nearly 120 years later, the Heinz facility remains Holland's oldest employer.”
Company spokesman Michael Mullen said in an e-mail that the decision to consolidate manufacturing across Kraft Heinz in North America "is a critical step in our plan to eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies for the new combined company. This will make Kraft Heinz more globally competitive and accelerate the company's future growth."
The company is exiting its Lehigh Valley facility in Pennsylvania this summer and moving its production of Grey Poupon to Holland, officials said. The City of Holland has committed to a 12-year property abatement, but the company has not filed their application yet so the city hasn't taken it up yet and the value is not known, according to a MEDC spokeswoman.
“Kraft Heinz Food Company's decision to expand here is a testament to our community's strong food-processing employee skill set, along with many other factors that add up to a solid location for world-class businesses,” said Jennfier Owens, president of Lakeshore Advantage, a nonprofit economic development organization in west Michigan.
Today's announcement comes on the heels of Kent Quality Foods, a producer of high-quality meats, announcing its expansion recently in Jamestown Charter, investing nearly $35 million and creating 140 jobs. Spiech Farms, a grower of grapes, asparagus, lettuce and blueberries, is also expanding in Paw Paw. That project is expected to generate more than $1 million in private investment and create 55 jobs.
Michigan's food-processing businesses generate nearly $25 billion in economic activity and employ more than 130,000 residents, according to state officials. Western Michigan is also home to Mead Johnson Nutrition, Butterball Farms, Coles, Kellogg's, Country Fresh, Hudsonville and Gerber.

Secret law persists even in areas where we thought the secrecy had ended. Although President Obama is often credited for releasing controversial memos written by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel under the Bush administration — such as the infamous “torture memos” — new data show that at least 74 O.L.C. opinions from 2002 to 2009 on national security issues, including intelligence gathering and the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists, remain classified. Similarly, despite the disclosure of many FISA court opinions following Edward Snowden's revelations, new information from the Justice Department indicates that about 30 significant opinions remain secret.
We pay a high price for this system. Secret law denies us the ability to shape the rules that govern official conduct through the democratic process. It prevents us from holding the government accountable for violations, rendering such violations more likely. It weakens checks and balances, as both legislative and judicial oversight operate less effectively under the constraints imposed by secrecy.
Secret law is also bad law: When rules are developed by small groups of officials without the input of outside experts or stakeholders, their quality suffers. Indeed, an inherent conflict of interest exists when the executive branch enacts laws out of the public eye to govern its own actions. This can result in policies that are ineffective, ill advised or even contrary to statutes or the Constitution.
In theory, congressional oversight should stand in for public scrutiny. But the system breaks down in practice. Executive officials sometimes refuse to provide legal interpretations to oversight committees. Even when they have access, lawmakers often fail to push back against interpretations that go too far. After all, they have little incentive to take on the national security establishment when their constituents are not even aware that a problem exists.
The costs imposed by secret law are for the most part unjustified. National security frequently requires secrecy in the details of intelligence or military operations. Rules and regulations, however, establish general standards for conduct; they do not normally include details like dates, times, targets or sources. As for opinions that apply the law in specific cases, if their authors anticipated disclosure, they could write in a manner that minimized the entanglement of law and fact. The sensitive information could then be redacted without obscuring the legal analysis.
U.S. Congressmen Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Danny Davis (D-Ill.) Wednesday introduced legislation that would treat privately issued student loans the same as other types of private debt in bankruptcy.
This is the fifth time a bill like this has been introduced in the House, but Cohen feels it stands a better chance now given the current focus on student loan debt, including a reported rise in student loan debt among members of Congress.
“Congress taking action on student loan debt is long overdue,” said Cohen in a statement. “People who seek higher education to better their futures should not be dissuaded from doing so by the threat of financial ruin. Our bill takes a modest but important step in achieving this goal.”
The bill, HR 532, would amend the U.S. bankruptcy code to allow private student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings. A report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) last year indicated that some $150 billion of the $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt was from private lenders.
But the growth in private student loans is likely to slow in coming years.
The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which got attached to and passed with the healthcare reform bill in 2010, effectively killed federally guaranteed private student lending. Going forward, all student loans that would have been previously guaranteed by the government are going to be originated directly by the U.S. Department of Education.
Cohen's bill would not allow federal direct loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.
There are still plenty of private lenders participating in the student loan market. The Federal Direct Student Loan Program does not originate loans to pay for non-accredited schools. Federal direct loans also only cover tuition and certain approved fees, but not all costs to attend college. Private lenders can provide loans to cover some gaps. Chase, among other large lenders, has a formal program to cover federal loan shortages.
The recent focus on the magnitude of the student loan debt problem might help the bill's prospects. Just last week, credit reporting agency TransUnion said that more than half of student loan accounts are in deferred status. The bill has already picked up 14 co-sponsors.
Individual members of Congress are also reporting more student loan debt that they are responsible for paying.
According to a report Thursday from the Center for Responsive Politics, the amount owed by U.S. Representatives and Senators in 2011 totaled as high as $4.3 million, compared to a ceiling of $2.4 million in 2008. Congressional finance disclosures require members to only report ranges of debt rather than hard numbers. The total number of Congressional student borrowers did definitively grow over the same time, though, from 30 in 2008 to 46 in 2011.
The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, of which Cohen is a member.
Correction: A previous version of this story indicated that the Federal Direct Student Loan Program does not lend to students at for-profit colleges. In fact, the Department of Education last year published a cohort student default study that included for-profit college loans. The article has been updated to reflect this.
A new test which can diagnose asthma from a patient's saliva has been developed by Loughborough University.
Around 5.4 million people currently receive treatment for asthma in the UK, of which 1.1 million are children.
To diagnose the condition doctors usually measure a person's airflow lung capacity, however lung function tests can be inaccurate and do not reflect underlying changes associated with asthma. Other tests, such as blood, urine or sputum analysis can be distressing, particularly for younger patients.
The new test, developed in collaboration with Nottingham City Hospital, is completely painless and offers a one-stop diagnosis suitable for people of all ages.
To develop the test the research team, led by Professor Colin Creaser from Loughborough's Department of Chemistry and Dr Dominick Shaw from the Respiratory Research Unit at City Hospital, collected saliva from patients with asthma and healthy individuals. They then performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis on the samples to find so-called metabolic biomarkers.
By detecting the presence and amount of these ‘metabolic biomarkers' the new test can diagnose asthma. It also has the potential to pinpoint the severity and progression of the disease.
“Unlike other sampling methods, such as expired breath analysis, saliva can be collected by passive drool from the very young to the very old without causing distress,” explains Professor Creaser.
“We were therefore interested to know if techniques for metabolic profiling of saliva to identify physiological stress from exercise – developed by Loughborough – could be applied to asthma diagnosis.
“We were very excited to discover that they could.”
Before the new test can move to a clinical setting the diagnostic metabolic biomarkers identified need to be validated in further longitudinal studies.
If this is successful, the approach could be used in early asthma diagnosis as well as part of the ongoing monitoring of patients.
The research has been published in the journal Analytical Methods and can be viewed here.
When IBM, one of the largest technology firms in the world, generating nearly $100bn in 2014 revenue, announced it was interested in blockchain technology, the wider world took notice.
IBM revealed it would lend its support to the Open Ledger Project this December, an announcement that was followed by a wave of popular press proclaiming that the initiative would become a new blockchain for business, one perhaps better suited to enterprises than alternatives like bitcoin.
Organized under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, the Open Ledger Project attracted banks, financial institutions, technology firms, as well as two blockchain startups based in New York, Digital Asset Holdings and R3CEV, the consortium that has attracted 40 major banks.
In interview, the tech giant used similarly striking language when referring to the blockchain, with IBM fellow Jerry Cuomo calling distributed ledger technology “a fundamental way of reimagining core business processes”.
“The art of the possible with blockchain is really what brings us to the table,” Cuomo told CoinDesk.
Those backing the project hope that the Open Ledger Project will serve as a development library that will be tapped for use by other firms looking to build permissioned ledgers of their own.
Cuomo said:
“We've done [proofs-of-concept] for customers with almost all of those. And I would say the world is a better place because those things were and are pioneers in the space. But we, and several others in the industry, got a twinkle in our eye looking at this and thinking [whether] this could be used for more than just cryptocurrency.”
Gathering of interest
Another key factor is IBM's past work with the Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization that supports the open-source Linux operating system.
Cuomo said that last year the two sides reached similar conclusions about bitcoin and the blockchain, and from that general agreement movement toward a shared project began.
“There was a kind of perfect synchronization of thought,” he said. “They had already been entertaining proposals in the blockchain area.”
The gathering of various interests around the project grows out of an internal effort that has seen the deployment of several dozen employees, including developers and researchers, as part of a single team within IBM.
In the past year, the company has experimented with bitcoin and other blockchain implementations, producing public projects like ADEPT, a network for underpinning a system of interconnected devices developed in partnership with Samsung that drew elements from Ethereum.
Cuomo said other proofs-of-concept developed with IBM customers came out of those efforts.
Road ahead
A formation committee has already begun meeting, Cuomo said, and the next phase involves discussions over the Open Ledger Project's structure; how each party will contribute and support the initiative; and the creation of subcommittees, including a technical committee on which he will sit.
According to Cuomo, the process for those contributing code to the project has already begun, which will draw from code written by IBM staff as well as code pledged by Digital Asset Holdings. The firm is also contributing the name Hyperledger, from one of two startups it acquired last year.
“Last week we did a call for code, and it's like, smoke ‘em if you got ‘em, so let's put the code on the table,” said Cuomo.
He added that the process of development coming together has already begun, saying that “you can see folks aren't waiting” ahead of a more formal process.
Cuomo said that development will take place over a period of years, but expressed hope that by 2017 companies will begin developing POCs and commercial-scale products based on the Open Ledger Project.
“History shows that these things take a while,” he remarked, adding:
“The bold will adopt it sooner, rollercoasters and bumps and all, and conservatives will wait for the first movers.”

Following news that the ESL (Electronic Sports League) is to introduce random testing for performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) from August, the UK's largest eSports company, Gfinity, has responded by saying it too is working on establishing a "common testing framework".
IBTimes UK reached out to Gfinity – who earlier this year opened the UK's first dedicated eSports arena in London – to ask them about the news and whether they will be following suit.
"Gfinity is aware of recent stories regarding the use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) within eSports. The use of PEDs is prohibited at all Gfinity competitions and we are working with the other leading global eSports tournament providers to establish a common testing framework to ensure that those breaching those rules will be identified," the company stated.
"As in any high level sport, such an approach is necessary not just to identify the small number of cheats, but to preserve the reputation of the majority who want a clean sport."
IBTimes has requested more information about which companies Gfinity is working with.
What is Adderall? Adderall is a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is used illegally (largely by students) as an aid to boost attentiveness, focus and concentration.
A notable Adderall scandal this year appears to have prompted the need for drugs testing in an industry that continues to grow year on year, with prize money continuing to build across the many competitions taking place around the world.
In spring Eurogamer published an investigation into the extent of Adderall use in Sports, then in July pro Counter-Strike player Kory "Semphis" Friesen stated publicly in an interview that "everyone" takes the drug to help boost their performance.
In the ESL's announcement, a spokesperson said: "In order to maintain the fair play spirit of our sport, ESL has partnered with NADA (Nationale Anti Doping Agentur, located in Bonn, Germany) to help research and determine an anti-PEDs (performance enhancing drugs) policy that is fair, feasible and respects the privacy of the players, whilst simultaneously providing conclusive testing results."
"ESL will remain proactive in ensuring all professional players and organisations involved in our competitions will be informed about the current status of this initiative. This will include the list of banned substances, the methods of testing, and the disciplinary actions for players caught using PEDs and/or admitting to having used them."

Story has it that in the early 1960s, a young and promising Birmingham guitarist named Tony Iommi decided he had enough of his day job at the local factory. Full of confidence, youthful determination and probably a few other substances, he left his position at the sheetrock cutter for lunch with every intention of never coming back.
His mother, being a proper 1960s British mum, convinced the young Iommi to return to work that day and finish his shift.
It was on that day that Tony cut off a good portion of his fret hand's fingers in a freak industrial accident.
That could have been where the musical part of this story ends, thus depriving the world of dozens of platinum-selling albums enjoyed by millions both forwards and backwards.
But inspired by another similarly inflicted guitar player, Django Reinhard, Tony decided to get back on the crazy train and do the one thing he was put on this Earth by Satan to do — play guitar.
At this point, what was left of his fingers was so sensitive that he could no longer play guitar the way he used to. Instead, he had to loosen the strings down a few pitches to make them easier to touch. He also now plugged his guitar into a bass amp to create a heavy sound that his delicate fingers could not accomplish alone. On top of that, he taught himself to play a new kind of chord using primarily two fingers.
What this resulted in was one of the most distinct and influential guitar sounds in rock history, forging new sonic territory that was greatly responsible for his band Black Sabbath's success.
By now, I know what you're thinking. This is a nice little story, Greg, and brilliantly told, but what does this have to do with advertising?
First, thank you — you're too kind. Second, allow me to demonstrate.
Say you're a young creative and you have just presented the piece of work you feel will be your all-expenses-paid ticket to drinks on the Carlton terrace. Only to have it killed because the brief has changed. The client now wants to just feature the product.
I imagine a similar thing happened when a creative team in the '90s at DDB London was told by their VW client that they wanted to do a spot that showed off every new feature of the latest VW model. A pure product spot brief.
Here's what they did. A film that's almost entirely focused on the product, showing off every feature on the brief in great detail, by way of a truly inspiring piece of creative judo.
The first 58 seconds of it is nothing special, a '90s piece of product advertising just interesting enough to hold your attention. The last two seconds of it makes it brilliant, turning the previous :58 into a stealth setup to a left-hook punch line.
It demonstrates the value of embracing the problem of your problem. A way of using the weight of an obstacle to your advantage.
Consider this the next time you're faced with an impossible brief, or an unreasonable, yet unmovable, demand. At such a point you have three choices.
You can fight against it. You can give up. Or, as Mr. Iommi did, use the cruel hand that fate has dealt you to your advantage and create a whole new kind of music.

Nobody ever brought up Milwaukee, Wisconsin as a “must see” destination when I started traveling around the country. Maybe that's because Milwaukee has been keeping a secret from the rest of America – it's a really cool place to live and visit.
“Cool” is an appropriate adjective in more ways than one. During my visit in late June, Lake Michigan was still partially frozen from the harsh Winter most of the country experienced. As I arrived, residents were all too eager to mention “Day 17” — the number of days fog had covered much of the city, even during the warmest part of the afternoon. To say that people were a bit freaked out would be an understatement.
Perhaps it's part of the “fly-over country” mentality, but who thinks of Milwaukee when you picture beach front property? Yet, there it is! The beautiful western shores of Lake Michigan are both put to good use and protected. The stunning Milwaukee Art Museum and it's next door neighbor, a children's science museum called Discovery World, enjoy stunning backdrops with the lake behind them. Not even a mile down the road however, land is set aside for the sole purpose of preservation and recreation. Sunbathing, beach volleyball and swimming (if you can brave that cold water) seemed to be keeping people busy.
While enjoying a lunch break at the Milwaukee Public Market, one cashier told me about moving to the area from the East coast. She said she loved the small town feel while having all of the perks of a big city. That's not to say Milwaukee is necessarily small. It's still one of the 50 most populated regions in the United States. It's the biggest city in the state of Wisconsin. But, the girl was right – it has all the makings of a small town. Traffic was not horrible, people seemed generally friendly and never once did I not feel safe as I explored the area.
Milwaukee is also a town that loves festivals. There's a party during the year for everything you can think of. Germans, Italians, gay pride, Mexicans, Indians, Arabs, Polish and oh yeah – music. Milwaukee hosts the biggest music event you've probably never heard of. I've covered my share of music festivals in the past and had an idea of what to expect when Summerfest was added to my agenda. For years, I traveled to Nashville, Tennessee for their massive 4 day country music festival called CMA Fest. (Aka: “Fan Fair”) Let's just say, Summerfest made the popular country music gathering look like a high school battle of the bands competition.
I was completely blown away and downright stunned as I walked the grounds and passed stage after stage of concerts. And I don't mean like 4 or 5. There are 11 stages, many of them big enough to be housed in a venue of their own. All types of music for any taste – notables, locals, classic and bizarre — but, all music. The event goes on for 11 days, features over 800 acts and 1,000 shows. This year's lineup included major acts such as Bruno Mars, Bonnie Raiit, Dave Matthews Band, Brad Paisley, Usher and Motley Crue.
As I checked into the hotel, my phone rang with an invitation to join the ladies of Visit Milwaukee at Summerfest for that night's headliner – Lady Gaga. Of course, I accepted the invitation knowing that none of my friends or family would actually believe that yours truly stepped foot into a concert to watch this freak show. While freezing cold (remember the frozen lake) there I stood in my “summer” clothes (I mean it is called Summer Fest, right?) I watched as a jam packed amphitheater sang, shouted, danced and stood for nearly two hours.
One of the most popular tourist destinations in Milwaukee is the Harley-Davidson Museum. Even for someone that isn't familiar with motorcycles – it's fun seeing the progression of the bikes through the years – including the very first one. The timing couldn't have been better as the world's first all-electric motorcycle was being shown to the public on the day I stopped by. I spent some time with one of the engineers who helped build it and let him start the engine live on the radio during a call-in segment back in Saint Louis.
Milwaukee has lots of walkable areas. Touring downtown, there are many reminders that people here love two things: beer and cheese. Like most of Wisconsin residents, they do not care about your cheese jokes or farmland stereotypes – they embrace both.
We made a quick stop at the former brewery for Pabst beer. We were even granted a fun, behind the scenes tour of what's soon to be a reception hall – that once were the administrative offices for Pabst Brewery. You can see in the photo the picture of what it looked like way back then and what it's currently being transformed into.
Many of the old buildings downtown are being transformed into new living spaces and businesses. It's so much fun to see cities like Milwaukee come back to life and re-purpose these beautiful structures. Walking along the riverfront on what could be described as a canal through town, you see plenty of activity – boating, kayaking, and a handful of overpasses that rise up for tall vessels passing through.
At one point along the river -you'll even stumble upon a popular picture taking spot – a statute of actor Henry Winkler as Fonzie from the hit show Happy Days. The sitcom wasn't filmed in Milwaukee, but the show was in fact based here and Winkler is said to be a frequent visitor.
For a city that I had absolutely zero expectations for – Milwaukee turned out to be an overwhelmingly terrific stop.
**7/20/14 – An added note of thanks to the great people of Milwaukee for the INCREDIBLE response to this piece. I can't even begin to count all of the e-mails, re-tweets and comments from readers with genuine gratitude. I always seek to find the positive in every place I visit – and it wasn't tough to find plenty of it in Milwaukee. Keep being proud of your home town and many thanks for the heartfelt response. I'll always remember this. -BC
Pickapeppa Sauce bottle, with trademark bird and hot pepper logo
Pickapeppa Sauce is a brand name Jamaican condiment, the main product of the Pickapeppa Company, founded in 1921. It is made in Shooters Hill, Jamaica, near Mandeville.[1] The ingredients (in order on the product label) are: cane vinegar, sugar, tomatoes, onions, raisins, sea salt, ginger, peppers, garlic, cloves, black pepper, thyme, mangoes, and orange peel, aged in oak barrels.[2] The sauce is sweet, sour and mildly spicy. The company makes several variants of the sauce, including mango and extra hot Scotch Bonnet pepper varieties.[3]
One traditional use of the sauce is to pour it over a block of cream cheese, to be spread on crackers.[4]
A noted fan of Pickapeppa sauce is supermodel Naomi Campbell, who carries a bottle with her.[5]

The city of Halifax has spent around $250,000 fixing an intersection that the local councillor says was more unpopular than unsafe.
The new intersection connecting Kearney Lake Road and Larry Uteck Boulevard drew complaints from residents in Hammonds Plains and Bedford, says Matt Whitman, councillor for Hammonds Plains – St. Margarets.
Matt Whitman, regional councillor for the area, says he's had complaints from people in his constituency. (CBC)
"It wasn't built so that our residents could drive it safely," Whitman said Wednesday.
"You had to change your driving patterns to drive through the intersection, and residents weren't able to change — or resisted that change."
'It wasn't perfect'
The intersection originally cost $1.2 million last December, but drivers said the turn was too sharp and the stop sign at the end of the road was hidden in the middle of the curve.
Some blame recent traffic collisions on these problems, Whitman said.
"It was — engineering-wise — built OK, but it wasn't perfect," Whitman said.
"My residents made a lot of noise. Bedford residents made a lot of noise and the city listened and we got it done."
'Two thumbs down'
The $250,000 wasn't spent under the direction of Halifax Regional Council. It was ordered at the discretion of the city's chief administration officer Richard Butts, since the cost is under $500,000.
A 15-centimetre divider barrier, more signs and lights and a bike lane built away from traffic have been added.
Jeff Rogers, who lives in the area, sarcastically calls the intersection an "amazing use of tax dollars" even after the additions.
"I think the practicality of it is not so great. I'd give it a two thumbs down," Rogers said.
Changes to slow down drivers
The intersection is tricky with so many people from outside the communities driving through, neighbour Karen McIntyre said.
"I think the Halifax people who are driving need to slow down and be more responsive and pay attention to other drivers," McIntyre said.
A city program engineer previously told CBC, the goal of the upgrade was to encourage people to slow down.
"That's really the number one reason why we're having the number of near misses that we do," Paul Burgess said.
The changes to the intersection were unveiled this week.

Hi -
I am the inventor of Rankdex, I left the company about a year ago, as
far as I now, the Rankdex index was never updated since I left. GARI
Software which hosted Rankdex is now part of Dow Jones, no one is
responsible for Rankdex anymore. Dow Jones may still own the patent,
if it is approved, but anything could happen.
If you are interested, a detailed technical paper on Rankdex was
recently published in IEEE Internet Computing, July/August issue, the
title of the paper is

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A winter storm packing snow and Arctic cold slammed the northeastern United States on Tuesday, grounding 3,000 flights, shutting down governments and schools and making travel a potential nightmare for millions.

States across the northeast declared emergencies and warned residents not to travel during the fast-moving storm, which packed a potentially lethal combination of snow and wind, backed by temperatures up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (17 degrees Celsius) below normal.
The system could dump as much as a foot of snow on southern New England and to snarl the evening commutes of millions along the I-95 highway corridor from Boston to Washington, said Bruce Sullivan, a senior meteorologist at the National Weather Service.
“Behind this system is a lot of strong winds, (with) very cold, bitter temperatures, so this snow is going to be around for a while,” said Bruce Sullivan, senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
He warned that stranded travelers faced potential frostbite or worse. “That's the risk you take if you travel in this kind of weather,” Sullivan said.
Hundreds of thousands of federal workers in Washington were ordered to stay home. City schools and offices also shut down, and the White House called off its Tuesday press briefing.
But the Supreme Court remained open to hear cases, and organizers of the annual anti-abortion March for Life said Wednesday's rally would go on regardless of weather.
FLIGHTS CANCELED
About 3,000 airline flights in the United States were canceled, according to FlightAware.com, a tracking service. The bad weather left thousands of air travelers wondering when they were going to get home.
“I rushed to the airport, but (my flight) just got canceled,” said Sumeet Kapoor, 24, a North Carolina State University graduate student who was on his way from Washington's Reagan National Airport to Raleigh, North Carolina.
“I actually had a class at 6, but I'm going to be late, I guess,” he said.
Hours after he was sworn in to a second term, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency, as did Delaware Governor Jack Markell. Christie's inauguration party on Ellis Island in New York Harbor was canceled because of the looming storm.
In Massachusetts, Governor Deval Patrick postponed his annual state of the state address because of the weather.
State governments in Delaware and Maryland shut down and Connecticut sent nonessential state workers home beginning at 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT). The Maryland Transit Administration cut back rail and bus services.
In Connecticut and Virginia, state officials warned residents not to travel if they did not have to.
Some schools in North Carolina closed early, and schools were shut across Virginia and West Virginia. Connecticut closed all its schools for Wednesday, and Hartford, the state capital, sent students home early on Tuesday.
At a gas station in Princeton, West Virginia, residents said they were stocking up on propane, food and other staples in case they lost power and had to weather the storm.
“The snow by itself isn't a threat. It's when it freezes after and weighs down the power lines that I get worried,” said Jim Mullins, who spent the day buying supplies.

Forecaster AccuWeather said the cold front would drop temperatures below freezing as far south as northern Florida.
While the polar front grips the eastern United States, the western half will see above-average temperatures as a drought worsens, the National Weather Service said.
Sullivan, the meteorologist, said the cold snap would be followed by two more polar fronts through the weekend. One would hit the Great Lakes region, and the other the upper Great Plains, he said.
Maria and I were updating the NerdDinner sample app (not done yet, but soon) and were looking at various ways to do bundling and minification of the JSS and CS. There's runtime bundling on ASP.NET 4.x but in recent years web developers have used tools like Grunt or Gulp to orchestrate a client-side build process to squish their assets. The key is to find a balance that gives you easy access to development versions of JS/CSS assets when at dev time, while making it "zero work" to put minified stuff into production. Additionally, some devs don't need the Grunt/Gulp/npm overhead while others absolutely do. So how do you find balance? Here's how it works.
I'm in Visual Studio 2017 and I go File | New Project | ASP.NET Core Web App. Bundling isn't on by default but the configuration you need IS included by default. It's just minutes to enable and it's quite nice.
In my Solution Explorer is a "bundleconfig.json" like this:
Pretty simple. Ins and outs. At the top of the VS editor you'll see this yellow prompt. VS knows you're in a bundleconfig.json and in order to use it effectively in VS you grab a small extension. To be clear, it's NOT required. It just makes it easier. The source is at https://github.com/madskristensen/BundlerMinifier. Slip this UI section if you just want Build-time bundling.
If getting a prompt like this bugs you, you can turn all prompting off here:
Look at your Solution Explorer. See under site.css and site.js? There are associated minified versions of those files. They aren't really "under" them. They are next to them on the disk, but this hierarchy is a nice way to see that they are associated, and that one generates the other.
Right-click on your project and you'll see this Bundler & Minifier menu:
You can manually update your Bundles with this item as well as see settings and have bundling show up in the Task Runner Explorer.
Build Time Minification
The VSIX (VS extension) gives you the small menu and some UI hooks, but if you want to have your bundles updated at build time (useful if you don't use VS!) then you'll want to add a NuGet package called BuildBundlerMinifier.
You can add this NuGet package SEVERAL ways. Which is awesome.
Add it from the Manage NuGet Packages menu
Add it from the command line via "dotnet add package BuildBundlerMinifier"
Note that this adds it to your csproj without you having to edit it! It's like "nuget install" but adds references to projects! The dotnet CLI is lovely.
If you have the VSIX installed, just right-click the bundleconfig.json and click "Enable bundle on build..." and you'll get the NuGet package.
Now bundling will run on build...
c:\WebApplication8\WebApplication8>dotnet build
Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 15
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
Bundler: Begin processing bundleconfig.json
Bundler: Done processing bundleconfig.json
WebApplication8 -> c:\WebApplication8\bin\Debug
etcoreapp1.1\WebApplication8.dll
Build succeeded.
0 Warning(s)
0 Error(s)
...even from the command line with "dotnet build." It's all integrated.
This is nice for VS Code or users of other editors. Here's how it would work entirely from the command prompt:
$ dotnet new mvc
$ dotnet add package BuildBundlerMinifier
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet run
Advanced: Using Gulp to handle Bundling/Minifying
If you outgrow this bundler or just like Gulp, you can right-click and Convert to Gulp!
Now you'll get a gulpfile.js that uses the bundleconfig.json and you've got full control:
And during the conversion you'll get the npm packages you need to do the work automatically:
I've found this to be a good balance that can get quickly productive with a project that gets bundling without npm/node, but I can easily grow to a larger, more npm/bower/gulp-driven front-end developer-friendly app.

Deployment of a new unmanned aerial fleet has been pushed back multiple years because lawmakers and military officials are unable to settle on what type of drones they want—ones loaded to kill or ones built to keep a watchful eye.
That was the conclusion of a Government Accountability Office report commissioned by Congress to study the Navy's Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) system—a regime that includes new drones, a control system, and an aircraft carrier.
“The system's intended mission and required capabilities have come into question, delaying the Navy's UCLASS schedule,” the report, which was publicly released on Monday, revealed.
Each phase of the program, from design review to test flights, has been pushed back multiple years, according to the Navy's own estimations. Even the first phase of awarding development contracts, which was expected to be completed in 2014, is now not set to occur until 2017. The program's expected early operational capabilities have now been pushed back until 2022.
Although the UCLASS system includes both the words “surveillance” and “strike,” the military and policymakers aren't quite sure how much of one capability they want at the expense of the other.
“The main options are a large surveillance role with limited strike operating in less contested environments, or a large strike role with limited surveillance operating in highly contested environments,” GAO described.
The future role of the US military in the Pacific looms large over the debate about UCLASS capabilities, with hawkish lawmakers and the defense establishment lobbying for bulkier, weapons-loaded drones that can survive in skies around Chinese airspace.
As GAO noted, “Congress has heard testimony from former DOD and Navy officials expressing concerns about the ability of UCLASS to help counter the defenses of adversaries trying to deny U.S. access.”
Many lawmakers and the Obama administration, however, would prefer to mostly gear the program toward surveillance in less contested environments. The GAO described this approach as focused primarily on “affordability, timely fielding, and endurance.”
The agency stated that when these differences are bridged, “before system development begins, the weapon system is more likely to meet objectives.”
Last week, the US House passed a 2016 defense spending bill that appropriates over $130 million for carrier-launched drones.
In the past few years, the world has been introduced to the concept of the digital currency. Though the idea had been attempted before, bitcoin is the first truly realistic digital currency. Bitcoin has the benefit of being transparent, secure and liquid.
Though there has been much talk about bitcoin in the media, it remains somewhat inaccessible to much of the population due to its digital nature.
In order to understand bitcoin, here are some of the basics of the cryptocurrency:
What is Bitcoin?
In layman's terms, bitcoin is an open-source payment system which allows a person to securely send payment to another person while paying practically no transaction fees. This has made bitcoin extremely attractive to those looking to send money or conduct business across borders.
Bitcoin is also relatively anonymous and includes a sort of transaction history feature that severely limits any efforts at stealing or counterfeiting the currency.
How Many Dollars is Bitcoin Worth?
The price of bitcoin has fluctuated greatly since its creation in 2009. The most recent quotes put the value of one bitcoin at about $600. Bitcoin reached a high in December 2013 at almost $1,150.
What Determines Bitcoin's Value?
Supply and demand determine bitcoin's value. For example, the currency leapt in value from around $120 per coin in September 2013 to more than $1,000 per coin in December as more people came to learn about it.
There is a finite number of bitcoins that can ever be created, and this number is controlled by the way the code which generates bitcoin was written. The value of bitcoin dropped substantially in December after it was revealed that the coin was not as safe as some had thought.
How Safe is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is extremely safe to use, as safe as any currency. However, people who hold their bitcoins in a so-called third-party wallet are in danger of losing their coin if the company which controls to the wallet has financial problems or is fraudulent.
Mt. Gox was a third party company that caused a crisis of confidence in bitcoin after it claimed that it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.
What Can I Buy With Bitcoin?
Just like deciding whether or not to accept credit cards, individual companies and organizations decide whether not to accept bitcoin payments. As the currency's popularity grows, an increasing number of companies and organizations are deciding to accept the payment, including select universities and retailers.
There are even a number of companies which are launching technologies which would make paying for goods and services with bitcoin every bit as easy and intuitive as paying with a credit card.
What is the Investment Potential of Bitcoin?
The future of bitcoin is difficult to predict. On one hand the currency is benefiting from a surge in popularity and familiarity among the population. The freshman class at MIT was given $100 worth of bitcoin each, which could singlehandedly lead to the development of revolutionary applications for the coin.
However, as federal authorities have yet to take a definitive stance on the currency and its legality, its future is uncertain. Some financial analysts see it going to $10,000 or more per coin in short order, while others call it a money-making scheme with no future.
Eighty-seven residents participated in our study between September 2013 and March 2015; 30 individuals participated multiple times, providing 152 total participants. The data from individuals living in less affected areas and away from Fukushima at the time of the study were eliminated, leaving the data from 142 participants for analysis. Details of study participants and exposure durations are summarized in S1 Table . The participants consisted of 70 full-time farmers, 8 part-time farmers, 35 office workers, 6 housewives, 6 self-employed workers and 17 individuals with an unspecified occupation. According to the diary of each participant, during a given study period, on average the participants spent approximately 57% (SD = 13%) of the time at home, 14% (SD = 11%) of the time indoors other than their home, 16% (SD = 13%) of the time outdoors, 6% (SD = 6%) of the time in a transport vehicle, and 13% (SD = 7%) of the time in an unspecified activity. Our results indicate that people spent a substantial portion of the time at home and this agrees well with time-activity patterns in Fukushima reported elsewhere [ 10 , 16 ]. In these previous studies, some participants spent more than 50% of the time at home. For outdoor workers, the time spent outdoors was reported to be up to about 40% [ 10 ]. In our study, some famers spent approximately 50% of the day outdoors.
On average, participants spent 208 (SD = 83) hours carrying the D-shuttle and GPS for data collection. Table 1 lists summary statistics for individual external doses obtained using D-shuttle. The distributions of individual external doses for each person were generally lognormally distributed. More than 6-fold differences were observed in the mean and GM of the individual external doses of participants. The variation in the 95%:5% ratio, expressed by the ratio between the 95th percentiles to the 5th percentile, suggests a large range in inter- and intra-individual activity. The individual external dose measurements obtained using D-shuttle by the Fukushima High School students [ 11 ] demonstrated that median hourly individual external doses ranged between 0.07–0.10 μSv/h and this range falls within our results. Of the participants in our study, the person with the highest individual external dose (mean = 0.47 μSv/h) worked in a forest and his house was located in a relatively highly affected area. Other individuals with higher than average individual external doses included a retired person living in a relatively higher ambient dose area, and a farmer working at a non-remediated orchard.
Relationship between individual external dose and ambient dose rate
The relationship between the average additional external individual dose obtained using D-shuttle and the average additional ambient dose estimated based on the air-borne monitoring survey, and the relationship between the reduction factor (RF) and the average additional ambient dose, are presented in Fig 4. The RF is defined as the ratio of the additional individual external dose to the additional ambient dose. The raw data used to analyze these relationships are provided in S3 Table. Individual external dose data, making it possible to locate position and relate the ambient dose data, were used in this analysis. We observed significant positive correlation between the average additional ambient dose and the additional individual external dose for all cases (p < 0.0001). The regression line showed that the average additional individual external doses were approximately 18%, 14% and 36% of the average additional ambient doses during all study periods, while at home, and while outdoors, respectively. These results indicate that the average additional individual external doses were significantly lower than the average additional ambient doses estimated based on the air-borne monitoring survey. The exposure while at home was estimated to be the lowest mostly due to the building shielding effect. We observed no correlation between the average additional ambient dose and the reduction factor for all study periods (r = -0.11, p = 0.19) and time spent outdoors (r = 0.11, p = 0.22), and a small negative correlation for time spent at home (r = -0.26, p = 0.002). The mean values of the RFs were 0.18 (min-max: 0.02–0.42) for all study periods, 0.16 (min-max: 0.03–0.42) for time spent at home, and 0.32 (min-max: 0.01–0.80) for time spent outdoors. Previous studies also demonstrated that the levels of individual external doses directly measured using a personal dosimeter were substantially lower than levels estimated using the government-proposed equation [5, 6]. The RFs reported in these studies were on average about 0.3 and this is larger than the RFs obtained from the current study. The reasons for this discrepancy include the values of background doses used to estimate additional dose, consideration of decay in the ambient dose determination, and differences in number and type of participants.

Individual external dose, expressed as Hp (10) values, measured in affected areas in Fukushima have previously been reported to be comparable with the ISO or ROT irradiation geometries [13, 14]. Earlier published evidence showed that the values of Hp (10) were about 0.7 times that of the ambient dose rate, expressed as H*(10), if the measurements were conducted in outdoor field conditions in affected areas in Fukushima [17]. In the current study, most of the RFs were derived from outdoor data in which the mean value was 0.32 (min-max: 0.01–0.80), which is much lower than the reported value of 0.7. There can be several reasons for such discrepancies and variabilities among the RFs. The airborne monitoring-based ambient dose rates, which used in the current study, are considered as an aerial average, and not the ambient dose rates based on the point locations of individuals. The airborne monitoring data were obtained using high-sensitivity radiation detectors installed on helicopters: second-by-second measurements are taken of gamma rays emitted from radioactive substances deposited in circles of a diameter approximately twice the flight altitude (target altitude: 150 to 300 m) and centered around ground locations directly below the flight trajectory [18]. If a helicopter flies at an altitude of approximately 300 m above the ground, the system measures the average value of the radiation in a circle in 300 m radius on the ground [18]. A dedicated software program was used to determine the hourly ambient dose rate 1 m above the ground surface at each location based on the value of gamma rays measured in the air and the reading from the survey meter on the ground [18]. Therefore, the airborne monitoring-based ambient dose rates, therefore, may be over or under estimations of the actual ambient dose rates measured on the ground near the locations of individuals. The reasons for very low RFs obtained in this stu294dy can be due to several factors such as decontamination activity, and the behavior and locations of individuals. If an individual stays or works in a decontaminated area and the airborne monitoring system does not detect the decrease in radiation level of the decontamination area, the values for individual external dose can be much lower than the airborne monitoring-based ambient dose rates. In addition, an individual working for a long period of time on tarmacked surfaces or in farm trucks could be exposed to a low individual external doses. Quantifications of the effects of these factors on RFs remain a future challenges.
People are not typically standing motionless outdoors, but rather spend time both outdoors and indoors where there is some sort of radiation shielding. The mean RF for time spent at home obtained in this study was 0.16 (min-max: 0.03–0.42). The median reduction factor with an interquartile range for wooden houses, which is the ratio of indoor ambient dose rate to outdoor ambient dose rate, has been reported to be 0.43 (0.34–0.53) [19]. Since the methods for calculating home RFs in our study and the reported reduction factors are different, it is not possible to directly compare our home RFs and the reported reduction factors. The reported reduction factors are defined as the ratio of indoor ambient dose rate to outdoor ambient dose rate, while the home RFs in our study are defined as the ratio of additional individual dose rate to airborne-based additional ambient dose rate. Since decontamination works have been conducted in the most of the houses in the affected areas in Fukushima, the outdoor ambient dose rate measured at decontaminated points around a house are considered to be lower than the airborne-based ambient dose rate. Moreover, the values of Hp (10) were about 0.7 times that of the ambient dose rate [17]. Taking these relationships and variability of RFs into account, our estimated home RFs are comparable to those reported in previous studies [10, 19] and can be used to estimate individual external dose during time spent at home based on the airborne-based ambient dose.
In the current study, we used publicly available ambient dose rate data estimated from the airborne monitoring survey provided by the Japanese government. More accurate predictions of individual external doses could be possible if ambient dose rates and reduction factors corresponding to an individual's activity locations were prepared, but this would be impossible to perform for a large number of individuals. The current study relates the individual external doses to the publicly available ambient dose rates and with the activity-patterns of the individuals. The results provide, from a practical viewpoint, valuable information for understanding and estimating realistic individual external doses in the affected areas in Fukushima, especially for evacuees who want to know their individual external doses after returning to their original homes.
On May 3 Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (R) took the action Everytown for Gun Safety had urged by vetoing campus carry legislation that had been on his desk for over a month.
The legislation–HB 859–was passed by the Georgia House on February 22. On February 26, Deal took front and center in defending the bill, even suggesting that those who opposed it were using old arguments that had proven vacuous after other concealed carry expansions.
On March 11 the Senate concurred with Deal and passed the bill. But once it reached Deal's desk he grew quiet.
Yet the anti-gun crowd was not quiet. Breitbart News reported that Michael Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety launched an ad campaign against campus carry on March 7 and on April 25 REM frontman Michael Stipe begged Deal to keep law-abiding students disarmed.
In the end, Deal sided with Everytown and Stipe. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Deal vetoed HB 859 on Tuesday.

Screenshot of Saturday night tweet from the Oxford, Miss. Police Department.
A week after jokingly telling Ole Miss fans not to call 911 about Razorback Brandon Allen's career day, the Oxford, Miss. Police Department on Saturday again took note of Arkansas' senior quarterback.
In a Tweet posted after Allen led the Razorbacks to a 31-14 upset win over LSU, the Oxford Police Department said the Baton Rouge Police Department "maybe ... should have tried kicking [Allen] out of the stadium.
"We hear that helps," the humorous message added.
The Oxford agency last week earned widespread attention on the social network to the tune of more than 19,000 retweets, or shares, and more than 15,000 "likes."
That light-hearted tweet joked that asking police "to kick the Arkansas QB out of the stadium is not a legit reason to dial 911."
Allen that day threw for six touchdowns and 442 yards, leading the Razorbacks to a 53-52 overtime win over Ole Miss.

The Monkey Explains it All FX guides were created by Andi Allan (monkey_fx_guide@yahoo.com) as a response to a request for a simple explanation for how an envelope filter works, posted on the Harmony Central forums (a cappella.harmony-central.com). Due to enthusiastic response, they grew quickly to the format you see now, i.e. very scruffy indeed.
Feel free to quote the FX guide anywhere you like, as long as the first two paragraphs are included and the original text is not altered in any way.
Envelope Filter:
Envelope filter is a bit like an automatic wah (not to be confused with auto-wah). Imagine that you have a wah pedal and a well-trained monkey.
When you hit the strings hard, the monkey pushes the rocker pedal forwards. As the volume decreases the monkey pulls the rocker pedal back. So the volume envelope of the guitar signal determines the position of the pedal, via the monkey. Now imagine that the monkey is a tiny monkey hidden in a pedal, and that the rocker pedal is a rocker pedal hidden inside your stomp box. Then it's a simple step to imagine that there's actually no monkey or rocker pedal, and that it's all done in electronics.
So basically, if you hit the strings hard you get a treble boost, and as the signal from the strings dies away the boost fades. If you regulate how hard you play, you can get a similar sound to how many people use wah, emphasising the upper frequencies as you hit the strings.
Harmoniser:
A harmoniser is a specialised pitch shifter. I'll break out the monkeys again for an analogy-rich description, if I may.
Imagine that there is a well-trained monkey. This monkey has a pair of headphones on, through which he can hear what you're playing. He also has a guitar that sounds just like your one. There's a dial on the front of the box where you choose what key you're playing in, and another that lets you choose what interval you want (e.g. a fifth, a major third or whatever else). The monkey looks at what you've chosen on the two dials, hears what you're playing and plays a note at that interval in the scale you've chosen. His signal and yours are mixed together and fed back out.
As in previous analogies, imagine that the monkey is inside the pedal/rack unit, and is tiny, with a tiny guitar and a tiny pair of headphones. Then simply imagine that there isn't really a monkey, and that it's all done with some very clever electronics. Ta da!
Analog delay:
Imagine a line of laid back, hippy monkeys, each with a guitar just like yours. They're sitting on little stools in a cunning arrangement such that each monkey can only hear the monkey sat before him. The first monkey hears what you played, turns to the next monkey and plays it back to him. He then turns, and plays to the next monkey. At each stage, little mistakes are introduced due to the hippy monkeys' inherent laid-back-ness. At the end, the last monkey plays, and his guitar is connected to the output.
The monkeys are in a big big circle, and the first monkey, as well as hearing what you're playing, can also hear the last monkey - but not very well. There's a baffle between them, which cuts down how much he can hear. The first monkey plays both what you're playing and what he can hear of what the last monkey is playing, and this is passed on as before.
Now imagine the monkeys are tiny, as before, with tiny guitars and tiny stools and a tiny baffle. They're in a box. A knob labelled feedback controls the baffle. Then, kapoosh! The monkeys disappear and are replaced by a Bucket Brigade chip, and off we go.
Digital delay:
Exactly the same as analog delay, but there are many more monkeys, and they're all actuaries and very precise. Some people miss the laid-back-ness of the hippy monkeys, but many like knowing that little actuary monkeys are taking very good care of what they're playing. Some of the monkeys know special tricks, like making what they play come out of the output even though they're not the last monkey.
Chorus:
Thousands of monkeys are sat on stools in a large hall. Each has a guitar like yours (getting repetitive yet?). They are all sat at different distances from you, and hence hear what you're playing at different times. As soon as you start to play, they all copy what you're playing. In an analog chorus, laid-back hippy monkeys (see analog delay) are used; in a digital delay straight-laced actuary monkeys are used. Because they are all playing just slightly out of sync with you, it gives a much richer, fuller sound. In most types of chorus, the monkeys are actually sitting on an old-style fairground carousel, and therefore each gets nearer and further away from you, hence playing with a different delay as the carousel turns and giving a warbled sound.
Yada yada tiny tiny monkeys yada yada. Nice knob controls how fast the carousel spins. Ta da!
Phaser:
Similar, overall, to chorus, but there are only, typically, 2, 4, 8, or maybe 12 monkeys in total. Phaser gives a sucked, whooshing noise.
Flanger:
Two monkeys. One has a guitar just like yours, but with a tremolo bridge (if yours doesnt have one). He plays the same notes as you, but the other monkey is quite mischievous and is constantly wobbling the tremolo arm up and down. When the sound of the first monkeys guitar is mixed with yours, the subtle pitch differences create a whooshing, almost jet-like sound. Some flangers use several teams of monkey guitarists and tremolo wobblers.
Compression:
Picture the scene. Sicily, 1947. A monkey. With a volume pedal. He has tinnitus, so he doesn't like loud noises, but needs things to be a certain volume level in order to hear them, poor little mite. He is wearing headphones. When you play, if it's too loud, he turns the volume down a little. If it's too quiet, he turns it up. He can do this quite quickly if he wants, but there's a big dial in front of him, telling him how fast he's allowed to turn the volume control. There's another control that determines how loud his headphones are compared to your guitar.
Pop the little chap in a box and paint it (traditionally) blue and off you go. Oh, it might be a good idea to replace him with some sort of electronics gubbins, to save his poor hearing.
Some compressors allow you to have a little effect loop in between your guitar and his headphones, so that you could (for instance) have him only listen to the bass part of your guitar sound, but work the volume control according to that.
Pitch Correction:
So, there's this monkey, goes into a bar (stop me if you've heard this one before), and he's got a little guitar just like yours with him. He also has a fancy Strobe tuner, and makes sure that he's perfectly in tune, and a music stand and the tab for your set. When you start playing, he unplugs you from the amp, sticks the cable into an A/B box, and plugs himself into the A/B box and then that into the amp. Both of you then start playing at the same time. If you go a little bit out of tune for any reason, the monkey carries on playing, and because of his shiny strobe tuner, he's always playing the right notes. He hits the A/B box pedal and plays until you get your act back together.
Just occasionally, you really muff up your lines. When this happens, the monkey throws his guitar to the floor in disgust and jumps on it, with bizarre noises as a result. He then quickly pulls out another guitar and carries on playing. But you know there'll be trouble later.
Solid State overdrives:
Take an infinite number of monkeys, each with a guitar. The first is a third the size you are, and plays notes at 3 times the pitch of yours. The second is 1/5th the size of you and plays at five times your pitch, and the third is 1/7th the size of you and plays at seven times your pitch, and so on for the rest. The smaller monkeys are quieter than the larger ones, as youd expect. They all play along with you, and the sound from each guitar is added into your signal. This gives quite a harsh fuzzy sound.
Tube overdrive:
As above, but now the monkeys are different sizes. The first monkey and guitar are half the size of yours, and therefore play an octave higher than you. The next is a quarter the size of you, and plays two octaves higher, the next 1/6th the size of you and plays at 6 times your pitch and so on. Again, this gives a fuzzier sound, but one that's much smoother and easier on the ears than the SS overdrives.
Fuzz:
Essentially the same as solid-state overdrive, but the monkeys play louder, with the end result that the sound coming out is very very messy indeed. The monkeys particularly like this, because they get to play good and loud and generally make a racket. Fuzz monkeys are generally fed the most bananas.
Boutique FX:
Boutique FX function in basically the same way as non-boutique FX, with the following differences:
1) They only use free-range monkeys, who are very well fed and trained and love their work.
2) They are almost exclusively made with analog, hippy monkeys.
3) The monkeys, instead of having stools, have comfy designer chairs to sit on. Lay-z-boys are particularly popular. The boxes they live in are also brightly decorated, which the monkeys love.
These factors combine to make many people think that boutique FX produce better sound, due to the happier monkeys. However, these monkeys are very expensive to raise, and so the boutique FX tend to cost many more bananas to buy. There is much debate as to whether it's worth it.
Univibe:
Again, a monkey sitting on a stool. He plays the same thing as you, but theres another monkey spinning the first monkeys stool rapidly. This makes the first monkey dizzy, and the sound his guitar makes is therefore rather warbly. Its like a combination of flanger and chorus. Univibe is seen as rather cruel to the monkey on the stool, and therefore many guitarists prefer the sound of a Leslie speaker cabinet, in which a speaker (or two speakers) is/are rotated by a motor. Many say that the Leslie is much superior in sound as well, but theyre bigger, heavier and more expensive than even a boutique monkey based univibe.
As the rich countries of the West lock horns with the developing world at Paris on the question of who will cut how many carbon emissions, a new study by Oxfam shows the jaw dropping chasm between emissions of the two sides. The richest 10 percent people of the world are responsible for almost half of all global carbon emissions while the poorest 50 percent of the world – some 3.5 billion people – cause just 10 percent of it in one year.Here's another way of looking at this: a person belonging to the poorest half of the world emits just 1.57 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year while a person belonging to the richest 10% emits 17.6 tonnes – over 11 times more.If you compare the richest 10 percent with the poorest 10 percent, the gap is mind boggling. The carbon footprint of the richest is 60 times larger than that of the poorest at a global level.Why is this relevant to the Paris talks? Because in the smoke and mirrors of global negotiations, the commitment of the rich countries to their own lifestyles – and its humongous carbon footprint - is so entrenched that they are unable to give it up, forcing changes on the struggling poor of the developing world. This is all the more unjust because it is the developing world that is going to bear the brunt of extreme climate change effects as a recent World Bank study of 52 countries showed.Oxfam has made these calculations for consumption rather than production as is normally done. In this way, what happens is that if a soft drink made in China is consumed in the US, the emissions in production, transportation etc. are counted in US. This is more logical as the reason for making the drink was a demand in US, as was its ultimate destiny.The vast majority of the richest 10 percent of the world stay in the OECD countries – North America, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. In fact a third of them stay in the US. So the culpability of the rich countries in emissions is reaffirmed, with the additional information that it is their profligate consumerism that is driving emissions.Where does India fit into this picture? Oxfam's estimates reveal that per person emissions of India's richest 10 percent are about 2 tonnes which is just a quarter of even the poorest 50 percent of US whose emissions are 8.57 tonnes.If you compare the poorest half of the population of India and US, the contrast is even starker. India's poorest 50 percent population has a per capita emission of a mere 0.42 tonnes while for the US it is 8.57 tonnes per year, over 20 times more.This incredible equation shows the wide and deep chasm between consumption driven emissions in the first world and the third world. It also shows the locked down nature of the rich economies where even the poor cause more emissions than the rich of the third world.So, what does it mean for the climate change negotiations in Paris? While climate change is a global crisis and everybody has to chip in, the magnitude of the problem is directly linked to the lifestyle choices and economic trajectories of the rich countries. Without even going into the question of historical responsibility, even on the basis of current emissions, the scale of emissions from the richer bloc is orders of magnitude more than India and other third world countries. Hence the richer bloc of countries need to not only make deeper cuts, they also need to pay more to compensate for the damage caused by climatic changes in the third world.

This is NFL Rookie Diaries, a series where NFL rookies take you inside their new lives as NFL players. From adjusting to playing the game at its highest level, to learning the locker room culture, to adjusting to life off the field, these rookies tell it like it is. Welcome to the NFL.
***
Fact: You can't beat Von Miller at Connect Four.
I know, because as a rookie, that's one of my duties. I carry stuff in from practice like every rookie in the history of the NFL probably has, and I have to play Von Miller in Connect Four. Every day. And he's got it down to a science. He's the master. I've gotten him a couple of times, but he's as close to unbeatable as it gets. And he'll let you know it, too.
I met Von in Miami before I was drafted — before I became a Bronco. Coming out of college he was a guy I looked up to as a pass-rusher, and there I was, standing on the sidewalk listening to him talk about NFL locker room culture. Next thing I know, we're talking football, and he's demonstrating proper footwork and giving me tips right there on the sidewalk as people walk by.
He didn't know me at the time. He didn't know what team was going to draft me. And there he was, trying to educate me and make me better.
When you're a first-round pick, a lot of times you just get thrown into the fire. You have coaches there to help you on the field, but don't have anybody there to guide you on how to do the right things off it, or how to take care of your body.
Me? I'm in the ideal situation. I'm here with probably two of the greatest outside linebackers in the game in Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware. I can ask questions and learn from them every day. That's an advantage most rookies don't have.
Take Von, for instance.
You can tell watching tape that Von is an incredible athlete. But when you see him up close, it's insane. I watch how quick his feet are — how many steps he takes and how he sets himself up to swipe the blocker's hand and dip his shoulder to get around the edge. I think, OK, let me try that. Let me take my steps like this and work it into my own style.
His get-off is the fastest I've ever seen. He just explodes off the ball. So one day at practice, I just walked up to him and said, “Hey man, I'm having trouble. My get-off is not looking like yours. What am I doing wrong?” He bent down, grabbed my feet and put them in the right stance, then showed me how to lean — how to balance my body to maximize my get-off speed. I started working on that on my own, and next thing you know, I'm getting off the ball faster. I could notice the difference. All because he was there, and I asked.
Von is the guy who teaches me the physical stuff. DeMarcus is the veteran — the guy whose brain I just want to pick. He's so much more technical. We'll be watching film, and he'll stop, rewind, and replay it in slow motion.
“Hey, did you guys see that? The quarterback is leaning before he snaps the ball. If you key on that, it can help you get off the ball faster.”
We're all looking around at each other.
I didn't notice that … you?
Nope, me neither.
DeMarcus picks up on things nobody else in the room sees because he's just been doing it for so much longer.
Von is a freak athlete, but DeMarcus has a totally different approach to the game. He sets guys up. He has enough experience to know what he's going to get from an opponent and how to expose his weakness.
When we were playing the Raiders earlier this year, I was going up against a bigger guy. DeMarcus came up to me and said, “You're strong and you're fast. That guy's bigger than you. You gotta be able to set him up. Give him a couple of speed rushes to take him up the field and get him moving back a little bit. Then hit him with a power rush. He'll be on his heels and you can shed him easier. The quarterback is gonna step up in the pocket and you'll be right there.”
And that's exactly what happened. The quarterback stepped up in he pocket, and I was right there to get the sack.
As a rookie, I feel like I'm still trying to find out what I do best. What's my go-to? What's my move? What do I do that's better than what other guys can do? And having Von and DeMarcus has helped me tremendously. I can learn the physical tools from Von and the mental game from DeMarcus. From there, I can start figuring things out for myself and putting the pieces together to define the kind of player I want to be.
They look out for me off the field, too.
A blizzard swept through Denver recently, and I wasn't prepared. I drive a Dodge Challenger. I live in the mountains and I don't own an SUV. Rookie mistake.
So I called Von.
“Hey man. There's no way I'm gonna make it through the snow … Can I use one of your SUVs to help me get to the practice facility?
He didn't even think twice.
DeMarcus has opened his home to me. One day he came up to me and said, “If you need to get some treatment, you can come to my house. I have some laser therapy that'll help get you right. We can watch film, too. Break stuff down.” It's like an open invitation whenever I need it — to get healthier, to get better.
You hear stories around the league about being a rookie and being at the bottom of the totem pole. Coming into our locker room, it's the complete opposite. T.J. Ward, Chris Harris, Aqib Talib — all these guys talk to me and take the time to share their knowledge to help me understand everything. Not just the game, but this whole new lifestyle.
But they've still got me carrying helmets in from practice.
I wasn't supposed to be in Denver. I wasn't supposed to fall to 23rd in the draft. But I made a mistake before the draft and paid the price. Now, all I can do is work my ass off to be the best player I can be on the field and the best teammate and person off it. Everything happens for a reason, and at the end of the day, I don't think there's a better place I could have landed than right here with the Broncos. I get Von and DeMarcus and the other guys to learn from and support me, and as a rookie, I get a chance to compete for the playoffs and for a Super Bowl.
And maybe if I play my cards right, I'll get the ultimate reward …
The secret to mastering Connect Four.
The perpetual battle of whether states' rights should trump civil rights continues in Washington today. A three-judge panel in a D.C. District Court will hear arguments this week on whether Texas can demand voters present certain types of photo ID in order to cast a ballot.
Texas, along with other states that have historically discriminated against voters of color fall under “covered jurisdictions” that must obtain pre-clearance before changing voting districts or regulations. The Department of Justice contends that more than 600,000 voters will be disenfranchised because of Texas' law–most of whom are Latino–and denied The Lone Star State pre-clearance on the voter ID law under the Voting Rights Act. Rather than comply, Texas sued. The case challenges a cornerstone piece of civil rights legislation that protects the right of every citizen to vote.
One of the three judges on the panel hearing, and ultimately issuing a decision on the case, is no stranger to civil rights. Judge Robert Wilkins was a budding lawyer in 1992 when he was pulled over by Maryland State Police. The case set the term “driving while black” into the national vernacular, and resulted in a groundbreaking settlement that made it mandatory for Maryland officers to note the race and gender of drivers who were pulled over and searched. Other states followed suit, and an executive order on racial profiling was also issued. As a target of racial profiling by Maryland state officers, Wilkins is likely to understand what's at stake this week when Texas insists its state's rights are more important than the civil rights of marginalized voters.
This year's iteration of Farming Simulator will not only introduce female avatars, but will also include pig farming. The latter has somewhat upset the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Foundation, and it has in turn issued a letter to the game's developers—Giants Software—urging them to add abattoirs to Farming Simulator 17.
“Farming Simulator 17 should either show the nightmarish reality endured by pigs at the abattoir or change into Vegan Farming Simulator 17 and let players grow crops—to do anything else would be dishonest”, says PETA's European outreach liaison Harriet Barclay in a statement. “PETA urges anyone who considers pig-slaughter footage too gruesome to include in a simulator game to rid their real-life plates of animal corpses and switch to cruelty-free vegan foods.”
Barclay also penned the letter which goes into rather graphic detail with regards to the process of preparing and slaughtering of pigs. Here's a less gruesome summary:
“Following the announcement that Farming Simulator 17 will depict pig farming, we are writing to encourage you to include video footage from abattoirs in the game. To simulate the farming industry accurately, Farming 17 would need to show all aspects of pig farming, including what happens to pigs when they're sent to slaughter.
“We ask that you include footage of this in your game to show players the horrific reality of the pig-farming industry.”
The letter in full can be read here, and we've reached out to Giants for comment. Farming Simulator 17, with or without graphic animal slaughter, is due October 26.

Two chimps walking together at Chimp Haven in Keithville, La. The government is about to retire most of the chimpanzees who've spent their lives in U.S. research labs. (Gerald Herbert/AP)
In a significant step toward ending controversial biomedical research using chimpanzees, the federal government announced a decision Wednesday to retire all but about 50 of the animals available for testing and retire them to sanctuaries.
The National Institutes of Health has been phasing out its funding and use of research chimps for at least two years but still houses nearly 400 chimps in facilities across the country. All except up to 50 of those remaining will be placed in sanctuaries in the coming months, NIH Director Francis S. Collins said.
“Americans have benefitted greatly from the chimpanzees' service to biomedical research, but new scientific methods and technologies have rendered their use in research largely unnecessary,” Collins said in a statement.
Later, in a telephone news conference, he called the decision a milestone, saying chimps are “special animals, our closest relatives” whose DNA is “98 percent . . . the same as ours.”
The announcement by NIH comes two weeks after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to place both wild and captive chimps on the endangered species list for the first time. Previously, captive chimps were listed as threatened, a designation that carries fewer protections. The split listing under the Endangered Species Act allowed NIH to fund medical experiments using captive chimps.
Animal rights activists who pressured NIH for decades to end its testing of chimps saw the Fish and Wildlife proposal as a direct message to the health agency. The Humane Society of the United States, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Jane Goodall Institute hailed the two decisions.
Chimpanzees are under a growing threat. More than a million have disappeared in the wild since 1900, according to estimates by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Fewer than 300,000 remain as people invade their habitats.
Wednesday's announcement had no bearing on rhesus macaques and other monkeys NIH continues to use for invasive biomedical research. “This set of decisions relates solely to chimpanzees. There are no implications for other animals. That research NIH believes is still vital,” Collins said.
Ongoing behavioral research using apes can continue until their scheduled completion in the next year or two, NIH officials said. The 50 chimps that will remain available for new research will be chosen over the next several months.
NIH has 150 sanctuary spaces available. As of October, about 110 chimps were already housed at one sanctuary, Chimp Haven in Louisiana, at a yearly cost of $2 million. Chimps placed in sanctuaries are protected and can't be moved back to research.
NIH officials said the agency will seek $3 million from Congress for 2014 to house more animals in sanctuaries. Congress provided up to $30 million for sanctuaries as part of the 2000 CHIMP Act, but NIH is $800,000 from reaching that limit.
“This is certainly a monumental moment for the chimpanzees,” said Kathleen Conlee, vice president of animal research issues for the Humane Society. “It has been a long road to get here and now it is time to roll up our sleeves and focus on getting those animals to the peaceful sanctuary they so deserve.”
Conlee's group, along with the zoo association and the Goodall Institute, named after the famed chimpanzee researcher, was instrumental in pushing Fish and Wildlife toward its proposal, filing a petition to list captive great apes as endangered in 2010.
The groups had long said that medical research using chimps was unnecessary. In January, an advisory panel for NIH agreed and issued 28 recommendations, including the retirement of all but up to 50 chimps, to ensure that at least some research using higher primates can continue that might be crucial to human health.
Collins accepted nearly all the recommendations.
The panel, called the Council of Councils, determined that chimpanzees should be used in research only if the knowledge obtained will advance public health and can be found no other way. NIH maintains that research on chimps led to breakthroughs that provided vaccines for hepatitis.
The council deemed that chimpanzees should be treated well in pens with far more space than the current average of 25 square feet per animal.
At the headquarters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in Norfolk, the organization was “popping champagne corks . . . to celebrate the news that [NIH] has brought the U.S. one step closer to ending a shameful 90-year history of treating chimpanzees as disposable laboratory tools and ignoring the apes' profound psychological and physical needs,” said Justin Goodman, a director at PETA.
All party Leaders in this election will -- or at least should -- tell you that they want to see more women in politics, and that Canadians would be better served by a more balanced representation in the House of Commons.
But what sets Tom Mulcair apart from Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau, is that he won't simply wring his hands and lament the sad state of affairs. He'll back up his desire to change the face of politics in this country with concrete action to get the job done.
I'm a woman proudly running for office with Tom Mulcair's team. That pride, in no small part, is a result of his clear track-record of backing his principled words up with decisive action.
His action to advance the equality of women within the NDP and in Canadian politics takes shape in at least three major, tangible ways.
First, getting women elected to the House of Commons; second, making sure women's voices are heard loud and clear in parliament; and third, taking principled stands against policies that negatively affect women, and for policies that advance the equality of women in Canada.
On all three fronts, there is no question that Tom's action speaks much louder than words.
On electing women to sit in the House of Commons, it's becoming a well-known fact that, for the second straight federal election, the NDP has the highest-ever number of women running for office. One hundred and forty-seven women are running for the NDP, or 43.5 per cent of our 338-member slate of nominees. This number shatters Canada's previous record of 124 women candidates (40 per cent of 308), which was an impressive bar set by the NDP under Jack Layton' leadership in the last campaign.
In every other party's slate of candidates, men outnumber women by more than two-to-one.
The incontrovertible reality is that more women candidates mean more women elected, which was on full display with the NDP in 2011. We fielded the largest number of women candidates in Canadian history, and then we elected the most women MPs in Canadian history.
Second, on ensuring the voices of women are heard in Ottawa once elected, Tom's record could not be more clear. Each Leader in parliament surrounds themselves with a group of MPs in prominent positions called House Officers. These MPs are very influential in caucus decision-making, and in providing strategic advice to the Leader. Under Tom's leadership, six-out-of-nine NDP House Officers were women, including two deputy Leaders, the Whip and the NDP Caucus Chair.
By contrast, Trudeau and Harper asked just one woman to serve among their 10 House officers. Trudeau chose men for five out of six Liberal House officer positions, and Harper chose men for all four of his. A troubling record for both leaders.
Third, on making the right choices on tough questions and issues in Parliament, once again Tom has proven that he'll back up his principles with action time after time.
In the last parliament, the NDP caucus brought forward a law to require gender parity on the boards of our crown corporations; they succeeded in having the tax on feminine hygiene products removed for all Canadian women; and they voted unanimously to stop a parliamentary committee from re-opening the abortion question.
My experience as both a journalist and moderator of the International G(irls) 20 Summit has taught me that "women's issues" are actually priorities for all Canadians who want to build a country that is fairer, stronger and more inclusive for all.
For example, Tom's plan for $15-per-day childcare plan will create a million new childcare spaces across Canada, and will help level the playing field for young mothers who want to return to the workforce. In Quebec, since the introduction of affordable childcare, 70,000 more women have joined the workforce. While there is no doubt that this ranks as a top priority for women, it's also an important policy for families, for children, for communities and for the economy. And far from being too costly or difficult to implement, it's actually a plan Canada can no longer afford to do without.
In Tom Mulcair, the NDP has a Leader with a concrete plan to repair the damage of Stephen Harper, the courage of his convictions, and a track record of backing those convictions up with action -- just like he did when he voted against C-51.
Tom Mulcair's principled approach is becoming a hallmark of his leadership in Ottawa.
He strongly believes there should be more women in the House of Commons, and that they should play leadership roles when they get there. And, most importantly, he backs those words up with action.

This week will be crucial for Ted Cruz' future, according to Chris Cillizza and Sean Sullivan at the Washington Post, with the fate of ObamaCare, the debt ceiling, and continued funding for the government at stake. It doesn't depend on victory so much as it does to his impact on opposition to ObamaCare, the two write:
To be clear: A Cruz bounce back should not be judged solely on whether he can round up the 40 additional votes necessary to keep a bill that keeps the government funded but strips the Obamacare defunding off the floor of the Senate. Unless there is a major shift among Republicans in the Senate, Cruz won't be able to find those 40 votes. Instead, they key to measuring Cruz's success will be what approach he takes to making his opposition to Obamacare known and what (if any) impact it has. Does Cruz launch a traditional talking filibuster, a doomed but principled effort to show how strongly he opposes the measure? If he doesn't, is he able to convince/cajole a handful of wavering Republican senators to vote against cloture? Can Cruz make enough of a stand in the Senate to stiffen the spines of House Republicans — assuming the legislation, sans defunding Obamacare, is headed their way some time in the next week? Cruz seems little interested in making nice with his colleagues — Democrats or Republicans. And, that's fine — heck, it probably works in his favor politically at a time when people loathe political Washington and its inhabitants. But, what Cruz must prove this week is that he's more than just talk; that when he has the chance to act on principle, he does everything he can to do exactly that. (Think Sen. Rand Paul's filibuster on drones.) In short: It's put up or shut up time for Ted Cruz this week.
He's going into the week with considerable headwinds on this effort, at least according to a new poll out by CNBC. Respondents lean against defunding ObamaCare at all — and a wide majority opposes a government shutdown to force it, 59% to just 19% supporting it:
The CNBC All-America Economic Survey of 800 people across the country conducted by Hart-McInturff, finds that, in general, Americans oppose defunding Obamacare by a plurality of 44 percent to 38 percent. Opposition to defunding increases sharply when the issue of shutting down the government and defaulting is included. In that case, Americans oppose defunding 59 percent to 19 percent, with 18 percent of respondents unsure. The final 4 percent is a group of people who want to defund Obamacare, but become unsure when asked if they still hold that view if it means shutting down the government. … In general, men are roughly split on the issue, with 43 percent supporting defunding, 42 percent opposing and 15 percent unsure. But when the issue of a government shutdown and default is included their support declines: 56 percent oppose defunding and only 14 percent solidly favor the measure. Women are more firmly opposed to defunding the new health care law under any circumstances, with 47 percent opposed, 33 percent in favor and 20 percent unsure.
Even while a majority of Republicans support defunding (51/36), a near-majority oppose a government shutdown over the issue (36/48 for shutdown). Independents break even more harshly against both, narrowly opposing defunding (40/44) but coming out almost 5:1 against a government shutdown, 14/65. In fact, the only demographic that favors this strategy, according to CNBC, is the Tea Party demo, which supports a shutdown strategy with a 54% majority.
This differs sharply from a Rasmussen poll last week on the same subject. That survey found 51% supporting a government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans could decide what to cut from the “health care law at existing levels of spending,” but that's a little different than what's being asked here. Also, that question followed at the end of a series of questions about overall federal spending and the use of a shutdown to get cuts overall, which would tend to bias the specific question being reported. Even with that, only 20% thought a shutdown would be good for the economy, with 56% believing it to be bad. A shutdown presumably would have to have a hope of having a major impact on spending, ObamaCare and overall, or hope that the bluff would get the cuts desired.
Unfortunately for backers of this strategy, it won't work without a government shutdown, as David Freddoso explains:
The funding for Obamacare does not depend on the government spending bill (the “continuing resolution”) that Cruz has now announced he will block from getting a vote on the Senate floor. Obamacare gets funded whether that bill passes or not. So there's no such thing as funding the rest of the government and “leaving out” funding for Obamacare. If there was, this whole thing might almost make sense. There would be real leverage. The whole concept of “defund” is to block funding for other, unrelated government functions until Democrats agree to trade away funding for Obamacare. This detail is vital — and I'm convinced that most conservatives who have bought into this strategy have been misled to believe we can hold off Obamacare for a while with a government shutdown. Cruz has repeatedly said, as he does in the interview above, that he's just trying to keep Democrats from funding Obamacare. But that's a bit misleading. Obamacare is already funded, and that won't change if this bill gets stalled by a filibuster. During the shutdown, the Marines don't get paid, but Obamacare gets funded.
Tom Coburn has been trying to explain that for weeks. The problem is that almost all of the funding ObamaCare gets is through already-levied taxes and fees passed into statutory law, not in the budget process. The only way to prevent its funding, especially that of the exchanges and subsidies that Tea Party conservatives most want to stop, is either through full repeal or delay. A government shutdown doesn't stop the exchanges from going online or the subsidies from being paid out in a little over a week from now, nor does it arguably stop the salaries of those who operate the exchanges or cut the subsidy checks. ObamaCare is in the same class of statutory spending as Medicare and Social Security, and even the bureaucracies of those organizations continue to get paid in a government shutdown thanks to their statutory requirements for spending.
We will undoubtedly see more polling on these issues this week, and Cruz and his allies had better hope for better numbers than this. Democrats have every reason to encourage a shutdown over this issue in order to distract from (a) the debacle of the ObamaCare rollout that will begin in earnest on October 1, and (b) the question of why every other stakeholder in ObamaCare got a delay at the expense of the consumer, who got stuck with adhering to the individual mandate.
Edmonton police said Monday that a man had been charged in connection to the city's first traffic fatality of the year.
On Friday, January 20, 2017, officers were called to a two-vehicle collision after 3:10 p.m., in the area of 144 Avenue and Ebbers Boulevard.
Reports indicated a 2003 Toyota Corolla had been travelling southbound on Ebbers Boulevard and was trying to turn left, eastbound down 144 Avenue at a stop sign, when it was hit by a Ford F150, that had been travelling westbound at 111 kilometres per hour (in a 60 kilometre per hour zone).
Paramedics responded, treated the 43-year-old male driver of the car and took him to hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.
The driver of the truck, identified by police as Gary Stokes, 47, suffered non-life threatening injuries in the crash, Stokes has been charged with speeding under the Traffic Safety Act.
Drugs and alcohol are not believed to have been factors in this crash.
Stokes is expected to appear in court March 16.
Yesterday my partner Albert and I sat down with the people behind Americans Elect. For those that don't know, Americans Elect is an online third party movement. In their words, "Pick A President, Not A Party."
Here's how it works (in short):
They are going to get on the ballot in all 50 states this fall. They've already gotten on the ballot in many of the states.
They have created a website where anyone can choose to run and where candidates can be drafted. Here's the current roster of candidates.
Over the summer, they will conduct an online convention and a single candidate will be nominated to run on their ticket.
That's basically it.
There are a number of cool things about the online service they have built. You answer questions about issues and they build an online profile of you. Then they match you with candidates that share your views. If you want to try that out, go sign up and you will be taken through the questions in a few minutes. It's fun to see where you end up even if you have no intention of voting for a third party candidate.
I'm sure a lot of people think this is a nutty idea. But I don't. So many people bitch and moan that they don't like our current system. Yet the do nothing to change it. The people behind Americans Elect have done something about it. That's progress.
For TV fans, spring is a double-edged sword.
As the 2016-2017 season wraps up with a slew of highly anticipated season (and series) finales before summer TV doldrums hit, the major networks are determining which shows will make the cut and which shows will go the way of “Blood & Oil.” See, you already forgot that existed.
Every year around May, TV essentially turns into the “Hunger Games” with ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and The CW debuting their fall TV slates to advertisers at the upfronts. Enter the cancellation bear quietly claiming its victims to make room for the new kids on the block.
With an upcoming TV season full of reboots and revivals ― we're looking at you “American Idol” and “Will & Grace” ― and a host of promising new shows that will seriously test your DVR storage capabilities, it's time to pay our respects to the dearly departed and praise the TV gods for giving our faves another chance.
Here are notable series that have been either renewed, canceled, set to end after the current season or are still awaiting a pickup.
This is not a comprehensive list and we haven't learned the fate of every single one of the HUNDREDS of shows that air each season. But as we learn more, we'll be continually updating this list, so check back for the latest.

It feels like I'm reporting on the next-gen AMD hardware everyday now, which we pretty much are, but the latest we have on the Radeon Fury X is in the form of some new photos. We have previously reported that Fury X is around 50% faster than the R9 290X, and it beats the Titan X in a single OpenCL benchmark.
The new shots show off the liquid cooling on Fury X, the backplate, and the red LED Radeon logo on the card. In the above shots, we can see the Radeon logo lit up beautifully, and in the second shot, we can see it in more detail. Above the glowing Radeon logo is a dual BIOS switch, so you can overclock until your card fails, and then switch over to the good BIOS.
AMD will reportedly have a 300W TDP on the Radeon Fury X, with the card powered by two 8-pin PCIe power connectors. All of this will arrive in a much smaller card than we've ever received for a flagship GPU. Around the back of the Fury X, we have some tubing coming out of it for its watercooling, as well as a matte black PCB and backplate.
Versatile player returns for a second spell
AFC Wimbledon today completed a first summer signing after beating off competition from elsewhere to bring Jon Meades back for a second spell.
Still only 23 years of age, Jon had offers from other League 2 clubs after leaving Oxford United, but he decided that a Wimbledon return was his number one choice.
Of course, Jon was a popular figure during his last spell at the club on loan as he made 25 appearances during AFC Wimbledon's dramatic survival in 2012/13, a campaign that also ended with a Young Player of the Year award for the Welshman.
Having featured at left-back and in various positions across the midfield during that season, Neal Ardley views the player's versatility as a big plus.
Speaking during an interview with Dons Player, Neal said: “Jon will naturally want to hold down one position. I have told him it is up to him if he wants to do that, but he can be an outstanding left-back, an outstanding left wing-back if need be, and an outstanding central midfielder. He has all the physical and technical attributes to do that. Jon still lacks that little bit of experience, but he is powerful, 6 ft 2 inches tall and can handle the physical side of this league. I think by the end of the season we could have a very good player.
“Jon is a very under-rated player and we tried to keep him here, but Oxford lured him with a very good deal. That was unfortunate at the time. Sometimes people say you should not go back to a club further down the line, but we proved with George Francomb that a player can come back and be a success.
“Jon had a terrible time in his first season at Oxford after breaking his ankle and then he ended up not getting a run of games under different managers. I think it was a big pull for him to come back and play for a manager who knows how good he is and believes in him. At this stage of his career he needs to have two big seasons to re-establish himself.”
Born in Cardiff, Jon joined his hometown club at the age of nine and progressed through the academy under the guidance of Neal Ardley, before making one first-team appearance. He joined AFC Bournemouth in 2012 and he has also had a loan spell at Moss FK in Norway.
An extensive update with Neal Ardley will follow soon on Dons Player, along with an exclusive interview with Jon Meades.
After the no-show of a new Star Trek trailer at CinemaCon this week, it was discovered that Paramount was saving up for something bigger – a fan event, the first of its kind, to be held in Los Angeles in May. Details of the event have now surfaced.

Represent! is your eye on how well government serves citizens and the public interest in Southern California. KPCC's politics and government team posts frequently on transparency, civic engagement, reform efforts and accountability. We invite your comments and suggestions — follow us on Twitter at the links below.
Even before this week's paltry turnout for the California primary, local officials already had reason to worry about disengaged voters.
Last year's mayoral election — a competitive contest between Eric Garcetti and Wendy Greuel — drew fewer than one-in-four voters to the polls. With that in mind, the city formed an Election Reform Commission, which recommends municipal elections be moved to coincide with state and federal races.
The commission, jointly appointed by Mayor Garcetti and council President Herb Wesson, wants to see city elections moved to June and November of even-numbered years. That would put them on the same cycle as presidential and gubernatorial elections. Under the current system, L.A. city elections are held in March and May of odd-numbered years.
"Every single study that examines turnout shows that moving it to the even-numbered years increases Latino, African-American, Asian-American and youth [turnout]," said Fernando Guerra, chair of the commission and director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University. "That's not theory. That is hundreds of very well-refined academic, rigorous studies."
Under the off-cycle elections, turnout has dwindled. The competitive mayoral race between Garcetti and Wendy Greuel last year resulted in just 23 percent turnout. Twenty years ago, 45 percent of registered voters turned out for the race between Richard Riordan and Mike Woo, and back in 1969, there was 75 percent turnout when Mayor Sam Yorty defeated Tom Bradley.
The commission's recommendation, however, was not unanimous. The decision came on a 6-3 vote. A minority report argued the move would decrease participation, limit opportunities to debate local issues and make campaigning even more expensive. A third report from Commissioner Jeffery Daar recommended the city hold elections over a weekend to increase turnout.
One commissioner, Larry Levine, argued that the added expense of campaigning in an even-numbered year would ultimately make it more difficult for candidates to communicate their messages. He also noted that some voters never make it to the end of a long ballot, where the municipal races would appear.
"The turnout drops as you go down the ballot," Levine said. "People don't get [engaged] by the bottom of the ballot. They come out for the top of the ballot."
A study by the U.S. Census, cited in the commission's report, found Americans say they do not vote because they're too busy, they're uninterested in the issues and they don't like the candidates.
The commission's report was forwarded to the Los Angeles City Council's Rules, Elections and Intergovernmental Relations Committee, which is expected to take up the issue at its June 20 meeting.
The Zimbabwe government is overseeing the return of a white farmer to land that was seized from him at gunpoint, in what it hailed as a sign of the new president's "inclusiveness".
Rob Smart, 71, whooped with joy this week when he was told that he can return to his farm in eastern Zimbabwe - the only home he has ever known.
He and his family, including his young grandchildren and many of their workers, were evicted at gunpoint from their farm in the east of the country nearly six months ago by several gangs loyal to former first lady Grace Mugabe.
Former president Robert Mugabe, 93. was forced to resign last month after 37 years in power after a coup d'etat, in which he was succeeded by his former ally Emmerson Mnangagwa.
Mr Mugabe supported land invasions from 2000 which saw about 4,000 white farmers evicted, sometimes violently. Mr Smart told Reuters that Mr Mnangagwa, personally oversaw his return after he heard about the case.
“Apparently Mnangagwa saw that and flipped his lid,” Mr Smart said. One of those who engineered the invasion was Bishop Trevor Manhanga, who leads a church known as the Pentecostal Assemblies of Zimbabwe.

First Appearance: Iron Man I#120 (March 1979)
Powers/Abilities: Uranus Bliss possessed no known superhuman abilities. Considering herself a proper woman accustomed to being treated with regard, Uranus could grow incensed when she felt offended or disrespected. After repeated, rough run ins with Anthony Stark, she was ready to belt him for his boorish behavior. She also had a seemingly unlimited supply of derogatory terms to describe Stark's perceived lack of manners. A recreational gambler, Uranus wore orthopedic shoes, sometimes used a cane and was aware of air pockets' effects on kidneys during airplane travel. Bliss liked to wear oversized hats, even indoors and on planes. She always adorned them with a single, white decorative marguerite.
Height: 5" (by approximation)
Weight: 115 lbs (by approximation)
Eyes: Brown
Hair: Brown
History:
(Iron Man I#120 - BTS) - Deciding she had earned a vacation, Uranus Bliss booked a trip to the Mediterranean and boarded a Boeing 747 jumbo jet bound for France along with, among others, Anthony Stark.
(Iron Man I#120) - Uranus was in the aircraft's restroom when somewhere over the Atlantic, the plane was struck by a tank (hurled by the Sub-Mariner during an unrelated conflict on a nearby island). Stark immediately rushed to the lavatory to change into his Iron Man gear, but found it was still occupied by Uranus, who finally responded to Stark's frantic banging on the door, by telling him to hold his horses even if all those air pockets were wreaking havoc on his kidneys. Not giving her a moment to finish, Stark grabbed Uranus and moved her out of the way, toppling over the startled woman in the process. Even as Tony apologized, an annoyed and enraged Bliss called him a philistine.
(Iron Man I#123 - BTS) - Despite the fact her plane was forced to make a sea landing, Uranus finally made it back to the United States. She then decided to visit Atlantic City for a bit of gambling at the local casinos. Unbeknownst to her, Tony Stark and his friend Bethany Cabe were also present.
(Iron Man I#123) - Hoping to win big at the casino so she could afford a new pair of orthopedic shoes, Uranus played the slotmachines. Just as she hit the jackpot, the casino vault's alarm system went off. Overjoyed and unaware of the crisis, she used her hat to catch the coins the machine was spewing out, only to once again be bowled over by Tony Stark who raced past her to investigate the source of the alarm. Recognising Stark from the plane, his quick apology didn't cut it with Bliss who called him an old lady mugging heathen.
(Iron Man I#137 - BTS) - While visiting her sister Bambi Arbogast, Uranus was invited to attend the third annual Stark International Employee Appreciation Party.
(Iron Man I#137) - At the party, Bambi introduced Uranus, who was using a cane, to her colleagues. Meeting Iron Man, Yvette Avril, James Rhodes and others, she was barely acknowledged by physician John Ehrmann, who was looking for Tony Stark. When Stark briefly stepped out of the Iron Man armor to make an appearance at the party, Uranus recognised him as the one who had pulled her out of the plane toilet and bowled her over in Atlantic City. Bambi dismissed her sister's claims, explaining that he was indeed her boss Anthony Stark. Convinced she was right, Bliss sarcastically begged Bambi's forgiveness, claiming she hadn't realised huns were put in positions of responsibility these days. The party was briefly interrupted by Stark employee Ted Calloway who, via satellite, preceeded over the official activation of the new Stark sonic borer. Uranus and the others watched in horror as the device exploded mere moments after countdown. Stark immediately ran off to don his Iron Man armor, inadvertently knocking over Bliss who was just getting some punch. Launched into the bowl and covered in hors d'oeuvres, the furious Uranus called Stark a thimblewitted bully and promised he would die the next time she saw him. That next time came several hours later, when Stark returned to the party after investigating the explosion. Her clothes still stained with food, Bliss wanted to belt Tony, but was restrained by Edwin Jarvis who had trouble keeping the fighting mad Uranus from clobbering his boss.
Comments: Created by David Michelinie (writer), Bob Layton (plot & inks), John Romita Jr. (pencils).
Ms. Bliss' tenure as a character might well be the first time someone literally became the butt of a running joke since Stark ran her over on no less than three seperate occassions (uttering "sorry ma'am, no time to explain" every single time). Having her turn out to be Mrs. Arbogast's sister was a nice little touch given their similar personalities, but hardly necessary in the long run. We should have seen more of her, if only because getting away with a character named like that in a Comics Code approved book. After all, even if you're past 12, try and *not* smirk a little at a name like 'Uranus Bliss'...
...

Matt Taibbi draws the obvious parallel between Fox News and the infamous Radio Rwanda broadcasts (something I've thought about myself) and wonders why we aren't boycotting Fox:
A lot of Tea Party anger is driven by real local issues -- where I live in central Jersey, for instance, there are a lot of pissed-off white people crowing over a nutty state supreme court case in which a Central American drunk driver got off because cops didn't explain the consequences of refusing a breathalyzer in his native Spanish. But without the constant reinforcement of national 24-hour media, which has taken these isolated cases and presented them as a coast-to-coast massive conspiracy, the rage over stories like this would never reach the levels we're seeing.
In fact if you follow Fox News and the Limbaugh/Hannity afternoon radio crew, this summer's blowout has almost seemed like an intentional echo of the notorious Radio Rwanda broadcasts “warning” Hutus that they were about to be attacked and killed by conspiring Tutsis, broadcasts that led to massacres of Tutsis by Hutus acting in “self-defense.” A sample of some of the stuff we've seen and heard on the air this year:
On July 12, Glenn Beck implied that the Obama government was going to aid the New Black Panther Party in starting a race war, with the ultimate aim of killing white babies. "They want a race war. We must be peaceful people. They are going to poke, and poke, and poke, and our government is going to stand by and let them do it." He also said that "we must take the role of Martin Luther King, because I do not believe that Martin Luther King believed in, 'Kill all white babies.'"
CNN contributor and Redstate.com writer Erick Erickson, on the Panther mess: "Republican candidates nationwide should seize on this issue. The Democrats are giving a pass to radicals who advocate killing white kids in the name of racial justice and who try to block voters from the polls."
[...] There's nothing in the world more tired than a progressive blogger like me flipping out over the latest idiocies emanating from the Fox News crowd. But this summer's media hate-fest is different than anything we've seen before. What we're watching is a calculated campaign to demonize blacks, Mexicans, and gays and convince a plurality of economically-depressed white voters that they are under imminent legal and perhaps even physical attack by a conspiracy of leftist nonwhites. They're telling these people that their government is illegitimate and criminal and unironically urging secession and revolution.
The Fox/Rush/Savage crowd in the last 18 months has taken the anti-Muslim fervor that launched a phony war in Iraq, carried George Bush to re-election, and pushed through the Patriot Act, and re-directed that anger at a domestic nonwhite enemy. In doing so they've achieved a perfect storm of political cross-purposes: they've almost completely succeeded in distracting the public from the real causes of their economic misfortune (i.e. Wall Street corruption), they've re-energized a Republican party that was devastated by eight years of Bush-era corruption and incompetence, and, as usual, they've made Rupert Murdoch a sh*tload of money.
I'm convinced that none of the key actors here – the Wall Street banks shrieking about government takeovers and advertising on Rick Santelli's CNBC, the Republican Party's career hacks who have been scheming for a new horse to ride ever since Bush imploded, and the right-wing TV and radio networks – none of these actors is pushing this crazy movement out of any real desire to stoke a race war. For these institutional leaders and patrons of the Tea Party movement, this is all about material expediency: overcoming the real threat of new financial regulations after the crash, winning elections, and making TV profits. It's just our bad luck that driving frustrated/broke white suburbanites into a race-hatred frenzy happens to be good business for these folks. And all of this is race-baiting-for-cash is borne out of the same short-term, indifferent-to-consequence thinking that we saw from the Wall Street guys in recent years -- who created mountains of deadly leverage capable of destroying the global financial system for the sake of a few one-year bonuses.
The fact that Fox and co. are doing what they do for these dreary commercial reasons makes it even worse, of course; at least Hitler really hated Jewish people. But that also means there's a bright side. One of the few positives in this Tea Party phenomenon is that it's shown how quickly masses of Americans can be convinced to completely change their minds about sh*t. The same Americans who is a six or seven years ago were looking skyward in search of poison-distributing Saddam-drones and buying duct tape and bottled water to protect themselves against imminent Muslim attack are now probably not spending five minutes a week worrying about Muslim terrorists -- and instead arming themselves against the coming black-Mexican-leftist-communist state. To me that indicates that if Fox and Glenn Beck can be induced to jerk off to some perhaps similarly profitable but less toxic hate-fantasy (midgets from New Zealand are taking our jobs!), all of this – well, it maybe won't go away, but it won't have us steaming toward widespread racial violence like we are now.
I'm beginning to wonder why effective boycotts against these hate-media channels, and particularly Fox, haven't been organized yet. Why not just pick out one Fox advertiser at random and make an example out of it? How about Subaru and their unintentionally comic “Love” slogan? I actually like their cars, but what the f**k? How about Pep Boys and that annoying logo of theirs? Just to prove that it can be done, I'd like to see at least one firm get blown out of business as a consequence of financially supporting the network that is telling America that its black president wants to kill white babies. Isn't that at least the first move here? It's beginning to strike me that sitting by and doing nothing about this madness is not a terribly responsible way to behave.
Steve Bruce's alarm is set for half-past six, and by 7.15am he's in the car heading for work. This past week has been spent formulating a plan to beat Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup and juggling all the phone calls and meetings that come with the January transfer window.
‘It's taken 80 per cent of my time. Everybody is offering the new Paul Scholes or David Beckham. For the agents, they're all world-beaters,' says Bruce, chuckling at the absurdity of it all. Not that he'd want to be doing anything else of course.
After more than 40 years in football, Bruce's decision to quit Hull City in the summer left him outside the game with a rare three months off. So when Aston Villa came calling in October, the 56-year-old found accepting the challenge was a need rather than a choice.
Steve Bruce has spent the past week formulating a plan to beat Tottenham Hotspur in the Cup
There was a need behind his decision to manage Aston Villa - it was not simply a choice
‘I've lost count of the number of people who come up to me and say, “Are you mad?”,' he admits.
‘But you know what, football is the only thing I've ever done. Of course if you lose on a Saturday it can engulf you if you're not careful. But the vast majority of time, I have been very fortunate.
'Football has given me a beautiful place next to a golf course in Portugal, it's given me a lifestyle which many can only dream of. Until I lose that enthusiasm and don't want to get up early, I won't accept my time is up.
As a player, Bruce captained the biggest club of all, Manchester United, to the inaugural Premier League title.
His managerial career has never quite reached those heights at Crystal Palace, Sheffield United, Huddersfield Town, Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic, Sunderland and Hull, though he won promotions and reached finals. There was even a point when he was on the verge of signing Gareth Bale from Spurs.
So when he left Hull, some sensed it may mean the end of his long career, particularly as he was overlooked for the England job shortly afterwards.
Bruce never hit the heights of his playing career as a manager, but did not consider retiring
‘Of course it was hard to walk away,' said Bruce, who spent his lay-off sailing in the sun and losing weight. ‘There are only 20 Premier League managers and I was going to be one of them.
‘But I knew that the owner [Assem Allam] was ill and his son [Ehab] wanted to go in another direction. That was his prerogative but it's fair to say that in the end we didn't see eye to eye.
‘One thing you need in a football club is the relationship between the owner and manager to be watertight and unfortunately it wasn't. So I made a decision to do what was best for everyone and stop the continual arguments and fighting between me and Ehab. That's never healthy.'
As for his England near-miss, he adds: ‘To be interviewed and not get it, you'd wish sometimes you'd not even been on the radar!
'But I was the first on the phone to Sam [Allardyce] and wished him luck. We've known each other 25 years. I am still convinced he would have been a very good manager but it wasn't to be. Now I hope Gareth [Southgate] does a wonderful job.
He said it was worse to be interviewed and not get the England job than not be on the radar
The decision to leave Hull was perhaps vindicated last week when Bruce's former No 2, Mike Phelan, was sacked after only a dozen games.
‘I feel for Mike. He took over a difficult club at a difficult time, now he's lost his job and it just shows you what football is. It's a brutal industry. I am under no illusions here, at Villa. You would love to say, “Can I have three, four, five years and I know for a fact I'd get the job done”. But we know these days, are you going to get that time?'
Bruce was already set for the Villa job when the England post unexpectedly became available again. It didn't take him long to assess that things needed to change after last season's relegation and an unhappy start to the season under Roberto Di Matteo.
That's why Villa are getting column inches this month, with new owner Tony Xia offering a reported £25million war chest. Goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has already arrived on loan from Manchester United and striker Rudy Gestede has gone to Middlesbrough for £6m. There will be more ins and outs, though Bruce insists: ‘We are going to box clever and wait for the ones to make us better.'
Bruce believes Aston Villa need to be clever as they approach the January transfer window
Bale won't be one of his targets but Sunday's clash reminds Bruce of the time he thought the superstar was going to be under his charge. Harry Redknapp had just arrived as Spurs boss and Bruce recalls asking him if Gareth Bale would be available. ‘Harry said, “Give me the weekend to think about it, I will call you Monday”. It never got any further, but for 48 hours I thought maybe there was a deal to be had.
‘Bale has done all right since then. Wonder if he would come and give me a hand now?
‘I watched [on TV] Spurs beat Chelsea on Wednesday night and thought: “Gosh, we've got them next.” I can only hope Mauricio Pochettino makes a few changes against us! This is easily the best Spurs team in my lifetime. They could have won the Premier League last season with a bit of luck.'
He revealed he nearly convinced Harry Redknapp to let him sign Gareth Bale while Wigan boss
There is genuine enthusiasm in Bruce's voice, still strong Geordie, when he discusses the future at Villa Park: ‘I have to say this is the biggest club I've been at as a manager. This is my greatest opportunity and I hope I can turn this around and get them marching where they should be.
‘There something quite unique about Aston Villa, its name for a start. The Villa is always going to be mentioned as one of this country's big clubs for tradition, history and trophies.'
The sacrifices made to win are still worth it, though Bruce acknowledges his celebrations are unrecognisable from when he played with Bryan Robson and Peter Schmeichel.
Bruce is at an age where he likes to go home and have a quiet night to celebrate after a victory
‘Now I am at an age where I go home, have a glass of wine or go out for a quiet bite to eat and put my feet up to watch Match of the Day. It is not like the old days, put it that way. I do believe a manager needs most of his energy on match day, so by the end of it, I'm physically exhausted.'
Having been at United when the Class of 92 emerged, Bruce is taking responsibility for helping Villa's outstanding young asset Jack Grealish live up his promise.
Since masterminding Villa to an FA Cup semi-final win against Liverpool, the youngster's reputation has been blighted by off-field stories about his drinking, smoking and partying, though White Hart Lane is a perfect stage for him this afternoon.
Bruce says: ‘I think things have changed for young players even compared to 20 years ago when David Beckham and Paul Scholes came through. They are treated like rock stars and it can be very difficult for them. Jack has been blessed, the game comes so easily to him. He's made mistakes and been silly at times but underneath he is a really good boy. He always has a smile on his face and he wants to be a footballer.
Bruce defended youngster Jack Grealish and said underneath everything he is a 'good boy'
‘I will give him every bit of advice I can, from my past experiences to the horrible world that's out there. It's up to me to give him the platform but I won't mention Beckham or [Ryan] Giggs. That wouldn't be right, he has to fight his own way. But I think he has learned very quickly that he can't be like his mates at work or college.
‘The public don't want to see footballers drinking in nightclubs or out in bars. Back in my day, you could go down the local pub and have a couple of pints with the supporters. I don't think they really want to see it now.'
Monday's defeat at Cardiff left Villa mid-table though their form since Bruce took over is among the best in the Championship. The play-offs remain an aim, however. ‘We can't give up. We are Aston Villa,' he says.
He believes Villa cannot give up on a place in the play-offs despite being in mid-table
The FA Cup is important, too. Villa have won it seven times, the last in 1957, and reached the final in 2015, where they lost 4-0 to Arsenal. Bruce took Hull to the previous final where they lost 3-2 to Arsenal having led 2-1 with 19 minutes left.
‘Perhaps I undermined the competition in my earlier days because staying in the Premier League was so important. But I've learned to take the Cup seriously. If you ask the people of Hull what was their greatest day, they will probably say going to the final.
‘Are Aston Villa capable of winning the FA Cup? Yes, we are, so we'll take it seriously. We have had a horrible draw, we're under no illusions about that, but we are capable of winning five games to get to a cup final.'

( 1-minute sustained ) • The Lowest pressure 928 mbar (hPa; 27.4 inHg) Seasonal statistics Total depressions 9 Total storms 4 Hurricanes 2 Major hurricanes
(Cat. 3+) 2 Total fatalities 76 total Total damage $170,000 (1917 USD) Atlantic hurricane seasons
1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919
The 1917 Atlantic hurricane season featured nine known tropical cyclones, four of which made landfall.[1] The first system appeared on July 6 east of the Windward Islands. After crossing the islands and traversing the Caribbean Sea, the storm struck Honduras, Belize, and Mexico, before dissipating on July 14. After more than three weeks without tropical cyclogenesis, another tropical storm developed west of Bermuda. As the storm brushed eastern New England, four ships sank near Nantucket, causing 41 fatalities. The same cyclone brought damaging winds to Nova Scotia before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August 10.
A hurricane developed over the central Atlantic Ocean on August 30 and ultimately affected Bermuda with heightened tides as it passed to the east. Elsewhere, the hurricane had little impact, becoming extratropical on September 5. After the third system, a series of four tropical depressions formed, but failed to become severe. The fourth hurricane brought devastation to Jamaica, Cuba, and portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially western parts of the Florida Panhandle. Overall, the storm left six deaths and inflicted at least $170,000 (1917 USD) in damage.
The season's activity can be quantified in an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61.[2] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed; therefore, storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACE ratings.[3]
Systems [ edit ]
Tropical Storm One [ edit ]
Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration July 6 – July 14 Peak intensity 50 mph (85 km/h) (1-min) <1006 mbar (hPa)
Historical weather maps indicated a trough east of the Windward Islands on July 6.[1] Around 06:00 UTC, a tropical depression formed about 80 mi (130 km) southeast of Barbados. Moving west-northwestward, the depression crossed the Windward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea early on July 7. Later that day, the system intensified into a tropical storm. After peaking with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on July 8, it began to weaken and fell to tropical depression intensity early on July 10. Early the next day, the depression struck Honduras, before briefly emerging into the Caribbean Sea. The system struck Belize around 06:00 UTC on July 12 and entered the Bay of Campeche about 24 hours later. At midday on July 14, the storm struck south of Tampico, Tamaulipas.[4] In the city of Veracruz, 4 in (100 mm) of rain fell in a 24-hour period.[1]
Tropical Storm Two [ edit ]
Tropical storm (SSHWS) Duration August 6 – August 10 Peak intensity 70 mph (110 km/h) (1-min) <994 mbar (hPa)
An area of low pressure developed into a tropical storm to the west of Bermuda at 00:00 UTC on August 6.[1][4] Initially the storm drifted westward and strengthened minimally. By August 9, it curved northward and began to accelerate. The storm strengthened further and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mbar (29.4 inHg) early on August 10;[4] both were observations from the Nantucket Shoals Lightship. Offshore the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts, four ships were lost, with an estimated 41 people perishing.[1] The storm continued northeastward and made landfall in Saint John County, New Brunswick while becoming extratropical at 00:00 UTC on August 11. The remnants dissipated over the Labrador Sea later that day.[4] In Nova Scotia, dozens of boats were beached. Wind speeds up to 64 mph (103 km/h) in Yarmouth damaged trees, power lines, windows, and roofs. Crops were impacted throughout the Annapolis Valley. Fifteen barns were damaged or demolished.[5]
Hurricane Three [ edit ]
Category 3 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration August 30 – September 5 Peak intensity 120 mph (195 km/h) (1-min) <980 mbar (hPa)
Weather maps indicated that an area of low pressure existed between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 30. At 12:00 UTC that day, a tropical storm developed while located about 900 mi (1,400 km) northeast of Cayenne, French Guiana.[1][4] Moving west-northwestward, the tropical storm reached Category 1 hurricane intensity early on August 31. By late on September 1, the storm had intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. Further strengthening occurred brought the hurricane to a Category 3 intensity late on September 3, while briefly heading northward. Early the next day, the cyclone attained its peak force with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h); the lowest barometric pressure reading in association with the storm was 980 mbar (29 inHg).[4]
While passing east of Bermuda late on September 4, the storm's "unprecedented high tides" lashed the island. Portions of Market Square on St. David's Island were submerged. Additionally, a large section of Higgs' Island was completed washed away.[1] The storm accelerated to the northeast and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane around 12:00 UTC on September 5. Losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 00:00 UTC the following day, while located about 290 mi (470 km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Its remnants tracked northeastward until dissipating near Iceland on September 7.[4]
Hurricane Four [ edit ]
Category 4 hurricane (SSHWS) Duration September 20 – September 30 Peak intensity 150 mph (240 km/h) (1-min) 928 mbar (hPa)
The Nueva Gerona Hurricane of 1917
A tropical storm formed about 160 mi (260 km) east-northeast of Barbados on September 20. Later that day, the storm crossed the Lesser Antilles between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea on September 21, the system intensified quicker, becoming a Category 1 hurricane several hours later. While passing south of the Tiburon Peninsula on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. Later on September 23, the hurricane struck the northern coast of Jamaica, before re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea. Around 06:00 UTC on September 24, it intensified into a Category 3 hurricane. Approximately 24 hours later, the hurricane deepened into a Category 4 hurricane.[4]
Ramón Perez of the Instituto de Meteorología de la República de Cuba estimated that this hurricane attained a minimum barometric pressure of 928 mbar (27.4 inHg) on September 25. Using the pressure-wind relationship, HURDAT increased the maximum sustained wind speed to 150 mph (240 km/h).[1] Within the next six hours, the hurricane made landfall in the eastern Pinar del Río Province of Cuba. The system entered the Gulf of Mexico later on September 25. While moving northwestward, the storm fell to Category 3 hurricane intensity early on September 27. It briefly tracked generally northward and approached southeastern Louisiana before re-curving northeastward late the next day. At 02:00 UTC on September 29, the hurricane made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Shortly thereafter, the system rapidly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and fell to a tropical storm several hours later. Early on September 30, it became extratropical over Georgia. About six hours later, the remnants of the hurricane dissipated.[4]
Some islands in the Lesser Antilles experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall, including Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Lucia.[1] In Jamaica, the hurricane caused significant damages to banana and coconut plantations. Communications from Holland Bay were disrupted when the station was demolished.[6] The greatest damages were reported from the northern half of the island. In Nueva Gerona, strong winds destroyed well-constructed buildings, devastating the town. Orchards and crops were destroyed on the Pinar del Río Province.[7] In Louisiana and Mississippi, impact was generally limited to damaged crops and timber stands.[1] One death from drowning was reported in Louisiana.[7] Farther east in Mobile, Alabama, portions of roofs, trees, and other debris littered streets.[8] Communications were severed in Pensacola, Florida. Several small watercrafts washed ashore, and numerous wharves, docks, and boat storages suffered impact. Total damages were estimated near $170,000 in Pensacola area. Five deaths were reported in Florida, all of them in the city of Crestview.[7]
Tropical depressions [ edit ]
In addition to the four systems reaching tropical storm intensity, there were five other tropical depressions. The first probably developed from a tropical wave offshore western Africa on September 12, according to historical weather maps and the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), both of which indicated a closed circulation. This depression was last observed on September 14. Another depression also developed on September 12, well to the east of the Lesser Antilles. While approaching the islands, the storm may have briefly strengthened into a tropical storm on September 15, as suggested by a ship report of winds blowing 40 mph (65 km/h). The cyclone likely dissipated on September 15.[1]
The next tropical depression briefly existed off the east coast of Florida on September 14. It soon became extratropical, though its remnants lasted several days, traveling along the East Coast of the United States. At Nantucket, a wind gust up to 69 mph (111 km/h) was observed. The extratropical remnants probably dissipated near Newfoundland on September 20. Meanwhile, a trough in the Gulf of Mexico had developed into a tropical depression on September 14. The following day, the system made landfall in Louisiana and disintegrated into a disorganized area of thunderstorms over Mississippi and Arkansas on September 16. The last tropical depression and final cyclone of the season developed on October 19 from a trough over the central Atlantic Ocean. Two days later, the depression was absorbed by a cold front.[1]

Wimbledon 2017 on the BBC Venue: All England Club Dates: 3-16 July Starts: 11:30 BST Live: Coverage across BBC TV, BBC Radio and BBC Sport website with further coverage on Red Button, Connected TVs and app. Click for full times.
Weekends are the most important days of the year when you're a tennis player, so if you're working that's a good thing.
We play finals on Sundays, most semi-finals are on Saturdays and if a tournament starts on a Monday, we're practising the weekend before.
So it's pretty rare to have a weekend when we don't do anything.
We do get days off at other times. When I got back after the Australian Open in January I had four or five days when I wasn't doing anything, and that's your time to do normal stuff. You get to be with your family, watch TV, go out for dinner, see friends and do normal things.
It's pretty rare at this time of year - at least you hope it is - but that doesn't mean I get home every night and lock myself in my room, just concentrating on my match.
Maybe I don't do loads around the house during the two weeks of Wimbledon but I still want to spend time with my family when I can.
For example, on Friday I only saw my daughter for an hour in the morning and I want to make sure I spend the time available with her.
I've got two days without a match this weekend and I'll try to do stuff with my family in the mornings and the evenings around practice. Kim and I watched an episode an evening last week of a show called The Night Of, which we finished on Thursday.
I'm fine switching off from the tennis but I like being busy over the weekends because it means I'm doing well. I'll get plenty of weekends off when I finish playing.
'I was going to roll down the hill and up to the pump'
That feeling when you get to the petrol station with your car running on fumes
There was a moment the other night when I was stuck in traffic, with the fuel gauge close to empty, and I thought, 'this isn't looking good'.
Home felt a lot further than 11 miles away with Wimbledon in gridlock and about six miles' worth of petrol in the tank.
I always let it run down low, although not normally that low.
My car lets me know when I've got 35 miles left, and when I left home that morning I had 30 miles, so enough to get there and back.
Unfortunately there was an accident along the route and it was taking some people two hours to get in. I use an app that got me to the England Club in 45 minutes, but I had to go around the houses to get to there.
It normally takes me 25 to 30 minutes, so if I'd stopped to fill up and then taken that route I'd have been late to start my physio, so I thought 'just get to Wimbledon'. The club is surrounded by lots of petrol stations within two or three miles, so no problem.
But when I left that night there was so much traffic around the venue that I was stuck.
I had a back-up plan though - the petrol station I headed for is at the bottom of a hill, so I thought I could just roll down there and up to the pump if I needed to. That would have been quite a sight for anyone watching.
Luckily I made it there with one mile left in the tank, and I might fill it up a bit more than normal next week!
'I fancy my chances against Rafa - at putting'
Media playback is not supported on this device Nadal powers through in straight sets - five best shots
Playing Monday, Wednesday, Friday means I get the weekend free, which can work both ways.
The other half of the draw get to play every other day throughout the tournament and pick up a good rhythm, on the other hand I have more time to catch up on the practice I missed in the week before Wimbledon.
I play Benoit Paire in the fourth round on Monday and he is another talented, tricky opponent. Like in the last round against Fabio Fognini, it will be our first meeting on grass.
That means plenty of time at the club working on my game, and there's another competition I've got my eye on.
I saw Rafa Nadal and his team trying a bit of golf before he went on to play his match on Friday, they had the putter out for a little bit of friendly competition.
I don't really play much golf and I know Rafa plays all the time, but putting is a very specific skill and I fancy my chances.
Maybe we'll line that one up for next week, why not?

The Perryville Farm & Forest Rally consists of 8 stages, run over 4 gravel roads through wonderful Perry County Missouri. Located along the eastern edge of the state and bordering the Mississippi river, you will enjoy rolling country side views, and great roads through the farms and forests.
The towns of Perryville and Altenburg welcome all competitors and volunteers to the area and hope you enjoy your stay while you are here for the rally.
The Perryville Farm & Forest Rally is a performance rally car race, using street legal vehicles, which have the addition of safety gear and full roll cages. For any newcomers to rallying, a rally consists of “transit zones” and “special stages”. A transit has the rally teams on the roads with the general public following all traffic rules and merely gets the competitors from one special stage to the next. A special stage is a closed to-the-public section of road(s) where teams are allowed to travel from the start to the finish as fast as they can. Teams are started one minute apart, so there is no wheel-to-wheel racing. The total elapsed times for each team over all 8 of the special stages will determine both individual class and overall victories of the event. In addition, the rally is run “blind”, where the teams have not seen the roads ahead of time.
For the past 6 months, the rally committee has again been working with the local government officials & economic partners, to ensure a well organized and safe event. The rally aims to help give the area an economic boost by bringing in multiple teams, their service crews, officials, and hundreds of volunteers from outside the area. The Perry county road commissioners have given the rally organizers permission to temporarily close a few county roads for short periods of time during the afternoon on Saturday.
Saturday will begin with a rally car show and opening ceremony. Saturday's activities kick off at 10:30 AM on N. Jackson St in downtown Perryville. Teams will compete throughout the afternoon, passing multiple spectator points and servicing their vehicles at the East Perry County fairgrounds in Altenburg. The public is invited to join in the festivities, see the cars up close and meet the teams at the start of the day and at the service area. There is no admission charge for any of these events.
Spectator Guides will be available in the coming weeks, including detailed maps and schedule for each spectating location. More information can be found online at the rally website, http://perryville.100aw.org
Anyone interested in helping with this event may contact Lee Hilliard at 636-734-3292 or visit the website to volunteer. Your help is greatly needed as well over 200 volunteers will be required to staff the courses on Saturday the 29th.
As a first-generation daughter of British and Taiwanese immigrants, Lisa Joy was raised to seek out a career that would provide, above all else, stability. But she loved writing, and wrote for fun throughout her time at Stanford and then Harvard Law School. While studying for the bar, Joy submitted a spec script — a sample script of an existing show — to a friend, who passed it to a TV producer, helping her get a job as a staff writer on Pushing Daisies. Then she became the only woman writer on staff at Burn Notice at the time.
Her latest project, the HBO hit Westworld, about a futuristic theme park of robots that malfunction and start rebelling against humans, which she co-created with screenwriter husband Jonathan Nolan, is one of the most talked-about shows on television. As Joy explains, she's just writing about the world as she sees it.
I was always interested in writing from an early age, but it seemed so far away and inconceivable, like wanting to be an astronaut or a pop star. So whenever anyone would ask me what I wanted to be, I would say a lawyer or a teacher.
After graduation, I went to work for management consulting firm McKinsey & Company in L.A., specializing in finance and high tech for entertainment companies. No matter how long my day job hours were, I always made time to write. I wrote fiction, short stories, and poetry. I never shared it with anybody. I had a lot of college debt. It's very difficult to go to a university that is as expensive as Stanford and then blindly follow your passions when they don't immediately make money out of the gate.

After two years at McKinsey, I took a job in corporate strategy at Universal Studios. I needed some kind of respite from that. So I started taking UCLA extension classes for short stories and poetry. It was like a gift to myself and it allowed me to indulge in my sheer love of writing.
While I was working at Universal, I met my now-husband Jonathan Nolan at the premiere of Memento [which is based on a short story he wrote]. I would come home at night and work on my own writing, and [he saw] how much it brought a light to my eyes that nothing else seemed to.
After a few years at Universal, I was getting a little bit restless. I had this vision of myself in a cloistered academic environment with a beagle, surrounded by thick-bound books and wearing warm, cozy clothing. I wanted to go to Harvard because it felt like it would be the Hogwarts Academy of law schools. When you don't have a safety net economically as a young lady, you need to understand the systems around you. You need to be able to understand what's bullshit and what's not. Having an understanding of the law is one way of doing that.
And on a totally superficial level, I really loved the movie Legally Blonde. When I got to Harvard, I couldn't afford the exposed-brick, cozy apartment, but I did adopt a beagle.
Before I went to law school, Jonah — I call [my husband] Jonah — gave me a gift that changed my life. It was a little gift-wrapped box, just the size of an engagement ring. I thought, Oh my gosh, this guy is gonna propose. I'm going to Boston, he's in California, this seems like difficult timing for getting married. I opened it up and it was a bunch of metal brads that hold script pages together. Then he gave me a card, which was a gift certificate for me to buy screenwriting software for myself. He said, “I see your passion for writing and how hard you work at it. I always believe that having the right tool for a job is half the battle.” He gave me the tool that I needed.
John P. Johnson
While I was studying for the bar in California, I started to panic. Being a lawyer or working as a consultant is a totally good, respectable life, but it didn't inspire me quite as much as writing did.
During law school, I wrote my first proper TV script. It was a spec of Veronica Mars. I told one of my friends, Michael Green, who is a screenwriter I knew from Stanford, about it. Michael passed it on to Bryan Fuller, who was developing a new show called Pushing Daisies. He brought me in for a meeting. I thought that was my brush with Hollywood.
I passed the bar exam and McKinsey put me in San Francisco on a high tech study. About two weeks later, I was in the middle of running a meeting when I got a call. This guy said, “You just got the job.” I said, “That's amazing and incredible! It will take a few months or so to finish up with this company, then I can fly back to L.A. and start as a writer.” The guy said, “This job starts tomorrow. If you're not there, you don't get it.”
I had to take this leap of faith and it was a little scary for me. But because it was a writing job, I thought, This is it, I can have a passion for my work that I never even dared to dream of. I had to call the partners at McKinsey and quit on the spot.
It was a huge pay cut. I had to pay off the Harvard loans myself. But I could make it work. I just had to live lean. I took on a lot of credit card debt, and relied on my boyfriend [Jonah] a little bit to help me though. He became my husband in 2009.

Writers' rooms can be incredible places. You can meet genius people who become friends for life. You can also encounter sexism and competition. Early on, there was another junior writer who pulled me aside and said, “You know, you really shouldn't talk in a room because you're just a diversity hire, and no one wants to hear from the diversity hire.” That was tough to hear. I'm half Chinese. Was she saying that's the only reason I was hired? Am I not supposed to talk? Is everyone looking at me like I don't belong? Then I realized if you're a minority of any shape, color, or form, it doesn't matter. Someone is going to look at you like you don't belong in any room.
Not long thereafter, [Bryan Fuller] asked each writer to bring in one or two episode pitches. I drafted over 20, then narrowed it down to my 12 favorites. I pitched them all out in front of the room, each one getting shot down, but I kept on pitching. Then I got to the 11th and it worked — and was later my first pitch to make it to the small screen. Being told by that one writer to stay silent had the opposite effect: I figured I had nothing to lose and that feeling was liberating.
Pushing Daisies was on the air for two seasons. After I left, one of my friends from college who was a network exec at the USA turned me on to Burn Notice. I joined the writing staff in 2010. I was the only woman on staff.
I was actually drawn to Burn Notice because it was macho. I wanted to take on writing a show people associated with a male voice and masculine action — to show writing a show like that was not just the domain of male writers. There was this thinking in Hollywood that women can't write men or women can't write action, or women can't be funny, or whatever stupidity is in the air in that moment. I felt the same kind of impulse that made me do financial modeling and high tech [extracurriculars] when I was an English major. You say that I can't do that? Well, fuck you. I'm going to do it.
HBO
While I was still on Burn Notice, I wrote a graphic novel called Headache, which was a retelling of Greek mythology, the Athena story in contemporary times. It was basically my take on Wonder Woman without the tights and the lasso.
I left Burn Notice in 2011 and started to work on an adaptation of Headache for TV. I eventually sold it to a production company. I spent a year developing it. Then they said, “We have a slate full of female protagonists this season. Can you change this to focus more on the male characters?” I was like, “Well, the working title is Athena. So I can't. It's just not in the DNA of the show.” In the end, they didn't pick it up.
Another part of being a woman writer that you're told by many well-meaning people are that you can't be a writer and a mother. But I wanted a baby. So when Headache didn't go, I thought, OK, I'm going to try to get pregnant. I was also unemployed. So I decided to work on my own project. In that time of days spent alone vomiting into a bucket, I developed my first feature film, called Reminiscence. Suddenly I wasn't a writer for hire, I was a voice in my own right. Right around the time I sold the script [in 2013], J.J. Abrams approached Jonah and myself about doing Westworld.
He had the rights to it and he suggested telling the story from the robots' perspective. I was like, My god, that sounds so full of potential. What an amazing world to play in.
Working in TV or film is an all-consuming lifestyle. When you're both working in the job full-time, you don't get to see each other that much. He'd be in Europe. I'd be in Florida. Here was this chance to work on something together. And it was a chance to build a world together. There's something really romantic to me about that.
Jonah and I crafted the world, the characters, the episodes, and everything about it. We brought it in with J.J. and talked to HBO about it. They said, “Good, go write the script.” We wrote the script, and then they said, “Good, go shoot it.” And we did.
The female characters in Westworld are people I feel very close to. It's a summation of 30-plus years of living as a woman put into fiction. I think in this year, if I wrote a piece where women have no shackles whatsoever, I wouldn't feel like I was being honest. This isn't a story that celebrates those shackles. It's a story that explores them and talks about the need for rebellion. And that's the kind of story I was interested in telling. I understand that some of those things upset people, and frankly, they upset me too. That's why I'm writing them.

I'm an extreme Luddite when it comes to social media. I have no conception of fandom. I spent the majority of my life writing for an audience of one. I am plagued with enough self-doubt and perfectionism that I don't need to know how other people think I might not be doing. But people have shown me some of the fan art recently, and I was so honored that people would make art inspired by the show.
I'm first and foremost a fan myself. Disappearing into protagonists and characters that I understood — whether it was Willow in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or Veronica Mars, or a poem by Billy Collins — makes me feel less alone in the world. For anything that I write to be able to do that to even one person is magical for me.

Ready to see something equal parts adorable and wicked impressive? Gigglers, meet Arduboy, a handheld gaming system the size of a credit card. It's tiny, simple, and totally open source, which means games are free once you have the handheld. But that's not all this little guy does: This little bugger could help make coding in the classroom super easy!
How, you ask? Well, Arduboy is a simple-to-use little gadget that is built on Arduino software, a platform that allows for open source coding. That means you can build your own Arduboy games (don't worry, some games have already been built and are ready to play), using a simple step-by-step set of instructions the company will provide. And since getting coding into classrooms is the next wave of tech in schools, Arduboy is providing education kits to help teachers use the tiny little guy with students! Kind of genius.
Look at the Arduboy in all of its glory:
Creator Kevin Bates shared the prototype of Arduboy via Youtube in February of last year, and it went viral shortly thereafter. Arduboy looked a little different back then, but the basics remain the same. It's still a credit card sized system with a simple screen display and Gameboy-like controls.
Since realizing the potential of this amazing project, Bates has tweaked it a bit, and it looks more like a Game Boy now than it did a year ago. We're talking the red and black buttons on a white background, baby. Vintage to the max.
Arduboy has caught the eye of a lot of very cool people, including Bill Nye and President Obama. But more importantly, backers have turned out in serious numbers to get behind this project. The original goal for Arduboy's Kickstarter campaign was $25,000. To date, they've raised over $280,000 from almost 5,000 backers. Because of that awesome support, it looks like Arduboy will be shipping to backers in October. It will also be available for purchase at a starting price of $39, while backers can get it for $29.
Let's recap: Arduboy is super small, super educational, has super games, and is super affordable. And it's going to be available super soon! We can't wait to see this little guy in action.

President Donald Trump delivers a statement on the deadly protests in Charlottesville at the White House in Washington on Monday. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
On Saturday, President Donald Trump responded to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, with a prepared statement that condemned “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.” He then appeared to ad lib that nullifying qualifier into a refrain: “on many sides.” Trump was deservedly criticized for, as my colleague Josh Levin put it, “All Lives Matter[ing] a Nazi rally.” Along with being awful, the president's original speech was notable for its absence of Trump-ian rhetoric. Whereas he usually spins division into political gold, this time Trump preached a kind of horrifying togetherness. The address, tiptoeing instead of name-calling, politely declined to address the Klansmen and neo-Nazis who'd marched through Virginia. Trump didn't just come down softly on fascist terrorists. What made Saturday's address so remarkable was that he bent so many of his own rules to do so.
On Monday, the president went back to normal. Or at least, he displayed all the now-familiar tics of a man allergic to accountability and desperate for praise, a man delighted to accept our congratulations on the sagacity of his responses to horror. After a few minutes of throat-clearing about his feats on behalf of the American worker, Trump reiterated, almost word for word, his language from the weekend. “As I said on Saturday,” he told reporters, “we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.” Trump then continued: “And as I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin,” we all “salute the same great flag. … Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs.”
It was a neat substitution: Instead of “on many sides,” the president offered another seemingly inconsequential phrase—“as I said.” Over the weekend, Trump failed, resplendently, to denounce the gun-waving race vigilantes who instigated a riot in Charlottesville, one that ended in the death of a woman who was run over by a white supremacist. On Monday, he strode up to the podium and pretended that he's not the kind of guy who'd embolden and encourage the alt-right. If you haven't heard him declaring racism is evil, he said, that's because you haven't been listening.
Trump's contempt for reality is such that he is not content to mislead the American people in the moment. He compounds the lie by telling us, in direct contradiction to what we've seen and heard, that he has always been doing whatever it is he wants to have been doing. No universe exists in which any Trump response could have possibly been inadequate or wrongheaded. Over the weekend, Trump delivered the perfect address to salve Charlottesville's wounds and fire up its moral conscience. On Monday, he just repeated it for all us dummies who missed it the first time.
This insta-revisionism calls to mind the Lost Cause romanticism that insists slavery was always ancillary to the Civil War. Neither Robert E. Lee nor the statues cast in his image were ever really “about” white supremacy, we're told, often by the same people who want to absolve Trump from his complicity in a fascist movement. Asked why he did not condemn hate groups by name over the weekend, the president replied, “They have been condemned.” Slavery, too, has been condemned, though not always all that vociferously by those who defend monuments to the Confederacy. Condemnations were made, is the point. Why do the work when you can simply steal the credit?
“As a candidate,” Trump intoned at his Monday press conference, “I promised to restore law and order to our country, and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge.” Somehow, the commander in chief twisted the weekend's melee in Charlottesville into evidence that he was succeeding. Ignore my deeds, Trump is telling us. What I've done is what I've said I've done.
SAN DIEGO (KGTV) - A weeklong spring break camp is teaching San Diego students how to code for computers.
The League of Amazing Programmers is now in its 11th year, giving students the tools to do the jobs of tomorrow.
"We don't teach Javascript or any of the dumbed-down computer languages," said League of Amazing Programmers Executive Director Vic Wintriss. "These kids are learning professional level Java, and we're the only school in the country that starts kids this young."
Students can take the camp as early as 5th grade. They spend two hours a day learning to code, for five straight days. After that, if they want, they can move into a 5-year program to learn more advanced coding.
Wintriss said about 75 percent of the kids that take the camp move on to the longer program. When they're done, they're ready for a job in computers.
"The starting salary for jobs like this in San Diego is about $100,000," he said. "That can change their entire life and help their entire extended family."
The best part is the program is free for a majority of students. Scholarships and grants help pay their tuition.
It's also targeted towards girls, low-income students and minority students. About 45 percent of the kids in camp this spring are girls.
"All these kids are the same," said Jackie Arseneau, a volunteer instructor. "They're all lovely, they're all eager to learn and they're all able to absorb these concepts no matter what their background is."
The classes are accredited by UC San Diego. After a few years in the program, the students are advanced enough to take the AP Computer Science Exam, earning them college credit.
The next camp will start this summer. To sign up, visit jointheleague.org .
NEW DELHI: Keeping in sync with skipper Virat Kohli 's uncompromising training regimen, the Indian cricketers are now undergoing DNA test that reveals the genetic fitness blueprint of an individual, raising the bar to a level hitherto unseen.The test helps a sportsman improve his speed, in fat burning, endurance, recovery time, and muscle building.It has been learnt that the BCCI has introduced this test on recommendation of team trainer Shankar Basu , so that a more comprehensive fitness programme for the national team can be chalked out.The DNA test, or, genetic fitness test, gives an idea about how 40 plus genes are related to a person's fitness, health, and nutrition. Each cricketer's DNA data is then combined with the environmental data which is the individual's body weight and diet, for an all-round analysis."Yes, we have started the DNA test for the Indian cricket team for some time now. It is basically in line with the new fitness parameters, which has been set by the team management. The DNA test was first introduced in the NBA (basketball) and the NFL in the United States."The idea was mooted by Shankar Basu and it has proved to be extremely beneficial. For conducting each and every player's test, the BCCI spends between Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 which is a nominal amount," a senior BCCI official told PTI on the condition of anonymity.Earlier, the Indian cricket team used to undergo Skinfold Test for body fat measure percentage and then switched to DEXA test."Skinfold test was used primarily for a long time but it was found out that results related to body fat percentage were not accurate enough. Then there was a switch to DEXA test for calculation of body fat percentage."The DNA test is being done so that the body's needs are known to maintain a particular fat percentage," the official, who is aware about the module, further added.As of now, the permissible body fat percentage limit for a senior national team player is 23 percent, which is standard for most of the international cricket teams, including Pakistan and New Zealand.It is learnt that some of the cricketers did not know why, after rigorous amount of training, they were not able to bring down their fat percentage to a certain level."Some of them have been having copious amount of milk since childhood as it is a common belief that milk gives you strength. Then they found out that despite training, their body is not able to measure up to the demands of modern day game."When this test started, some players understood that they are lactose intolerant or some who have fetish for mutton biryani know what their body needs after eating a particular kind of food," he added.One of the players whose strength and stamina has tremendously improved has been pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar , who has been consistently playing ODIs and T20 Internationals.Since the start of Champions Trophy, Bhuvneshwar has played 19 ODIs and 7 T20 Internationals, purely because of a new fitness routine that was prepared after getting his genetic fitness report.The DNA test is believed to test the body's abilities and what kind of diet and exercise are most effective for a particular player.What trainer Basu does is to prepare a detailed workout and nutrition guide for each player that is tailored for their respective physical needs.
Not many people believed in the Raptors at the start of their Eastern Conference finals series against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
After tying the series up at two wins apiece, Toronto's got the doubters eating their words – literally, for one basketball fan.
“If the Raptors win two games I will throw my cellphone in some teriyaki stir fry and eat it,” tweeted Kazeem Famuyide, founder and editor-in-chief of Stashed magazine, last Sunday.
It was an easy bet to make. The Cavaliers had just blazed through their first two series of the playoffs, sweeping both, while the Raptors fought tooth-and-nail through two seven-game series.
“Me and my friends have a little tradition of putting fun bets on really outlandish things,” said Famuyide. Think Usain Bolt losing to an amateur in a race, or Yao Ming winning a three-point contest.
“That's what we thought of the Raptors of beating the Cavs,” he admitted.
And after the first two games, Fumayide was feeling pretty good about the bet.
“It looked like it was going to be the same old story, with another walk in the park to the finals for Lebron and the Cavs,” said Famuyide. “Then Bismack decided to turn into Bill Russell, Love looked like he's playing injured, and DeRozan had himself a game.”
Sure enough, the Internet did not forget about the wager and on Monday, it was time to pay up.
Since iOS 8 doesn't look altogether different from iOS 7, there's the perception that there aren't lots of changes. If you look at the bill of particulars though, it's not a handful of refinements and some new apps. There are loads of significant changes that are more than skin deep. It's also true that the controversial flat interface of the previous OS is somewhat tamed.
Although there were loads of protests about iOS 7, upgrade stats were off the charts. Before iOS 8 became available last month, some 91% of the iOS user base had upgraded to its predecessor. That's a compelling achievement by any estimate. In contrast, getting a high single digit adoption rate for a new version of Google's Android can take long months.
Still, iOS 8 adoption remains under 50%, noticeably less than iOS 7 at this early stage. Even though the previous OS had a faster upgrade pace, it's probably not a significant issue. Don't forget that adoption of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is reported to be way ahead of last year's iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c; over 7% as of Monday.
True online metrics of this sort have margins for error, since they vary, sometimes substantially, from measurement firm to measurement firm. But trends tend to be consistent, and it's clear that even if fewer older iPhones and iPads are moving to iOS 8, the number of new sales will soon make up for much of the difference.
I suppose Apple didn't make the upgrade path so easy either. If you have a device with 16GB of RAM (don't even think of those 8GB models), you'll want to do the update via iTunes, since there won't be much free space available on the unit itself to install the 1.1GB upgrade file.
But it's no doubt true that Apple can't make magic, regardless of what you think, and the installation requirements are what they are. If you want to update to iOS 8 on a storage starved iPhone or iPad, except trouble if you're not using iTunes.
Ture to form, the Apple hate mongers are in full force. Apple's very serious misstep with the iOS 8.0.1 update is mentioned time and time again. One blogger for a major tech site claimed it had more bugs than iOS 8, which is decidedly not true. A certain consumer test publication insisted that Apple took hours to withdraw the update when troubles were discovered, which is also decidedly not true.
In the real world, as opposed to the alternate Bizarro world in which some tech pundits live, iOS 8.0.1 fixed several problems and added two to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. They were serious, though. The connection to a cellular network was broken, and Touch ID stopped working. It worked fine on other iPhones. What's more, Apple became aware of the problem quickly enough to pull the update in a little over an hour. Some 40,000 units were impacted by the flaws, and Apple posted instructions online on how to get them up and running by downgrading to iOS 8.
It was a serious mistake, and the person or persons who made the decision to release 8.0.1 ought to face the music. It was a decidedly dumb move regardless of the excuses one might make for it. One report suggested the group handling the update didn't have proper access to an iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus due to Apple's extreme secrecy policies. But that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Just as likely, a last-minute change before release created unforeseen problems; regardless the testing process clearly failed.
The very next day, the 8.0.2 update fixed the problem. It doesn't mean that things were perfect. There are still reports of early release bugs with the various versions of iOS 8, and you expect Apple will fix the worst of them soon. An 8.1 update is expected to launch Apple Pay and perhaps a new iPad lineup, and that might come as early as next week, when another Apple media event may happen.
I think some of the people who are complaining a lot about iOS 8 issues forget the shaky rollout of iOS 7. All the zooming and parallax view special effects made some people dizzy until Apple devised better ways to slow or halt the excesses. To some, the thin lettering of interface elements were too thin, although it was possible to switch to a bolder typeface.
For iOS 8, Apple has enhanced the ability to alter system font sizes and apps that support ‘Dynamic Type,” and make the text bold. The interface seems a tad smoothed out, so whatever ragged edges remain probably aren't as significant as those that showed up in the first versions of iOS 7. But it's possible the problems with the previous release may have made some of you think twice about an OS upgrade so early in the game. Maybe you want to wait for things to settle down a bit longer before you take the plunge.
By next year, when iOS 9 arrives, the user base for iOS 8 will still probably exceed 75-80%, which is still a pretty high number in the scheme of things. And Google? Don't ask!

Britain is not planning to extend its military intervention in Syria, according to Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokeswoman, despite Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson telling the Foreign Affairs Committee the UK should consider more “kinetic action.”
“There are no plans for military action. We are working with the international community to look at how to bring the conflict to an end,” May's spokeswoman said when asked about Johnson's comments.
A range of options are available, she added.
The spokeswoman's comments contradict those of May's foreign secretary, who addressed the Foreign Affairs Committee early on Thursday.
“It is right now that we should be looking again at the more kinetic options, the military options," said Johnson.
"But we must be realistic about how these in fact work, and what is deliverable."
He said the West's future role in Syria would be discussed at high-level meetings this weekend.
Johnson added negotiations with Russia over the future of the Syrian crisis have “run out of road” and that the West should now consider engaging in more “kinetic action.”
The foreign secretary envisions a future for Syria without President Bashar Assad and referred to the Saudi-backed coalition of rebel groups, known as the ‘High Negotiation Committee' (HNC), as embodying “progressive” values.

During the hearing, Johnson made the strongest indication yet that Britain and its allies are considering a military intervention in the Syrian crisis.
“On Sunday I'm calling a meeting of fellow foreign ministers… to discuss how we're going to proceed, not just in Syria, but in Iraq as well. Obviously it's good that things are happening again in Geneva, but most people feel the process of discussion with the Russians has basically run out of road,” he said.
“On Sunday we'll be talking about all the options we think are available to us and the West.
“Most people, I think, are now changing their minds about [intervention]. They're thinking we can't let this go on forever… Whether that means we can get a coalition together for more kinetic action now, I cannot prophesize. Certainly people want to see a new set of options.”
He added that such military options are still “a long day's march” away and would be dependent on the US.
The foreign secretary referred to a Sky Data survey published on Thursday which indicates 46 percent of the British public support military intervention in Syria and 53 percent think the UK has a responsibility to protect Syrians.
Some 37 percent polled did not support military action, while 17 percent expressed no preference.
Johnson expressed regret for the British Parliament voting against military intervention in Syria in 2013, describing it as a “big step backwards.”
“We vacated the space that has been occupied by the Russians. Our options now are on the humanitarian front.”
While Johnson told MPs the UK must continue to be “very, very tough” with Russia, he said it is wrong to compare the present situation to a new Cold War and explained that London does not want “endless confrontation” with Moscow.
The secretary even confessed to being a Russophile and described how he visited the country when he was 16.
Russia and the UK must work together more, particularly in the fight against terrorism, he said.
Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin cannot yet offer any assessment of Johnson's comments, as it's necessary to find out the motives and reasons for a possible military intervention by the UK to address the situation in Syria.
"For what purpose [would the UK intervene militarily in Syria]? We should probably wait until all these points are clarified. Efforts of any states in the fight against terrorism are worthy of the highest praise, but if those efforts are designed to fight the legitimate authorities of the country, they are unlikely worthy of praise,” Peskov told reporters.
"Without accurate information about the motives, plans and intentions, it's hard to give some kind of assessment," he added.
Today's DIY focus is more of a brag than a tutorial.
Our kids love books. LOVE them. Because of this, every birthday and holiday they get books as presents. This is all wonderful and awesome. Except for one small thing:
They pile up everywhere! There are bookshelves in their room, and piles of their books were overwhelming the bookcases in our living room. Sadly, every time they would go to grab a book there is would be an avalanche of board books crashing down.
We needed a solution. But with our limited floor space, it needed to be something with a really slim footprint. After doing a lot of research I found this plan by Ana White . If you haven't heard of her, she is a carpentry genius who graciously shares her plans with us mere mortals.
Using her bookshelf blueprints we were able to create an awesome bookcase that allows the kids to see all the books they have, take them down without danger, and still takes up less space than a traditional bookcase. Win!
We did make a few changes to her plans. Instead of making the bookshelf 3" deep, we made it 4". A lot of books to store people. Every inch counts.
We also chose to use leftover baseboard for the fronts of the shelves, versus plywood. A: I like the look of it over plywood. B: I am a big fan of using leftover materials. Call me c heap resourceful.
To attach the baseboard to the front, we used wood glue along the bottom and clamped it down. Then we used our finish nail gun and added a few nails along the bottom and on the sides.
Lovin' my chevron paint job? There are lots of complex mathematical formulas out there for creating a perfectly designed chevron. As the design is going to be covered 99% of the time by books, I decided to just wing it.
First I painted the back section of the bookcase with white paint. Once that was dry, I cut out a small triangle and used is as a rough guide for marking my chevrons with masking tape. Then I painted the entire thing in a lovely shade of blue. Once dried, I slowly removed my tape. Voila!
The chevrons are little lopsided, but this is a children's bookcase. I'll just pretend it adds character
And there you have it! All in all it cost us around $20, and holds 60 books! Trust us, we counted.
The kids love it!
True data offers many benefits over information on a piece of paper when it comes to everything from versioning to verification and preservation. Yet despite the fact that paper was invented in 100 B.C. and despite the fact that we come just a little ways technologically since then, we still rely upon paper. Back in 100 B.C. we also thought that any illness was the result of angry gods and we would sacrifice a goat or a chicken to the gods to cure our family members. Fortunately for the goats we determined there was a better way. But we held on to the paper. Why?
The reason is mystifyingly simple. It is because we think if we write it down on paper it is hard to change, therefore immutable. And data, like that in a spreadsheet, is very easy to change. That is in fact true. But if you have ever pulled up your computer and searched for the latest Word, Excel or PowerPoint document only to open an older version than the one you want, look at it and say, “Dang that one has the wrong data in it,” you understand why.
It's easy to think that if we just stick with good old-fashioned paper—or in the case of scans or PDFs, digital renderings of that sacred paper—we'll have the printable proof we need. Proof we need for court, compliance, agreement or for that meeting. So paper gets associated with “hard to change” and data get associated with “easy to change, or unreliable.”
This is a falsehood. We know that in many instances paper is much easier to forge, copy or alter. So it's important to understand the benefits of data over paper and digital documents when the data is protected and applied to the right solution.
Rock, Paper, Data?
Since you can hold it in your hand, paper may feel more tangible as a source of proof than data and thus seem more reliable when verifying originality and authenticity of versioning and information. But it's risky to become overly trusting of paper as the be-all and end-all authority for verification purposes since it can be photoshopped or otherwise altered. This is also true for digital versions of documents (PDF, scans), which are often erroneously considered the equivalent of the data of that document.
If you think about it, without even realizing it, the world has already started its shift toward equating digital currency and digital paper with the physical form of paper. Otherwise, we wouldn't put our money in banks, since the reality is that not every person could go to the bank at once and cash out their bank account into physical dollars—there simply isn't enough physical currency available. Despite this reality, we trust that our money is there based on what our digital bank balance on our smartphone shows us even if, under certain circumstances, it might not be.
Shifts in thinking like this are why digital versions of what could be printed are generally viewed as physical documents even if they are never printed—and even though digital documents, just like paper, are far from being protected against alteration. Even the digital document that is often considered the most “uneditable” form of digital documentation—the PDF—is still no more than an accumulation of 1's and 0's, which can easily be modified by a savvy hacker. Scanned documents are another digital document that's often given greater authority than it should have, since these too can be altered with a little ingenuity. What's more, these digital documents are also prone to versioning problems, whether you send a link to the document or the document itself. If you consider digital documents and data the same thing, then how do you know which one is the correct version?
The New and Rightful King
Understanding that data has moved into the position to become king over paper and digital files requires developing a better understanding of what true data really is, and recognizing the advantages of using pure data as the verification medium. Many people have yet to make the leap from seeing paper or digitized paper as the best proof of truth and originality. Yet there is a sea change underway now, since new blockchain-based tools are proving without a doubt why data, when used with the right framework as a solution, has the potential to be recognized as the king it really should be.
Specifically, a new technology from Factom called SmartProvenance™ introduces a unique approach to data and evidence storage. Having a trusted third-party store the proof of the digital documents or data solves compliance problems for the mortgage industry in a way that simply relying on paper or the digital documents themselves never did. What's more, with immutable data backing a digital document, version control is simplified. It mirrors the best parts of the deal room, where a group of reviewers had only a single set of printed papers in front of them. In that scenario, there was no chance that one person was reviewing outdated information that someone else had changed the day before.
Likewise, Factom Harmony with SmartProvenance™ technology organize documents and data into unique chains. Rather than store private documents or data in the blockchain, Factom only publishes one-way hashes of the data as cryptographic proofs. Factom also stores metadata that allows for fast cataloguing and retrieving of digital asset information. Since it's much harder to prove what hasn't happened than what has happened, entries in the Factom system are time-stamped and sequential. That means the system can prove what's there and what's missing—it's like a filing cabinet of paper except that it can never be physically stolen or digitally compromised.
Having the Proof
The mortgage industry has grown accustomed to having to recreate the truth in the case of a dispute over accuracy or authenticity of documentation. But whether you're dealing with audits, foreclosures, lawsuits, or regulatory reviews, it's always better to have the proof already than to be forced to try to recreate the truth. This is where Smart Provenance comes in. This technology allows the mortgage industry to reclaim the power of data.
The power of blockchain is what actually makes data the mortgage industry's strongest asset. With SmartProvenance technology, even if information gets altered or changed, you can still prove your original point. So it's time to stop assuming the authority of tools based on a different era. We shouldn't entrust the most important details of the mortgage industry around an era that is archaic. We need to collectively move beyond the mentality that views physical documents, or even their counterpart digital documents, as the indisputable law or truth.
With this new blockchain-based approach, data becomes a more reliable source than any physical paper trail, even if the latter involves notarized paper or digital documents. Are you ready to let data become your ultimate source of truth instead of paper? It's definitely time. Find out more at

We now find out that the Republican party cut ads, and sent them to TV stations around the country, opposing the bailout bill even BEFORE Pelosi spoke before the vote yesterday. The Republican National Committee, the official “party,” was planning on the bill passing, and then was going to attack Democrats who voted FOR the bill. Talk about calloused. So in fact, the Republican party was playing games, playing politics, with our economy. Did the RNC tell individual members of Congress that they were going to be running ads attacking anyone who voted for the bill? Is this why Republican members voted against the bill 2 to 1 (while Dems voted for the bill almost 2 to 1), sending Wall Street into a nose dive? And what about John McCain? What does it say about him when his own party is secretly undercutting the proposal that he claimed to “save the day” on?
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S claim that 3 million to 5 million undocumented immigrants voted illegally in last fall's elections is as evidence-based as the assertion that space aliens on Saturn are bombarding planet Earth with marshmallows. Nonetheless, Washington being Washington, Mr. Trump's declaration has generated its own politically charged momentum in the form of a presidential commission to investigate voter fraud — a topic that has been endlessly investigated for years, with consistent results: There is no evidence that it is widespread or has materially affected the outcome of any U.S. election.
Now Mr. Trump's Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is beginning its work under the guidance of its vice chair, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican notorious for his efforts at vote suppression. As an opening salvo, Mr. Kobach has written to state election officials requesting that they hand over voter rolls, including not only names, addresses and dates of birth, but also party affiliation, voting history back to 2006 and the last four digits of Social Security numbers — all of which he says will be made public.
Mr. Kobach's preposterous request — making public millions of partial Social Security numbers: Seriously? — has generated well-founded fears about privacy and data security; more than two dozen states have already announced they will refuse to convey the data he requested. Those same concerns have blocked the compilation until now of any such all-in-one list of every registered voter in the United States. In addition, Mr. Kobach's elaborate past efforts at voter suppression in Kansas, mainly blocked by federal and state courts, provide ample cause for alarm that the commission's real goal is an aggressive purge of voter rolls — a meat-cleaver approach whose inevitable effect would be widespread disenfranchisement.
No question, voter lists should be as up-to-date and accurate as possible. In the vast majority of cases where they're not, however, it has nothing to do with fraud — it's because people have died or moved, evidence of nothing more than a mobile society and decentralized election system. (Among those whose names have appeared simultaneously on more than one state's rolls are several people in Mr. Trump's immediate orbit, including Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser; Stephen K. Bannon, chief White House strategist; and Tiffany Trump, Mr. Trump's daughter.)
The trouble is that commonplace and often minor inaccuracies on the rolls, along with inconsistencies in data collection and formatting among the states, give rise to the high likelihood of false “matches” from one roll to another, and also that many voters may be purged unfairly, without safeguards or recourse. That would provide Mr. Kobach with a pretext for what Vanita Gupta, former chief of the Justice Department's civil rights division, called “voter suppression, plain [and] simple.”
The commission's endgame may be an attack on the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, the so-called “motor voter” law that requires states to offer registration at public service agencies such as motor vehicles departments. That would amount to an assault on American democracy and a damning indictment of the GOP's commitment to free and fair elections.
I'll vote for Ted Cruz before I'll ever, ever vote for Donald Trump. Hell, I'll write in Bozo the Clown before I'll vote for Trump (although I'd be hard-pressed to tell you the difference). Cruz has never been what you'd call a people person, which is why I'm glad he's taking the right side in the eternal battle of Man vs. Nature.
As you know, Faithful Reader, I hate animals and I want them all to die. It's us or them, man. So it's heartening that Cruz is siding with humans against the disgusting vermin we've been forced to tolerate for far too long. Lauren-Elizabeth McGrath, Ecorazzi:
Yesterday afternoon, during a speech for his last efforts to get Illinois under his belt, Cruz was interrupted by a single animal rights protestor who began shouting from her chair during his speech. She is [sic] later escorted out by the Secret Service…
It's unclear exactly what the animal rights protestor at Cruz's rally was protesting, other than protesting animal rights for the sake of it.
I don't care why. I just know that Cruz gave her the correct answer. The only correct answer.
.@tedcruz to protester: "It's wonderful you care about animals, I happen to also care about human beings." pic.twitter.com/atrB982IkW — Samantha-Jo Roth (@SamanthaJoRoth) March 15, 2016
“I understand that you're very, very concerned about animals. That's wonderful. I think animals are wonderful. I also happen to care about human beings.”
Cruz is wrong about animals being wonderful, of course. Animals are dumb, and their only purpose on this planet is to serve as our pets and/or McNuggets. But at least he's on the right track.
Animal Liberation? We need to be liberated from them. End Animal Rights Now!

PARK CITY, Utah — Secrecy shrouded the controversial documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, which premiered Sunday at the Sundance Film Festival.
Rumors swirled about massive protests, prompting filmgoers to arrive hours in advance to assure they got a seat.
Security was heightened, but no threats materialized.
The festival's most hotly anticipated documentary did not disappoint, however. The revelations were almost as numerous as the number of lawyers HBO Documentary Films hired to vet the movie (160).
The scathing exposé directed by Alex Gibney (The Armstrong Lie) is based on Lawrence Wright's riveting 2013 bestseller.
Among the bombshells asserted by eight former church members: Scientology intentionally broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman; it tortured some of its members in a prison known as "the hole" and subjected others to hard labor; it harassed those who left the organization and forced their family members to cut off all contact.
The film offers an intimate portrait of founder L. Ron Hubbard (or LRH as he's referred to by members) and follows the rise of current leader David Miscavige, alleging his misuse of power and that he physically abused several members.
The film also claims that Hubbard beat and threatened his first wife and kidnapped their daughter, leaving her in Cuba in the care of a mentally disabled woman. It also detailed Hubbard's elaborate cosmology incorporating space aliens, invading spirits, volcanoes and other elements that his sci-fi writing had contained.
One of the former members interviewed, Marty Rathbun, was the second highest-ranking church official before he defected. He alleged that Miscavige didn't approve of Kidman because her father is a well-known psychologist in Australia, and Scientology vehemently opposes psychiatry and psychology.
The film goes on to explore the close friendship between Miscavige and Cruise, and questions whether Cruise is aware of church abuses. The filmmaker essentially calls upon Cruise to renounce Scientology in order to put a stop to the abuses.
It also alleges that another high-profile member, John Travolta, won't leave the church out of fear that his personal life will be exposed. Reams of information are kept on each member as they go through the process of "auditing" in order to become "clear" of all problems, worries and bad memories.
Spanky Taylor, a former publicist and friend of Travolta, details how her infant daughter was taken away from her and left in a urine-soaked crib and unsanitary, fly-infested conditions. Meanwhile, Taylor was forced to do arduous physical labor while she was pregnant. Fed up, Taylor took her child and escaped from the church. She attended the premiere with her daughter Vanessa, now grown, whom Gibney called "the stolen baby."
Several of the former members who spoke out in the documentary — and also in Wright's book — were on hand for the Sunday premiere, and drew a standing ovation.
"You're so thoroughly indoctrinated, deluded and not questioning anything because (Hubbard) had all the answers," said Taylor. "So you continue to believe all the nonsense.''
Gibney said he has received "many cards and letters" from Scientology's lawyers.
"The kinds of threats that I've received, and Alex as a filmmaker, have been predominantly legal and they have been manifold," said Wright. "But nothing compared to what the people who were in the church suffered."
Wright lauded those who spoke out in the documentary. "I want to emphasize what a tremendous amount of courage it took for people to come out," he said. "The goal was to get as many people to talk so they'd feel safe in numbers."
The film reveals the church to have fewer than 50,000 members worldwide but more than $1 billion in assets.
The former members interviewed, including screenwriter Paul Haggis and others high up in the organization, described how they turned over vast sums of money to the church. They used terms like ''brainwashing'' and each expressed remorse and chagrin over their involvement with the organization, which was granted church status by the IRS in 1993, making it tax-exempt.
Scientology's fight against the IRS was detailed, as was a lavish celebration thrown by Miscavige and Scientology officials when the "war" with the federal government ended in the group's victory.
The film also featured moving emotional testimony from a lifelong member who had achieved the highest status in the church but left when her son was labeled "a suppressive person." The organization demanded that her daughter, still a member, and granddaughter, cut off all contact.
"The hope of this film is that it will raise public awareness," said Gibney.
Going Clear is scheduled to air on HBO later this year.

Sweden, as the only country to give Syrian refugees automatic residence, has struggled to house them and faces warnings of a coming surge in new arrivals. Josef Ariss and his mother Reina fled Aleppo in northern Syria three months ago when their family's clothing factory was flattened by shelling. Although relieved to escape the violence, he is far from happy with the situation in Sweden -- living in cramped conditions with relatives, like many of his countrymen.
"We're staying at my aunt's house -- eight people in 90 square metres," the soft-spoken 20-year-old told AFP.
Speaking at a crowded Syrian cultural centre in the outskirts of Stockholm as new arrivals streamed out of a Swedish language class, he added: "If you need help from the Migration Board to find a place they throw you in the north where it's far below freezing. We can't live there."
Wearing a warm knitted jumper and a look of tired resignation, his mother Reina, 50, said she had expected something different.
"We came here with big hopes of starting over -- of having our own place to stay," she said.
Sweden has seen a sharp increase in Syrian refugees -- about 8,000 have arrived since it threw the doors open in September, bringing the total number this year to more than 14,000 -- of a total of 50,000 refugees. The Migration Board (Migrationsverket) offers everyone temporary accommodation in a growing network of refugee centres scattered around the country.
SEE ALSO: Syrians boost Stockholm population growth
However, at least a third of newly arrived Syrians go straight to relatives and friends -- mainly in the Stockholm area and Södertälje, located about an hour south of the capital, both of which have sizeable Syrian communities.
"It's chaos with housing," said Elizabet Toutoungi from the Syrian Association, a voluntary cultural organization. "The Migration Board helps with temporary refugee accommodation -- but many who have gone there haven't been able to stay because it's too tough for big families and people with children. It's like a hostel, and you can be there a long time."
Refugees at 20-year peak
About 8,000 refugees with residence permits live in reception centres, currently having to wait an average of six months for permanent accommodation, according to migration authorities. The queue is expected to double next year with up to 69,000 more refugees, the highest level since the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In Södertälje, the situation has already passed crisis proportions, said Social Democratic mayor Boel Godner.
During the Iraq war, the town -- with a population of 90,000 -- took in more refugees than all of North America did, and is home today to 25,000 Middle Eastern Christians, many of whom belong to the Syrian Orthodox church.
"We've had at least 700 new families in the last year and they all live with relatives and friends -- it's often cramped with two or three families in an apartment meant for one," said Godner. Although she supports Sweden's liberal refugee policy, she wants to remove refugees' right to choose where they stay when they arrive. With a further 2,000 Syrians expected in Södertälje next year, she is worried about the long-term consequences for a district with 14 percent unemployment -- nearly double the national average.
"If we had the power to check we would say 'no, it's too crowded here'," she said. "Children have it tough at school... learning Swedish when everyone around them speaks the same (foreign) language. And it's hard to get jobs, which creates a lot of poverty and frustration. Many refugees would be better off if the whole country helped out -- there are districts that have not accepted a single refugee."
More must show solidarity
Sweden's Migration Minister Tobias Billström said Sweden can handle the upturn and he ruled out curbing refugees' freedom of movement, citing human rights accords. However he acknowledged that accommodation was a problem -- noting that Sweden has a housing shortage regardless of its refugee intake.
"All municipalities have to show solidarity," he told AFP, adding that the same applied to Europe. "We see problems with the fact that two countries -- Sweden and Germany, which are not European Union border states -- are accepting a disproportionate number of Syrians arriving in Europe."
"You only need to turn on your TV or open a newspaper to see pictures of the bloody conflict in Syria," he added, "and be reminded why everyone has to take their share of the responsibility."
Billström has promised extra funding to Södertälje and other councils, but Godner said it will not be enough. The issue has provoked little mainstream debate, not even when the government announced plans to award residency to all Syrian refugees – with the exception of war criminals. Some analysts say the rise of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats (SD) -- at about 10 percent in recent opinion polls -- is to blame and that Sweden is in denial about the potential impact of its generous migration policy.
RELATED: 'Sweden's integration debate skewed by political correctness'
"We have very high public support for a generous and liberal migration policy ... but at the same time SD has polarized the debate - they are driving the other parties into a more hard-line (liberal) position," said Adam Cwejman from the centre-right think tank Timbro.
"You're either for or against. There's no real debate about the long-term challenges in housing and employment," he said. "But we need to acknowledge some of the massive problems facing local councils."

The Most Versatile Classics Rider in Cycling
So which rider is the most versatile classics rider in the current peloton? Who has what it takes across all five of cycling's hardest one day races, the monument classics?
If we are to judge simply on the number of wins in these five races, it has been a ding dong battle for supremacy for the last few years between Fabian Cancellara and Tom Boonen. Boonen has four Paris-Roubaixs and three Tours of Flanders, both records. While Cancellara's total of six victories are spread between those two same races along with a single win in Milan San Remo.
But this is not about total victories. Boonen and Cancellara have been the two dominant Spring classics riders of their generation, but neither have ever even started either Liege-Bastogne-Liege nor the Tour of Lombardy.
Perhaps Phillipe Gilbert would be a better bet. The incumbent world champion has won both of the hilly classics in Liege and Lombardy and has finished on the podium of Milan San Remo and the Tour of Flanders. But in Paris-Roubaix, a race much less suited to Gilbert's physique, he has only ever finished a modest 52nd.
Although, he has yet to win a monument classic, in more recent years Peter Sagan has shown us a talent the likes of which has the potential to nab him wins in any of the five. But similarly to Boonen and Cancellara, he has yet to attempt either of the two hillier classics. Although still only 23 years old, he is sure to rectify this scenario before his career is out.
So just who is the most versatile monument classics rider in the current peloton?
One way to determine this is to consider all riders who have actually ridden all five races, add up their best finishing positions in each and the rider with the lowest score wins.
Using this system, Gilbert sits in third place, only let down by that 52nd place in Paris-Roubaix, to yield a score of 60.
The rider who would be in second place on this list is a team-mate of Gilbert's, another of the world champion brigade on the BMC team, Alessandro Ballan. The Italian has finished fourth, first and third respectively in Milan San Remo, Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix. A more modest showing in the hilly classics with 19th in Liége and 14th in the Tour of Lombardy is still good enough to give him a score of 41.
The rider at the top of this list is yet another rider from BMC. Cadel Evans? Thor Hushovd?
Nope…
The most versatile monument classics rider in the current peloton is Greg van Avermaet.
He has never won any of them or even finished on the podium but his lowest scores, in the order in which the five races appear on the calendar, are ninth, fourth, fourth, seventh and 12th, giving him the lowest score of any current rider of 36.
Van Avermaet is a curious type of rider who has all the attributes of a top classics contender. He's strong over short climbs, he has an enviable sprint and he seems to have a keen eye for reading a race. He has won Paris-Tours, a stage of the Vuelta and numerous stages of minor stage races. But for a number of reasons a big win has always eluded him.
One of the main apparent reasons is the team that he has chosen to be a part of. When Van Avermaet joined BMC in 2011 he was leaving an Omega-Pharma-Lotto team which was to be built around Gilbert for the coming season. This meant that Van Avermaet's chances of going for personal glory would be greatly reduced by the presence of Gilbert who ended up winning all three Ardennes classics in 2011. So Van Avermaet decided to leave.
The BMC team that Van Avermaet was joining contained a more balanced classics squad which included George Hincapie, Taylor Phinney, Karsten Kroon, Marcus Burghardt and Alessandro Ballan. Plenty of talent but plenty of races to go around. Indeed, this was the year that Van Avermaet won Paris-Tours along with the GP de Wallonie. But that winter, team owner Andy Rihs got out the cheque book once more and signed both Gilbert and Hushovd, which reduced Van Avermaet's opportunities for sole leadership of the team on race day. He was reduced to feeding off scraps in the big races and often acted as the tactical decoy for his more illustrious team-mates.
There are actually surprisingly few active riders who have ridden all five monument classics. And of those that have, they tend to be of the second tier of riders likely to win one of them. One would be inclined to think that times have changed since the days of the old World Cup competition where there was a season-long incentive to take part in all of these races and in its absence, that incentive is no longer there.
But even riders who took the World Cup seriously, indeed former winners of the World Cup like Paolo Bettini and Erik Zabel did not ride all five in their careers. Bettini never rode Roubaix and Zabel never rode in Lombardy. For the really big names when it comes to classics riders, there always seems to be at least one of the five races which they shy away from.
Here is the top 10 list of current riders with the lowest total finishing positions in the five monument classics*:
*I'm open to correction on riders who are possibly missing from this top 10. It's a tricky enough stat to research and come up with a definitive answer.

Older and disabled people could be disproportionately affected by plans to force councils in England to sell high-value social housing, campaigners say.
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the policy was likely to lead to a widespread sell-off of bungalows, which are often popular among the elderly.
It said 15,300 council-owned bungalows in England could be sold off by 2021.
But ministers say councils can decide not to sell a property if it meets "a particular need" or is hard to replace.
The Housing and Planning Bill - which the government says will help more people become homeowners - goes before the House of Lords later.
If it is passed, local authorities will be compelled to sell expensive properties as they become vacant, to "ensure that the money locked up in high value vacant housing stock will be reinvested in building new homes".Warning over 'bungalow sell-off plan'
According to the Bill, what will count as a "high value" property is likely to vary in different areas.
However, the foundation called on ministers to make bungalows - which it says are in high demand - and sheltered housing exempt from the initiative.
How will extending Right to Buy work?
The increasing reliance on costly, insecure tenancies in the private-rented sector to house families on low incomes will only serve to trap more people in poverty Brian Robson, Joseph Rowntree Foundation
Such a move would bring England in line with Northern Ireland, where councils are not forced to sell bungalows or ground-floor flats under a similar initiative.
In the foundation's report, researchers from Cambridge University said they found high demand for bungalows meant they were almost three times more likely to be sold off and would be harder to replace because of the amount of land needed.
It also estimated that while bungalows make up 9% of council-owned housing, they were likely to make up 25% of high-value property sales because of their higher cost and more frequent vacancies - a result of people moving into residential care or tenants moving later in life.
One in five older people currently lives in a bungalow, a proportion that increases steadily from 55-75, according to the report. This figure rises to one in four when there is someone sick or disabled in an older person's household.
'Acute housing crisis'
Brian Robson, from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the housing Bill would reduce the number of affordable homes at a time of an "acute housing crisis".
"We risk holding a great British bungalow sell-off that will make things worse for older and disabled tenants who are trying to find suitable, affordable accommodation," he said.
"The increasing reliance on costly, insecure tenancies in the private-rented sector to house families on low incomes will only serve to trap more people in poverty."
However, a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities would have the power to decide not to sell a property "if it meets a particular need and would be difficult to replace".
"Planning policy already requires local plans to take the housing needs of older and disabled people into account. Where there is a local need, councils can set much clearer standards for accessible and wheelchair-adaptable new homes," he added.

LARAMIE, Wyo. – The University of Hawai'i football team had a conference-opening win within its grasp before eventually falling to defending Mountain Division champion Wyoming in overtime, 28-21, Saturday night at War Memorial Stadium.For the second straight visit to Laramie, UH (2-2, 0-1 MW) went into overtime with Wyoming. And like their last visit in 2013, the Rainbow Warriors left with bitter disappointment as the Cowboys regained possession of the Paniolo Trophy.UH was seemingly in control for much of the game. The Rainbow Warrior defense had its best defensive effort in more than four years, holding Wyoming to just 269 total yards – including just 92 passing yards by highly-touted quarterback Josh Allen. Meanwhile the UH offense racked up 450 yards of offense and nearly doubled up the Cowboys in time of possession.But the Cowboys (2-2, 1-0 MW) made the big plays when they needed, capped by an interception off a tipped pass to seal the game on the final play of overtime.Through nearly three quarters, UH used a stifling defensive effort and a ball-control offense to take a 14-7 lead. But right aftercappped an 89-yard UH drive with a touchdown and a UH lead, the Cowboys answered. Tyler Hall took the ensuing kickoff 97 yards to knot the score with less than a minute left in the third quarter.The Cowboys used another big play to set up their next score as Trey Woods' 59-yard run led to an Austin Conway 3-yard scoring run to give Wyoming the lead early in the fourth quarter. A John Urusa 50-yard pass fromknotted the score at 21-21 with 8:18 remaining. It was a score that stood for the rest of regulation.Once in overtime, the Cowboys struck fast as Allen found James Price for a 25-yard touchdown on the first play of the extra frame. Wyoming then sealed the win on Cash Malui's interception on the second play of UH' ensuing possession.Saint Juste recorded his third 100-yard game of the season and his fifth in the last six games, dating to last year, after finishing with 120 yards and a touchdown. Ursua nabbed eight catches for 102 yards and a touchdown, while Brown set career highs for completions (29) and attempts (39), finishing with 280 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.led UH's defensive charge with 10 tackles and 1.5 sacks.The Rainbow Warriors will next play their first home game in nearly a month when they face Colorado State in a Mountain West contest on Saturday, Sept. 30. Kickoff is set for 6:00 p.m. at Aloha Stadium.
On the wake of Wednesday's NBC News report that Rex Tillerson's now infamous “moron” remark was in response to President Donald Trump reportedly asking for a tenfold (!?) increase of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough claimed we may be closer now to a nuclear war than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski linked the NBC report to Trump's “erratic, unpredictable…and extremely concerning behavior,” and Scarborough added that Sen. Bob Corker, a leader in Trump's own party, said the president's rhetoric could lead the U.S. to World War III.
“This statement is unprecedented in modern American history, from a leader on the Hill whose president is in the same party with them,” Scarborough said. “It's never happened before.”
Scarborough called out Republicans for remaining silent as President Donald Trump senselessly provokes World War III.
“Every Republican senator on Capitol Hill has the record before them,” Scarborough said. “Calling for a tenfold increase in nuclear weapons, having the most powerful Republican on Capitol Hill saying Donald Trump's erratic words and actions are leading us towards World War III.”
Scarborough continued that no Senate Republicans have publicly refuted Corker's comments, claiming that their silence is a sign they agree with their colleague.
The Morning Joe co-host then said “foreign policy people” have told him off the record, with regards to North Korea, “that actually we are far closer to a cataclysmic event than even the media is talking about.”
He challenged Republicans to push back against the president's provocations.
“These Republican senators in the middle of October 2017 have that responsibility for millions and millions of Americans and others across the globe, and if they can't do that, then there's something called the 25th Amendment that they're going to have to start looking at,” Scarborough said. “This is not acceptable as the status quo. We have the most powerful Republican on Capitol Hill saying the president of the United States could be leading us toward nuclear war, and Republican senators remain silent.”
MSNBC's Mike Barnicle noted that during the Cuban Missile Crisis, leaders in both Moscow and Washington D.C. were “rational actors.”
“And I don't think you can say comfortably, with any assurance, that today in Washington D.C. we have a rational actor.”
“Where are the Republicans?” Scarborough asked, of GOP lawmakers still standing by Trump.

Blocks is already behind its projected May 2016 delivery date, so it's probably heartening for backers to see some progress. The company said its Android-based "factory-ready devices" are currently undergoing final testing before hitting the mass production lines. The watches are now slated to ship in September.
At launch, you'll have six modules to choose from: a GPS unit, an extra battery, a pulse sensor, a humidity/temperature/altitude sensor, a programmable button and a flashlight. Block says add-ons for body temperature, perspiration, fingerprint authentication and gesture control are in the works. Since the platform is open, third-party developers can make more parts as well.
Each Blocks purchase comes with a watch face unit, called a "Core," along with four modules that form the strap; larger-wristed folks can go up to five links. If all goes well with testing, then, the days of having a super-powered smartwatch could come very soon.
All the graduation speech hype seemed to begin with the famous Vonnegut “sunscreen” speech, purportedly given during the MIT commencement in 1997. And while anybody in his right mind would agree that you should absolutely wear sunscreen, almost everyone now knows that the speech itself was never delivered to an audience, nor was it written by Vonnegut. Kofi Annan gave the MIT commencement address that year, and the “sunscreen” speech was actually composed by a columnist for the Chicago Tribune, Mary Schmich. She has no idea why people attributed her column to Vonnegut, but Wired magazine reported that she was not even that impressed with it; she thought it was silly. Either way, the advice it contained has become quite famous—director Baz Luhrmann even turned it into a song in 1999.

Trust is foundational to business, yet maintaining it—particularly throughout a global economy—is expensive, time-consuming, and, in many cases, ineffective. Could blockchain be part of the answer?
Blockchain is more than the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Organizations throughout the public and private sectors have begun exploring how this technology might profoundly transform some of their most basic operations, from contract execution to transactions with customers and suppliers.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger that enables communities to record and share information. Members maintain their own copies of the information and must validate any updates collectively via a shared consensus mechanism. The information could represent transactions, contracts, assets, identities, or practically anything else that can be described in digital form. Entries are permanent, transparent, and searchable, which makes it possible for community members to view transaction histories in their entirety.
A protocol manages the way new edits or entries are initiated, validated, recorded, and distributed. With blockchain, cryptology replaces third-party intermediaries as the keepers of trust, with all participants running algorithms to certify the integrity of the whole. This creates a trustworthy, transparent, immutable repository of truth that is highly resistant to outages, manipulation, and censorship.
Rewiring Markets
Blockchain's ability to replace intermediaries is precisely why this technology matters. It can reduce overhead costs when parties trade assets directly with each other. Its ability to guarantee authenticity across institutional boundaries will likely help parties think about the authenticity of records, content, and transactions in new ways. Consider, for example, the efficiencies that shared ledger technology might bring to the labyrinthine global payments market, or how a trusted, transparent, stable environment might help developing countries reduce the estimated $1.26 trillion they lose each year to corruption, bribery, theft, and tax evasion.¹
The financial services industry (FSI) is today's institutional authority of record for payments and remittances. It plays an important role in the issuing, trading, and ownership of financial instruments, and in the stability of the global financial system. It comes as no surprise, then, that FSI organizations are aggressively pursuing blockchain investment and experimentation. Outside of the financial sector, organizations across industries are also ramping up blockchain programs and exploring opportunities such as next-generation payments, loyalty and rewards platforms, smart contracts, asset management, and exchange scenarios.
Patterns of Value
New blockchain use cases are emerging weekly, but this technology is not applicable to all business and operational problems. It's worth examining both the underlying benefits of blockchain² and the associated challenges:
Transparency. Ease of sharing and visibility are essential features of blockchain; lack of one or the other is often a central driver of blockchain adoption. These features become particularly critical in transactions that involve more than one organization making blockchain entries.
Trust. The immutability of blockchain makes it nearly impossible for changes to be made once it has been established, which increases confidence in data integrity and reduces opportunities for fraud.
Disintermediation. With blockchain, peer-to-peer consensus algorithms transparently record and verify transactions, eliminating the need for a third party and potentially reducing costs, delays, and general complexity.
Collaboration. Blockchain can be programmed to instigate specific transactions when other transactions are completed. This could help parties collaborate, without increasing risk, on transactions with multiple dependencies or those authored by different parties.
Security. With private and public key cryptography part of blockchain's protocol, transactional integrity becomes virtually unassailable. Trust zones can also be established, including open public ledgers and permission-based shared or private blockchains.
Where Do You Start?
Early adopters, largely within FSI, are piloting blockchain in innovation labs, filing patents, and investing in technology startups. Organizations across industries can aggressively explore scenarios in which this technology could reinvent parts of their operations, value chains, or business models. Specific areas of focus may include:
Education. Blockchain can be confusing, and some of the earliest and most public use cases involving bitcoin may be deemed irrelevant or underwhelming. Concerted education efforts may be required, ideally coupled with a disciplined approach to innovation and a prototype demonstrating potential use cases specific to a given organization and industry.
Embrace the ecosystem. The blockchain community is seeing considerable investment from established industry institutions, technology vendors, academia, venture capital firms, and startups, among others. Now is not the time to worry about which technologies or standards will dominate. That said, any solutions can include abstractions around protocols and platform features to allow portability should it eventually become necessary to switch to a different standard.
Consider partners. With the blockchain ecosystem growing, it may make sense to partner with one or more vendors. But before signing on the dotted line, try to understand what makes a prospective partner's offering unique. For instance, is the partner willing to co-invest in solutions (or even proofs of concept) that will meet the organization's specific needs? Given the nature of blockchain, partnerships with business partners, peers, and competitors can be considered.
Know your trust zones. Public, private (i.e., permission-based), or hybrid? Established players often create tightly managed, permission-based zones that basically impose legacy thinking about what constitutes “trust” on a new architecture. Each case will likely be unique and thus require its own trust zone variation. With blockchain, the most effective option may not always be permission-based.
Understand blockchain's limitations. Blockchain's consensus algorithms³ require more computing power and introduce delays. The very features that protect blockchain against theft and fraud could also lower performance and limit scale if not correctly implemented. As a result, high-volume transactions with latency sensitivity may not be ideal candidates for this technology right now. In addition, blockchain was not originally designed to ensure the privacy of participants or the confidentiality of their transactions. Architects and information security teams need to design blockchain solutions accordingly.
Regulation and compliance. With blockchain technology, progress is outpacing regulation, which may help organizations gain momentum with their initiatives in the short term. Eventually, regulation—and legal precedents that recognize blockchain transactions—will almost certainly catch up with this technology. Additionally, the adoption of smart contracts will require a legal framework, which is still in development. Private blockchains will be managed under private agreements.
*****
Business, government, and society are built on trust, and any promise to use modern computing principles to transform how we achieve and apply trust is disruptive—perhaps on a historic scale. Will the eventual embrace of blockchain mean that venerable institutions of trust disappear? That seems unlikely, but it does mean that, very soon, they may have to transform themselves if they hope to continue participating in blockchain's brave new world.

If you're debating which Pokémon game to pick up later this year, developers Game Freak just highlighted one of the biggest differences between the games: they don't take place at the same exact time.
As the trailer above shows, Sun and Moon are set 12 hours apart from one another—which means that events will play out in different ways, depending on what game you're playing. Sun will obviously be during the daytime, while Moon takes place during the nighttime, judging by this footage.
Here's a closer look at the day/night cycles:
And some more specifics on how the time differences will work:
The two worlds of Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moonare 12 hours apart and are tied to the actual time in real life. Pokémon Sun operates on the same time as your Nintendo 3DS system, but time in the world of Pokémon Moon is shifted by 12 hours. Some Totem Pokémon which appear in the trials throughout the game will also be different in each version. Players will encounter different Pokémon on the same route depending on whether it is day or night, which means players will have different experiences according to their chosen version of the game.

Also new: photography! It reminds me a little of Pokémon Snap, though it's unclear if these pictures can only be taken at very specific locations (which is way less exciting.)

The social element also looks interesting, though it appears as if you'll only be able to respond with prefabricated messages.

The trailer also introduces the idea of “Ultra” Pokémon, such as this one:
...though it's unclear on what exactly “Ultra” means. I do know that word isn't “Mega,” though, so I'm not holding my breath on the return of that type of monster. Sorry, folks.

Here's the press release, teasing a bit more about Ultras:
All over Alola, rumors speak of creatures that possess mighty powers and pose a threat to humans and Pokémon. They're called Ultra Beasts, and there are said to be multiple Ultra Beasts in existence. It seems that the Aether Foundation is conducting research on these Ultra Beasts, referring to each of them by a code name. UB-01 is an Ultra Beast that has a body composed of a glass-like substance. It constantly changes shape, and its movements resemble that of a young girl. Whilst evidence of something like a survival instinct can be observed in UB-01, no one knows whether it has a will of its own or any emotions at all.
Finally...why are Pokémon's live-action trailers so freakin good?
Chelsea coach Rui Faria slapped with six-match STADIUM ban after altercation with an official during Sunderland defeat
Jose Mourinho's feeling that football's authorities have it in for Chelsea will have been amplified when his assistant Rui Faria was hit with a six-game stadium ban on Thursday.
Faria's punishment was confirmed after an independent disciplinary commission heard the evidence of his angry touchline clash with referee Mike Dean and fourth official Phil Dowd at Stamford Bridge last month.
Chelsea declined to comment last night and will wait to see written reasons for the punishment. If they do not appeal, Faria will miss the games at home to Norwich on Sunday, at Cardiff on the final day of the Barclays Premier League season and the first four domestic games of next season.
VIDEO Scroll down to watch a sarcastic Jose Mourinho after the Sunderland defeat
Off you go: Jose Mourinho holds back his assistant coach Rui Faria after he was sent off by Mike Dean (left)
Anger: Faria was infuriated by Dean's decision to give Sunderland a penalty during the defeat
The flashpoint, when Faria had to be dragged away from the officials, followed Fabio Borini's winning goal for Sunderland from a disputed penalty which inflicted Mourinho's first home defeat as Chelsea manager in 78 Barclays Premier League matches.
It was one of three disciplinary charges to emerge from the game for the club.
Ramires has been banned for four games for flinging an arm into Seb Larsson's face and Mourinho was charged with improper conduct by the FA for sarcastic post-match comments made in the media about the performance of referee Dean and referees' chief Mike Riley. It is his third charge of the season and the hearing is expected to be next week.
'I do not feel free,' said the Chelsea boss, last week. 'Every time I speak, there's a consequence. Even when I think the referee is amazing, there's a reason to be charged. So I don't feel free at all.'
Faria is Mourinho's long-term confidante and sounding board on the bench and also takes the team's pre-match warm-up on the pitch.
The two Portuguese have worked continuously together for 12 years and the hard-line punishment will hurt Mourinho.
It is one of the most severe bans handed out to coaching staff because there were two breaches of the rules and because the officials were the target of his verbal abuse.
Calm down: Mourinho tries his hardest to hold Faria back on the touchline during an angry exchange
Neatly tucked away: Fabio Borini had no problems scoring the resulting penalty at Stamford Bridge
The first breach was using 'insulting words and behaviour' towards Dowd and the second was 'improper conduct' after Dean had ordered him to leave the technical area. He was also fined £30,000 and warned about future conduct.
Newcastle's Alan Pardew was banned from the stadium for three games and from the touchline for a further four after his butt on Hull midfielder David Meyler. Paul Ince was banned from the stadium for five games after a tirade at an angry fourth official when manager of Blackpool.
Human rights challenge against ‘named person' legislation refused by appeal judges
A challenge to legislation which will see a “named person” assigned to every child in Scotland has been refused by appeal judges in the Inner House of the Court of Session.
Four charities and three individuals contended that provisions in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 passed by the Scottish Parliament were “incompatible” with the European Convention on Human Rights and EU data protection law, and hence beyond the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.
However, the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Carloway, sitting with Lord Bracadale and Lord Malcolm, upheld a decision to refuse a petition for judicial review of the legislation introduced by the Scottish Ministers.
In January 2015 Lord Pentland held that the named person service provisions contained in Part 4 of the 2014 Act did not contravene the European Convention, EU law on data protection or fundamental common law rights, and that the subject matter was “within the devolved competence”of the Scottish Parliament.
However, the petitioners – (First) The Christian Institute, (Second) Family Education Trust, (Third) The Young Me Sufferers (“Tymes”) Trust, (Fourth) Care (Christian Action Research And Education), (Fifth) and (Sixth) James and Rhianwen Mcintosh, and (Seventh) Deborah Thomas – appealed.
They argued that the automatic naming of a person to be allocated to each child – without the consent of the child or parent and without any assessment of need – interfered with the Article 8 right to respect for a person's private and family life and for the integrity of the home. They argued that the provisions interfered with parents' rights to determine, in accordance with their conscience and religion, the welfare and upbringing of their children, in terms of Article 9 and Article 2 of Protocol 1.
The petitioners submitted that the scheme was not “in accordance with law” since it lacked transparency, accessibility and predictability, and that it amounted to an “arbitrary interference” by the State.
The petitioners also contended that the sections of the 2014 Act which deal with the sharing of information were incompatible with the requirement of the European Parliament and Council Directive on Data Protection, as read and applied in the light of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. For this reason also the provisions were ultra vires of the Scottish Parliament.
The petitioners further argued that the information sharing provisions ran contrary to the Data Protection Act 1998 and related to reserved matters – i.e. data protection – in terms of the Scotland Act 1998 and thus, once again, were ultra vires of the Parliament.
The interveners, Community Law Advice Network (Clan Childlaw) – who applied and were granted for leave to intervene in the case in the “public interest” – were concerned only with the extent to which the information sharing provisions were compatible with children's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention.
Refusing the appeal based upon the Article 8 right to respect for a private and family life, the judges observed that all that the legislation does, and is intended to do, is “…to provide for every child and his or her family a suitably qualified professional who can, if necessary, act as a single point of contact between the child and any public service from which the child could benefit”.
Delivering the opinion of the court, the Lord Justice Clerk said: “The mere creation of a named person, available to assist a child or parent, no more confuses or diminishes the legal role, duties and responsibilities of parents in relation to their children than the provision of social services or education generally. It has no effect whatsoever on the legal, moral or social relationships within the family. The legislation does not involve the state taking over any functions currently carried out by parents in relation to their children.”
The challenges under Article 9 and Article 2 of Protocol 1 also failed, as the court held that the 2014 Act contained ”no colourable interference, or even potential interference” with a parent's or child's right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that the legislation contained “no provision which bears upon a child's right to education or his parent's right to bring up a child according to his conscience and religion”.
If the scheme was seen as interfering with Convention rights, the court considered that such interference is in accordance with the law, has a legitimate aim and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of, amongst other things, public safety, the prevention of crime, the protection of health or morals or of the rights of others.
The court held that the scheme has the appearance of “achieving a balance” in which the advantages of early detection of potential welfare issues involving a child “outweigh” any adverse effect of the measure on the Convention rights of parents and children generally.
The challenges to the information sharing and disclosure provisions in the Act were also rejected.
Lord Carloway said: “The 2014 Act makes it clear to all those concerned that information may be shared between service providers in certain defined circumstances; notably if it is necessary or expedient to enable a named person to carry out his or her statutory functions. These functions are clearly set out and involve, broadly stated, advising the child or young person and helping him or her to access the correct service or support and raising a matter concerning the child with a service provider or relevant authority.”
The court further held that the 2014 Act did not encroach upon reserved matters, stating: “Its pith and substance is child protection.”
On the issue of standing, however, the court disagreed with the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the first to fourth petitioners, the four charities, had no standing to bring the present proceedings.
The standing of the fifth to seventh (individual) petitioners to bring the proceedings was conceded, but the Lord Ordinary held that first to fourth (institutional) petitioners lacked “sufficient interest” entitling them to seek judicial review of Part 4 of the Act.
However, the appeal judges considered that, applying the “broad tests” set out by the UK Supreme Court, they did have standing “in general” to challenge the legislation.
“It was appropriate that interest groups, who showed sufficient interest in the subject matter, should be permitted to assist with the proper development of public law and to call public authorities to account,” the Lord Justice Clerk added.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - With the 24-17 victory over the New York Jets in MetLife Stadium on Sunday afternoon, Tom Brady earned his 187th regular season win, surpassing Brett Favre and Peyton Manning for the most regular season wins in NFL history. The Patriots enjoyed similar success in the local broadcast ratings, as the fixture was the highest-rated program in the Boston market for the past week.
Sunday's broadcast captured a household rating of 32.9, the second-highest household rating of the season behind only the opening night primetime matchup and Super Bowl LI banner celebration, while the market share of 69 was the Patriots' highest market share since Week 8 of last year. In comparison, the 32.9 household rating surpassed last season's Week 6 matchup vs. Cincinnati which featured Tom Brady's return to Gillette Stadium.
The Patriots return home next week for a Super Bowl LI rematch when they host the Atlanta Falcons at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, October 22. The 8:30 p.m. ET kickoff will be televised nationally on NBC's Sunday Night Football with Al Michaels handling play-by-play duties accompanied by color commentary from Cris Collinsworth.
There's nothing more annoying than when you're speaking passionately about a subject and someone picks up on the way you're speaking, rather the content of your speech.
There will be some men who have never experienced that but it's unlikely there are any women who don't know what I mean. For every teenage boy who is freely allowed to go about their daily business by society, there's a teenage girl who gets pulled up every time she says “shit”, “fuck” or in Millie Bobby Brown's case “bitchin”. When she tweeted that word last week she was publically called out by Netflix's official US Twitter account, a twee and gimmicky branded embodiment of the Steve Buscemi “how do you do, fellow kids” meme.
Your jokes are shit, Netflix
Whether the Browns are comfortable with their child swearing is entirely up to them (hopefully they encourage her to say anything she wants), but it's not our job to police the language of a teenage girl, especially when “bitchin” is an absolutely excellent choice of word.
It's just a joke, right? Well, it would be if jokingly pulling a woman up on her “bad language” didn't have the exact same effect as being sincere. It indicates that even after decades of feminism women are still being monitored for how “ladylike” we are. When you make these jokes, it shows that your focus is more on the fact the person you're speaking to is a woman than what they're saying, even if you don't really believe that there's a difference in what language men and women should use. It's, at worst, infuriating and, at best, an unfunny inconvenience that we can do without.
It's something you'll hear a lot if, like me, you're a woman who likes to swear. Granted, my swearing vocabulary is pretty small and very unimaginative and mostly used in mundane situations. Possibly out of habit, I frequently reach for “fuck” and “shit” where a softer “bugger” or “bastard” would suffice, which might be why, in my teens, boys would accuse me of “swearing for effect”, even though they swore much louder and more frequently than I did.
Who the fuck are you?
Yes, women do swear “for effect”. Men swear for effect too. That's really what swearing is all about.
It's unsurprising that we're still focused on these silly stereotypes, given that, for example, in movie scripts, the language written for men and women is so different that a computer can tell the difference between whether a random line is spoken by a man or a woman with 74% accuracy. This research by Cornell University confirms multiple findings that show male characters have language peppered with swear words, while women use more greetings and words like “please”.
Of course, everybody has to temper their language in certain circumstances, but exclusively calling out women for how she speaks, especially in public, can be damaging.
It's not just swearing either – a few months back, I was on the train with a couple of friends when a man aged about 40 came over to us, interrupted mid-sentence and said he had needed to move seats, away from us, because the amount I used the word “like” in conversation with my friends was unbearable to him.
He obviously hadn't expected us to stick up for ourselves – we're all nearing 30 but perhaps look a few years younger – as he was shocked when his “I'm not being rude…” was met with “actually you are being rude”. He eventually went away baffled and a little angry. But despite knowing he was an idiot, I felt uncomfortable speaking for the last bit of the train journey and it's still stayed with me. I think about it every single time I'm speaking in front of people or when something I say might be broadcast.
Of course, this isn't exclusive to how we speak – men feeling entitled to have a say in how a woman conducts herself stretches past words and into the everyday things we do. I've had men on public transport sigh dramatically when they see I'm putting mascara on – as if it somehow affects their day that my makeup wasn't perfect before I dared show my face to a busload of people.
But speech is particularly important because it's no secret that women's voices feature less in parliament, business, in the media and almost every element of the public sphere. Criticising how a young woman expresses herself is adding another completely unnecessary hurdle for her to overcome on the way to becoming one of those voices. Joking about how a “lady shouldn't swear” might not seem like a big deal but every instance her speech is criticised compounds. Ultimately, even the most resilient women can be less inclined to deal with the hassle of speaking up, despite often having something valuable to say.
For the first time ever, revenues of Maruti Suzuki surged past those of its parent's local business, thanks to the strengthened hold of the Indian company over the market, and underpinning its importance for its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor Corporation.
The maker of cars such as Baleno and Swift, Maruti Suzuki's net revenues stood at Rs 66,909 crore last year as against Rs 60,047 crore (standalone) net sales posted by Suzuki Motor Corporation during the same year.
Absolute sales of Maruti Suzuki last year stood at 15.65 lakh units as compared to 6.39 lakh units of Suzuki, Japan. When compared to 2015-16, Maruti recorded a much bigger jump. In 2015-16, Maruti Suzuki sold 14.29 lakh units as compared to 6.3 lakh units sold by Suzuki Japan.
RC Bhargava, Chairman of Maruti Suzuki India, termed the development as not surprising. "Our car sales have been higher than Suzuki Japan but their per-unit price is higher than us. Their home market sales have not grown during the past 2-3 years.”
Suzuki Japan's revenues also include revenues from its motorcycle business whereas for Maruti Suzuki its revenues are based only on sales of passenger vehicles. Suzuki also sells motorcycles and scooters in India but has a minuscule market share.
Thanks to the success of new models like Baleno, Brezza, Ignis, Celerio and Ciaz (refreshed) Maruti has been able to strengthen its hold over the Indian market during last year. With the addition of the all-new Dzire a few months ago, Maruti has improved its market share to more than 50 percent in the domestic market.
This year so far, Maruti Suzuki beat the industry's growth with 17 percent increase in volumes at 8.22 lakh during the April-September period as compared to the same period last year. The industry so far during the same period posted a growth of 9 percent at 11.63 lakh units.
Though the Delhi-based carmaker faced constraints with regards to production capacity for the whole of last financial year, with the start of production at its newest plant in Gujarat, Maruti Suzuki was able to ramp up production at a significant pace. This brought down the waiting period on certain models from six months to a few weeks.
The Japanese passenger vehicle market during the last four years fell 4 percent to 8.02 million units last year (8.34 million) whereas the Indian passenger vehicle market closed last year at 3.04 million units as compared to 2.5 million units posted four years ago, reporting a growth of 22 percent.
New launches lined up — two new models every year till 2020 — and a sustained improvement in new vehicle purchases will likely help Maruti Suzuki maintain its lead over Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan.
Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki's royalty payout to its parent company has grown nearly four times in the last eight years. By the end of the last financial year, Maruti Suzuki had paid Rs 3,848 crore. In 2009-10 this figure stood at Rs 1,016 crore.
Royalty thus paid to Suzuki now accounts for 52 percent of profit after tax as of the last financial year compared to 36 percent in 2014-15 and 13 percent in 2005-06.

MARLINTON, W.Va. — A former Pocahontas County sheriff's deputy sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison last November will ask a judge Friday to reconsider his sentence.
A hearing is scheduled for 10:45 in Marlinton in the case of Bradley Totten.
Totten, of Hillsboro, was indicted twice on a total of 66 counts claiming that from 1995 to 2010 he would arrest women and teenagers and then force them to have sex with him. There were believed to have been at least 20 victims. Totten eventually pleaded guilty to a single count of sexual abuse involving a 17-year-old girl. There were multiple assaults of the same victim.
“You're going to start serving time today,” Pocahontas County Circuit Judge Jim Rowe told Totten during his sentencing last Nov. 8.
Under his original sentence, Totten would have to serve at least 10 years before there's a chance for parole.
Judge Rowe will preside over Friday's hearing.
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A 22-year-old woman in the United States is publicly auctioning her virginity to pay for her college education, sparking a heated online debate about sex and morality.
Teen girls are seen in a file photo. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi
The student from San Diego, California, who is using the pseudonym Natalie Dylan for “safety reasons,” said she had no moral dilemma with her decision and found it “empowering”.
But few bloggers sided with her and some suspected her intentions.
“I don't think auctioning my virginity will solve all my problems,” she told celebrity television show The Insider on Wednesday. “But it will create some financial stability. I'm ready for the controversy, I know it will come along. I'm ready to do this.”
“We live in a capitalist society. Why shouldn't I be allowed to capitalize on my virginity?” she added.
The woman, who has earned a bachelor degree in women's studies and now wants to start a master's degree in marriage and family therapy, is hoping the bidding will hit $1 million.
The online auction site eBay turned her down so the auction will take place at a Nevada brothel, the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, where her sister is working to pay off her college debts.
The date for the auction was not immediately available.
In a flurry of media interviews and appearances, she admitted that her mother, a fourth grade teacher, does not agree with her decision. Many on the Internet also disapprove.
“Maybe this is the conservative in me coming out, but this seems so wrong,” wrote one blogger, Mike. “Isn't this prostitution?”
“I must say I feel sad for the future of our society,” said Mike from Montclair State University in New Jersey.
“What disgusts me about this whole thing is the fact that she is promoting it so heavily. It seems less about having some guy pay for her virginity and more about trying to get her 15 minutes and a reality show,” said a blogger called “Ent Lawyer”.
She does have her supporters — not surprisingly Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.
“I think it's a tremendous idea. Why lose it to some guy in the backseat of a Toyota when you can pay for your education?” he told reporters.
Residents of Deer Trail, Colo., a small town 60 miles east of Denver, are considering an ordinance to issue hunting licenses for drones and a bounty system to reward anyone who shoots down or damages an unmanned aerial vehicle.
"They fly in town, they get shot down," explained Phillip Steel, the Deer Trail resident who drafted the anti-drone ordinance, per Denver's 7News.
A draft of the anti-drone ordinance, provided by DeerTrailColorado.com, would allow the town to issue an unlimited number of drone-hunting licenses for $25 each, so long as those issuing the licenses follow basic guidlines.
No background checks would be required, and all licenses would be "issued on an anonymous basis." Additionally, there's no residency requirement, so long as the hunting occurs within Deer Trail only. The license applicant must also be older than 21 and "able to read and understand English."
Those who are successful in shooting down or damaging a drone will be rewarded for their marksmanship. Bring in a fuselage or a wing with markings from the U.S. government, and the town will pay you $25. A whole drone? That's worth $100.
Town leaders acknowledge the ordinance is mostly symbolic, particularly as drone-hunting weapons are restricted to shotguns "12 gauge or smaller." There's also no shortage of pesky federal laws standing in their way, even though the measure asserts Deer Trail is "a sovereign political entity" entitled to maintain the security of its airspace.
"It's all novelty," Deer Trail Mayor Franks Fields cautioned to 7News, prompting Steel to respond: "To him it's a novelty, yes. To me, I'm serious."
The measure will go before the town council at its next meeting, scheduled for August 6.
If they don't pass it, "I will get my 25 signatures that I need on a petition and will force a special election to pass [it as a] citizen's initiative," Steel told the I-70 Scout, a newspaper in Eastern Colorado.
"I am pretty sure the whole thing is [illegal]," he continued, "but I would love to argue that in court. It is also against the law and the constitution to conduct covert surveillance on American citizens."
WATCH:
Most people can't wait to turn 21 so that they can drink. For me, it was the day I could finally petition the government to change my dad's immigration status. I filed the paperwork in February and believed it would be the beginning of sleeping easier at night, of not worrying about “la migra” every time the phone rang.
Eight months later, my father and I showed up at the immigration services office with our lawyer and notebooks full of supporting documents. The officer told us our petition should be approved, but not that day. We took this as an indication of another waiting period, but we remained upbeat: The officer told my father how to learn about his rights as a lawful permanent resident and acknowledged that he had paid the appropriate fees.

After the officer left the room several times, something changed in her demeanor, and the air in the room became thick with mounting uncertainty. She asked me to leave. I didn't want to, so she turned to my father and asked him to tell me to leave. I told myself I was just being paranoid and walked outside. As I waited, three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came in and took custody of my dad.
When our lawyer reappeared, the look on his face told me everything I needed to know. The world felt ripped from under my feet.
My dad wanted to follow the rules. He has been trying to adjust his status with the help of relatives since 2001. We filed the correct paperwork, paid the fees and lined up all his references, only for my dad to be dragged out of a little office and locked up. ICE could have chosen to grant my dad his residency, per the suggestion of our immigration officer. Instead, my father, a man who has filed his taxes every year, has no criminal record and is the sole provider for four children, wasn't even put out on monitor or bond. He is still being held in a detention center in Aurora, Colo., and is awaiting deportation proceedings unless ICE grants him the cancellation of his removal.
RICHMOND (CBS SF) — One person was killed and three others injured in a shooting in unincorporated North Richmond on Saturday night, a spokesman said Sunday.
At around 10 p.m., deputies responded to reports of several people who had been shot in front of a home in the 1600 block of First Street, Contra Costa County Sheriff's spokesman Jimmy Lee said.
Two victims were taken by private vehicle to Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo before deputies arrived at the scene, Lee said.
Two other victims remained at the scene and were taken by ambulance to John Muir Medical Center, he said.
One of the victims who had been taken to Doctors Medical Center — a 23-year-old man — was flown by helicopter to John Muir, where he later died, Lee said.
The victim's name was not released.
The three other victims were expected to survive, Lee said.
No suspects have been identified.
Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office at (925) 313-2600 or the anonymous tip line at (866) 846-3592.

After initially saying he was undecided on the topic, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is against gay conversion therapy. Christie faced criticism when he said earlier in the week he wasn't sure if he would sign legislation banning the practice on minors.
"Governor Christie does not believe in conversion therapy," spokesman Kevin Roberts said in a statement to the New Jersey Star-Ledger. "There is no mistaking his point of view on this when you look at his own prior statements where he makes clear that people's sexual orientation is determined at birth."
Gay conversion therapy, also known as reparative therapy, claims to be able to change the sexual orientation of gay people through religious counseling, intense therapy and other methods. Health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization, have all spoken out against conversion therapy, saying it can cause serious and long-term harm. The New Jersey state senate's health committee approved legislation banning the practice on Monday.
Christie, who is widely thought to have 2016 presidential aspirations, has not said whether he will sign the bill banning the practice. He remains opposed to same-sex marriage.
At a press conference Wednesday, Christie said he wasn't sure if he would sign the bill because he needed more information, as well as wanting to give parents as much leeway in raising their children as possible.
"I'm of two minds just on this stuff in general. Number one, I think there should be lots of deference given to parents on raising their children," Christie said at the press conference. "Generally, philosophically, on bills that restrict parents' ability to make decisions on how to care for their children, I'm generally a skeptic of those bills. Now, there can always be exceptions to those rules and this bill may be one of them."
Democrats, as well as his challenger in his re-election bid state senator Barbara Buono, immediately pounced, calling Christie's stance "disgusting," adding that "gay children don't need to be 'cured.'"
"It's an outrageous practice and it has no place in New Jersey," Buono said in a statement. "That Governor Christie would dignify this shameful practice is disgusting. I urge all New Jerseyans who value equality to speak out and make clear to Governor Christie that his intolerance has no place in our state."
California is the only state so far to outlaw gay conversion therapy, but a federal appeals court has put the implementation of the ban on hold.
The practice gained attention during the 2012 primary campaign when Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) and her husband, Marcus, were accused of using reparative therapy in their family's suburban Minneapolis treatment centers.

American business has a remarkable talent for short-sightedness—no doubt driven by the importance of public companies hitting that 10 percent improvement each year to support their share price, even if means sacrificing the longer-term prospects for their company.
We've seen this at work when it comes to corporations buying businesses only for the acquired's ability to contribute to a quarterly bottom line so that expected numbers can be reached rather than for the long-term benefits—or detriments— the purchase may bring to the company. We've seen this when it comes to companies taking short-cuts that improve current bottom-lines that ultimately submit entire industries to the long-term effects of increased regulation due to unconscionable business practices.
Now, we are seeing how big business' practice of supporting politicians who are all to willing to return the favor by pushing legislation that helps corporate short-term profits are leading to what may be one of the greatest challenge American business has ever faced—a government default on our nation's debts and the economic disaster likely to follow that will bring catastrophic fallout to the doorsteps of some of our largest companies.
Big business not only knows the part they've played in this folly—they are now beginning to admit and acknowledge their complicity.
I often try to remind anyone who will listen that—counter to presumptions based on fixed ideologies—it is not so much liberal and progressive Americans who are responsible for ‘big government' as it is “big business” that has brought us to the era of ever larger government.
Ask yourself why we have so many regulations that tend to fall harder on the shoulders of big business than on any other segment of American life. If you are being honest and objective, you cannot help but come to the conclusion that it is the transgressions of big business against the health and welfare of the public at large that have led to our heavily regulated society.
When big industry pours unconscionable amounts of toxic waste into the air our children breathe, the inevitable response, once we find out what they are doing to us, is going to be an empowered EPA that is ready, willing and able to provide government regulations designed to stop the offending behavior. When huge energy companies run up a track record of ecological destruction that threatens drinking water while pursuing unsafe operating practices that put thousands of employees and their surrounding communities at physical risk, the result is going to be greatly increased government regulation.
When mass-market food manufacturers use preservatives or other ingredients that are proven to be excessively harmful to the people who eat these foods, government will, inevitably, step in to put an end to these dangerous practices.
Why does big business engage in such behavior in the first place knowing that, sooner or later, they will be found out and their entire industry will pay the price?
Because it is far more cost efficient for business, in the short term, to spew toxic waste into the air than to make the investment in cleaner technologies that allow businesses to make its products without putting the public at risk. Similarly, a preservative packaged into a processed food that allows a product to stay on the shelves and available for sale for a longer period of time inures to the bottom line of the manufacturer while, again, putting the public at risk. And while all of this may have a negative long-term impact on the business, long-term is simply not part of the vocabulary in today's American business model.
Still, there is no getting around that were business to simply behave in a responsible way that does not so dramatically prioritize profits over public safety, we would have a substantially smaller government with far fewer regulations laid on American business.
Once a human being is hired to regulate, that individual is not likely to show up at the boss' office to inform her that the job has come to an end once that smokestack is no longer throwing killer fumes into the atmosphere. Indeed, it is far more likely that the regulator in question will do the only thing a regulator can do when they've completed a project if they wish to hang onto the job—begin regulating something else, whether it really needs it or not.
This is the road to too much regulation and it is a road we have blindly travelled.
But make no mistake— it all begins with the short term, self-destructive impulses of big business.

The same is now proving to be the case when it comes to government's inability to sensibly deal with the debt and—more specifically—debt ceilings.
Big business has played a significant part in putting us where we are and now, not only is the public facing potentially catastrophic consequences as a result, but big business is itself realizing that their behavior is turning out to be the financial equivalent of harikari—the ritual suicide practiced by samurai in traditional Japanese society.
If you question this, take a look at a terrific piece published in Sunday's Wonkblog over a Washington Post by Lydia DePillis under the title, “‘Shame on us': How businesses brought the debt limit mess onto themselves.”
In her piece, DePillis interviews Paul Stebbins, chairman of World Fuel Services—a Fortune 100 company—and delivers some terrific insights into how big business has itself to blame for the debt ceiling mess that, yet again, threatens world economic security and growth.
Stebbins gets to the heart of the problem when he says,
“We have a higher duty of care to engage this issue. It is grossly reckless to watch the long-term business trajectory of the U.S. to be at such risk. And we are part of the pathology that got us here. We've all had our K Street lobbyists who are part of the problem. You've got the classic narrative: Progressives say, 'fat cat CEOs want to throw grandma into the snow, and all their special tax interests.' And then you've got the Club for Growth that thinks we sold them out.”
Mr. Stebbins continues—
“The reality is, you go over to Capitol Hill and you say to some guy, 'why can't you guys get in a room and fix this thing?' And they nod at you very politely and say 'that was very nice of you to come, thank you for your input, you can go home now.' Because their reality is, the Club for Growth is telling every single Republican member of Congress 'we're going to raise $5 million to beat you in a primary if you even mention the word revenue.' And AARP is telling every Democratic member of Congress, 'if you even mention the word entitlement reforms, which is all that throw grandma into the snow stuff, we're going to raise $5 million and beat you in a primary.' And what makes a politician's life worth living? Reelection. So the CEOs had a bit of naiveté about the political realities of what makes it so hard for a lot of well-intentioned people to actually get to yes.”
Right.
Paul Stebbins clearly ‘gets' the problem and the role big business has played in bringing us to this precarious place. However, he remains unwilling to take the next step and recognize that the time has arrived for big business to take on the extremists in the Republican party who are responsible for putting the full faith and credit of the United States on the chopping block.
Maybe this is because Stebbins is a member of “Fix The Debt”—the CEO group that professes only to want to contribute their business expertise to solving the nation's debt crisis on a non-partisan basis.
On paper, the organization has always sounded like a good idea. However, a closer examination of the group reveals that they aren't nearly as non-partisan as they pretend to be—which is precisely why they have failed to have the impact they sought.
As reported by Huffington Post —
“But the bipartisanship is only skin deep, according to campaign finance records and non-profit tax filings reviewed by The Huffington Post, which reveal that Fix The Debt's biggest backers and partners are Republicans and Republican-allied.
HuffPost previously reported that members of the campaign's Fiscal Leadership Council currently calling for cuts to Social Security and Medicare have benefited from billions of dollars in war contracts, bailout funds and tax subsidies. But the CEOs haven't just been taking -- they've been giving, too, in the form of political donations to many of the lawmakers who keep the spending spigots turned on.
Of the 86 CEOs on the council, all but 10 donated to political candidates in 2012, for a total of more than $3.2 million through Oct. 17. Of that, 79 percent, or $2.5 million, was donated in support of Republicans, while only 21 percent aided Democrats.
(Continue reading)
CEO contributions to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney outpaced those to President Barack Obama by more than three to one. Overall, contributions supporting Romney's bid, including donations to allied super PAC Restore Our Future, reached $1.6 million, accounting for more than half of all contributions made by the Fix The Debt CEOs.”
So, while there is reason to appreciate Mr. Stebbins' comments as recorded by the Washington Post, his affiliations would seem to reveal that he and his friends remain unwilling to do what they could to help resolve their—and our—situation.
What good does it do for big businessmen like Paul Stebbins to see the role big business has played in taking our economy to the edge of destruction via using the debt ceiling to hold the nation hostage to the demands of about 80 members of Congress if Stebbins and friends are unwilling to do what is necessary to bring this horrible behavior to an end?
The time has come for big business to accept that their party of choice has blown it—and not just in a way that threatens the security of the average American, but in a way that has brought great risk to their own highly profitable operations.
There is only one way we put an end to this—large political contributors, such as those found sitting on the Fiscal Leadership Council of “Fix The Debt”, must put their deep pockets to work where it will do the most good—defeating Congressional extremists more interested in their own re-election than the present and future welfare of American citizens.
While it is fine for Mr. Stebbins to call out Club For Growth and AARP for their willingness to put money behind challengers to Members of Congress who don't cave to their special interests, what good is it to acknowledge this if you are not prepared to use your own money to play the game the way it is played?
Mr. Stebbins relays a story to Ms. DePillis during their interview—
“I'll tell you a story. Bob Zoellick [one time President of the World Bank] was in Australia, and the foreign minister took Bob aside and said, 'Don't you realize, America is one debt deal away from being great again.' Think about that. Because the whole world is watching the most important experiment in self-governance in the world, and can you do this. And if you could, can you imagine what signal that would send the world.”
Right again, Mr. Stebbins. But it is not just the whole world that is watching as millions right here at home are very much doing the same.
If Paul Stebbins really wishes to save his country from self-destructing while gaining the support and appreciation of the American public, why not put his money behind his professed commitment? If—as Mr. Stebbins says—he understands what these elected officials are doing to the nation, he should do something about it. Mr. Stebbins and his friends have it well within their power to target each and every extremist in Congress, on either side, who would throw the entire world into economic chaos in the name of their own re-election.
When the big business community understands the role they should be playing, and get past their traditional loyalties that certainly are failing to serve them well at this time, only then will they gain the credibility with the American people that will allow these business experts to have a true influence on solving our debt crisis.
Until that time, and for so long as the captains of industry continue to write big checks to those who are not only our enemy but their own, how can Paul Stebbins expect to accomplish anything of value, for both his own business and the public at large?

I've tried a few different HomeKit lighting solutions but nothing quite like Nanoleaf's Aurora smart lighting panels. These modular tiles probably won't replace traditional lamps or ceiling bulbs, but the customizable LED lights provide visually impressive colorful (and pricey) accent lighting. See it in action below:
Nanoleaf's Aurora smart lighting system retails for $199 for a starter kit that includes nine panels, nine linkers, the HomeKit-compatible controller, 28 3M mounting strips, and the power supply. That's comparable in price to the Philips Hue smart lighting system which includes three color-changing A19 LED bulbs and a HomeKit-compatible bridge, but the novelty of Aurora is unmatched by any other HomeKit lighting solution on the market.
Aurora is modular so you can create a variety of designs from the same nine tiles, or add additional tiles to create more complex layouts. Each lighting panel can connect to up to three more lighting panels with one linker connecting two tiles. Aurora intelligently detects what layout you've created, then maps it on Nanoleaf's companion app where you can set color flows, brightness, speed, and more.
Additional tiles are sold in sets of three for $59.99 which is about the cost of one additional Philips Hue color bulb.
Check out our hands-on video with Nanoleaf Aurora below:
Subscribe to 9to5Mac for more videos
HomeKit support means you can also set colors and brightness with Siri, Apple's new Home app, or through automation based on time or commands that control other accessories.
For example, you could have a scene called Movie Night that turns off the ceiling light and sets the Aurora lights to deep blue at 10% brightness; just tell Siri to ‘set Movie Night scene' and your connected accessories automatically jump to the right mode.
Apple's Home app doesn't support multicolor waves from the built-in color picker — only solid colors — so you'll want to spend more time in Nanoleaf's app at first to discover different color effects. HomeKit makes changing the brightness, toggling the lights on and off, and setting solid colors very convenient.
You can also turn color effects you discover or create in Nanoleaf's app into scenes in Apple's Home app. This is where HomeKit support's potential is really unlocked. You can use Siri to change between dramatically different color effects, or pick a few favorites to access from Control Center.
You can also automate specific color effects using Apple's Home app. For instance, you can have Aurora display a vibrant sunrise color effect at 7 am each morning or even based on the actual sunrise time where you live.
Simply using Siri to turn Aurora on, change the color effect and brightness, and turn Aurora off makes HomeKit support super valuable.
Setting up Aurora can be a bit intimidating, but Nanoleaf provides the necessary supplies including paper templates that let you mock up a design on your wall before sticking tiles. Nanoleaf also has a series of very helpful video tutorials that I found useful before installation.
Nanoleaf's packaging is pretty minimal and easy to break down and recycle (the box even asks you to) which I appreciated. The power supply includes plenty of cable length for wiring the controller to where you need it, and each tile is pretty light and can stand a few accidental drops (trust me).
Nanoleaf recommends connecting each panel right out of the box before you starting hanging anything to make sure there are no defects. The first panel connects to the controller, then each additional panel connects with a small tab called a linker that inserts into both panels to pass power and data.
3M mounting strips hold each panel in place on the wall. Nanoleaf recommends exposing the non-adhesive tab on each mounting strip so panels can be easily removed in the future, and you can strategically place them so that the connecting tile covers the exposed tab. The process is super easy once you get the hang of it.
Deciding on a design pattern may be the hardest step. Nanoleaf provides several ideas in the setup guide including four patterns that work with the starter kit, four more designs that work when adding the expansion kit, and seven ideas when using 15 and 30 panels. You can make any pattern with your panels, though, and the Nanoleaf app recognizes it and reflects it on your smartphone or tablet. I was tempted to go with the fish layout, but ultimately decided on a more linear layout to cover a few scratches on the wall from guitars.
A few things to keep in mind: each panel is lit by three LEDs which are more noticeable at high brightness levels, the controller is wired and may not sit flush like each tile so try to place it out of sight, and consider how the plasticky white panels will appear when not lit before deciding on placement.
Aurora is visually impressive and well integrated with Apple devices and Siri thanks to HomeKit, and Nanoleaf makes the lighting system both easy and fun to set up with the modular design. The starter kit is pricey for mood lighting at $200, but overall the product is very well done. I can definitely imagine purchasing additional starter kits to create different designs in other rooms in the future.
My office has a ceiling bulb connected to a HomeKit wall switch, a HomeKit bulb in a desk lamp, two studio lights connected to a HomeKit switch, and now Aurora which is overall my favorite for just general background lighting.
Nanoleaf Aurora is like a beautiful screensaver for your wall. Pair that with some music you enjoy and you can create a very ambient lounge experience.
Nanoleaf Aurora starter kit is available for $199.99, Aurora expansion kit retails for $59.99, and Best Buy is currently bundling Aurora starter kit and expansion kit together for $199.98. Nanoleaf also makes other interesting HomeKit lighting solutions like the Ivy (reviewed) which you can find on Amazon.
Robot arms are getting cheaper than ever, making it possible for you to get your own personal assembly line / disembodied droid buddy to have around. But maybe you're not ready to spend $500 for a robotic arm wrestling partner. Or maybe you prefer building things yourself. Or perhaps (in what's probably the most likely scenario) you're a kid who doesn't have $500 to drop on a robotic arm but still are interested in learning to code.
Enter the MeArm Pi, a Kickstarter project that claims to offer just that. It's a miniature robotic arm designed to be simple enough for a child to put together, and it's controlled by both a pair of attached joysticks and more advanced coding through a Raspberry Pi. The company has also put together a simplified, block coding web application that makes it easy to start programming the arm through an internet-connected computer without necessarily needing to know how to code first.
The MeArm Pi is available to back on Kickstarter now for £40 (approximately $74.53) which gets you just the arm, should you already have a Raspberry Pi, while £110 (roughly $136.63) will get you a full kit, including a Raspberry Pi 3. While the MeArm Pi is technically from new company, the team has previously run successful Kickstarters for other robot arms in the past, which should help reassure nervous backers. The MeArm Pi is expected to ship later this year in July.
The original team (Dominik Haslinger, Jens Doblies and Sebastien Ronsse) did the majority of the work.
It was originally intended to be a much longer game, but I finished up the ice cavern sequence so that it could be released as I thought it would be a shame if no one got to play it.
Their sourcecode was playable up to the point where you complete the mechanism in the cavern. Here are the changes and fixes that I made to that source code:
-Replaced LucasArts logo with a ScummGen logo.
-Made a few grammar corrections to the original script.
-Created icons for inventory items that lacked them (all instances of the stones and the gas can).
-Programmed an if/then statement regarding the gas can that was referenced but not implemented in the source.
-Fixed the mechanism puzzle to require both objects, as before it was possible to complete it with only one object.
-Added dialog to facilitate the change in the mechanism puzzle.
-Fixed the lighting so that the cavern stays lit when you move to the cavern entrance and back.
-Enabled the usage of the item used to exit the cavern, as referenced but not implemented in the source.
-Changed the description of the macguffin as it was originally used as a joke related to the game being unfinished (but kept it humourous to suit the tone of the original).
-Added dialog necessary for the ending sequence.
-Added an ending screen.
Speaking behind closed doors this week at a Bangor cocktail reception hosted by a conservative foundation, U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin said he deliberately avoids talking to the media because he doesn't want to provide “them and everyone else the ammunition they need and we lose this seat.”
A secret recording obtained by the Maine People's Alliance, which published its contents and released part of the tape, captured the two-term 2nd District Republican with his guard down, something that rarely happens in public.
In sections of the recording released by the left-wing group, Poliquin also called it “shameful” that the U.S. Senate's refused to move ahead with GOP plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Maine's Republican senator, Susan Collins, was one of three senators who squelched the bill.
Poliquin's chief consultant, Brent Littlefield, declined to respond to the revelation.
“I don't comment on dark money, special interest group-funded hyperbole,” Littlefield said Friday.
At the Tarratine Club in Bangor on Tuesday, Poliquin told Maine Heritage Policy Center supporters in detail about why he rarely engages with the press.
Poliquin said that “it would be stupid for me to engage the national media” so he simply tries not to do it.
“As soon as you go down that path, you are in the swamp,” Poliquin said. “You are exactly where they want you to be. Do not take the bait. I drove the press crazy for nine months because I stayed on message focusing on what I was going to do to help my state and my district and it worked.”
The congressman, who is seeking re-election, said that “anywhere you go in D.C., when you're coming out of my office building or coming out of a tunnel or going across the street trying to not get mowed down,” reporters are there “dying to get you on record to say whatever.”
“We have to be really careful,” Poliquin said.
He told the crowd that the GOP needs his seat in the 435-member House because there are only “two dozen swing districts in the country,” including his.
They “can go either way” in elections, Poliquin said. “We win ‘em, we're in the majority, we can advance agenda.”
But lose them, he said, and Democrats such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont will “run the show” instead.
“That's just the reality of the numbers, OK? So we've got to be incredibly careful,” Poliquin said.
There are five Democrats already vying for the chance to take on Poliquin in next year's election, including state Rep. Jared Golden of Lewiston.
The Inside Bitcoins conference in Tel Aviv has been postponed due to logistical problems resulting from the ongoing military action in the Gaza Strip between the Israeli military and Hamas.
The postponement stems from the cancelation of international flights to Israel in response to rocket attacks launched against Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. Due to the international profile of many of the conference's speakers and attendees, the conference is being moved forward to an as-yet-undisclosed date.
CoinDesk spoke with Alan Meckler, chairman and CEO of Mediabistro Inc, which operates Inside Bitcoins. He said that the military crisis – and concerns that the conference would not function without its global guest list – prompted the delay.
Additionally, Meckler noted the fact that several conference participants are currently on active duty with the Israeli Defense Force during the operation in the Gaza Strip.
Meckler explained:
“We had planned to go ahead with the show while missing some of our partners due to military service. But once the airlines canceled all flights we were faced with losing speakers and paid attendees and exhibitors. We had over 15 exhibitors and sponsors and would have had over 200 paid attendees but for the conflict in Gaza.”
Flights to Tel Aviv called off
Ben Gurion International Airport was forced to close to incoming flights after a rocket struck nearby. The rocket was fired from the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces bombed scores of Hamas targets and left hundreds of people dead or wounded.
Several major US carriers issued temporary flight suspensions, and according to press reports at least one American aircraft had to redirect to another nation after approaching the airport.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a 24-hour ban on flights to Tel Aviv, set to expire at 12.15 pm EST on 23rd July.
In a notice to air carriers in the US, the FFA said that the “hazardous” situation in Tel Aviv had prompted the temporary ban. The agency is expected to update airlines in the next 24 hours on what may lie ahead.
However, the FAA made no indication whether or not it would lift or extend the flight ban after the initial period expires.
Setting the date
According to Meckler, a new date for the Tel Aviv conference has yet to be chosen. However, given the volatile situation in Israel and the Gaza Strip – and throughout the entire region – it remains unclear when the bitcoin gathering will take place.
He went on to suggest that the conference situation is unfortunate, given the diverse set of speakers and the exhibitors set to take the stage in Tel Aviv. Meckler predicted that the conference, whenever it does take place, will still be a success.
CoinDesk will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as the story develops.

His dog made him do it.
A former Morgan Stanley investment manager accused of secretly videotaping romps with three women claimed the camera was only intended to monitor his pooch.
“I have this camera set up in my apartment to watch my dog when I'm not there,” John C. Kelly told investigators on Feb. 26, according to court papers made public Thursday. “It's on and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex because it's always recording.”
Kelly, the son of noted defense lawyer John Q. Kelly, was arraigned in Manhattan Supreme Court Thursday and pleaded not guilty to 19 counts of unlawful surveillance and attempted unlawful surveillance.
Kelly's lawyer Ben Brafman implied that the victim only lodged the complaint against his client after he'd had her arrested for trashing his apartment.
The handsome financier has been under investigation for nearly year for making the creepy recordings between May of 2011 and December of 2012.
He was arrested Nov. 8 and released on his own recognizance.
Daniel Parker, the defense lawyer for one of the victim's, said Kelly posted the illicit videos on Internet sites.
“He used an elaborate system of surveillance using multiple devices in both his bedroom and their homes,” said Parker. “He left a trail and it was on YouTube and Vimeo.”
Kelly used a hidden camera, a web cam and a stealth phone app to film the women engaged in various sexual acts. He even installed a hidden camera in the bookshelf of his East 69th Street apartment, Park said.
The victims delivered the video footage to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office prompting the investigation.
Kelly's father represented the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson and the mother of Natalee Holloway, the Alabama teen who disappeared in Aruba in 2005.
A form of reasoning that consists of an incredibly lazy premise, a supremely ignorant premise, and a conclusion designed to comfort the comfortable.
One would think that after his declaration about a white man displaying obnoxious, attention-seeking behavior, he would shut up.
You cannot and do not win anything when your numbers look like Trump's. I can't say it any more clearly than that. There's nothing you can say or do — not that Trump would ever even consider going on an image rehabilitation tour — to change how people feel about you. Republicans know Trump. And they really, really don't like him. Trump, of course, knows this. His goal is attention, not winning. And in truth, even that would be fine if Trump had an issue (or issues) that he cared about and wanted to draw attention to via his presidential bid. He doesn't. He just says stuff. Lots and lots of stuff. And it's not clear that he's spent more than the five seconds before he speaks thinking about what he's going to say. Trump has every right to run. This is a democracy after all. But what he should not get is covered as though this is an even-close-to-serious attempt to either win the Republican nomination or influence the conversation in GOP circles in any significant way. It's not.
But then one remembers this is Chris Cillizza.
The main problem of classic monolith applications is that over time they become too complex and difficult to support. Implementing and releasing new functionality can take too much time, because all parts of an application should be tested and integrated; adding or updating some feature may lead to exceptions in other parts of the system.
Microservices and cloud-native approach can solve these issues. Having an architecture based on microservices means that a system consists of multiple separately deployed units (microservices) built in accordance with their business functions. This approach is not only an architectural design, but is also an approach for development leading to maximum build and test automation.
The benefits of microservices:
The system consists of multiple microservices, which can be updated and deployed separately. It is also easier to make changes in these applications—they can be tested and deployed faster than the whole monolith app. Flexible scalability of the system, which is divided into multiple apps that are deployed separately. Each of the microservices can be scaled independently from other services. The microservices approach introduces maximum automation of the testing and building processes.
However, re-platforming is not that simple. There is a set of challenges that should be solved during the process:
finding the right way to split the system into microservices
providing communication between microservices
updating microservices
addressing failover of the system
implementing load balancing
enabling authorization
ensuring security
The main goal of this video is to share our experience in the re-platforming process. During this webinar, we will explain its main concepts: how to start the process correctly and prevent major mistakes.
Tesla's offer: How SA's power network could benefit from energy storage
Updated
South Australia's energy network has been struggling of late — there were forced blackouts for tens of thousands of homes during a heatwave last month because there wasn't enough power to meet demand.
But Tesla thinks it has a solution.
The company's billionaire boss Elon Musk says he could install a battery farm capable of fixing the system within 100 days of signing a contract.
It's a suggestion that the Grattan Institute's energy expert Tony Wood says should be taken seriously, but it's not the only electricity storage option that's available.
What's the advantage of electricity storage?
The idea is that energy storage technologies can take power during off-peak hours and put it back into the grid when it's needed.
As well, wind and solar are intermittent sources of electricity generation, so this power needs to be stored if the grid is to rely entirely on renewables. (Keep in mind that South Australia already gets about 50 per cent of its energy from renewables, mostly wind and solar.)
One storage technology that's getting a lot of press is Tesla's Powerpack.
Tesla says this battery is "infinitely scalable" — that means a business could buy a single Powerpack so that it still has power during a blackout, while a city, state or country could install hundreds, thousands or even millions of them in order to support an entire grid.
In 2015, Musk said you'd be able to transition the United States to renewable energy with 160 million of them, and the entire world with 900 million.
Don't presume he was just speaking theoretically, either; this is the same man who last month was spruiking his plan to send tourists around the Moon in 2018.
Where has battery storage already been done?
Tesla has already built what it describes as "the largest lithium-ion battery storage project in the world" in Southern California.
It says the battery farm consisting of 396 Powerpack 2s can power more than 2,500 households for a day.
Why haven't we done this in Australia already?
It's always been too expensive to be practical.
For it to make sense as an investment, the savings would have to be greater than the costs of installing and running the batteries in the first place.
The reason interest in these batteries is growing is because they're getting cheaper every year.
But whether or not they make economic sense yet is still up for debate. Roger Dargaville, from the Melbourne Energy Institute, suggested in The Conversation that they don't.
Currently, large-scale batteries are much more expensive than "off-river pumped hydro energy storage".
Wait, what is "off-river pumped hydro energy storage"?
PHES as it's known simply involves pushing water uphill.
"When there is excess electricity, water is pumped through a pipe or tunnel, to the upper reservoir," ANU sustainable energy expert Andrew Blakers wrote in The Conversation.
"The energy is later recovered by letting the water flow back down again, through a turbine that converts it back into electricity. Efficiencies of 90 per cent in each direction are possible."
So when you've got power to spare, send water uphill; when you need power, send it back down. Quite ingenious, really.
Currently, this technology represents 97 per cent of electricity storage around the world. Professor Blakers says used in combination with wind and solar, PHES is cost-competitive with fossil fuel power stations.
Last month, EnergyAustralia chief executive Catherine Tanna said a desert site in South Australia would be perfect for a proposed pumped hydro venture.
The company is backed by federal funding and if its project goes ahead, the target date for operations is 2020.
"If a pumped hydro project of this scale had been available recently in South Australia, there wouldn't have needed to be the load shedding that occurred there," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.

August is not typically a busy time of the year for the GPU industry. But this is quickly turning out to be anything but a normal August. Between professional and consumer graphics cards we have a busy week ahead.
Kicking things off on the consumer side today, AMD is announcing that they will be releasing a new Radeon HD 7950 with higher clockspeeds. The new 7950, to be called the Radeon HD 7950, is a revised version of the existing 7950 that is receiving the same performance enhancements that the 7970 received back in June, which were the basis of the Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition.
AMD GPU Specification Comparison AMD Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition AMD Radeon HD 7970 AMD Radeon HD 7950 (w/Boost) AMD Radeon HD 7950 Stream Processors 2048 2048 1792 1792 Texture Units 128 128 112 112 ROPs 32 32 32 32 Core Clock 1000MHz 925MHz 850MHz 800MHz Boost Clock 1050MHz N/A 925MHz N/A Memory Clock 6GHz GDDR5 5.5GHz GDDR5 5GHz GDDR5 5GHz GDDR5 Memory Bus Width 384-bit 384-bit 384-bit 384-bit VRAM 3GB 3GB 3GB 3GB FP64 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 Transistor Count 4.31B 4.31B 4.31B 4.31B PowerTune Limit 250W+ 250W 225W 200W Manufacturing Process TSMC 28nm TSMC 28nm TSMC 28nm TSMC 28nm Architecture GCN GCN GCN GCN Launch Date 06/22/2012 01/09/2012 08/17/2012 01/31/2012 Launch Price $499 $549 $329 $449
Diving right into things, the new 7950 – which we're going to call the 7950B for lack of a distinct official name – is a performance enhanced part based on the same process that AMD used to create the Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition. Like the 7970GE, AMD is doing two things here for the 7950B: they're increasing the base clockspeed, and they're also introducing their GPU turbo boost functionality to potentially push clockspeeds higher.
With these enhancements the clockspeeds for the 7950B will be 850MHz for the base clock, 925MHz for the boost clock, and the memory clock is kept at 5GHz. As a result the GPU clockspeed difference is anywhere between 50MHz (6%) at its base and 125MHz (16%) at the highest boost clock. Because only the core clock is changing, the performance difference between the 7950 and 7950B will be heavily dependent on whether the game/application at hand is GPU limited; heavily GPU limited tasks (that can stay within the power limits) will benefit the most, while memory bandwidth limited or CPU limited tasks may not benefit at all.
So how is AMD pulling this off? We've already covered AMD's PowerTune Technology With Boost (PT Boost) in depth with the 7970GE review, but in case you missed it, here's a quick refresher. At its most basic level, PT is a combination of BIOS and Catalyst driver changes that allow AMD to overdrive the GPU when conditions permit. In practice PT Boost is very similar to NVIDIA's GPU Boost. Both technologies are based around the concept of a base clock (or engine clock in AMD's terminology) with a set voltage, and then one or more boost bins with an associated voltage that the GPU can move to as power/thermal conditions permit. In essence PT Boost allows suitably equipped cards to overvolt and overclock themselves to a limited degree.
Under the hood, the current incarnation of PT Boost is primarily designed to take advantage of AMD's previously conservative specifications for the Radeon HD 7950. In implementing their PowerTune technology, AMD opted to base their power consumption calculations around the worst case scenario for leakage, thereby ensuring no card ever exceeded its designated PowerTune limit at an opportunity cost of having not maximized performance. PT Boost effectively inverses this methodology, implementing a Digital Temperate Estimation (DTE) algorithm to determine the real leakage at any given time. By accurately estimating a GPU's leakage AMD can push the GPU closer to its limits, thereby maximizing its performance. The tradeoff of course is that real power consumption will increase, as AMD's cards are now eating into what was previously a large power buffer.
Moving on, since PT Boost was designed against AMD's existing hardware, AMD and their partners have been taking advantage of this design choice by deploying it on existing 7900 series hardware. Just as how the 7970GE was built on existing 7970 board designs, the 7950B specs are intended to be deployed as an upgrade for existing 7950 designs. As with the 7970GE, the real change here is that AMD is qualifying their GPUs to operate at higher voltage/clockspeed combinations. For our converted reference card the new base voltage is 1.125v for 850MHz, up from 1.093v for 800MHz on the original 7950. Meanwhile the boost voltage goes much higher, with AMD using a rather high 1.25v for the 925MHz boost clock. In fact this ends up being the highest voltage a reference Tahiti card operates at, as even the reference 7970GE only used 1.218v.
Radeon HD 7950 Series Voltages Ref 7970B Base Voltage Ref 7950B Boost Voltage Ref 7950 Base Voltage 1.125v 1.25v 1.093v
These numbers paint an interesting picture, albeit not one that is particularly rosy. For the 7970 AMD was already working with top bin Tahiti GPUs, so to make a 7970GE they just needed to apply a bit more voltage and call it a day. The 7950 on the other hand is largely composed of salvaged GPUs that failed to meet 7970 specifications. GPUs that failed due to damaged units aren't such a big problem here, but GPUs that failed to meet clockspeed targets are another matter. As a result of the fact that AMD is working with salvaged GPUs, AMD has to apply a lot more voltage to a 7950 to guarantee that those poorly clocking GPUs will correctly hit the 925MHz boost clock.
With that in mind however, all of this appears to be a calculated risk on AMD's part. The reality of AMD's situation is that Tahiti can't compete with GK104's power efficiency. Tahiti is a clearly superior GPU for compute purposes, but when it comes to gaming AMD and NVIDIA's best products are virtually tied in performance, a matchup that leaves NVIDIA holding the smaller, lower power GPU. So what is AMD to do in such a situation? If the 7970GE didn't make it obvious, the 7950B does: forgo all pretense of power efficiency and focus on performance-per-dollar.
With both the 7970GE and 7950B AMD has notably increased their power consumption. We'll take a look at the numbers in-depth in a bit, but the important change is that based on our data the 7950B is now drawing more power than the GTX 680. This isn't necessarily a bad tradeoff – after all everyone likes more performance – but like all tradeoffs it does come with consequences. For the 7950B in particular, this means that the TDP has gone up from 200W for the 7950 to 225W for the 7950B.
A San Jose homeowner who was awakened in the middle of the night Friday by loud banging fired a shotgun through his glass door at what he believed were two armed intruders in his backyard, seriously injuring a 24-year-old man.
The homeowner, who was not identified, then ran out of his house in the 1700 block of Patio Drive without a shirt on, prompting an alarmed neighbor to call police at 4:18 a.m., San Jose police Sgt. Ronnie Lopez said.
When police arrived, the man who had fired the shotgun told them he had seen one of the intruders with what looked like a silver handgun.
Officers searched the gated yard and found the shattered French doors, the shooting victim and a cell phone, but no handgun. No traces of a second intruder were found.
The presumed intruder, who was not identified, was in serious condition Friday afternoon with a gunshot wound to his stomach area. A preliminary investigation also revealed he appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, Lopez said.
The homeowner was questioned by detectives and released Friday afternoon, pending further investigation. Police and prosecutors will weigh the “totality of the circumstances” in deciding whether he will face criminal charges, Lopez said.
Under California law, homeowners or renters who react violently to a perceived intruder are essentially given the benefit of the doubt.
The law presumes they acted out of a reasonable fear of imminent death or great bodily injury. They cannot be charged with a crime unless prosecutors can prove otherwise.
One factor that is likely to weigh heavily in whether the homeowner will have to face charges is that it was the second time officers had been called to the block Friday with a report of a disturbance — possibly by the same intruder.
“We believe they are one and the same, but we have not yet completely confirmed that,” Lopez said.
In the other incident, officers responded about 3 a.m. to a report from a homeowner that an inebriated man had tried to fit a key into the front door to gain entry. The homeowner yelled at the man, “Wrong house,” and the man left.
There is no evidence that the homeowner who shot the man knew about the first incident.
While San Jose is enjoying a decrease in serious crimes overall, it's been a rough couple of days in the city.
On Wednesday night, a 20-year-old man was stabbed multiple times by two attackers at McLaughlin and Fair avenues in front of Bridges Academy, formerly Fair Middle School. The attackers fled and are still at large.
Tuesday night, San Jose police arrested two men after a violent robbery at a Locust Street home where officers said two residents have been growing marijuana; police have not said whether it was an illegal grow house. And shortly after that incident, police shot in the leg a man they thought might be one of the burglary suspects. The man, Anthony Silva, 30, turned out not to be connected to the burglary, police said Thursday, but he did have a no-bail warrant for his arrest stemming from drug possession charges.
Alan Pardew exceeded all expectations last season but the bar has been raised and recruits such as Mathieu Debuchy would be a big help
Guardian writers' predicted position: 7th (NB: this is not necessarily Louise Taylor's prediction but the average of our writers' tips)
Last season's position: 5th
Odds to win the league: 175-1
Newcastle United fans are asking plenty of questions at present. Should Alan Pardew stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used late last season or switch to a 4-3-1-2 diamond that would allow Demba Ba to play more centrally? Would signing Andy Carroll represent a regressive step or may he turn into the new Zlatan Ibrahimovic? Why does owner Mike Ashley not compromise and meet Lille's fee for the France right-back Mathieu Debuchy? Will Europa League involvement prove a blessing or a curse?
They are all intriguing queries; not to mention very different from the questions the same supporters were pondering this time last year. Back then people wondered if they were about to watch the unfolding of a relegation battle and looked extremely doubtful if it was suggested that signings such as Ba, Yohan Cabaye and Davide Santon would prove a success.
No one dreamed that the team would finish fifth in the Premier League or that Pardew would morph into "Pardiola", let alone envisaged Ba rattling in 16 goals in record time before being joined by a similarly prolific Senegalese compatriot striker in Papiss Cissé during the January transfer window.
A clever tactician and astute man manager – how many other coaches have coaxed smiles out of Hatem Ben Arfa? – Pardew thoroughly deserved his manager of the year award but now the bar has been raised and he must confront a set of fresh challenges.
Providing Newcastle survive their Europa League qualifier they will then fall into the draining Thursday night/Sunday afternoon playing routine demanded by the competition's group stage.
While a return to Europe is eagerly anticipated by fans, Pardew will need to devise a fairly radical squad rotation policy. Either that or several of his best players could be burnt out by Christmas by which time their challenge for a Champions League place may have bitten the dust.
After recovering from a nasty knee injury Sammy Ameobi – Shola's little brother and a skilful creator – has impressed in pre-season and will almost certainly be offered games in Europe and the Premier League. So, too, should the gifted attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic. The 19-year-old Slovenia international could do with putting some appalling bad luck with injuries behind him in what really needs to be a breakthrough season.
So far new signings have been youthful, low key and targeted at a radically overhauled development squad. Even so Gael Bigirimana, recruited from Coventry, has caught the eye in midfield this summer while medium-term hopes are similarly high for both Romain Amalfitano, another midfielder acquired from Reims, and the Australian centre-half Curtis Good.
It would help Pardew's cause if long-mooted moves for Debuchy – who shone for France during Euro 2012 – FC Twente's Brazilian centre half Douglas and the Ajax defensive midfielder or left-back Vurnon Anita are completed by the end of August.
Anita, especially, appears an important target as he promises to be an ideal replacement were Cheik Tioté to be injured or, worse, subject to a last-minute bid from a Chelsea or Manchester United.
Pardew, who remains optimistic he can retain "stars" such as Tioté, Cabaye and Cissé this summer, reports that Tioté is "10 times better" than last summer when the Ivorian was detained in West Africa for a chunk of pre-season while he negotiated the red tape involved in renewing his visa.
Like Ba, Cissé and Ben Arfa, Tioté is a Muslim but, this season, that quartet will not have to cope with problems of daylight fasting during the early weeks of the campaign as Ramadan ends, conveniently, on 18 August.
By then they should be joined in the first-team squad by the centre- half Steven Taylor, Pardew's best defensive header of a ball, and the winger Sylvain Marveaux. While Taylor missed the second half of the last campaign with a ruptured achilles, a groin operation meant Marveaux's career on Tyneside has still to get going.
Ba was widely expected to be swiftly out of the starting blocks en route for lucrative pastures new this summer. Everyone knew that the Senegal striker's contract contained a clause enabling him to depart for £7m before 31 July but despite some interest from Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Rubin Kazan, Ba's long-term, if well managed, knee condition – something Pardew describes as "a deficiency" – evidently deterred suitors.
Newcastle have declined to re-negotiate Ba's partially pay-as-you-play contract until next summer but Pardew has promised that he will occupy a central attacking role "90% of the time" rather than operate in the wide left position in which he ended last season.
Come January, Ba, Cissé and Tioté will almost certainly be bound for the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, which explains why Pardew is so keen on signing Anita and a striker.
While Shola Ameobi – aka the Fenham Eusébio and/or the Mackem Slayer – enjoyed some excellent moments in attack last season and should not be underestimated, he can be injury prone. Moreover his erstwhile co-forwards Leon Best and Peter Lovenkrands have, along with the underrated midfielder Danny Guthrie, left Tyneside this summer.
Such exits explain why Pardew was disappointed to lose out to Borussia Mönchengladbach in the race for FC Twente's promising young striker Luuk de Jong before trying to persuade Liverpool to loan him back the centre-forward he sold them for £35m in January 2011.
Carroll's mooted return looks a non-starter – (although Ashley's ability to hold his nerve in a game of brinkmanship with Liverpool suggests that could yet alter by 1 September) – and there are those who feel that may be no bad thing.
This, after all, is a season that Newcastle are looking forward to with optimism rather than drawing solace from past glories. With the outstanding Tim Krul in goal, the fabulous captain Fabricio Coloccini at centre-half, Tioté enforcing in central midfield and Pardew coaching meticulously the team are in their best shape for ages.
As long as Cissé and Ba are around goals should not be in short supply but, if the days when a crisis constantly loomed around every corner at St James' Park have been consigned to the past, the team's enduring success depends on certain variables.
Foremost among them is the relationship between Ashley and Pardew staying healthy. Then there is the question of whether the manager can not only keep Ben Arfa onside but extract the No10's true creative brilliance on a consistent level. Luck with injuries will also play a part as will the maintenance of an extraordinary spirit among an increasingly French-speaking squad.
There are those in football who, rather unfairly, regard Pardew as rather too full of himself and believe he and Newcastle could be poised to fall flat on their faces. Granted, the road ahead promises to be tricky in places but both manager and club have learned from past mistakes and the suspicion is that their critics may be disappointed.
Bringing the big-gun experience to the rimfire world, the Ruger Precision Rimfire is a scaled down version of the Ruger Precision Rifle® and maintains the same ergonomics, trigger and manual of arms as the larger centerfire rifle. The Ruger Precision Rimfire is the ideal long-range shooting trainer and go-to rifle for your next rimfire match.
The Ruger Precision Rimfire features a molded, one-piece chassis and adjustable buttstock assembly manufactured from glass-filled nylon for strength, stiffness and stability, offering a solid foundation for accuracy each and every shot. The innovative Quick-Fit adjustable Precision Rimfire stock allows the rifle's length of pull and comb height to be quickly and easily adjusted for proper fit over a wide range of shooter sizes, outerwear and shooting positions. Indicating marks molded into the chassis help you quickly return to a previous position.
To make the .22 LR chambering feel more like 6.5 Creedmoor, Ruger engineers designed the Big-Gun adjustable bolt throw technology. By simply removing a spring clip, shooters can change from a rimfire 1-1/2" bolt throw to a short-action centerfire 3" bolt throw, reducing the chance of short-stroking the bolt in competition. Identical to the Ruger Precision Rifle, the oversized bolt handle makes for positive bolt manipulation.
The rifle's 18" target barrel is cold hammer-forged from 4140 alloy steel to create ultra-precise rifling for excellent accuracy. The 1/2"-28 thread pattern allows for easy pairing with the Silent-SR® suppressor or other muzzle devices. The 15" hard black anodized aluminum, free-float handguard features Magpul® M-LOK® slots on all four sides for improved scope clearance and easy mounting of M-LOK-compatible rails and accessories.
The popular Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger has a pull weight range of 2.25 to 5.0 pounds; the adjusting wrench is conveniently stored in a buttstock compartment on the rifle. Ruger's own AR-pattern pistol grip and safety selector allow for maximum control and access to the 45 degree, reversible safety selector.
The Precision Rimfire ships with one, 15-round BX-15® magazine. For increased long-range elevation capabilities, the rifle is topped with a 30 MOA Picatinny scope base.

As the beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, he began his routine before an empty gym. The bright lights beamed down upon him. He shot step-back jumpers, crossing over from side to side. With an intent focus, as the gym filled up, he'd lost track of time before being reminded that tip-off was nigh.
And as Kemba Walker prepared to play his first game since being named an NBA All-Star for the first time, it was quite appropriate that Madison Square Garden—the biggest platform in his hometown—would be his stage.
The long journey to this point—from the Sack-Wern housing projects in the Soundview section of the Bronx, all the way down to the house that Michael Jordan built—Walker was now where he always dreamed he'd be. He was in his hometown, serving as an inspiration to a city which boasts a proud basketball tradition.
Minuscule as he may be, Walker is tiny in stature alone. In more important ways, he's become a giant.
* * * * * *
I've only known Kemba Walker for six years, but I've known of him much longer.
With the explosion of the digital media marketplace, it's easier than ever to hear what a player said after a game or find out how many points he scored in his previous contest. For someone who has been blessed to have a front row seat to the game and access to some of the world's great athletes, the best and most rewarding part of the job is having the opportunity to know NBA players as men. Walker, as a person, is perhaps the finest specimen.
As he completed his warm up at Madison Square Garden, I sat perched on the scorer's table at midcourt, like a player waiting to check into the game. The plan was for Walker and I to connect after the game, but when his pregame workout regimen took longer than expected, our rendezvous occurred.
Since the night of the 2011 draft, Walker's life has changed dramatically. From a starry-eyed neophyte hoping to supplant incumbent starter D.J. Augustin to being the unquestioned franchise player, in many ways, he remains the same humble sociology major who graduated from college in just three years. Walker, now just the seventh Hornets player in franchise history to make an All-Star team, had finally achieved something he'd seemingly been working toward since his days at Rice High School in Manhattan.
“You know me,” Walker said as his eyes opened widely. He shook his head as he sighed.
“I'm just grateful that the coaches put me in.”
And when reminded that he should have made the All-Star team last season, Walker was quick to respond, humbly and politely. With a shrug of the shoulders, he served a quick reminder.
“With me, it's never been about the individual accomplishments. I just work hard and try to be the best player I can be. That's gotten me to this point, so I'm just gonna do me,” he said.
The son of Caribbean immigrants, from the time we met, Walker and I shared a common story. My parents emigrated from Jamaica in the 1970s, while his mother (born in St. Croix) and father came by way of Antigua. Most often, when people from the Caribbean seek greener pastures in the United States, they do so with nothing but summer clothes, aspirations and values that they pass on to their children. In every way, shape and form, Walker has carried not only the Bronx with him on his back. He has also done everything within his power to be a good sibling and son—both to his parents and to the Hornets.
A fiery competitor, Walker may be minuscule in stature and humble in spirit, but that underlies the fire that burns deep down within.
“To be perfectly honest with you, I thought he was just ‘another' small guard,” one member of the Hornets franchise told Basketball Insiders. “But honestly, he's a franchise player. He's the first guy to show up and the last guy to leave and he's not one of those guys that do things and say things because it's the ‘right thing' to do. It's just who Kemba is.”
On the night in question, despite the Hornets controlling the game through the first nine minutes of the fourth quarter, the Knicks got some heroic basketball from Courtney Lee and managed to turn a late deficit into a three-point win. In front of his hometown fans, Walker turned in a 31-point, 10-rebound effort and was clearly the standout performer of the night.
After the game, however, he blew off a question about his finally earning the first All-Star nod of his career.
“I'm not thinking about that right now,” Walker dismissively said to the assembled media when asked about the honor afterward.
Of course, anyone who knows Kemba Walker, what he stands for and what his motivations are knows that the last thing he would want to do is spend time speaking about an individual accomplishment after his team suffered a disappointing loss that doesn't help his team to retain one of the Eastern Conference's playoff seeds.
Walker always had and always will be team first. There may be a “me” in “Kemba,” but his entire existence has been dedicated to inspiring others. Even if he didn't take the opportunity to extol his own virtues in public in his hometown, there's no questioning that he has scratched and clawed his way toward being revered as one of the game's more underrated floor generals.

It's been a while since I've visited Charlotte. In January 2015, when head coach Steve Clifford and I discussed Walker and the four-year, $48 million extension that the team signed him to, Clifford assured me that Walker would become an All-Star and a pillar for the franchise. Now, just two years later, the premonition has proven true. He now joins the likes of Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning and Glen Rice.
Back in 2015, it was all just a dream.
Then, Walker was only a few years removed from being a standout high school player. He revealed that he had been told that he was too small, too nice and too raw to ever become a meaningful point guard at the professional level. It wasn't until he began seeing his name in mock drafts after he performed admirably in the McDonald's All-American game in 2008 that he believed he actually had an opportunity to go pro.
On the night of the 2011 draft—the night we spoke for the first time—Walker said that he was grateful for Michael Jordan taking a chance on him and vowed to work tirelessly to maximize his potential and reward the faith that was shown in him.
In 2015, when I visited him in Charlotte, he told a story of a small kid from the Bronx who listened to his parents, worked hard and never stopped believing in himself. And on this night, about two years later, Walker found himself in one of the buildings that were most influential to his development. This was the very court that saw his UConn Huskies capture the Big East Championship in 2011 behind one of the greatest tournament performances in history.
So yes, it was quite appropriate that Walker found himself in Madison Square Garden, once again. It's funny how circuitous life can be. In a familiar place, Walker had found himself surrounded by familiar faces. Many things remained the same, but one thing was different.
Kemba Walker. New York City kid. NBA point guard.
All-Star.
Before tip-off, as we bid one another adieu, Walker jogged back to the Hornets locker room while I found my seat in the press box. As I have had over the six years of his NBA career, I had a front row seat.
Seeing players fulfill their potential—it's what we hope to witness. And consistent with his past practice, Walker has taken those hopes and has made all that root for him as proud as can be.
His inspiring journey is far from over, but to this point, it has been as successful as it has been overlooked.
In 1990, in New York City, the Big Apple's next great point guard was born. And on January 27, it was quite fitting that he happened to find himself in the very arena that, no doubt, inspired him along the way.
Ireland recorded the second highest increase in house prices in the European Union during the April to June quarter, according to new figures published by the EU's official statistics body, Eurostat.
House prices in Ireland rose 10.6 per cent versus the second quarter a year of 2016, behind the Czech Republic, which recorded a 13.3 per cent increase, but ahead of Lithuania, where property prices jumped 10.3 per cent.
Overall, house prices in the EU rose 4.4 per cent compared to the second quarter a year earlier with an increase of 3.8 per cent for the 19 member states sharing the euro.
Compared with the first quarter of 2017, house prices rose by 1.5 per cent in the euro zone and by 1.8 per cent in the EU as a whole in the April to June period.
The highest prices increase on a quarter-on-quarter basis were recorded in Latvia and Slovakia, where prices increased by 6.1 per cent and 5.6 per cent respectively.

Four members of a polio vaccination team have been found shot dead in south-west Pakistan, four days after being abducted.
Police said that the bodies of a health worker, his driver and two security guards were found in the region of Balochistan.
The team were seized on Friday by Taliban militants, security officials said.
Militants say polio teams are spies or that the vaccine causes infertility.
The shootings are the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani polio teams. The violence has claimed the lives of at least 70 polio workers over the last four years.
Tense situation
Local media report that the polio team went missing in the Zhob district of Balochistan, near the border with Afghanistan.
Their bodies were found early on Tuesday morning.
The relatives of the victims have taken to the streets in the city of Zhob to protest against their deaths, according to local reports.

"The situation is very tense and people are angry at security forces who are unable to trace the culprits," a senior official in the city told Pakistan's Express Tribune.
Another official told Dawn newspaper that the Balochistan authorities had postponed an anti-polio campaign in the Quetta, Zhob, Sherani and Sibi districts because of the security threat.
The BBC's Shahzeb Jillani says the attacks are undermining Pakistan's efforts to bring the spread of polio under control.
The country now has the biggest number of polio cases worldwide and is one of only three countries where the disease is still endemic - the others being Nigeria and Afghanistan.

Whether you've dabbled in home automation or consider yourself a "DIY weekend warrior" when it comes to home technology, some smart home projects may seem like an intimidating task at first. Not to mention the number of devices that can be integrated into a smart home is growing at an accelerated rate. However, choosing the best smart devices for your home and lifestyle may be easier than you think. Not all smart home products are overly complex gadgets. There are several options for adding products that are quick and easy to install and require little to no wiring.
First, consider your needs. Do you want to add smart technology throughout your entire home, or add smart devices one room at a time? Second, choose the types of products that would make your life easier. Think about the activities that take place in different rooms on a daily basis. Which of these would be more enjoyable or easier with the help of smart home products?There is more than one way to build a smart home, but for most homeowners, a good place to start is by choosing a hub (aka "the brain" of the smart home) first. There are many great ones out there like Samsung SmartThings, Wink, Nexia, Lowe's Iris, or LG Smart Security. Or if you already have a security system in your home, companies like ADT, Vivint, or AT&T Digital Life also provide smart home solutions.

Whether you're looking for ideas for quick and easy weekend DIY projects for making your home even smarter or you're just getting started, here are some of the latest Z-Wave products to consider for your next DIY smart home project.
Portable Motion Sensors
Smart Motion Sensors take convenience to the next level. Placed in key locations like laundry rooms, hallways or the garage, portable Z-Wave motion sensors can signal lights to turn on and off based on occupancy, giving you the convenience of hands-free operation and added energy savings. The discreet, versatile sensor can be mounted on the wall or ceiling or simply placed on a shelf, table, or desk–making them perfect for any room with a detection range up to 180 degrees and up to 45 feet away. Once you decide on the best sensor placement in your home, you can choose to power the sensor with the built-in batteries or with USB power.
Plug-in Smart Switches
Imagine walking into your home late at night and turning on the lights, the TV or both without searching in the dark for a switch or remote. After your Z-Wave smart switch is plugged into the outlet, common appliances and lights can be plugged into it and controlled from a smart phone. It doesn't get much easier than that! In addition to letting you control lights, electronics, and small appliances remotely, smart switches can also help reduce energy costs by setting on/off schedules and restricting access to appliances after a set time. Other benefits of Z-Wave include the ability to speak to other Z-Wave products, extend the range of your mesh network and trigger whatever is plugged in to automatically turn on or off when certain things happen. The plug-in GE Z-Wave Plus Dual Outlet Smart Switch provides ultimate flexibility for your home by allowing simultaneous control for two devices to be automated and controlled together at the same time. The perfect solution for 2 lamps or devices on each side of a couch or bed!
Smart Door Sensors
Unlike many other window and door sensors that just stick on the outside of the door, the hinge-pin smart door sensor is the industry's first battery-operated door sensor that discreetly fits onto the door hinge to monitor the door opening and closing. Since the small unobtrusive sensor uses the existing door hinge and pin, you don't have to worry about altering the room's aesthetics, or having wires, door trim or crown molding interfere with the door sensor, making set up and installation a breeze. By simply opening or closing the door, the sensor uses Z-Wave technology to wirelessly trigger scenes throughout your home and send and receive information to your Z-Wave hub, helping you stay safe and in control of your home at all times. Automate your lights to turn on and welcome you when you walk in, automatically adjust your smart thermostat, receive alerts or trigger alarms when doors unexpectedly open.
PLX Kiwi is Scangauge's Big Brother
The Scangauge II (and Scangauge before it) has long been a necessary part of practicing EcoDriving effectively. It's a neat device because it gives you instant feedback, which not only allows you to improve your driving, but also helps you implement various hypermiling tips most effectively. However, Scangauge won't have a total market share for much longer, as PLX Devices has released a new, and intriguing device called the Kiwi.
Like the Scangauge, the PLX Kiwi takes data from your car's OBDII diagnostics port. This means that the device is plug and play, making it accessible to most drivers, but will only work on 1996+ vehicles. All older cars (like mine) are out of luck.Â The Kiwi uses the data is collects to not only show you what fuel economy you're getting, but also to instruct you on how to get a few more MPGs. This is the part that's really interesting, and the reason the device costs a steep $299.
PLX's cute video can say more about how it works than I can, so check it out:
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgNPwB-auu4
The website claims that the average driver can save quite a bit of fuel. In my experience, this is definitely true, though I don't know if the Kiwi is really necessary to do it. Most people can realize these improvements without any instrumentation, though those of you looking for more profound savings will probably need instrumentation.
I can't say yet whether it works or whether I would recommend it, but if you're motivated I think the purchase price could be recouped in gas savings, especially with gas looking to stay up above $4/gallon. You can bet PLX will be receiving an email from ecomodder as we look to test this thing out with both experienced EcoDrivers and complete newbs.

Back in the bad old days when California lawmakers debated the wisdom of liberalizing the state's divorce laws, many conservatives voiced concerns that relaxed laws would encourage a restless man to walk out on unwanted marriages, leaving indigent wives and impoverished children. Like so many questions argued abstractly, experience has proven the fears misplaced.
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, about 50 percent of marriages in the United States end in divorce, and about 80 percent of the divorces are initiated by women. That 50 percent is often quoted and it is probably on the high side, but it is illuminating that 80 percent of the divorces are filed by the wife.
This statistic suggests that more women are unsatisfied with their marriages, at least to the point of ending them, than men. Some marriages end for very objective reasons, such as physical abuse or addictions, and there are certainly many reasons for the dissatisfaction that exists. However, the husband and his actions – or his lack of them – play a significant role in causing and sustaining the dissatisfaction.
Of course, the news of a divorce of a couple in a long-term marriage – 10 years or more – jolts family and friends who are shocked to hear of a marital failure when it concerns a couple who spent more than a decade together. People wonder how the partners could have invested so much time into their relationship, only to abandon it. Danielle Horwich, a licensed clinical social worker in Los Angeles, says while there are no easy answers, there may be some obvious reasons behind the demise of a long and (what appeared to be) happy marriage.
One reason for the collapse of a longtime marriage could be that couples lose connection with each other when the children are grown. Day-to-day lives are no longer about parenting and building a home for their kids. “After 20 or so years, when the children have gone, entered college, or begun families of their own, the couple must look towards each other and ask themselves: without our children what do we have?” says Horwich. “Some couples will see this transition as a vibrant opportunity to embark on new adventures. Others, will look towards one another and see they no longer recognize and understand the partner they married.”
Several years ago, a Pennsylvania college professor whose marriage has been sinking found himself on the way to divorce when his wife asked him if he wanted to divorce. “”I don't care,” he replied. She filed shortly thereafter.
A life-threatening illness or injury sometimes collects the mind in the realization that life is short – too precious to live in a dead, lonely marriage. At 50 men and woman realize that there are now “more yesterdays than tomorrows,” as a freelance writer put it. According to Horwich, individuals may feel the need to take on a new path in mid-life. Many people face the inevitability of death between the ages of 40 and 65.
The so-called “golden years” seem bogus when confronted with the very predictable problems brought by time in anyone's life. Declining health issues, caring for failing parents, and dealing with the death of loved ones — all become more common occurrences in midlife, and require great adaptation and coping skills for couples. When a couple doesn't have the coping skills necessary to make it through a major traumatic event, it could lead to a breakdown between the two of them.
“Rigidity and inflexibility to new roles and new habits is often what leads a marriage to break in the midst of these changes,” explains Horwich. “Conflict is inevitable, yet how the couple manages this conflict will be essential to their success.”
One woman wanted to deal with the conflict in her marriage, but that wasn't necessarily true of her husband. “I came from a place where I would never think of leaving him, I thought we would work things out,” she said. “However, he came from a place where you just leave. There was no talking, no fixing, it was just over.”
While all couples are bound to face major life changes and traumatic events throughout the evolution of their relationship, it doesn't have to mean their love is doomed. Horwich says there are plenty of things couples can do now to ensure their marriage endures the long-haul by staying connected as a couple during child rearing and regular date nights when talking about the kids is off limits. Productive communication skills are important.
And husband can to a better job of keeping the wife happy. Here is how:
Digestive Health Alcohol and Liver Disease: Obesity Worse than Alcohol for Women Next » By UHN Staff • May 29, 2013
When it comes to alcohol and liver disease, the damage women cause to themselves by drinking alcohol is much greater if they are obese than if they are not, new research presented at the International Liver Congress 2013 in the United Kingdom indicates. In a study in women, the combination of high alcohol intake and high body mass index (BMI), each individually a major risk factor for chronic liver disease, interacted synergistically to produce a significant increase in risk.
Researchers at the Institute for Liver and Digestive Health at the University College London performed the largest study to date looking at how body weight, alcohol, and liver disease interact. They looked at the individual and combined effects of BMI and drinking habits on chronic liver disease and liver-related deaths. “It's well known that alcohol and a person's weight are major causes of chronic liver disease, but there has been a need for a large population study to compare these factors' influences on each other,” said Dr. Daniele Prati, MD, a governing board member of the European Association for the Study of the Liver who was not involved in the study but who moderated a press conference.

Obesity, alcohol, and liver disease is a deadly combination
The researchers examined data from more than 100,000 middle-aged and older women, including body mass index and weekly alcohol consumption as well as medical records and death certificates to determine if the women had any complications or death from chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver failure. Obesity and heavy drinking are each known risk factors for liver disease, so it was not surprising that the risk of liver cirrhosis was increased if participants were either obese or heavy drinkers. What was surprising was that between weight gain and drinking heavily, body weight appears to be riskier for liver health than alcohol.
Obesity results in a higher risk than heavy alcohol consumption, concluded the study's lead author Paul Trembling, a clinical research fellow at the Institute for Liver and Digestive Health at University College London. But the combination of the two was “super-additive, more than doubling the risk seen with either of the other risk factors,” according to Dr. William Rosenberg another researcher of the University College London.
Drinking while overweight not as bad for the liver as drinking while obese
Another surprising finding was the difference between being overweight and being obese when combined with alcohol use. In women who were overweight – usually defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29 – and drank, the two risks simply added up. But in those who were obese (BMI of 30 or higher) the risks were synergistic, producing damage to the liver that was far greater than the sum of their additive effects. “If you're obese, the damage you can do to yourself (by drinking heavily) is much greater than if you're just overweight,” said Rosenberg.
Abuse of alcohol and liver disease caused a 10-fold increased risk of death from cirrhosis in English women
Previous studies have also found that obesity and alcohol act together to increase the risk for liver disease, not just in women, but also in men. Europe, where the study was performed, has the heaviest alcohol consumption in the world, and alcohol consumption is the third leading cause of early death and illness, after tobacco and hypertension, commented Dr. Prati. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in abuse of alcohol and liver disease, in some countries like England, where death from cirrhosis among middle-age women increased ten-fold from 1970 to 2000. In the U.S., it is estimated that up to one third of Americans have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease related to obesity, diabetes, and high triglycerides.
How to heal from excess body weight, alcohol, and liver disease with natural medicine
The good news is that serious liver disease due to excess alcohol or weight can almost always be prevented or forestalled, and natural medicine has an excellent track record for helping patients with obesity, decreasing alcohol, and liver disease. Naturopathic and integrative healthcare practitioners know that it's not as simple as telling the patient to lose weight and quit drinking. All three of these conditions are associated with nutritional deficiencies, hormonal and neurotransmitter imbalances, excess inflammation and oxidative stress, and other factors which can be addressed using science-based natural and integrative therapies. Special healing foods, nutrients, and botanical medicines, such as silymarin from milk thistle seed extract, the well-researched Chinese herb schisandra, and the antioxidants n-acetyl-cysteine and alpha lipoic acid can be utilized to help protect and regenerate liver tissue that is unhealthy due to obesity, alcohol, and liver disease.

A woman who has been employed by the McDonald's Corporation for over 10 years says she was arrested last week after she confronted the company president at a meeting and told him she couldn't afford to buy shoes or food for her children.
Nancy Salgado, 26, told The Real News that she felt like she had to speak out during McDonald's USA President Jeff Stratton's speech at the Union League Club of Chicago on Friday for the sake of her children.
“It's really hard for me to feed my two kids and struggle day to day,” she shouted as Stratton was speaking. “Do you think this is fair, that I have to be making $8.25 when I've worked for McDonald's for ten years?”
“I've been there for forty years,” Stratton replied from the podium.
“The thing is that I need a raise. But you're not helping your employees. How is this possible?” Salgado asked.
At that point, someone approached Salgado and informed her that she was going to be arrested.
She later recalled the encounter to The Real News' Jessica Desvarieux.
“The strength was very powerful, like, just remembering the face of my kids, like I say, you know, just simple things like I can't provide a pair of shoes like everybody else does, sometimes every month, or anything like that,” she said. “And he needs to know we are what all the employees at McDonald's are going through. We're struggling day to day to provide our needs in our houses, things for our kids. And it's just–it gets harder and harder with just the poverty wage they have us living in.”
“They just told me, you know, well, you're being under arrest because you just interrupted, you trespassed the property. You're just going to go to jail,” Salgado added. “And what I remember just telling them, ‘well, like, so, because I have to speak out my mind and I had to tell the president the poverty wage I'm living in, that's just against the law?' You know, just be able to speak up your mind and say, you know what, I can't survive with $8.25? It's just — it's ridiculous that I'm going to get arrested. You know.”
Salgado, who is still working at McDonald's, said she had her hours cut following the arrest and feared further retaliation.
“The CEOs make millions and billions a year and why can't they provide enough for their employees?” she wondered.

The dramatic outcome of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections is a game changer. Many had forecast after the exit polls that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would win by a handsome majority. But the awesome scale of its victory, capturing over 75% of the seats, was unexpected. It has been backed by an equally impressive victory in Uttarakhand, and the formation of BJP-led governments in Goa and Manipur. It is a great political moment for the BJP, and the karyakartas of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) who have powered the party to success. But it has to be recognized that in the main, this is a major victory for Narendra Modi and Amit Shah.
The dynamics of the new political balance that has now emerged will have far-reaching implications for the key political events to follow: the elections of the new president and vice-president, elections in other states and, most importantly, the next general election in 2019. Even a week is a long time in politics it is said. But unless something dramatic happens to change the current trajectory of politics, it is now virtually certain that the BJP will return to power in the next national election as well. Modi will indeed be the prime minister for at least 10 years, as he had hoped when he first became prime minister in 2014.

Given this background, it is a good time to speculate about the prospects of economic reforms. Economists often discuss the prospects of reform in the framework of a political business cycle. In a five-year term, a new government spends the first year getting itself organized. In the fourth year, its policy decisions are tempered to favourably position the ruling party for the next election and the fifth year is spent campaigning. So typically a government has just the second and third years to push through tough reforms. The Modi government will soon be completing the third year of its political cycle and it should start getting into election mode after that. However, the virtual certainty of a second term makes the cycle somewhat elastic without altogether eliminating it. Elections will still have to be won in 2019 and the massive popular support for Modi and the BJP will have to be sustained. Hence, notwithstanding the dramatically favourable UP election results despite demonetisation, it is unlikely that the government will want to launch any major painful reform until after the 2019 general election.
Thus, during the next two years the government is likely to focus on reforms which are almost ready to roll out or those which cannot be postponed without risking economic stability. Also, all reforms are not bitter pills. So the government may also initiate those reforms which will be welcomed by the electorate. Other, tougher reforms could be postponed to the second term of the Modi government.
Notwithstanding the dramatically favourable UP election results despite demonetisation, it is unlikely that govt will want to launch any major painful reform until after 2019
To put the reform question in perspective, let me turn briefly to the growth outlook. Much was made of the Central Statistics Office's (CSO's) second advance estimate of 7.1%, which allegedly negated any negative impact of demonetisation. However, this growth rate referred to gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices, which adds tax revenue net of subsidies to the value added at basic prices. As the table shows, value added at basic prices grew at 6.7%, distinctly lower than the 7.8% in 2015-16. Further, disaggregating total value added between production sectors relatively insensitive to demonetisation, such as agriculture, utilities and public services, and sectors expected to be more affected, i.e., industry and other services, which account for 70% of total value added, the official estimates do show a sharp growth dip in the latter from 6.7% in 2015-16 to only 4.5% in 2016-17.
This is despite the fact that the CSO's advance estimates are based on assumptions and proxies that cannot capture the full impact of a shock like demonetisation. Moreover, the statistical picture was distorted because of all the gaming that went on to escape the impact of demonetisation. I would, therefore, reiterate my earlier forecast of 6.1% growth for 2016-17 in this column. This is only slightly lower than the 6.5% growth forecast in the Economic Survey. It is also almost identical to the 6.2% real growth assumed in the government's own budget, adjusting for the CSO's implicit inflation rate of 4.8%.
In 2017-18, growth is likely to go up to over 7%, partly because of a positive base effect arising out of the dip in 2016-17. But that is conditional on two key reforms that are discussed further below. For growth to be sustained at the 7-8% level or more in the long term, we would need reforms along a much wider front. These would range from education (see my earlier column here), labour market and land market reforms to reform of regulatory laws on everything from taxation to water and power supply, buildings, environment, transportation, etc., that are currently enforced by an army of predatory inspectors.
Most of these are state subjects requiring reform at that level. Moreover, the impact of these reforms will become visible only in the medium- to long-term. The central government can at best play an advocacy and supporting role on these during its present term. In this article, I will focus only on the two key reforms that are immediately necessary to nurse the economy back to a 7%-plus growth trajectory.
The first of these is the goods and services tax (GST). The GST council's deliberations are nearing closure. The new tax could be rolled out by July, if not earlier. The design of the multiple-rates GST is by no means ideal. The sharing of jurisdiction between the Union and states for administering the tax is also messy. We now know that the proposed arrangement is designed not to serve any larger national interest but simply to accommodate the self-serving turf interests of tax officials from the Central Board of Excise and Customs.
GST is undoubtedly the most far-reaching reform since 1991 and it will eventually emerge as a global best practice model in countries with a complex tax system such as ours
Nevertheless, it is better to have the GST, however flawed the design, than not have it. The design faults can always be ironed out later. Launching the GST will be the culmination of a long campaign that started over 10 years ago. It will create for the first time a unified Indian common market without multiple state-tax regimes and tax barriers. It will also create a tax credit chain that will eliminate cascading, or tax on tax. The associated information chain will also make indirect-tax evasion more difficult. Undoubtedly the most far-reaching reform since the grand reform programme of 1991, I am confident that it will eventually emerge as a global best practice model for value-added tax systems in countries with a complex multiple tax jurisdiction system and federal polity like ours. For the economy, it will be a strong positive shock.
The second urgent reform is resolution of what the Economic Survey has called the twin balance sheet (TBS) problem.
UP election victory puts Modi govt's reform agenda back on track
What is the TBS problem? The growth boom around the mid-2000s was financed, among other sources, by a dramatic increase in bank credit, which doubled between 2004-05 and 2008-09. But then conditions turned sour. First, there were huge cost and time overruns. Then the global financial crisis hit. Growth was halved, disrupting all the projections underlying investment programmes. Rupee depreciation and interest-rate hikes raised the cost of debt. Squeezed between higher costs, reduced revenue and higher cost of money, companies soon ran into debt-servicing problems.
In 2013, nearly a third of corporate debt was owed by companies with an interest liability to cash flow ratio of less than 1 (IC1 companies). By 2015, that share had risen to around 40%. Corporate debt stress was also reflected in bank balance sheets. Non-performing loans (NPAs) had risen to 12% of GDP by 2015. In its excellent analysis of the problem, the Economic Survey has estimated that stressed assets, i.e., NPAs plus restructured debt plus “ever-greened" debt, amounted to 16.6% of outstanding bank loans. For the pubic sector banks, it amounted to an alarming 20% of bank loans.
The balance sheets were not cleaned up and the problem was allowed to fester. It was hoped that by giving more time and fresh credit to debt-stressed companies, they would return to financial viability and eventually repay their debts.
These hopes have been completely belied. Private asset reconstruction companies have been able to acquire only 5% of outstanding NPAs. Restructuring debt has not helped either.
Narendra Modi's historic chance to reshape the Indian economy
The earnings of IC1 companies had remained stationary at around Rs25,000 crore per quarter till mid-2015, but then shrank to Rs20,000 crore per quarter by the end of 2015, and further to Rs15,000 crore by the third quarter of 2016. Debts of the top 10 stressed corporate groups tripled in the last six years, even as their earnings shrank. They are now registering a loss of over Rs15,000 crore per quarter. Private investment growth slowed to 5% by 2012-13 and has actually turned negative for the first time in 2016-17. Total investment has also declined in absolute terms. A financial sector-led crisis is not impending. It is already happening.
What can be done? Many proposals are on the table. Essentially, a solution strategy would require strict recognition of stressed assets and NPAs along with a combination of some debt restructuring, some equity takeover and resale for hopelessly indebted firms, some debts write off, and some discounted off-loading of stressed assets to a public asset reconstruction corporation. Such a corporation could be financed by the capital market, issue of government securities and use of Reserve Bank of India assets.
These are not easy solutions. Many obstacles lie in the way. However, procrastination will not help. The crisis will only deepen and growth could collapse. It is imperative for the government to bite the bullet and initiate firm reform measures now. For a man who could demonetize 86% of the country's currency overnight, such firm action should not be impossible, especially after his massive mandate in Uttar Pradesh.

A proposal to change the availability of voting centers across the state is splitting voting rights groups between those who favor saving money and those who say closing voting centers will disenfranchise voters who need them most.
This week's state Capitol hearing on Senate Bill 16-112 marks the first legislative action on a half-dozen proposals designed to change Colorado's voting laws in time for this year's election.
Sponsored by Sen. Jack Tate, a Centennial Republican, the bill would change the availability of voting service centers in counties with at least 75,000 voters.
Since Colorado went to an all-mail ballot election system in 2013, voters who want to cast their ballots in person no longer do so in their precincts, but at voting service centers maintained by their county. Current law requires one center for each 30,000 voters during the early voting period that starts 15 days before the general election. Each county, regardless of size, must have at least one voting center.
Under Tate's bill, the law would require fewer centers – one per 75,000 voters for the first seven days of early voting. During the last seven days, the county would maintain one voting center per 30,000 voters. The bill also would nix a requirement that voting centers be open on the first Saturday of the 15-day early voting period.
The measure has divided voting rights groups that traditionally have agreed on voting legislation.
The League of Women Voters supports the bill because of its potential cost savings. In opposition are Colorado Common Cause and COLOR, the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights.
In December, Hayle Johnson, clerk and recorder for Jackson County, told The Independent that not a single person came to the voting center in her county to vote in November. The cost to her county to update and maintain the machines that nobody used was $21,000.
But Johnson noted that even if one voter needed the electronic voting machine the expense would be worth it.
The League of Women Voters — which usually advocates for improved voting access — disagrees. League representative Carol Tone told The Independent that the small turnout in voting centers during the first week renders the current law wasteful.
“There isn't much use, it's an expense and they have to hire people to be there,” she said. “We just don't feel it's a necessity for that first week.”
Colorado Common Cause is opposed to the bill, both because of its timing and because of its intent to cut back on early voting in some communities. Executive Director Elena Nunez pointed out that when election reform was passed in 2013, the coalition that worked on the bill agreed to re-evaluate the number of voting systems after the 2016 presidential election. It's too soon to tinker with the law now, she said.
Nunez also noted that making voting centers less available will disenfranchise voters who tend to use them most — younger voters who wait until the last minute.
“It's important we give voters options to cast their ballots, and the bill would significantly reduce those options in the first week,” Nunez said. What that means is that people would either have to wait a week or drive longer distances to a voting center that is open during the first week.
“For a voter who needs assistance or wants to vote on an accessible voting machine, if there isn't a voting center in your community, your option is to either wait or chose not to vote. It's not an acceptable trade-off.”
COLOR's Cristina Aguilar is also opposed to SB 112. “We should be eliminating obstacles to voting, not creating more,” she said in a statement. “We should do more to ensure that people are able to vote, not roll back important gains in voting opportunities.”
Sen. Matt Jones, a Louisville Democrat, reminded the committee about the 2013 agreement to revisit the voting center issue after the 2016 election. He also pointed out that voting centers do more than just provide voting machines; they also allow people to register to vote, update voting information, or obtain a replacement ballot.
Tate, the bill's GOP sponsor, attempted a similar bill last year that had all of the language of SB 112, plus provisions to cut the number of voting centers on Election Day by half. That bill never made it out of its first committee hearing.
This year's version was approved Monday on a party-line 3-2 vote by the Republican-majority Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee.
Tate's bill is the first of at least eight bills that would change election or campaign finance laws in time for the 2016 election.
The proposals include plans to require a state-issued photo identification to vote, to let voters opt-out on automatic mail ballots, and to require the Secretary of State to buy 24-hour accessible ballot drop boxes and surveillance cameras for each county.
Six of the eight measures are sponsored solely by Republicans and are triggering early criticism from voting rights groups – which may prove problematic when those bills reach the Democrat-controlled House.

It's been exactly two years since hundreds of Bramptonians packed the Rose Theatre for a special council meeting on the fate of the Hurontario-Main LRT.
What should have been a slam dunk decision for Brampton became what will likely go down as one of the most contentious decisions to ever come out of Brampton City Council.
But it should have been easy — after all, the province had committed $1.2 billion to the route, which would have run from Port Credit all the way into downtown Brampton.
There are hundreds of cities around the world that have successfully implemented and seen the benefits of LRT, so why was Brampton an exception? The answer still isn't clear. The councillors against the route still have yet to provide factual, proven data to support their controversial decision.
The issue inspired record civic engagement in Brampton. So much so that council chambers overflowed when key decisions were made on the project. Lots of young people engaged in the debate online and at council meetings, and when it came down to the final decision over 60 people delegated to council, which remains a standing record.
It sparked conversation and ignited people on both sides of the debate. When it came down to the final meeting to decide the fate of the route, almost all the delegates were in resounding favour of the decision to build the route into downtown Brampton. When one delegated asked, “if you're in favour of the LRT, please stand,” and the overwhelming majority of the room stood.
But democracy didn't play out that night as it should have. Most of the councillors made their position on the issue very clear, anyone paying attention knew going into the evening that the real decision was in the hands of councillor Michael Palleschi.
Councillors Elaine Moore, Grant Gibson, John Sprovieri, Doug Whillans and Jeff Bowman had already come out and said they were against the decision.
On the flip side, mayor Linda Jeffrey, councillors Gurpreet Dhillon, Pat Fortini, Gael Miles and Martin Medeiros had voiced their support time and time again.
Three months earlier in July 2015 when the decision was originally supposed to be made, Palleschi called for a mediator to come in to help councillors sort through their issues and come to a consensus. It was largely unsuccessful, though the mediator did encourage council to vote for the proposed route.
When it came down to it, the majority of council voted “no” to building the route, forfeiting the $400 million, and having the Hurontario LRT stop at Steeles Avenue.
The very small group of people present that were against the LRT outwardly appeared smug. But why? Brampton had been set back decades. One of Canada's fastest-growing cities was robbed of an essential service that would have made the lives of many people, especially those who rely on transit, easier. It would have brought Brampton into the 21st century, made it a more attractive place for businesses to invest and for developers to build.
$400 million of funding from the provincial or federal government doesn't come along every day, or even every decade, so it's no surprise cities like Hamilton and Toronto got their game plans together to try for what Brampton had so easily given up.
To put it metaphorically, Brampton became the kid at the party who threw a tantrum and dropped his cupcake because it didn't have as many sprinkles as the other kids.
Since that time Brampton has seen little movement on its transit file, not even from the councillors who voted “no”, but vowed to make transit better in the city anyway.
Last year councillors voted to spend $4.4 million to study alternative light rail routes — a hefty expense, particularly because alternatives have already been studied and ruled out in the past.
While some councillors have been hoping Bramptonians would forget the issue, it remains fresh in the minds of many people and still, two years later, is a regular topic of conversation on Brampton Facebook groups, subreddits and Twitter threads.
Brampton is less than a year out from an election and there's no doubt this decision will affect how Bramptonians vote. With more news outlets than ever before in the city, and even more places on the internet to discuss Brampton issues, residents are going into this election more informed than ever before.
So if you're ever on the 502 Zum coming down Hurontario, think about how ridiculous it would be if you had to get off of the bus at the Gateway Terminal, then wait for and get on another bus to take you the rest of the 2km into downtown Brampton. That will be the reality in 2021 when the Hurontario LRT is built.

Alemdar Mustafa Pasha (also called Bayraktar Mustafa Pasha; died 15 November 1808) was an Ottoman military commander and a Grand Vizier born in Khotyn in then Ottoman territory Ukraine in 1765. He was of Albanian origin,[1] from the village of Goskovë near Korçë.[2] Both alemdar and bayraktar mean "the standard bearer" and were the names given to the same rank in the Janissary corps. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha is often regarded as one of the pioneering public figures, who recognized the need of a modern army, as he was instrumental in setting up the French military mission in 1796.
Early career [ edit ]
He was originally the ayan (provincial notable) of Rusçuk, and one of the strongest ayans of his time. The deposition of the reformer Sultan Selim III in 1807, and his replacement with the reactionary Mustafa IV by the Janissaries and other opponents of reform, provoked Alemdar Mustafa Pasha to lead his army of Albanians and Bosnians to Constantinople in an attempt to reinstate Selim III and restore his reforms. After he arrived, Mustafa IV ordered Selim III and Mahmud II killed, succeeding in the former case. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, seeing Selim III dead, gave fealty to Mahmud II (Selim's cousin), and he was instated the sultan, with Alemdar as his Grand Vizier.
As vizier, Bayraktar purged the soldiers who had rebelled against Selim, removed conservatives from government positions and replaced them with men sympathetic to reform. Bayraktar modernized the army and navy and attempted to reform the Janissaries, but Mahmud, fearing a political backlash of the elite corps, halted such change. Bayraktar's power and influence and his arrogance wielding it caused a rebellion against his position. In November 1808, the Janissairies attacked the Porte and laid siege to the stone powder magazine where he and his personal guard had taken refuge. As the Janissaries were about to break in the powder barrels exploded, killing Bayraktar, his guard, and several hundred Janissaries.
He rose through the Janissary corps. After having been promoted to commandership, he took part in the wars against Austria and Russian Empire.
In 1808, when the Sultan Mustafa IV ascended the throne with the help of the reactionaries who opposed the reform efforts undertook by Selim III, and the deposed Selim III was imprisoned, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha was the governor of the city of Rusçuk (today "Rousse") in Bulgaria.
The assault on Constantinople and fight against the reactionaries [ edit ]
Alemdar Mustafa Pasha had always been a keen supporter of Sultan Selim III. With Mustafa IV on the throne rule and the reactionary rebels commanded by Kabakçı Mustafa in command of the Ottoman capital, Mustafa Pasha gathered a council in Rusçuk and the council decided to take action.
On 21 June 1808, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha and his army of about 15,000 men arrived in Constantinople. They easily took control, and Alemdar Mustafa Pasha ordered the rebels killed or exiled.
When Mustafa IV learned of these events, he decided to have his uncle, Selim III, and his younger brother, Prince Mahmut, killed in order to remain the only member of the imperial family. The executioners arrived first in the room of Selim III in the palace. Selim III, who was playing reed flute and had no weapons, resisted with his flute, but his efforts proved futile and he was strangled. His dead body was brought in front of Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, who began weeping, thinking he had failed in all his objectives.
His men warned him that Mustafa IV's men planned to kill Prince Mahmud as well. The executioners had raided the prince's room, but the servants hid the prince on the roof. Alemdar Mustafa and his men arrived and broke down the palace doors. They killed the rebels and eventually saved the prince.
Alemdar Mustafa Pasha declared prince Mahmud the new sultan with the name Mahmud II, and became his grand vizier.
In the service of Sultan Mahmud II [ edit ]
But differences of opinion soon emerged between the two. First of all, he made an agreement with the rebel representative from Anatolian lands, which was named "Charter of Alliance" (Sened-i Ittifak). Sultan Mahmud thought that his authority was limited by that agreement, and he withdrew his support for the Pasha.
Secondly, he re-established the army of Nizam-ı Cedid under a different name: Sekban-I Cedid Army. the Nizam-ı Cedid Army was a rival of the corps of Janissaries; therefore the Janissaries hated this army. The new name can be explained as an effort not to anger Janissaries. Furthermore, Pasha conducted an investigation among the Janissary corps and he fired the men who were not in fact Janissaries but receiving Janissary salaries all the same.
Death [ edit ]
His measures would eventually lay the ground for further reforms in the Ottoman Empire. But meanwhile, the ruling elites were resentful of him. On 15 November 1808, about a thousand Janissaries raided Alemdar Mustafa Pasha's house. Realizing he could not survive the assault, he ignited the gunpowder reserves in the cellar of his house, killing himself and approximately 400 Janissaries in the ensuing explosion. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha was buried in the courtyard of the Zeynep Sultan Mosque in Istanbul.
A street in Istanbul near the Sublime Porte is named after Alemdar Mustafa Pasha. A plaque there states that his father was a Janissary from Ruscuk.

IngDan has opened a new IoT innovation hub in Santa Clara, CA as part of its $35 million expansion in the region.
The 6,000-square-foot hub, known as a "Center of Excellence," opened in early December. It is IngDan's sixth such hub overall, and its first in the US. It's open free to the public to show emerging tech gadgets and is open to innovators and entrepreneurs to promote products and host workshops, events, and forums. The products on display aren't limited to those developed in conjunction with IngDan. Any startup can apply to have their new tech gadgets included at the center.
"IoT is the next industrial revolution, poised to usher in a new golden age of innovation and economic progress" said Shipeng Li, CTO of IngDan and Cogobuy Group, IngDan's parent company. "Innovators and investors in the US and China are paving IoT's early pathways to success. IngDan is committed to empowering IoT hardware innovators by connecting them to world-class investors, supply chain partners and marketing partners."
SEE: Photos of the tech gadgets on display at IngDan's new IoT experience center (TechRepublic)
Santa Clara was chosen as the location for the new hub, Li said, because, "Silicon Valley is the tech innovation center in the US—maybe in the world."
IngDan is investing in IoT because, according to figures from the IDC and MachinaResearch, US investments in IoT are expected to grow from $230 billion this year to $370 billion in 2018. By 2025, total global IoT revenue from sales and services is expected to reach $3 trillion, with a total potential global impact of $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion.
Some of the tech on display at IngDan's new center in the Silicon Valley includes SmartyPans, which are intelligent cooking devices; Xiao You, which is a service robot; and Jisiwei, a smart robot vacuum that can also watch your home and pet by remote control through the camera and a smartphone app.
As part of an overall IoT expansion, Ing Dan has partnered with Tsing Capital and SVC Angel Fund to provide financial services to IoT developers and startups through the center.
Companies producing new IoT gadgets will be able to leverage IngDan's supply chain and access to local resources and the Chinese market in order to accelerate their expansion. It will also customize funding models for IoT and smart technology startups, and offer mentorships with industry leaders.
"This is a win-win relationship for Tsing Capital, IngDan, and most importantly for IoT innovators who are looking for funding and supply chain support," said Don Ye, founding managing partner at Tsing Capital. "With IngDan, we're excited to offer our portfolio companies a vastly expanded value proposition to help transform an early-stage IoT startup with a product idea and a vision into a formidable international player with an efficient and reliable supply chain reaching customers from around the globe."

Teammates in a dieting challenge significantly improved each other's outcomes, suggesting that shedding pounds can have a ripple effect.
PROBLEM: Obesity remains a common, deadly, and costly disease in the U.S. It affects one in three American adults and its associated health problems, including heart disease and diabetes, cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Can team-based weight loss interventions help?
METHODOLOGY: Researchers from Brown University analyzed the results of the 2009 Shape Up Rhode Island campaign, a 12-week online weight loss competition where participants joined a team and competed in three divisions: weight loss, physical activity, and pedometer steps. The contest included 3,330 overweight or obese people or 987 teams.
RESULTS: Competition outcomes were most determined by the teams the participants were in. Those who lost clinically significant amounts of weight or at least five percent of their initial body weight tended to be on the same teams. Members who reported more teammate influence also increased their odds of achieving this level of weight loss by 20 percent.
CONCLUSION: Social influences can fuel weight loss.
IMPLICATION: Being surrounded by the right people when dieting matters. Lead author Tricia Leahey explains in a statement that they may provide accountability, help set expectations of weight loss, and provide encouragement and support.
SOURCE: The full study, "Teammates and Social Influence Affect Weight Loss Outcomes in a Team-Based Weight Loss Competition," is published in the journal Obesity.

The odds of the Giants avoiding Ezekiel Elliott to start the upcoming season may have increased.
The star Cowboys running back, already the subject of a long-running NFL personal conduct investigation, was allegedly involved in a late-night "altercation" at a Dallas bar, according to 105.3 The Fan in Dallas/Fort Worth.
Dallas police told Cowboys reporter Mike Fisher no arrests were made at Clutch Bar.
Statement from Dallas police regarding the Sunday night altercation that involved Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott: pic.twitter.com/AIObmC8uqW -- Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) July 17, 2017
Citing sources in a Facebook Live post, Fisher said he was told a punch was thrown at the bar and police and an ambulance responded. It is not clear what Elliott's role, if any, was.
The Cowboys became aware of the situation early Monday morning, according to Fisher.
Big questions for Giants' 2017 opponents
Elliott is facing a potential suspension due to a league investigation into domestic violence allegations made against him in 2016. ESPN's Adam Schefter has been reporting for several weeks Elliott's camp is bracing for a "short" suspension, likely for one or two games. If so, he would not be able to play against the Giants in the season opener on Sept. 10.
There is precedent for the NFL to view whatever may or may not have happened with Elliott in this specific incident as a separate matter from the current investigation. In that case, it would be unlikely any punishment for this incident could be handed out before the start of the season. But Fisher reported he has been told the NFL may look to punish Elliott for "the cumulative nature of his behavior."
If that is the case, this situation - as well as the March incident where he pulled a woman's top down at a St. Patrick's Day parade, exposing her, and his sighting at a marijuana dispensary in the Seattle area last August - could be considered if and when the league hands down punishment related to the domestic violence situation.

The Syrian government has demolished thousands of buildings, in some cases entire neighbourhoods, in parts of Damascus and Hama, as part of a collective punishment against residents of rebel-held areas, Human Rights Watch has found.
Satellite imagery taken over both cities has revealed seven areas where neighbourhoods have either been largely destroyed or totally demolished. None of the destruction was caused during combat. Rather, the buildings have been systemically destroyed using bulldozers and explosives placed by troops who first ordered residents to leave, then supervised the demolitions.
A report released on Thursday morning says the Syrian regime claims that the demolitions were part of an urban planning programme that aimed to remove illegally constructed buildings.
Human Rights Watch, however, claims the motivations were instead to punish areas that were deemed to be sympathetic to opposition groups. It says the destruction violated international law and the laws of war.
Claims of widespread abuses have been routinely levelled by the government and the opposition during almost three years of war in Syria, which has killed more than 130,000, displaced close to 8 million, led tens of thousands to disappear and battered the country's renowned heritage sites. However, the scale of the physical destruction has been difficult to document, with reporting limited by government visa restrictions and the intensity of the fighting.
“Wiping entire neighbourhoods off the map is not a legitimate tactic of war,” said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These unlawful demolitions are the latest additions to a long list of crimes committed by the Syrian government.”
Using satellite imagery, the organisation has compiled a dramatic series of before and after shots that it says show 145 hectares, the equivalent of 200 football fields, where the state policy has caused near-total destruction.
Some demolitions took place near areas such as the Mezzeh airbase and the international airport that the opposition viewed as strategic. While acknowledging that a military response in these areas could be deemed as legitimate, the report claims that the response was disproportionate.
The Mezzeh and Tadamoun areas of the capital, both opposition strongholds, have been particularly heavily hit, the images show. In Hama, where former president Hafez al-Assad killed tens of thousands of residents and wiped out neighbourhoods over several days in 1982, widespread destruction has again taken place. The satellite images show that the Masha al-Arb'een area has been wiped out. One image, apparently taken while the demolitions were under way, shows part of the area still standing – a grey blob of buildings juxtaposed against a white backdrop of ruins.
Above images embedded from Human Rights Watch website
Researchers compiled the report after viewing 15 satellite images and speaking to 16 witnesses to the demolitions, among them homeowners. Government statements, interviews with officials and videos posted to the web depicting the destruction were also used.
“No one should be fooled by the government's claim that it is undertaking urban planning in the middle of a bloody conflict, ” said Solvang. “This was collective punishment of communities suspected of supporting the rebellion. The UN security council should, with an ICC [international criminal court] referral, send a clear message that cover-ups and government impunity won't stand in the way of justice for victims.”
Nadim Houry, deputy director of Human Rights Watch for the Middle East and North Africa, said: "These are the areas that we were told about by witnesses. There are likely to be other areas, but there are many black holes in Syria where we don't have information. This is likely part of a systematic policy in rebel held areas elsewhere in the country as well.
"It shows yet again that this is not a one-off act by a commander. This is part of a strategy targeting all opposition-held areas. It is a mirror image of the starvation of people in Yarmouk [refugee camp in Damascus] or in Old Homs. It shows yet again how ready the government is to collectively harm areas of people that are supporting the opposition."
While the destruction of Syria's towns and cities during fighting has been well-documented, the eradication of neighbourhoods as a form of punishment or deterrence against supporting the opposition has not been revealed.
The regime has claimed that all those fighting against it are internationally backed terrorists who have imposed their will on communities, which they then use as bases to hide and stage attacks.
Opposition-held parts of Aleppo have repeatedly been hit by large ballistic missiles, including scuds, as well as non-conventional high-explosive bombs dropped from helicopters, known as barrel bombs. Such attacks killed 13 people in Aleppo on Tuesday and have claimed more than 300 lives since the start of the year.
Earlier satellite images have also revealed the scale of destruction in Aleppo, Syria's second city. A series of shots taken over other towns and cities during the past year has shown a physical landscape changed dramatically by the war.
Human Rights Watch called for its findings to be referred to the international criminal court and for compensation to be paid to homeowners. It also called for the international community to implement arms embargos that limit the supply of weapons and ammunition to the Syrian government.
Witnesses described seeing a "ball of flame" high above the sky and flames visible for kilometres after an explosion and fire ripped through the Lakeland Mills sawmill in the northern B.C. city of Prince George, killing one person and injuring 24 others.
Emergency crews rushed to the scene after the explosion engulfed the mill at about 9:45 p.m. PT, shaking nearby homes and businesses.
Flames at the sawmill, located about one kilometre outside the city, were reported to have shot more than 60 metres in the air at one point, according to witnesses.
The fire that followed has now been controlled but there are still hotspots and the fire isn't expected to be fully extinguished for another 24 to 48 hours, officials said Tuesday.
"There's nothing left standing as far as a recognizable physical structure. It was literally just a ball of flame," said Cameron Stolz, a Prince George city councillor.
All 50 workers who were on the job Monday night have been accounted for, officials said.
But on Tuesday morning, Northern Health spokesman Steve Raper confirmed one of the victims had died around 5:30 a.m. He was later identified as shift supervisor Alan Little, 43.

Twenty-four other people with varying injuries were treated at University Hospital of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, a Northern Health representative said.
"There were certainly some patients with some very severe burns, and we had to evacuate those to the waiting ambulances some distance away," said fire Chief John Lane.
A total of six people remained in hospital in Prince George in serious condition on Tuesday morning.
Three others in critical condition had been transferred by air ambulance to hospital in Vancouver and another person in critical condition was transferred to Edmonton.
Flames lit up downtown
Prince George Mayor Sheri Green said the news was devastating for the whole community.
"My thoughts and prayers and I know those of everyone is with every worker and with all of their families that are affected and for all of their emergency responders who are dealing with this as well. A fire and injuries from a fire are extremely difficult to deal with," said Green.
The fire chief said the sawmill, the log processing facility and the sorting facility were all destroyed, but the planer facility and an energy plant were intact.
The cause of the explosion and fire was not yet known and an investigation is expected to begin as soon as the fire is completely out.

Counc. Stolz told CBC News that he rushed to the scene after the explosion shook the house he was in.
"The flames literally lit up the entire downtown; they must have been visible for kilometres," he said.
The "cataclysmic" fire had many local families in shock, Stolz said.
Stolz said emergency services called in all the fire halls and extra staff, and extra workers rushed in to help at the local hospital.
Severe burns 'quite gruesome'
Co-workers at the Lakeland Sawmill scrambled to help each other immediately after the blast, with one saying he used scissors to cut charred clothing off those with severely burned skin.
"It was quite gruesome," said Brian Croy, first vice-president of the United Steelworkers Local 1-424 said from his home.
"When you walk out, there were guys with their skin hanging off their arms and stuff from being burned."
[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=2262 size=small]
Croy said he was among six people in the mill's lunchroom talking about training when the explosion happened.
Suddenly the walls caved in and the room filled with thick smoke.
"That thing came up so fast, so quick. I don't know where it came from, but it was almost like a cannon going off. It blew through there. It ended just that quick," he said.
Croy said breathed through his jacket until the smoke cleared, then struggled to exit the burning wreckage.
"The smoke was just wicked, it took me down to my knees."
Workers scrambled to escape
Unfamiliar with the mill, and disoriented from the blast, Croy scrambled to get out with the others.
"There were flames coming up on that side, so we turned and headed the other way."
He and others ran down a set of stairs and crawled across some blown-down walls to get outside, where they found another man scrambling to escape.

"He was in really bad shape, his clothes were blown off, he was burned bad. The thing I noticed first off were his fingertips on both hands looked like they were gone."
Minutes later the men found the first aid tent, where Croy said he learned all the other workers were accounted for.
It's the second devastating explosion in B.C. in recent months. In January, an explosion tore through a mill near Burns Lake, killing two and destroying the mill.
The cause of that explosion has not yet been determined by investigators, who completed their investigation of the Babine Forest Products mill site just last week.
But some outside experts have pointed to high dust levels and limited ventilation at the Burns Lake mills as a possible cause.
This article is about the pranking holiday. For other uses, see Mischief Night (disambiguation) Mischief Night is an informal holiday on which some children and teenagers engage in pranks and minor vandalism. It is known by a variety of names (see below). Mischief Night Toilet papering is often practiced on Mischief Night Also called Devil's Night
Goosey Night
Moving Night
Cabbage Night
Mat Night Observed by Teenagers, children Celebrations Vandalism, pranking Date 30 October (sometimes 4 November, 1 May) Related to Halloween Contents
Historical background Edit
The earliest reference to Mischief Night is from 1790 when a headmaster encouraged a school play which ended in "an Ode to Fun which praises children's tricks on Mischief Night in most approving terms".[1] In the United Kingdom, these pranks were originally carried out as part of May Day celebrations, but shifted to later in the year, dates varying in different areas, some marking it on October 30, the night before Halloween, others on November 4, the night before Bonfire Night. According to one historian, "May Day and the Green Man had little resonance for children in grimy cities. They looked at the opposite end of the year and found the ideal time, the night before the gunpowder plot."[1] However, the shift only happened in the late nineteenth century and is described by the Opies as "one of the mysteries of the folklore calendar".[2] In Germany, Mischief Night is still celebrated on May 1.[citation needed]
Naming variations Edit
Contemporary practice Edit
Mischief Night tends to include popular tricks such as toilet papering yards and buildings, powder-bombing and egging cars, people, and homes, using soap to write on Windows, "forking" yards, setting off fireworks, and smashing pumpkins and jack-o'-lanterns.[7] Local grocery stores often refuse to sell eggs to children and teenagers around the time of Halloween for this reason. Occasionally, the damage can escalate to include the spray-painting of buildings and homes.[11] Less destructive is the prank known as "Knock, Knock, Ginger". In New Orleans in recent years, Mischief Night has included a series of unruly parade-like processions with an anti-capitalist bent.[12] According to participants, the Mischief Night "krewes" follow in New Orleans' carnival's centuries-old tradition of "walking parades", which mostly transpire in the lead-up to Mardi Gras. Mixing revelry with pranks, Mischief Night parades involve thematic floats and costumes as well as targeted vandalism and fire. Targets of vandalism have included the police, real estate developers and symbols of racism. When asked in an interview from 2017 how Mischief Night in New Orleans fits into the context of carnival, a parader replied "Our Carnival traditions are those that actually want to 'turn the world upside down.'"[13] After a parade through downtown in 2016 that saw bonfires in the street, police cars hit with paint, and a now-removed white supremacist monument chipped away at with a sledgehammer, another participant wrote: There is no longer a middle ground; that's been seized for luxury condos. The choice is stark: we either collectively build a more combative spiritual practice or we collude in ceding our ritual spaces of encounter to the oppressors.[14] In some areas of Queens, New York, Cabbage Night has included throwing rotten fruit at neighbors, cars, and buses. Children and teenagers filled eggs with Neet and Nair hair remover and throw them at unsuspecting individuals. In the mid-1980s, garbage was set on fire and cemeteries were set ablaze. In Camden, New Jersey, Mischief Night escalated to the point that in the 1990s widespread arson was committed, with over 130 arsons on the night of October 30, 1991.[15]
Angels' Night Edit
In Detroit, which was particularly hard-hit by Devil's Night arson and vandalism throughout the 1980s, many citizens take it upon themselves to patrol the streets to deter arsonists and those who may break the law. This is known as "Angels' Night". Some 40,000 volunteer citizens patrol the city on Angels' Night, which usually runs October 29 through October 31, around the time most Halloween festivities are taking place.[16]
In popular culture Edit
In the 1994 film The Crow , the protagonist and his fiancée are murdered on the eve of their Halloween wedding on "Devil's Night" by a street gang on the orders of Detroit's most notorious crime lord, Top Dollar. With the help of a mystical crow, Eric returns from the grave on "Devil's Night" one year later to exact revenge against the crime lord and his henchmen. [17]

Hijab-clad Muslim woman evicted from Trump rally A hijab-clad Muslim woman was booted out of Donald Trump's campaign event again after handing out pens inscribed with the word 'salam' which means 'peace'. She was also evicted from the business tycoon's event for a silent protest in January.
Sikh with ‘Stop Hate' sign thrown out of Trump rally American hypernationalism was on full display at a Donald Trump rally in which a Sikh protestor was evicted amid chants of “USA! USA!” His offense: Holding up a banner that read “Stop Hate!”
WASHINGTON: In a 2006 Senate race, Republican candidate George Allen referred to a young Indian-American who was filming him at a rally as a "macaca" (monkey), compounding the slur by telling the US-born SR Sidarth, "Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia." The racist breach cost Allen the election, lost Republicans control of the tied Senate, and arguably cost the GOP the state itself as Virginia turned blue subsequently, voting for Democrats in the 2008 and 2012 Presidential elections after 40 years of Republican victories.Evidently, the Trump campaign hasn't learned much from the pivotal episode; perhaps it is not even aware of it. At a North Carolina Trump rally on Thursday, a young Indian-American was evicted by Trump's security, ostensibly because he didn't look white American enough, and they believed he was a protestor.At least, Sidarth was shooting a video for Allen's Democratic opponent; here, Jake Anantha, 18, was a registered Republican wearing a Trump T-shirt, a Trump fanboy who had come to cheer the man he thought was for all Americans.Not anymore. As he stood outside the door of the convention center watching "all these white people" streaming in after he was removed, Anantha says he stopped believing Trump stood for everyone."When I saw him on TV, I personally didn't mind his rhetoric," he told the local Charlotte Observer. "I defended him. When people called him a racist, I said he's a critic of our flawed immigration system. He's strong on Islamic terrorism.""Obviously now I'm very angry. I've wasted a bunch of time coming here. I may have wasted six months of my life supporting Donald Trump, who doesn't even let me come to his rallies," the young collegiate added.Now he plans to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson.Jake's father Ramesh Anantha, who also counted himself as a Republican, says his son's ardor for Trump made him go "whoa!" before the incident. "It's unbelievably ironic… he should have been looked at as a perfect Trump supporter. He should have been somebody they're putting up on stage," said Anantha, whose parents migrated from India.Now Trump has lost the votes of both father and son. Although they realize it was not Trump who ordered the removal, they maintain the candidate is responsible for the people he hires and the tone he sets."It was a very rude introduction into the world of politics," said Anantha, who works in financial services. "We realize Donald Trump himself had nothing to do with this problem, but it's the type of campaign he's running."Explaining the run-up to the incident, Jake Anantha said he had been waiting near the stage just before Trump arrived when a security staffer tapped his shoulder and asked him to come with him. He says the staffer told him, "We know who you are. You've been at many other rallies."Anantha, who registered to vote in March this year, told him he has never been to another rally in my life. "I'm a huge Trump supporter. I would never protest against Trump," he says he explained. But it did not help. He was turfed out."I do think it was because I was brown," Anantha said.
The new iPhone 5C and 5S were released a couple of weeks ago and were mostly criticised for the lack of innovation and the new, colourful, flat iOS7.
Let's forget the products and the new iOS for a moment and have a look under the hood of the Apple iPhone 5C/5S website.
As always with Apple websites, there are a couple of details which makes for some slick and elegant product presentation.
1. Top Sticky Navigation
Once you scroll to the second section the navigation bar slides down from the top of the browser window. This very simple, yet elegant effect, is done with a mix of JavaScript and CSS3. We will explore the html markup first.
HTML
<div id="product-nav-slide" class="active"> <nav id="productheader"> ... </nav> </div> <div id="main" class="main mbig"> ... </div>
Surprisingly there are two nav elements with productheader ID in the html markup. If you are familiar with the basics of html you know that ID should be unique and used only once per page.
Nevermind though, as I'm not here to teach you html. You would be better of signing up with Treehouse.
nav#productheader is positioned absolute off the screen ( top: -57px ), and JavaScript adds a class="active" once you scroll to the second slide.
CSS
html, #main { display: block; position: static; padding: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } #main { position: relative; z-index: 10; } /* Navigation - default */ #product-nav-slide { position: absolute; width: 100%; z-index: 20; top: -57px; line-height: 0.66; -webkit-transform: translateZ(0); -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 700ms; -moz-transition: -moz-transform 700ms; transition: transform 700ms; } /* Navigation - active */ #product-nav-slide.active { -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 600ms; -moz-transition: -moz-transform 600ms; transition: transform 600ms; -webkit-transition-delay: 1010ms; -moz-transition-delay: 1010ms; transition-delay: 1010ms; -webkit-transform: translateY(57px) translateZ(0); -moz-transform: translateY(57px); transform: translateY(57px); }
div#main is positioned relative and takes up the whole browser width and height .
Once the additional class .active has been rendered, CSS3 translateY(57px); moves the navigation bar back into the view with a slight delay transition-delay: 1010ms .
As you can see, the translateY value matches the top offset initially defined for #product-nav-slide .
If you scroll back to the first slide, you will see that the navigation disappears straight away without any delays and goes back to -57px off the screen.
2. Design slide animation
On the first slide you can see a back, front, and side view of the new iPhone animating into place when you scroll to it. Very neat and eye-catching effect. How was it done?
HTML
<section id="color" class="active"> <div class="gallery-content"> <img class="front" src="..." width="239" height="464"> <img class="back" src="..." width="240" height="464"> <img class="side" src="..." width="71" height="464"> </div> </section>
The HTML is pretty straight forward. There is a #gallery-content container with 3 images for front, back, and side assets.
Each img element has also data-responsive attributes, which includes an array of images for different screen resolutions. I have removed these data attributes from the markup above, to simplify our deconstruction.
CSS
#color .gallery img { float: left; width: 800px; height: 696px; behavior: none; -webkit-transform: translateZ(0); } /* animations */ #color .gallery-content.animate img { position:relative; z-index:1; -webkit-transition:-webkit-transform .6s .9s; -moz-transition: -moz-transform .6s .9s; transition: transform .6s .9s; } #color .gallery-content.animate .back { z-index:2; -webkit-transform:translate3d(-40%, 0, 0); -moz-transform:translate3d(-40%, 0, 0); transform:translate3d(-40%, 0, 0); } #color .gallery-content.animate .front { -webkit-transform:translate3d(56.6%, 0, 0); -moz-transform:translate3d(56.6%, 0, 0); transform:translate3d(56.6%, 0, 0); } #color .gallery-content.animate .side { -webkit-transform:translate3d(-338%, 0, 0); -moz-transform:translate3d(-338%, 0, 0); transform:translate3d(-338%, 0, 0); } #color.active .gallery-content.animate .front, #color.active .gallery-content.animate .back, #color.active .gallery-content.animate .side { -webkit-transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0) !important; -moz-transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0) !important; transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0) !important; }
These images are (by default) floating left next to each other, but are repositioned on top of each other at the beginning.
The offset is set in percentage for it to work in multiple screen resolutions. .front is moved 56.6% right, .side 338% left and .back is also shifted left by 40%.
As you can see the back image has the highest z-index and therefore appears on top of the other two assets.
Similar to the navigation effect, JavaScript helps with adding extra class .active to the #color container .
The translate3d value is then reset for each image, which makes them animate to their default position.
The values for the transition: transform .6s 20s , mean .6s animation duration with .9s animation delay .
3. Features slide animation
This is a tricky one to explain, so I will try not to confuse you and cover in high-level the concept of the animation.
HTML
<div class="capable-bottom"> <img class="capable-pink" src="..." width="231" height="440"> <img class="capable-yellow" src="..." width="226" height="440"> <img class="capable-blue" src="..." width="458" height="216"> </div>
The 3 images pink, yellow, and blue are positioned absolute inside a centered .capable-bottom container. Top and left offset is then used to position these images to their desired place.
<!-- Features View --> <figure id="capable-ios-actor" class="actor-slide" style="-webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 0%, 0px);"> <div class="slide-content link-down link-up" style="-webkit-transform: translate3d(0, -106px, 0);"> <div class="capable-capable-container"> <img class="capable-green" src="..." width="230" height="440"> </div> </div> </figure> <!-- iOS View --> <figure id="capable-ios-actor" class="actor-slide" style="-webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 100%, 0px);"> <div class="slide-content link-down link-up" style="-webkit-transform: translate3d(0, -325px, 0);"> ... </div> </figure>
The green image is inside a separate figure#capable-ios-actor element. The figure and #slide-content transform values are changing when you scroll between these two slides.
This means more of the green iPhone 5C image is revealed on the iOS slide.
Below is the CSS used for this section of the page.
CSS
#capable .capable-bottom { position: absolute; z-index: 1; top: 50%; left: 50%; display: block; margin-top: -288px; margin-left: -636px; width: 0; height: 0; } #capable-ios-actor { z-index:1; } #capable-ios-actor .capable-green { position:absolute; z-index:1; top:50%; left:50%; margin-top:293px; margin-left:-531px; } #capable .capable-bottom img { position:absolute; top:0px; z-index:1; } #capable .capable-bottom .capable-pink { top:-45px; left:106px; } #capable .capable-bottom .capable-yellow { top:-87px; left:-222px; } #capable .capable-bottom .capable-blue { top:-70px; left:448px; }
If you look at the CSS code, you will realise that the layout is created mostly by using absolute positioning, negative margins and CSS3 transforms.
It is a project using the most negative margins I have ever seen.
Why does only the iOS7 text fade in?
If you are looking carefully at the smaller details, you will see that the only text on the page fading in is on the last slide.
That's purely because if it was visible all the time it would appear on top of the the green iPhone image while the page scrolls between the slides.
Text appearing on top the image would be hard to read and it would look messy. To avoid this, it fades in with a slight delay .
Conclusion
A lot of small details make this page a nice and elegant user experience.
I strongly encourage you to open your Firebug or Chrome Inspector and have looked yourself. Explore how the new iPhone 5C page was structured and how JavaScript adds extra classes to the elements when they come into the view.

Female facial hair a series of contradictions – common yet considered abnormal – and the pressure to remove it represents the most basic rules of the patriarchy
Female facial hair: if so many women have it, why are we so deeply ashamed?
Women like me have been keeping a secret. It's a secret so shameful that it's hidden from friends and lovers, so dark that vast amounts of time and money are spent hiding it. It's not a crime we have committed, it's a curse: facial hair.
The disturbing truth about how we treat our pubic hair | Mona Chalabi Read more
What can be dismissed as trivial is a source of deep anxiety for many women, but that's what female facial hair is; a series of contradictions. It's something that's common yet considered abnormal, natural for one gender and freakish for another. The reality isn't quite so clearcut. Merran Toerien, who wrote her PhD on the removal of female body hair, explained “biologically the boundary lines on body hair between masculinity and femininity are much more blurred than we make them seem”.
The removal of facial hair is just as paradoxical – the pressure to do it is recognized by many women as a stupid social norm and yet they strictly follow it. Because these little whiskers represent the most basic rules of the patriarchy – to ignore them is to jeopardize your reputation, even your dignity.
About one in 14 women have hirsutism, a condition where “excessive” hair appears in a male pattern on women's bodies. But plenty more women who don't come close to that benchmark of “excessive” still feel deeply uncomfortable about their body hair. If you're unsure whether your hair growth qualifies as “excessive” for a woman, there's a measurement tool that some men have developed for you.
In 1961, an endocrinologist named Dr David Ferriman and a graduate student published a study on the “clinical assessment of body hair growth in women”. More specifically, they were interested in terminal hairs (ones that are coarser, darker and at least 0.5cm/0.2 inches in length) rather than the fine vellus hairs. The men looked at 11 body areas on women, rating the hair from zero (no hairs) to four (extensive hairs). The Ferriman-Gallwey scale was born.
It has since been simplified, scoring just nine body areas (upper lip, chin, chest, upper stomach, lower stomach, upper arms, upper legs, upper back and lower back). The total score is then added up – less than eight is considered normal, a score of eight to 15 indicates mild hirsutism and a score greater than 15 moderate or severe hirsutism.

Most women who live with facial hair don't refer to the Ferriman-Gallwey scale before deciding they have a problem. Since starting to research hirsutism, I've received over a hundred emails from women describing their experiences discovering, and living with, facial hair. Their stories loudly echo one another.
Because terminal hairs start to appear on girls around the age of eight, the experiences start young. Alicia, 38, in Indiana wrote, “kids in my class would be like, ‘Haha look at this gorilla!'”, Lara was nicknamed “monkey” by her classmates while Mina in San Diego was called “sasquatch”. For some girls, this bullying (more often by boys) was their first realization that they had facial hair and that the facial hair was somehow “wrong”. Next, came efforts to “fix” themselves.
Génesis, a 24-year-old woman described her first memories of hair removal. “In fourth grade, a boy called me a werewolf when he saw my arm hairs and upper lip hairs … I cried to my mom about it … she bleached my lower legs, my arms, my back, my upper lip and part of my cheeks to diminish my growing sideburns. I remember it itched and burned.”
After those first attempts come many, many more – each with their own investment in time, money and physical pain. The removal doesn't just make unwanted hair go away, it raises a whole new set of problems, particularly for women of color. Non-white skin is more likely to scar as a result of trying to remove hair.

On average, women with facial hair spend 104 minutes a week managing it, according to a 2006 British study. Two-thirds of the women in the study said they continually check their facial hair in mirrors and three-quarters said they continually check by touching it.
The study found facial hair takes an emotional toll. Forty percent said they felt uncomfortable in social situations, 75% reported clinical levels of anxiety. Overall, they said that they had a good quality of life, but tended to give low scores when it came to their social lives and relationships. All of this pain despite the fact that, for the most part, women's facial hair is entirely normal.
If I know I have visible facial hair, I'm much more reserved in social situations. I try to cover it up by placing my hand on my chin or over my mouth. And I'm thinking about it constantly. – Ashley D'Arcy, 26
Meanwhile, my 95-year-old demented, deaf and blind Italian aunt sits in a nursing home, and whenever I visit, she points to and rubs her chin, which is her way of communicating to take care of the hair situation. That's how I know she's still in there and she cares. I hope someone returns the favor in 40 years. – Julia, 54
There are, however, some medical conditions which can cause moderate or severe hirsutism, the most likely of which is polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, which accounts for 72-82% of all cases. PCOS is a hormonal disorder affecting between eight and 20% of women worldwide. There are other causes too, such as idiopathic hyperandrogenemia, a condition where women have excessive levels of male hormones like testosterone, which explains another 6-15% of cases. .
But many women who don't have hirsutism, who don't have any medical condition whatsoever, consider their hairs “excessive” all the same. And that's much more likely if you're a woman of color.
The original Ferriman-Gallwey study, like so much western medical research at the time, produced findings that might not apply to women of color (the averages were based on evaluations of 60 white women). More recent research has suggested that was a big flaw, because race does make a big difference to the chances that a woman will have facial hair.
In 2014, researchers looked at high-resolution photos of 2,895 women's faces. They found that, on average, the white women had less hair than any other race and Asian women had the most. But ethnicity mattered too – for example, the white Italian women in the study had more hair than the white British women.

But more than a gender thing, for me my hair was about race/ethnicity. My hairiness really solidified how different I was from my peers. I grew up in the suburbs of Dallas. And although my school was pretty diverse, the dominant beauty norm was to be blonde and white. – Mitra Kaboli, 30, Brooklyn
These numbers might be helpful to women like Melissa who said her facial hair meant “I felt inferior, I was a ‘dirty ethnic' girl”.
But giving reassurance to ethnic minorities probably isn't why this research was undertaken. The study was funded by Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods company worth $230bn which sells, among other things, razor for women. They know that female hair removal is big business.
Over the years, as women showed more of our bodies – as stockings became sheer and sleeves became short, there was pressure for these new exposed parts to be hairless. Beginning in 1915, advertisements in magazines like Harper's Bazaar began referring to hair removal for women. Last year, the hair removal industry in the US alone was valued at $990m. The business model only works if we hate our hair and want to remove it or render it invisible with bleach (a norm just as unrealistic as hairlessness – brown women rarely have blonde hair).
When did we sign up to an ideal of female hairlessness? The short answer is: women have hated our facial hair for as long as men have been studying it. In 1575, the Spanish physician Juan Huarte wrote: “Of course, the woman who has much body and facial hair (being of a more hot and dry nature) is also intelligent but disagreeable and argumentative, muscular, ugly, has a deep voice and frequent infertility problems.”
These signposts are strictest when it comes to our faces, and they extend beyond gender to sexuality too. According to Huarte, masculine women, feminine men and homosexuals were originally supposed to be born of the opposite sex. Facial hair is one important way to understand these distinctions between “normal” and “abnormal”, and then police those boundaries.
Scientists have turned their sexist and homophobic expectations of body hair to racist ones, too. After Darwin's 1871 book Descent of Man was published, male scientists began to obsess over racial hair types as an indication of primitiveness. One study, published in 1893, looked for insanity in 271 white women and found that women who were insane were more likely to have facial hair, resembling those of the “inferior races”.
These aren't separate ideas because race and gender overlap – black is portrayed in mass media as a masculine race, Asian as feminine. Ashley Reese, 27, wrote “part of my self-consciousness about my facial hair might also tie into some ridiculous internalized racism about black women being less inherently feminine”. While Katherine Parker, 44, wrote, “It makes me feel very confused about my gender.”
Some women are pushing back. Queer women – those who are questioning heterosexual and cisgender norms – are already thinking outside of the framework that shames female facial hair. Melanie, a 28-year-old woman in Chicago explained that as a queer woman “there is less of a prescription for what I should embody as a woman, what attraction between my partner and I look like, which has helped immensely in coming to terms with my facial hair”.

Social media accounts like hirsute and cute, happy and hairy and activists like Harnaam Kaur are resisting these norms too, by shamelessly sharing images of hairy female bodies. And even women who aren't rejecting these standards outright, feel deeply ambivalent about them. “I understand, on a rational level, how inherently misogynistic it is to expect women to be constantly ripping hair out of themselves, hair that grows naturally, wrote one woman who, like many I heard from, asked to remain anonymous. “But I can't bring myself to accept it and let it grow.”
Another wrote: “It's one thing to be a little heavy, or short, or both. But facial hair? That's pushing it.”
I'm not about to judge any woman for removing her facial hair. Despite knowing that I don't need “help”, I still go to see a beauty “therapist” each month. I pay huge sums so she can zap me with a laser that damages my hair follicles. I've signed up for a solution, even though I know that the problem doesn't really exist. I lie there wincing with each shock as she asks me about my weekend and says “Honey, are you sure you don't want me to do your arms too? They're very hairy.”
No, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Didn't Save Money by Killing the Red Line
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan spiked long-standing plans for the Baltimore Red Line because, he said, it cost too much. According to Hogan, he's saving taxpayers money by diverting Red Line funds to road projects.
But Ben Ross at Greater Greater Washington reports that, when it comes to return on investment, the governor's claim doesn't add up.
Ross writes that Hogan is pitching his “marquee project,” the $204 million widening of Route 404 on Maryland's Eastern Shore, as a time-saver for beach-bound motorists, “But the travel time savings from widening Route 404 will be far more expensive than the time saved by the two rail lines.”
The two-lane road only backs up on summer weekends when people drive to the beach. According to Google maps, the average traffic delay on summer Friday and Sunday afternoons varies from zero to six minutes. By a generous estimate, this adds up to 60,000 hours lost each year in traffic backups, making the construction cost $3,400 per annual hour saved. Building the Purple Line will cost $288 per annual hour of rider benefits, and the number for the Red Line is $456. The amount of money the state is spending to save a minute of travel time on Route 404 is seven and a half times greater than the amount it refused to spend to save a minute of travel time in Baltimore. That means a Baltimore bus rider will wait an hour so that an auto passenger can get to the beach eight minutes faster.
Officials claim the road widening will improve safety, but Ross says crash data doesn't bear that out. And if Hogan is looking to save lives, Ross notes, he would allocate Red Line funds for pedestrian safety measures around the state.
“The highway projects in Governor Hogan's package have never gotten the sort of detailed assessment of costs and benefits that the Red and Purple Line projects were subject to,” writes Ross. “The numbers for Route 404 suggest that canceling the Red Line was not at all the cost-conscious decision the governor presented it as.”

At half-past noon on Jan. 9, cable TV contractors sinking a half-mile of cable near Interstate 10 in rural Arizona pulled up something unexpected in the bucket of their backhoe: an unmarked fiber-optic cable. "It started pulling the fiber out of the pipe," says Scott Johansson, project manager for JK Communications and Construction. "Obviously, we said, 'Oop, we've hit something.'"
As the fiber came spooling out of the desert soil like a fishing line, long-distance service for millions of Sprint PCS and Nextel wireless customers west of the Rockies blinked off. Transcontinental internet traffic routed over Sprint slowed to a crawl, and some corporations that relied on the carrier to link office networks found themselves electronically isolated.
In the end, a hole dug out of a dirt road outside a town called Buckeye triggered a three-and-a-half hour outage with national impact. It wasn't even a very deep hole. "We ran into their line right away," says Johansson.
Know the signs!
Click here for our handy guide to underground markings.Experts say last week's Sprint outage is a reminder that with all the attention paid to computer viruses and the latest Windows security holes, the most vulnerable threads in America's critical infrastructures lie literally beneath our feet.
"No one wants something like this to happen," says Sprint spokesman John Taylor. "The fact is we are absolutely focused on restoring service to our customers ... and in this case we did so in record time."
A study issued last month by the Common Ground Alliance, or CGA – an industry group comprised of utilities and construction companies – calculated that there were more than 675,000 excavation accidents in 2004 in which underground cables or pipelines were damaged. And an October report from the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions found that cable dig-ups were the single most common cause of telecom outages over a 12-year period ending in 2004, with the number of incidents dropping in recent years but the severity and duration of the outages increasing.
In 2004, Department of Homeland Security officials became fearful that terrorists might start using accidental dig-ups as a road map for deliberate attacks, and convinced the FCC to begin locking up previously public data on outages. In a commission filing, DHS argued successfully that revealing the details of "even a single event may present a grave risk to the infrastructure."
"We see people talking about the digital Pearl Harbor from the worms and Trojans and viruses," says Howard Schmidt, former White House cybersecurity adviser. "But in all probability, there's more likelihood of what we call the 'backhoe attack' that would have more impact on a region then a Code Red, or anything we've seen so far."
Sprint claims it's still investigating who was at fault in Buckeye, but Johansson says that's a settled issue: Before his crew members disturbed so much as a pebble, they submitted their plans to Arizona's "call-before-you-dig" One Call center, then waited for each utility to mark off their buried facilities, if any. Contacted by Wired News, the center confirmed the call.
According to Johansson, Sprint responded by giving the contractors the all-clear. "We had a no-conflict ticket from them, indicating that they had no line there," he says.
Even that apparent gaffe wouldn't have been enough to cause an outage on its own. The Arizona fiber cut was on a transmission line that loops across the county in a solid ring – a "self-healing" topology that guarantees a single break won't stop service, because traffic can always circle back in the other direction.
But a few days earlier, another section of the same line buried in a railroad culvert near Reno Junction, California, suffered damage in a stormy mudslide. Sprint workers had to cut the waterlogged section of cable to make repairs. So when the contractor's backhoe ripped up the cable in Buckeye, the two cuts together effectively sawed off the entire westernmost section of the ring.
But that conspiracy of bad timing and wet weather pales against the impact that deliberate saboteurs or terrorists could make with some rented backhoes and careful target selection.
In 2003, then-Ph.D. candidate Sean Gorman famously mapped America's fiber-optic paths for his dissertation at George Mason University, and found it was easy to locate critical choke points from public records and data. Today, Gorman serves as CTO of FortiusOne, a startup that's helping financial companies diversify their electronic infrastructures, and consulting with the DHS. He says the vulnerabilities remain.
"We've looked at scenarios where we (could) have multiple fiber cuts that effectively disconnect the West Coast from the East Coast," says Gorman. "It's not very difficult to figure out."
Gorman blames this fragility in large part on the recent spate of telecom mergers and acquisitions – with each one, he says, more and more of the nation's critical communications merge into fewer and fewer fiber-optic cables. Witness the Sprint outage, which affected customers of Nextel, which Sprint finished acquiring last month.
Meanwhile, carriers don't want to spend the money to run redundant fiber-optic lines. A 2003 research paper (.pdf) from Sprint notes the company sought alternatives to "physically diverse protection paths" for its backbone network after confronting the "substantial capital investment" of running new cables, as well as challenges posed by geographic obstacles like mountains and bridges.
Those geographic limitations have spawned another dangerous trend, says Gorman: Different companies tend to install their cables alongside the same limited number of roads and railways, often unknowingly. "The vast majority of providers are on just two routes" across the country, he says. (Presumably, one of them runs under Buckeye.)
If there's widespread agreement on the danger, there's less of a consensus on the solution. Gorman argues that regulators should start taking into account the effect on national security when considering proposals to merge telecoms. "How many fiber paths are they planning on collapsing? How much diversity is the nation losing in the process? It's probably something that should be examined," he says.
But former White House cybersecurity adviser Schmidt disagrees. "We built the infrastructure using facilities that were already there, because they were most effective," he says. "You have physical limitations, like bridging the Mississippi River.... Can you imagine they tell you tomorrow, 'We have to build redundancy in the system, so we're going to double your phone bill?'"
Instead, Schmidt would like to see the government fund more research into network survivability. "Let's look at the R&D, let's start building this stuff so you can have alternative means of communications – wireless, satellite. Because you're never going to be able to have 100 percent redundancy."
For its part, Sprint insists that its network is diverse enough. "We do put a premium on redundancy," says Taylor. "In this particular case we had events simultaneously happen that are beyond our control."
In the end, there's no simple way to prevent sabotage to critical communications lines, should the United States' enemies ever decide on that tact. So far, they haven't.
But progress is being made on curtailing accidental damage, in particular by bolstering the system of regional One Call centers dedicated to preventing incidents like the Sprint outage, and the sometimes-fatal accidents that occur when an excavator digs into a buried natural gas or petroleum pipeline.
Under state laws, anyone who's breaking ground generally needs to contact the local One Call center first. The center then sends out notices to all the utilities in the area, which are obliged to respond, generally within two days. If anything is buried in the dig zone, the utility dispatches a worker to mark off the location, usually by spray painting a kind of infrastructure hobo's code on the ground: A red line indicates buried cable, yellow is a gas pipe, green a sewer line, etc. Any digging conducted close to the marked facilities has to be conducted by hand, or using special equipment like a vacuum pump.
The December CGA report – the first comprehensive look at digging accidents – found that nearly half of the 675,000 incidents in 2004 resulted from the excavator failing to contact the local One Call center. The most common facilities damaged as a result were gas pipelines, representing 51.6 percent of the damage. Telecommunications facilities came in second at 27.5 percent. Backhoes, trenchers and shovels tended to hit gas lines, while augers, borers and drills had it in for telecom cables.
Most of the incidents only affect local facilities – it takes bad luck to hit a major communications artery or pipeline. "But when they're hit, the damage is significant," says CGA executive director Bob Kipp. In one of the 2004 incidents, a construction crew in Walnut Creek, California, struck a buried petroleum pipeline, sparking an explosion that killed three people and injured six others.
But utilities are hopeful for change. In 2002, Congress passed, and President Bush signed, a law mandating the creation of a national call-before-you-dig three-digit phone number that, like 911, would route automatically to the caller's local center.
Last year the FCC decided on 811 as the magic number, and the CGA says it's on the verge of selecting a marketing firm to design a national Smokey the Bear-style campaign to promote the code when it goes live on April 10, 2007.
"So instead of having 50 state campaigns with 50 different numbers, we'll get one campaign with one easily recognizable number," says Kipp. "If dad's going to go in the backyard and plant a tree, the kid may say, 'Dad, if you're going to dig, you might blow up something, or we might be without phone service.'"

Ireland has launched a bid to become the home of Islamic finance in Europe as it seeks to rebuild its once dominant financial services sector.
The taoiseach, Enda Kenny, who was swept to power on a wave of public anger at the taxpayers' €70bn (£62bn) bailout of failed banks, told the Irish Funds Industry Association (IFIA) that he was doing everything he could to "ensure" Dublin became "a centre of excellence for Islamic finances".
Irish tax laws and financial regulations are now sharia-compliant, he said, and the government had recently signed double-taxation agreements with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
"There is first-mover advantage. If they [Islamic institutions] feel comfortable in a particular jurisdiction and you develop a cluster, more will follow," said Ken Owens, chairman of the IFIA. He said there was currently "a scramble" for Islamic business internationally and Ireland is just behind the UK in terms of adjusting its laws to be sharia-compliant.
Sharia law prohibits the payment of interest on loans or overdrafts, or the receipt of interest, and also prevents investment in certain categories including defence, adult entertainment and gambling.
"Their investment universe is quite limited. Islamic funds want to own the ship or the building, not a share in it. They want to own things outright because they can't pay interest. They want commmodities, infrastructure, manufacturing, property," said Owens.
On the mortgage market, institutions buy the house or the commercial real estate; the buyer then pays rent instead of interest.
Owens said Irish and UK financial institutions, which were devastated by the financial crisis, saw opportunities worth billions in Islamic finance, either seeking to get a toehold in Islamic countries or attract Islamic institutions to Dublin.
"The US and European asset management firms are already out in the Middle East and Asia with their products but now you've got those guys in China going 'I know China better than any US or European investor' and coming to Europe to compete with us," he said.
Owens, who is a partner in Pricewaterhouse Coopers Ireland, has one Middle-Eastern client who is about to open nine funds in Ireland; and the Irish Central Bank has recently authorised several Islamic institutions to operate in the Dublin's International Financial Services Centre.
The value of funds administered in Dublin is worth €1,890bn, split evenly between Irish and non-domiciled funds.
Last year, vacuum maker Dyson sued Samsung for patent infringement in the United Kingdom, where Dyson is based. Dyson lawyers argued that Samsung's MotionSync vacuums infringed Dyson patents related to the company's own vacuum technology.
But Dyson gave up the legal effort in fairly short order. The cause of this courtroom failure isn't clear, and the company told Wired UK it was forced to withdraw due to "loopholes in the patent system."
Samsung, apparently still quite displeased about being sued over patents in Dyson's home court, wasn't satisfied with that.
"The most unproductive innovation is patent litigation," said Samsung co-CEO Yoon Boo-keun in November, shortly after the suit was withdrawn.
The company has plans to rake Dyson over the coals on its home turf. Samsung filed a claim in South Korean court asking that Dyson should pay 10 billion won ($9.43 million) because the vacuum patent lawsuit "hurt Samsung's corporate image."
The counter-attack, reported this weekend in the Korea Times, included statements by an unnamed Samsung executive disparaging Dyson.
“Samsung's marketing activities were negatively affected by Dyson's groundless litigation, which is intolerable," said the executive. "Samsung is going to take a hard-line stance against patent trolls that use litigations as a marketing tool."
Samsung execs believe Dyson portrayed the company as a "repeat patent violator or copycat," the Korea Times wrote.
Of course, Dyson certainly isn't a "troll" in the classic sense: it has products which it sells internationally. And it's Dyson's widespread business lines, in fact, that enable Samsung to make a legal counter-attack on its home court. The company would have no such recourse against the kind of low-asset LLCs that are typical US patent trolls.
The lawsuit won't help Samsung a bit in the dozens of patent troll lawsuits it defends against every year in the US. Rather, it's a reminder to Samsung's actual business competitors: if you want to spark patent battles, we've got options too.
Dyson responded in a statement to The Guardian:
Anthony Bourdain, the celebrity chef turned TV show host, believes there's untapped potential with digital media to dive deeper into food and travel stories.
During a South by Southwest Interactive keynote moderated by Nathan Thornburgh, chief editor and publisher at Roads & Kingdoms, Bourdain talked about why he's increasingly interested in finding new ways to tell travel stories through interactive channels. Bourdain is an investor and an editor at large for digital-only Roads & Kingdoms.
When addressing the topic of print magazines, Bourdain asked, "Can you do real deep dives?"
"Everybody else has lists, people love lists, but deep storytelling … I think we travel differently now, and what we look for in reading before we travel is wildly different [than in past years]," he said. "I don't want a list of the best hotels or restaurants. I want to be set in a place where you get a real sense of what kind of place is what."
For example, Bourdain spoke of a Roads & Kingdoms story from earlier this year that was about dog killings in Southeast Asia that are used to make dog meat.
"It's my kind of story—it's painful, it's complex," Bourdain said. "You read the story, and it's very upsetting. I value good stories and people with uniquely powerful voices."
At the same time, attention spans continue to shrink and consumers are bombarded with online news.
"You wouldn't think of me as a sunny optimist, but I believe in good stories. I believe that there are people out there who value good stories. I was absolutely sure that [my career] was going to be over in [a few] years—16 years later, I'm still employed, which makes no sense at all," Bourdain said. "When you try to do honest, powerful—albeit confusing—stories, I think there are going to be people there."
But when it comes to short-form platforms like Twitter, Bourdain has a different view. When the session opened up for a Q&A with questions from Twitter at the end, Bourdain sarcastically quipped, "Twitter is fantastic—it's like making haiku."
Bourdain also talked about his CNN show Parts Unknown and the process that goes into making the hour-long series. It often includes digging into hard-hitting topics, such as an episode that takes place in the West Bank and discusses anti-Arab graffiti.
"I don't know when the show morphed into whatever the hell it is, but sometimes you have to acknowledge the elephant in the room," the former celebrity chef said. "I've never had a reputation to lose, which is a huge advantage."

As with most things in nutrition, there's no simple answer. Your individual needs will depend on your health, body composition, main goal, and level of physical activity (type, intensity, and duration). And even taking all this into account, you'll end up with a starting number, which you'll need to adjust through self-experimentation.
Daily requirements are expressed in grams of protein, either per kilogram of body weight (g/kg) or per pound of body weight (g/lb). In this article, we'll only mention daily requirements for adults.
If you're of healthy weight and sedentary, aim for 1.2–1.8 g/kg (0.54–0.82 g/lb).
If you're of healthy weight, active, and wish to keep your weight, aim for 1.4–2.2 g/kg (0.64–1.00 g/lb). Try for the higher end of this range, as tolerated, especially if you're an athlete.
If you're of healthy weight, active, and wish to build muscle, aim for 1.4–3.3 g/kg (0.64–1.50 g/lb). Eating more than 2.6 g/kg (1.18 g/lb) is probably not going to lead to greater muscle gains, but it can minimize fat gains when “bulking” — i.e., when eating above maintenance in order to gain (muscle) weight.
If you're of healthy weight, active, and wish to lose fat, aim for 2.2–3.3 g/kg (1.00–1.50 g/lb), skewing toward the higher end of this range as you become leaner or if you increase your caloric deficit (hypocaloric diet).
If you're overweight or obese, aim for 1.2–1.5 g/kg (0.54–0.68 g/lb). You do not need to try to figure out your ideal body weight or your lean mass (aka fat-free mass). Most studies on people with obesity report their findings based on total body weight.
If you're pregnant, aim for 1.66–1.77 g/kg (0.75–0.80 g/lb)
Also, note that …
Protein intake should be based on body weight, not on caloric intake. (But caloric intake should be based on body weight, too, so the two intakes are linked.)
Most studies have looked at dosages up to 1.5 g/kg; only a few have looked at dosages as high as 2.2–3.3 g/kg. However, even those higher dosages don't seem to have negative effects in healthy people.
How much protein you need depends on several factors, such as your weight, your goal (weight maintenance, muscle gain, or fat loss), your being physically active or not, and even whether you're pregnant or not.
Optimal daily protein intake for healthy, sedentary adults
The U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/kg. This is considered to be the minimal amount of protein a healthy adult must consume daily to prevent muscle wasting when total caloric intake is sufficient. According to recent studies, however, the RDA for protein may not be sufficient for healthy young men,[1] older men,[2] or older women.[3][4] These studies point to 1.2 g/kg as the minimum intake before the body starts downregulating important non-essential processes, from immune function to muscle protein synthesis.[5] Even a reanalysis of the data used to establish the RDA suggests the minimum intake should be at least 1.0 g/kg.[6]
A randomized controlled trial that confined healthy, sedentary adults to a metabolic ward for eight weeks provides the final nail in the coffin for the RDA.[7] The participants were randomized into three groups:
Each diet was equally hypercaloric: each participant consumed 40% more calories than they needed to maintain their weight. Yet, as shown in the figure below, eating near the RDA for protein resulted in loss of lean mass, and while this loss is so small as to be nonsignificant, the higher protein intakes were associated with increases in lean mass.
Another takeaway from this study is that eating more than 1.8 g/kg doesn't seem to benefit body composition, which makes it a good higher end for your daily protein intake, provided that you aren't physically active or trying to lose weight.
The RDA for protein (0.8 g/kg) underestimates the needs of a healthy, sedentary adult, who should rather aim for 1.2–1.8 g/kg (0.54–0.82 g/lb).
Optimal daily protein intake for athletes and similarly active adults
If you're physically very active, you need more protein daily than if you were sedentary. The American College of Sports Medicine, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and the Dietitians of Canada recommend 1.2–2.0 g/kg to optimize recovery from training and to promote the growth and maintenance of lean mass when caloric intake is sufficient.[8] This recommendation is similar to that of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (1.4–2.0 g/kg).[9]
Importantly, it may be better to aim for the higher end of the above ranges. According to the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date on the effects of protein supplementation on muscle mass and strength, the average amount of protein required to maximize lean mass is about 1.6 g/kg, and some people need upwards of 2.2 g/kg.[10] For those interested in a comprehensive breakdown of this study, please refer to our Examine.com Research Digest, Issue 34, Volume 1.
However, only 4 of the 49 included studies were conducted in people with resistance training experience (the other 45 were in newbies). There's some evidence that female athletes require 1.4–1.7 g/kg,[11] and that amateur bodybuilders require 1.7–2.2 g/kg on their non-training days.[12] Since higher protein intakes seem to have no negative effects in healthy people, one may want to err toward the higher amounts.
The daily protein requirement of healthy, sedentary adults is only 1.2–1.8 g/kg (0.54–0.73 g/lb), but regularly active adults and athletes need more. You can optimize body composition, performance, and recovery by consuming 1.4–2.2 g/kg (0.64–1.00 g/lb) — preferably toward the end of this range.
Optimal daily protein intake for muscle gain
Resistance training, such as lifting weights, is of course required for muscle gain: you can't just feed your muscles what they need to grow; you also need to give them a reason to grow.
Assuming progressive resistance overload and a mild hypercaloric diet (370–800 kcal above maintenance), a few studies suggest you'll gain less fat if you eat more protein (3.3 g/kg rather than 1.8–2.6 g/kg).[13][14]
What's important to understand is that a daily protein intake of 3.3 g/kg isn't likely to help you build more muscle than a daily protein intake of 1.8–2.6 g/kg. What the higher number can do is help you minimize the fat gains you'll most likely experience if you eat above maintenance in order to gain (muscle) weight.
Athletes and active adults can minimize fat gain when overfeeding by increasing protein intake to upward of 3.3 g/kg (1.5 g/lb).
Optimal daily protein intake for fat loss
More protein helps preserve lean mass in dieters, especially lean dieters. An early review concluded that, to optimize body composition, dieting athletes should consume 1.8–2.7 g/kg.[15] Later studies have argued that, to minimize lean-mass loss, dieting athletes should consume 2.3–3.1 g/kg (closer to the higher end of the range as leanness and caloric deficit increase).[16] This latter recommendation has been upheld by the International Society of Sports Nutrition[17] and by a review article on bodybuilding contest preparation.[18]
Note that those recommendations are for people who are relatively lean already. Several meta-analyses involving people with overweightness or obesity suggest that 1.2–1.5 g/kg is an appropriate daily protein intake range to maximize fat loss.[19][20][21] This range is supported by the European Association for the Study of Obesity, who recommend up to 1.5 g/kg for elderly adults with obesity.[22] It is important to realize that this range is based on actual body weight, not on lean mass or ideal body weight.
Considering the health risks associated with overweightness and obesity,[23][24] it is also noteworthy that eating a diet higher in protein (27% vs. 18% of calories) significantly reduces several cardiometabolic risk factors, including waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, and fasting insulin, while also increasing HDL-C and satiety.[25] These effects are small, however, and likely dependent on the amount of body fat one loses.
When dieting for fat loss, athletes and other active adults who are already lean may maximize fat loss and muscle retention by increasing protein intake to 2.3–3.1 g/kg (1.00–1.41 g/lb). People who are overweight or obese are best served by consuming 1.2–1.5 g/kg (0.54–0.68 g/lb).
Optimal daily protein intake for pregnant women
The protein RDA for pregnant women is 1.1 g/kg.[26] This value was estimated by adding three values:
The RDA for a healthy adult (0.8 g/kg)
The amount of additional body protein a pregnant woman accumulates
The amount of protein used by the developing fetus
However, as we saw previously with non-pregnant healthy adults, the RDA may not be sufficient, let alone optimal. There's some evidence that the RDA for pregnant women should be about 1.66 g/kg during early gestation (weeks 11–20) and 1.77 g/kg during late gestation (weeks 32–38).[27][28] Moreover, a meta-analysis of 16 intervention studies reported that protein supplementation during pregnancy led to reduced risks for the baby:[29]
34% lower risk of low gestational weight
32% lower risk of low birth weight
38% lower risk of stillbirth
Importantly, these values were determined from sedentary women, meaning that pregnant women who engage in regular physical activity may need even higher amounts.
Pregnant women may require a daily protein intake of 1.7 g/kg (0.77 g/lb) to support both the fetus and themselves. Protein supplementation during pregnancy appears to lower some risks for the baby — including the risk of stillbirth.
How much protein do I need per meal?
People over fifty, being less sensitive to the anabolic effects of protein,[30] need to consume higher doses to achieve maximal stimulation of muscle protein synthesis:[31]
These values are derived from studies using whey protein, which is especially bioavailable and rich in essential amino acids (EAAs). If your protein of choice isn't as bioavailable or as rich in EAAs — especially leucine — you'll need a higher dose.
Your dose should be even higher if consumed through a meal.[32] While 70 g (of protein consumed in one meal) may not increase protein synthesis more than 40 g does, it can further reduce body-protein breakdown, resulting in greater net protein balance.[33]
The problem with this study is that it looked at whole-body-protein balance. Muscle tissue accounts for only 25–30% of whole-body-protein turnover,[34] meaning that eating more protein may not necessarily translate to greater muscle-protein turnover and growth. Still, these studies show that the additional protein is not “wasted” (a common myth).
From a pragmatic perspective, it seems prudent to treat 0.24 g/kg (adults in their twenties) and 0.4 g/kg (adults over fifty) as minimum doses per meal, to be exceeded as necessary. This fits the conclusion from a recent review article on the maximal amount of protein that can be used from a single meal.[35] The authors suggest that, to maximize lean body mass, active adults should consume 1.6–2.2 g/kg per day, spread across four meals (0.40–0.55 g/kg per meal).
According to this table, a young 175-pound athlete needs to consume only 19 g per meal. But, as shown in the “Daily protein intake for athletes and other active adults” table, he could benefit from as much as 175 g per day — which translates as nine meals per day! Constantly sipping on a protein shake is an option, but maybe not an optimal one, since the body gets desensitized to the anabolic signaling of protein when intake is too frequent. More realistically, our young 175-pound athlete will simply consume more than 19 g of protein per meal.
For maximal stimulation of muscle protein synthesis, the per-meal dose of quality protein (such as can be found in meat, eggs, and dairy) is at least 0.24 g/kg for adults in their twenties and 0.40 g/kg for adults over fifty. Higher doses will not be wasted and are probably necessary when eating mixed meals that contain a variety of protein sources.

Every general manager who loved Russell Wilson coming into the draft now knows they didn't love him enough to pull the trigger a round early.
Apparently, when the Seahawks drafted him with the 75th pick in the 2012 draft, the first call they received was from a grumpy then-Eagles head coach, Andy Reid. Reid was hoping to snag Wilson 13 picks later.
The Eagles (5-4) take on the Seahawks (6-2-1) in Seattle this Sunday.
"I don't think (Seahawks GM John Schneider) specifically thought the Eagles were any more of a threat than other teams -- I don't know that -- but I know that Andy called us right after the pick, though, and gave John some trouble about it," Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday, via ESPN.com. "They're old friends. But we were really sweating it out. We wanted him the whole way, and John had it figured obviously perfectly for us to get it done. There were a couple other teams that called in right after that, too. Andy was the first guy to call, though. We felt very fortunate."
He added: "(Andy) was just giving John a hard time for taking his guy. Kind of regular banter that happens during the draft."
For the first time in five years, this anecdote won't be followed by the obligatory paragraph on Eagles quarterback woes. While Seattle clearly has the better team and player right now, they face a rookie in Carson Wentz who looks anything but green. Wentz has completed 65 percent of his passes so far for 2,121 yards, nine touchdowns and five interceptions. While his numbers and expectations are coming back to Earth a bit, nothing about the game looks too complicated or grandiose for him.
In that sense, Eagles fans might be able to finally tuck this story away and realize that good things come to those who wait -- and wait and wait and wait. Especially if Wentz can lead an upset bid on the road in the league's toughest stadium to call plays.
They can … but they shouldn't.
That's the message from Alice Roberts, a clinical anatomist, TV personality and professor of public engagement in science at England's University of Birmingham. While advancements in science have made it possible to bring animals back from the dead, Roberts recently argued, it might not be morally right to do so.
[pullquote]
"I would prefer the emphasis to be on saving existing animals under threat of extinction rather than trying to resurrect their long-extinct cousins,” Roberts said, according to a story at International Business Times.
The ethical issues surrounding “de-extinction” of a species were on debate during a March panel at the National Geographic Society.
Speakers include Chris Anderson, curator of the TED Conference talk series, Australian paleontologist Michael Archer and Spanish researcher Alberto FernDandez-Arias, who has worked on cloning a now-extinct goat.
Organizers of the event said dinosaurs aren't among the candidate species -- unlike in the movie "Jurassic Park."
Mammoths might be more realistic anyway: Japanese scientists have already extracted the bone marrow from woolly mammoth remains found in Siberia to look at the DNA, she said. But bringing those creatures may lead to unforseen problems.
"There's something really questionable about bringing back a single mammoth,” Roberts said.
"Mammoths are herd animals and their environment no longer exists, so what are you bringing that animal back for? You're bringing it back to live in a zoo?”
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is looking into possible net neutrality violations by telecom operators in the country, reports The Economic Times. An unnamed senior CCI official told the publication that they're “examining competition concerns that have come up in the light of ongoing debate on net neutrality and telecom companies providing uneven data access to users.” He also mentioned that they will need market evidence to come to a conclusion. The official also added that CCI could intervene if evidence of a dominant player restricting entry of other players in the market surfaces.
Bharti Airtel's soon to be launched Airtel Zero platform is the latest in the series of net neutrality violating moves made by telecom operators in India. Airtel Zero, for which Flipkart is believed to have already signed up, will allow companies to buy data to offer their apps to consumers for free. Zero Rating violates Net Neutrality, something which TRAI had acknowledged in its consultation paper announced last week as well. Interestingly, TRAI Chairman Rahul Khullar has apparently told CNBC Awaaz that Airtel and Flipkart shouldn't have signed a deal while the consultation on Net Neutrality is still on. (Hat Tip: Anuradha Sengupta).

Here's a look at some of the other recent Net Neutrality violating moves by telcos and companies in India:
– In November last year, Airtel had launched a sort of gateway to the web called One Touch Internet, which offered a limited set of services as trial packs to consumers. This is similar to Facebook's Internet.org, which was launched in India in partnership with Reliance Communications, earlier this year.
– Google is, apparently, also discussing the idea of Zero Rating with some app developers about reduction and possible cost elimination of data.
– In December, Airtel had also introduced differential pricing based on type of Mobile Internet usage, but later retracted it after forcing TRAI's hand on Net Neutrality consultation.
– Uninor had started offering its subscribers access to Facebook at Rs 0.5 per hour and Re 1 for a day of WhatsApp, last year. It recently started providing access to Wikipedia sans data charges as well. Interestingly, the telco seems to have a different policy in its own country and a different one for India. More here.
It's not just about differential treatment of web-based services and apps, it's also about speed throttling. Airtel had allegedly throttled speeds for Pritish Nandy Communications backed video streaming service provider Ogle, though the telco had denied it. However, we need to remember that it isn't a completely unheard of thing. Last year, Comcast had allegedly throttled speeds for Netflix customers in the US, a clear violation of Net Neutrality, thereby forcing NetFlix to partner with Comcast.
Last month, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) had asked the Department of Telecom (DoT) to hold public discussions on net neutrality in India, which is a welcome move. Open discussions are ideal as the stakeholders likely to be most affected by it (the customers) need to know how TRAI plans to tackle the Net Neutrality issue. However, we need to take COAI's statement with a pinch of salt, given that the telecom industry body has previously defended telecom service providers' stand against net neutrality.

Federal Government agrees to show trade union royal commission findings to Labor, Greens
Updated
The Federal Government has executed a swift about-face and agreed to show the confidential volumes of the trade unions royal commission to representatives from Labor and the Greens.
Key points: Conditions for crossbenchers to view classified royal commission findings released
Penalties for breaches include fines, jail
Jacqui Lambie says the Government could potentially "game the system"
Government agrees to show documents to one member of Labor, Greens
The Coalition is using the royal commission's report to push for the reinstatement of the construction industry watchdog, the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC).
The volumes of the findings have been kept secret to protect the identities of people who have given evidence to the commission.
But the Government has already agreed to show a redacted version of the confidential volumes of the royal commission to crossbench senators, who have demanded access to them before they vote on the legislation.
Now, Workplace Relations Minister Michaelia Cash said one representative from both Labor and the Greens would also be allowed to view the secret volumes.
"This is all about getting good policy through the Senate," Senator Cash said.
"On that basis we have determined that we will give access to the confidential volumes to one member of the Australian Labor Party and one member of the Greens.
"That's now being worked through as to who that person will be."
It is a quick U-turn from earlier on Monday, when Senator Cash continued to argue that there was no point showing it to either party because they had already decided not to vote for the ABCC.
"Why, then, they would need to have a look at the confidential volumes quite frankly is beyond me. Are they suddenly saying they may change their position and support the Government? I don't think so," she said.
Even though the Government is granting the classified volumes of Commissioner Dyson Heydon's findings a wider audience, there will be strict rules governing the exercise.
The documents must be viewed in the presence of an officer from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and cannot be removed from the room.
Parliamentarians are also not allowed to take notes of photos of the volumes. They cannot discuss the findings with anyone else and could face fines or jail terms if they disclose the material.
Lambie, Lazarus question strict viewing conditions
The conditions, included in the letter from Senator Cash, appear to have angered Tasmanian independent senator Jacqui Lambie.
"What if the Commissioner found in his secret findings that a mate of the Liberal Party was corrupt?" Senator Lambie said in a video posted online.
"This is how the Government can game or corrupt the system, and this is why Senator Cash is looking shifty."
Queensland independent senator Glenn Lazarus said it was too early for him to say what his position would be on the ABCC legislation.
Senator Lazarus said he would meet Senator Cash on Monday afternoon to discuss the ABCC legislation, and hinted he may vote against the legislation if the Government failed to release a redacted version of the royal commission findings to the public.
"I think it's very important that the public understand what we're dealing with," Senator Lazarus said.
"They were the ones that forked out the money to conduct this royal commission. I think they have every right to see what's been going on."
Senator Lazarus also said he would want to bring a staff member to the meeting to inspect the documents.
"I played rugby league for 13, 14 years, copped a lot of whacks around the head, and I think that I need some help in sifting through this volume," he said.
"I would certainly really appreciate being able to bring in my chief advisor to help me understand."

Earlier today, the American Civil Liberties Union went into action, suing the White House on behalf of two would-be refugees detained as a result of President Trump's executive order banning travel into the country from a number of majority-Muslim countries. And while it's easy for people to feel powerless when observing this sort of strife from far away—especially if they're not in a position to attend protests and rallies like the ones happening in Los Angeles and New York tonight—a few big musical names are making it a little easier for people to have their impact felt.
As reported by Pitchfork, musical artists Sia and Grimes have both pledged to match donations made to the ACLU (or the Council on American–Islamic Relations, in Grimes' case), provided pictures are sent to them of the donation receipt. Grimes will match donations made to the organization up to $10,000, while Sia has extended her offer out to $100,000.

But pop's single-named chanteuses aren't the only ones ponying up funds to amplify people's donation dollar; Shark Tank star and celebrity investor Chris Sacca is making a similar offer; he'll match funds up to $150,000, meaning that, for a while least, every dollar someone donates to the ACLU is actually worth $4. (Also, it serves as a pretty good basis for a ”Sia, Grimes, and a Shark Tank guy walk into a bar” joke that we'll presumably write at some later, less depressing date.)
Huge CONGRATS to the Beer Mile winners Liz Herndon and Corey Gallagher!!! #killcliff #beermile pic.twitter.com/gwmT6tRIWz — KILL CLIFF (@KILLCLIFF) December 4, 2014
It sounds like an event at a frat party, but training for the inaugural Flotrack Beer Mile World Championships involved far more running, practicing chugging technique and fitness than just chugging a few brews mid-run.
Corey Gallagher, 27, who won the title with a 5:00.23 finish on Wednesday, said he used a variety of different techniques to prepare to run the mile competitively. He would chug from a beer bottle that he kept at his apartment — which was full of water. And when it came down to championship time, he arrived a week early to test out the different beers to figure out which one was the perfect one.
“I'm one of those people that has an iron gut,” he said. “I can eat a huge supper and go out for a run. It doesn't effect me anymore.”
In the event, competitors are required to drink a beer and run a 1/4-mile lap four times.
Gallagher said he was just relieved that it was over. “I know there's a lot of pressure and hype about it,” he said. “Coming in with the top seed is pretty stressful because there's a target on my back.”
Elizabeth Herndon, 29, who broke the women's record with a 6:17.76 finish, said she pretty much trained the same way as Gallagher, focusing on running rather than drinking.
“I kind of figured (practicing with beer) would be more detrimental to my health than it would be beneficial,” she said.
Though the focus was on the running, the two said they spent a lot of time experimenting with different beers to figure out which one was perfect. At first, Gallagher had wanted to use a local brewery which made a special beer for the beer mile. But the beer was only available in cans — which he said added up to four seconds to chugging time.
He ended up settling on Budweiser Platinum — a beer that has a higher percentage but has a twist off cap and lower carbonation which helped cut seconds from that part of the race — though he has no plans to drink it after the race.
“I love beer. I love just sitting down and sipping a beer and enjoying it, but leading up to this there was none of that because (when I was training) if I'm going to have a beer, I'm going to chug it and that takes the fun out of it.”
Herndon said she and her husband picked a beer by chugging “a few different types of beer to see which ones we liked the best.”
To celebrate her win, Herndon said she went to the bar after the race with some of the other competitors. But the best part?
“Going out and getting a slice of pizza,” she said. “Because I hadn't eaten in nine hours.”
Getting on a train always involves a certain amount of guesswork. You don't know where the train will stop on the platform or where you should stand to get a seat. One car might be full, another nearly empty. Inevitably, you're stuck boarding the former (or running madly for the latter).
In the Netherlands, a new system designed to reduce shuffling on the platform tells riders exactly where to stand to get an open seat. It's a 590-foot-long LED screen that hangs above the train platform and uses intuitive color-coding and symbols to show exactly where to stand to make boarding easier once the train arrives.
“People have no idea they can walk farther to find free seats,” says Joost Holthuis, an Amsterdam-based creative director of the design agency Edenspiekermann (founded by German typographer Erik Spiekermann). “That was our main business case for our project.”
Long, illuminated blocks of blue span the length of each car, marking the space where the cars will pull in (and where the gaps between cars will be). Using information from infrared sensors in the train doors, the sign notes where seats are available–a block of green means that part of the train is empty, orange means semi-crowded, and red means that section is full. A white block with a perpendicular arrow indicates where the door will be once the train stops. Large numbers reveal whether each car is for first or second class, and symbols near the door signs–like a man with his finger to his lips–show where to stand for the quiet car, where you can board with a bike and which entrances are handicap-accessible.
ProRail, the organization that maintains platforms and stations on the national rail network, initially hired Edenspiekermann to come up with a way to speed up the transfer process at rush hour. That way, ProRail would be able to increase the capacity of trains the station could handle each hour. Holthuis* and his team spent three years researching the problem, working to get Dutch Railways (NS)–the state-owned rail service–involved, and coming up with concepts.
The only complaint about the service was that it wasn't implemented in more stations.
“A lot of passengers are quite confused on the platform,” explains Holthuis. “You can't predict where the train will stop, where it's busy. It's very crowded on the platform.” Jostling crowds can be dangerous on a narrow platform, and the signage also reduces the amount of moving around people do, making it a little safer.
A four-month pilot test in 2013 using the system in the Den Bosch railway station in the southern Netherlands proved successful in improving customer satisfaction, according to Dutch Railways. “We saw the people behave just as we wish they do,” Holthuis says. “They waited in line at the place they could expect the doors. There was almost no movement on the platform.” The only complaint about the service was that it wasn't implemented in more stations, he says.
“Aside from Hitler, I do not know who did what George Bush and Tony Blair have done, in the last century or in the end of the last century and the beginning of this century. It is a very bad start for this century when you have people who are not answering for the crime they have committed, and we are talking about sophisticated nations, nations where the rule of law prevails, and they set the standards for the rest of the world.” -Sabah Al-Mukhtar (from this week's interview)

It has been more than 12 years since the Bush Administration and its so-called “Coalition of the Willing” launched their war against the nation of Iraq with devastating consequences for the civilian population.
The decade-long conflict was launched on the pre-text of protecting the US and its allies from “weapons of mass destruction” which could get in the hands of Al Qaeda terrorists.
This pre-text has since been proven to be false.
Today, the majority of Americans accept the idea that the war on Iraq was a mistake. Even the former President's brother and potential Republican candidate for President Jeb Bush is put on the defensive if he attempts to defend the offensive.
The humanitarian disaster that followed the initial invasion serves as a profound indictment of the US Coalition's callous crusade. As of 2009, it was estimated that the Iraq War generated 4.5 million displaced persons, half of whom were refugees, 1-2 million widows, 5 million orphans and about one million dead. This is a tragedy affecting one in two Iraqis. [1]
There have been numerous attempts to hold President Bush and former Prime Minister Blair accountable for their actions in court. They include a September 2005 declaration from the German Court that the Iraq war violated international law, a war crimes complaint filed against former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld in Germany in 2006, a 2007 call from a Spanish Judge for the architects of the war to be put on trial for war crimes, and the ongoing Chilcot Inquiry into the role of the Tony Blair government in the invasion and occupation in Iraq. [2]
As of this writing, the architects of one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of modern times seem to have suffered no punishment whatsoever. In fact, a recent CNN poll registers a resurgence of popularity for the former US President.
Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Blair was recently elevated to the esteemed, and undoubtedly ironic position of chairman of the European council on tolerance and reconciliation!
Is there hope for justice for the Iraqi people?
This week's Global Research News Hour explores the massacre delivered on the people of Iraq and the prospect of one day holding those responsible to account.
Saba Al-Mukhtar is a Iraqi lawyer based in the UK, and President of the Arab Lawyers Association in the United Kingdom. He is a long time critic not only of the 2003 invasion and consequent occupation of Iraq, but also of the previous regime of sanctions which crippled the country. In the first half hour, Al Mukhtar speaks in more detail about the suffering he and is countrymen endured over the last two decades and about the particular culpability of Tony Blair.
Inder Comar is a San Francisco-based attorney. In 2013 he filed a lawsuit on behalf of Iraqi single mother and refugee Sundus Shaker Saleh. The plaintiff alleges that the Iraq war was pre-meditated, planned as far back as 1998, and violated the UN charter as it was not in self defense or authorised by the UN Security Council. Comar is in the process of appealing a December 2014 federal court ruling to dismiss the suit arguing the officials in question were immune from such a suit. Comar is confident, however, that war crimes charges against Bush and five other officials in his Administration will eventually be levelled. He explains his point of view in the second half hour.

Notes:
And in a somewhat happy turn of events, Twitpic has announced that it has reached an agreement with Twitter to keep Twitpic photos and links alive, giving Twitter control over the domain and the full photo archive.
However, the agreement also states that Twitpic will no longer be taking any new photos or data and will exist in a read-only mode. Apps on the App Store and Google Play have been removed, but users will still be able to log in, delete content or the account itself, and export and/or download data.
This comes after a “roller coaster ride” of the past few months. In September, Twitpic founder and CEO Noah Everett announced that the service would shut down after Twitter came after the service over the Twitpic trademark, threatening to remove the service's access to Twitter's API.
“This came as a shock to us since Twitpic has been around since early 2008, and our trademark application has been in the USPTO since 2009,” Everett wrote in a blog post.
Shortly thereafter, rumors circulated that Twitpic might be bought in order to save the service and the data that lives on it, until Everett once again admitted defeat and announced that he had given up on finding acquirers.
It's with a heavy heart that I announce again that Twitpic will be shutting down on October 25th. We worked through a handful of potential acquirers and exhausted all potential options. We were almost certain we had found a new home for Twitpic (hence our previous tweet), but agreeable terms could not be met.
According to the blog post from today, which you can read below, it seems Everett won't be staying on at Twitter or Twitpic.
Today marks the end of a difficult battle for Twitpic, whether it's a happy or sad ending.

Pourquoi pas fêter cette journée de congé avec la quatrième édition de notre liste de 20 faits sur Montréal que vous connaissez peut-être. 20 détails qui vous aideront à en savoir un peu plus votre ville.
Voici les liens vers les 60 premiers faits: 1ère partie, 2e partie, 3e partie.
Le premier véhicule de police motorisé de Montréal était un fourgon Stageman 1913 acheté au coût de 4 443 $. Le dernier véhicule acheté par le SPVM est le blindé à 364 600 $ exactement 100 ans plus tard. (et ils ont des airs de famille) Le beurre d'arachide fut inventé et breveté à Montréal par Marcellus Gilmore Edson en 1884. En parlant d'inventeur, Jacob Schick, celui qui a inventé le rasoir électrique et la compagnie de rasoirs Schick est enterré au Cimetière Mount-Royal. Le Tricolore à une fiche gagnante contre toutes les équipes qu'elle a affrontées à travers les années sauf Columbus. L'Université Concordia de la fusion de l'Université Sir-Geroges-Williams et du Campus Loyola s'est presque nommé l'Université Hochelaga ou l'Université Lester-Pearson. La flamme Olympique pour les jeux de 1976 a été transporté « par satellite » entre Athène et Ottawa et rallumée par laser pour continuer le relais au Canada. le Métro de la STM est le 3e plus occupé en Amérique du Nord après New-York et Mexico City. En 1960 Le Maire Drapeau avait comme plan de faire déménager la Tour Eiffel à Montréal pour la durée de l'Exposition Universelle de 67. De Gaule avait même donné son aval au projet. Les dimensions officielles d'une glace de la LNH de 85′ x 200′ sont les mêmes depuis 1862, soit l'ouverture de la Victoria Skating Rink de la rue Drummond qui a dicté ces grandeurs. Le Centre Bell et le TD Garden de Boston sont les seules aréna dans la NHL à encore utiliser une sirène à la place d'une trompette. Le quart arrière vedette de la NFL et futur membre du temple de la renommé, Tom Brady fut repêcher en 1995 par les Expos de Montréal. Selon les évaluations foncières, la résidence la plus chère de l'île de Montréal d'une valeur de 18,7 millions de dollars se trouve sur le Chemin Belvédère à Westmount et appartient à la Famille Bronfman. La rue de l'île avec le plus haut dénivelé est l'Avenue Clarke de Westmount avec une différence de 113m entre son point le plus haut (158m) et le plus bas (45m) d'altitude. Plus ou moins 1m de plus que le Chemin Camilien-Houde. Le premier établissement connu pour Homosexuels en Amérique du Nord était la boutique de biscuits et de pommes de Moise Tellier de la rue Craig (St-Antoine) en 1869, les hommes pouvaient « se réunir » dans des espaces réservés à l'arrière de la boutique. Il fut arrêté pour avoir tenu un établissement de débauche pour hommes rien de moins! « Misère Abominable » selon l'article du Montreal Evening Star du 8 juin 1869. En 2013 la région de Montréal a été frappé par trois tremblements de terre. (St-Jérôme, Valleyfield, Rigaud). Le plus fort séisme à avoir frappé Montréal a été estimé à 5,8 sur l'échelle de Richter en 1732. Il y a un total de 5617 Km de voies de circulation qui appartenant à la ville. Les usines de filtrations des eaux sur l'île fournies 14 réservoirs pour un total de 893 680 m3 d'eau, soit l'équivalent de 238 piscines olympiques en utilisant 5 200 km de conduite primaires et secondaires. Produite entre 1970 et 1977, Alfa Roméo avait un modèle qui s'appelait la « Montréal » lancé à l'Expo 67 du designer Marcello Grandini (Lamborghini Countach et Diablo, Maserati, Fiat, Renaud). Depuis son assassinat le 26 juin 1879, Mary Gallagher est le fantôme le plus connu de Montréal. La légende veut qu'à tous les sept ans depuis 1879, elle revient hanter Griffintown pour retrouver sa tête coupée par Suzanne Kennedy. Je me demande comment elle va trouver le quartier en 2019 ? Adopté le 22 mars 1985, le Protocole de Montréal est un accord international qui a pour objectif de réduire et éliminer l'utilisation de produits qui endommage la couche d'ozone. Originalement signé par 24 pays en 1987. En 2009, 196 pays sont signataires du Protocole de Montréal, lui permettant ainsi d'être le premier protocole environnemental à atteindre la ratification universelle par tous les pays.

Young South Koreans have different attitudes on family issues, from caring for parents to cohabitation before marriage.
Values and attitudes are changing in South Korea.
Huge structural changes accompanying South Korea's “compressed modernity” or “hyper modernization” have led to stark value and attitude changes across generations. Such changes include everything from attitudes toward the LGBT community, levels of support for unification, and thoughts on income inequality. Because of the historical timing, nature of its development, and the security environment, value change in South Korea has, unsurprisingly, moved along a trajectory different from other industrialized societies.
Direction and pattern of the changes aside, value and attitude changes are afoot. As Christopher Green recently tweeted: “Shifting #attitudes in #ROK; more evidentiary grist for the mill.” The short Joongang Ilbo article cited in Green's tweet reports (in Korean) some of the latest data presented by Statistics Korea and the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Affairs regarding youth attitudes toward important social issues, such as taking care of aging parents and co-habitation.
“Over the last two years, the answer ‘The eldest son and the eldest daughter-in-law should be the main caretakers' [for aging parents] decreased from 4.1 percent to 3.2 percent,” the article reports. Instead, “Among South Korea youth (ages 13-24) four out of five (80.1 percent)” believe that “all children” should share that responsibility.
The article goes on, “Regarding the responsibility to provide for elderly parents, 45.4 percent of South Korean youth think ‘Family, government, and society should care together.' Thirty-eight percent view it as a family responsibility. Over the last two years, the answer ‘Parents must look after themselves' increased from 11 percent to 13.5 percent.”
Most significantly, perhaps, are changing attitudes in an otherwise conservative society toward co-habitation before marriage. “More than half of South Korean youth (56.8 percent) think ‘couples can live together without being married,' the article reports. However, with regards to having children out of wedlock, numbers are still relatively low: “26.4 percent, down from three years ago (25.9 percent), think ‘couples can have children outside of marriage.'”
The article doesn't put the numbers into broader historical context, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. It does, however, show that a traditionally conservative society is changing, and that these changes are occurring within younger generations.
Biological Parenting in the LGBTQ Community
All of us at Triangle Community Center (TCC) are looking forward to our continued collaboration with GayParentsToBe (in partnership with Reproductive Medicine Associates of CT (RMACT)), and to our event on May 30th, Biological Parenting in the LGBTQ Community. For many in the LGBTQ community, the concept that – we too may settle down with our partners in recognized marriages – is new. An even newer concept is the idea of building a biological family with our spouse.
Growing up, I came to expect a typical answer when asking my friends where their families were from. I often heard, “My parents were both raised in NYC, but they decided to move here to CT when they were ready to build a family.” In this way, it was ingrained in me from a young age that Fairfield County was a wholesome and nurturing place to raise children, unlike the raucous streets of one of our world's largest cities. However, like a large portion of Fairfield County's children I was also raised Catholic.
Among the many noble teachings I learned from my religion, I was also taught that there was only one way to “build a family”. As I began to mature, I soon realized that my identity did not fit the requirements my religion had for being a father. I was heartbroken to say the least as I had always envisioned myself with a family of my own. This was in 2004, around the time when the “Marriage Equality Movement” had just started to become a common reference in news and media. There was still little understanding of LGBTQ identities and even less understanding of LGBTQ families.
Eleven years later, many in our community now realize that this idea, which we were taught to believe, is indeed untrue. Not only is our love and marital bond as strong as any other person's or couple's might be, but we have many options when it comes to building a family. The ability to have biological children is among those options.
LGBTQ Parenting Informational Event
This is why I personally believe in the partnership that's been forged. Educating the LGBTQ community about the services that GayParentsToBe offers is an honorable and gratifying mission. Seeing the faces of my peers light up as they begin to understand that they too are capable of creating human life with their loved one is reward enough. I am grateful for the partnership RMACT provides to both TCC and our community. Few organizations go as far as they do to ensure their clients' needs are met at every step of their journey through family building.
On May 30th at 1:30 PM, LGBTQ individuals can access the tools they need to start family planning. It's an informational panel discussion and reception here at the TCC. Get the facts on getting started with Biological Parenting in the LGBTQ Community. RSVP here.
It is my hope that those in the LGBTQ community begin their journey to becoming parents with the educational programming we are able to provide.
DUBLIN — A well-known Irish Catholic priest plans to defy Vatican authorities on Sunday by breaking his silence about what he says is a campaign against him by the church over his advocacy of more open discussion on church teachings.
The Rev. Tony Flannery, 66, who was suspended by the Vatican last year, said he was told by the Vatican that he would be allowed to return to ministry only if he agreed to write, sign and publish a statement agreeing, among other things, that women should never be ordained as priests and that he would adhere to church orthodoxy on matters like contraception and homosexuality.
“How can I put my name to such a document when it goes against everything I believe in,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “If I signed this, it would be a betrayal not only of myself but of my fellow priests and lay Catholics who want change. I refuse to be terrified into submission.”
Father Flannery, a regular contributor to religious publications, said he planned to make his case public at a news conference here on Sunday.
BILLIONAIRE Andrew ‘Twiggy' Forrest has labelled the Greens “the party for paedophiles” for failing to support a cashless debit card for welfare recipients.
Mr Forrest has long supported such a card believing it would stop welfare payments being spent on drugs and alcohol. This week he travelled to Canberra to show Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten CCTV footage of unconscious children being assaulted.
The Greens refused to attend the screening for reasons Mr Forrest dubbed “human rights horsesh*t”.
“I have to hold the Greens accountable here; the Greens might as well be the party for paedophiles, the party for child sex abusers — you're the party of human rights and you've forgotten the human rights of children, just call yourself the party for paedophiles,” he said, according to Fairfax Media. “While we play politics, Bill Shorten, Malcolm Turnbull, the cross benches, kids are dying and the instant someone plays politics, you literally consign another life to being molested, to being abused, to being kept from school, or worse, committing suicide.”
“I'm asking the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition to put wedge politics aside and come out and strongly back the little children in vulnerable communities, because quite literally, while Australia dithers on this, children are dying,” he said. “I want the government to listen to the communities. Governments are flat out listening to everyone else from the community from academics, to green politicians to people who don't go to these communities, don't care about these communities, and reckon they're an authority on them, whereas we should just give the cashless debit card to those communities who are begging for it.”
The cashless welfare card is being trialled at two sites — East Kimberley, WA and Ceduna, SA.
The government has announced plans to expand the trial to two more sites.
The trial has shown a reduction in alcohol and drug abuse and some homelessness but about half of the participants say the card made their lives worse.
Greens senator Rachel Siewert dismissed Mr Forrest's comments.
“Andrew Forrest tends to run bizarre commentary against people who do not agree with his ideas and this is just another example,” she said. “I will not be bullied into supporting the cashless welfare card and will not be dignifying his absurd and offensive comments any further.”

With EA's latest video game, Star Wars Battlefront 2, in hot water over loot boxes, the trend of implementing the hidden gambling feature has increased this year alone.
GiantBomb has listed more than 50 AAA games that have loot boxes. Whether it's a racing or shooting game, your favorite video games may include a variety of these types of micro-transactions. But what are loot boxes?
﻿
Video Games + Gambling = Loot Boxes
Loot boxes typically hold several in-game items that have some function in a game's online multiplayer mode. Like a slot machine, players never know whether a loot box will hold a rare or common item. Usually, players can either choose to save up in-game currency to purchase them, or use real money to buy as many as they please.
Welp, guess I'll never bother playing that garbage. #starwars #starwarsbattlefront2 #battlefront2 #ea #lootboxes #lootboxesaregambling Ein Beitrag geteilt von Holland Oats (@emceelokey) am 15. Nov 2017 um 17:14 Uhr
Originating in mobile games, loot boxes in major video games releases have only recently taken hold of the market, and not without its few shares of complaints. But the real question of the matter is: Are they exploiting gamers, especially children, by using an unregulated and sometimes hidden gambling system?
Loot Box Legality
In the United States, the definition of gambling is based on three qualities. Staking something of value for a chance to win a prize. As such, having all three elements of consideration, chance, and prize is what defines gambling in the country.
Technically, one could argue that this is a way of defining loot boxes. Yet the difference between America and other countries on loot boxes is their regulation. Although the case against loot boxes has yet to be brought up in the States, the chances of that happening appear unlikely at the moment.

However, U.K. and Belgium authorities just recently brought loot boxes under a legal light. Meanwhile, China and Japan see the addictive nature of video games combined with mechanics like loot boxes as violations against consumers. They are creating laws that force companies to disclose probabilities of getting certain items in a game.

ESRB on Loot Box Defense
As promising as the claims against loot boxes are, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) gave a statement in the defense of this new way to play (and pay):
“ESRB does not consider loot boxes to be gambling. While there's an element of chance in these mechanics, the player is always guaranteed to receive in-game content (even if the player, unfortunately, receives something they don't want). We think of it as a similar principle to collectible card games: Sometimes you'll open a pack and get a brand new holographic card you've had your eye on for a while. But other times you'll end up with a pack of cards you already have.”
Many critics were quick to call out the ESRB for their attitude towards loot boxes. Some believe that their defense is not valid or not looking closely at the issue.
Publishers like EA have also come forward, not seeing the inherent similarities of loot boxes and gambling.
Addictive Gaming and Spending
The human mind has shown evidence of high dopamine levels as a result of gambling. The “high” that one feels when winning in casino games explains many of the withdrawal and addictive natures that stem from gambling in general.
“We know that the dopamine system, which is targeted by drugs of abuse, is also very interested in unpredictable rewards,” said Dr. Luke Clark, director at the Center for Gambling Research at the University of British Columbia.
“Dopamine cells are most active when there is maximum uncertainty, and the dopamine system responds more to an uncertain reward than the same reward delivered on a predictable basis,” Clark added.
Games already show evidence of addictive properties. Adding an experience that could be inherently addictive only exploits gamers and especially children in purchasing unnecessary commodities in already costly $60 video games.
Companies like EA, Activision and Microsoft continue to capitalize on loot boxes. Plans for more lucrative systems in order to ensure players eventually buy them will persist. In short: if it ain't broke, why fix it? Especially if there is still more money in it.
“We met on a dating site twelve years ago. I sent her a message saying: ‘I want to let you know up front that I'm in a wheelchair, because I can't hide it.' And she wrote back: ‘Why? Is it bright yellow?'” (x)
Oh, Idunn and Agdar will love Elsa's choice of a cutie pie all right, but Anna will need to have a word with her for hiding that she's rich.
An accident had put Elsa in a wheelchair since 8. That didn't stop her from being a brilliant heir of Arendelle Corp, but it did discourage her from making friends, believing nobody would genuinely care for someone who can't walk.Her parents were worried that she would stay single for life if left alone, so they started putting pressure on her to date someone. They aren't the kind of people who would force their daughter in an arranged marriage though, so they gave Elsa total freedom as long as she will take home a presentable date within 6 months.Not sure where to even begin finding love, but also not wanting to disappoint her caring parents, Elsa half-heartedly went on a dating site. She smartly left out her family's status to avoid gold diggers, no picture either. After a couple months of fruitless search (all men scramble off as soon as they hear ‘wheelchair'), one day Elsa was bored enough to change the parameter of search to include women too. And bam, it immediately matched her up with Anna, a bisexual girl who gave Elsa that witty and kind-hearted response like above.Elsa had never suspected herself to be gay (now that she thought about it, she never found any man appealing, and the fact that she even considered searching for women on a dating site should be a tell-tale sign). She wasn't sure whether her parents would be happy if she took home a girl. But hey, Anna is too adorable and bright and funny and loving and innocent for Elsa to give up.——————

The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; he is their refuge in the time of trouble. The Lord helps them and rescues them…and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
—Psalm 37:39–40 NRSV
We met with the Kafwa health workers in Kasompe, Zambia. They took us on home visits to six clients. What a powerful experience! These incredibly courageous and upbeat people live in extreme poverty with few creature comforts.
To a person they thanked us profusely for visiting their little homes and beamed with pride that “visitors” had taken time to see them.
The Kafwa have an emergency fund provided by HealthEd Connect. It provides critically needed items for their clients. During the last six months, they spent about 90 Zambian dollars and accounted for every Kwacha (currency of Zambia) in a well-kept ledger. The ledger includes an account of the need with the items bought. It touched me that they had arranged transport to the hospital for a client who had no family.
Though the Kafwa workers essentially had done all they could and had placed her in the care of medical professionals, their care and compassion did not end. They took a few of their precious Kwacha from the emergency fund and spent it on bus transportation to the hospital to let their client know she was not alone and forgotten. She passed away while in care. However, she had Kafwa working for her until the end.
Prayer for Peace Comforting God, help us to be comforters, too. May those in need to find refuge in us. May we bring hope to those who cry alone. May we share with them the peace of Christ.
Spiritual Practice: The International Community Find (or imagine) a globe or map of the world. Look at all the nations, and find a country other than your own. Notice the geographic distance between your homeland and this one. Picture a person living there. Pray for this person. Sense God's love connecting you just as the oceans connect the continents. Thank God for the spiritual connection you have with all of God's people around the globe. Ask a blessing on the church as a community sharing Christ's peace, drawing all into the family of God.
Peace Covenant Today, God, I will stay by the side of a person in need, and not leave the person alone.

1 Get brewed coffee. This is just your basic drip coffee you might make at home, but prepared in many different flavors. All Starbucks have multiple brews going during the day, so you can sample several different roasts and blends. A pour-over, where hot water is passed through ground coffee, is also offered; this takes longer but is typically the same price as brewed coffee. Brewed coffee is the cheapest and easiest thing on the menu to order. Some stores may also have a Clover machine, which can brew both core roasts and any reserve coffees stored at the location.
2 Try a latte. Lattes are a basic espresso drink made out of steamed milk and espresso shots. Any flavor can be added to a latte, and any type of milk can be used. Lattes can be made hot or iced.
3 Try an americano. These are one of the most popular drinks for coffee enthusiasts, as the espresso taste is strong. Americanos are made with espresso and water only, and have one extra shot more than any other drink. Cream and sugar can be added just like with drip coffee, as well as any flavor you might like.
4 Try a cappuccino. These are similar to lattes because they are made solely of steamed milk and espresso, but cappuccinos comprise a large amount of foam. This means that your drink will be light and fluffy more than it is liquid. A cappuccino typically comes with approximately equal parts foamed and steamed milk; you may order it as “wet” (not so much foam) or “dry” (mostly foam) to preference. Add any flavors or sugar alterations you would like.
5 Order a caramel macchiato. Macchiato is the Italian word meaning, “marked.” It is used in this drink to describe the mark of espresso poured over the top, instead of being stirred into the drink. Caramel macchiatos are made with vanilla syrup, steamed milk and foam, espresso, and caramel drizzle.
6 Get a mocha. Mochas are lattes (milk and espresso) with the addition of chocolate. The two mocha variants are milk chocolate or white chocolate. The former is a bit richer while the latter is much sweeter. Mochas are typically made without any foam, so if you like the creamy milk ask for a little extra on top.
7 Try a specialty espresso drink. If you are a real espresso lover, order it straight up! Ask for a single or double shot of espresso, and then add a modifier of choice. Often espresso shots are served macchiato style with a dollop of foam, or con panna with a bit of whipped cream. An espresso macchiato may be confused for a caramel or latte macchiato: make sure to specify.
8 Order a tea. If you are not a coffee lover, try getting one of the many teas available. Most teas are made with hot water, but there are several latte teas made with milk. These include the ever-popular chai tea (spicy cinnamon flavored tea) and the London fog (a sweet vanilla and Earl Grey tea blend). You can order any tea to be made with milk or water, and hot or iced.
9 Get a frappuccino. Frappuccinos are blended drinks, typically made with coffee. Starbucks offers many specialty Frappuccinos, so ask your barista what ones are offered if you don't see them on the menu. Some Frappuccinos, like the strawberries and cream, aren't made with any coffee. These often come with whip and a drizzle of chocolate or caramel.
10 Try other non-coffee drinks. If you are not interested in coffee or tea, don't worry - there are several other non-coffee drinks available at Starbucks. For hot drinks you can get hot chocolate, a steamer (milk with a syrup flavor), or an apple cider. You can also do lemonade or different smoothies if you want something cold and coffee-free.
On July 21, 1865, frontier legend Wild Bill Hickok gunned down gambler Davis Tutt in what is often called the first “Wild West” showdown.
James Butler Hickok arrived in Springfield, Missouri, in the summer of 1865, fresh off a stint as Union scout and spy during the Civil War. The 28-year-old Illinois native was already known locally as “Wild Bill,” but there was little at the time to distinguish him from the countless other would-be gunslingers and cardsharps drifting through the American frontier. That would all change on July 21, when Hickok strode out to meet a former Confederate soldier named Davis Tutt in the Springfield city square. The duel that followed vaulted “Wild Bill” to national fame.
Wild Bill Hickok
Just how Hickok and Tutt came to be glaring at one another down the barrels of their six-guns is not entirely clear. Both men were known to haunt Springfield's poker rooms and saloons as semi-professional gamblers, and some witnesses claimed the pair had once been friends. The bad blood may have originated in a dispute over the affections of a lady, but it's also possible that lingering Civil War tensions were to blame. Some reports even alleged that Hickok had killed one of Tutt's friends during the war.

Whatever the source of the enmity, the Hickok-Tutt feud finally boiled over on July 20, 1865. That night, Hickok was playing poker at the Lyon House hotel when Tutt confronted him about a $35 debt from a previous card game. Hickok countered that the sum was only $25 and said he had a “memorandum” in his jacket pocket to prove it, but Tutt was unconvinced. He snatched Hickok's beloved Waltham pocket watch off the felt and declared he would hold it as collateral until the debt was settled. When Hickok protested, he also threatened to flaunt the timepiece in the town square the next day. A seething Wild Bill warned that Tutt wouldn't manage the stunt unless “dead men can walk.”

Hickok and Tutt spent most of the next day arguing over the watch and the poker debt, but according to witnesses, neither man seemed particularly eager to “slap leather” against the other. The former pals even tried to settle the dispute over a glass of whiskey before Tutt grew frustrated and stalked away. Sometime around 6 p.m., Tutt reappeared near the Springfield courthouse wearing Hickok's watch. Wild Bill walked out to meet him from across the town square, his hand dangling next to one of the Colt Navy revolvers strapped to his sides. “Dave,” he warned, “Don't you come across here with that watch.” Tutt ignored him and began sauntering in Hickok's direction, his hand hovering over his own gun. “Dave, don't come any closer!” Hickok shouted. As the two men inched to within 75 yards of one another, they suddenly drew their pistols and took aim.
A rendering of the Hickok-Tutt shootout from Harper's Magazine.
“At that moment you could have heard a pin drop in that square,” witness Richard Bentley Owen later recalled. “Both Tutt and Bill fired, but one discharge followed the other so quick that it's hard to say which went off first.” In the end it didn't matter who was faster on the draw. Tutt's shot flew harmlessly over Wild Bill's head, while Hickok's bullet found its mark. Some accounts say he let Tutt shoot first and then fired his own weapon after steadying it on his left hand. “Bill never shoots twice at the same man,” Owen noted, “and his ball went through Dave's heart.” After gurgling, “Boys, I'm killed,” Tutt staggered a few steps toward the courthouse and fell dead. The bloody exchange had lasted just a few seconds.
Hickok was arrested shortly after the showdown and charged with manslaughter, but he managed to post bail with the help of Owen and a few others. At his trial in early August, Tutt's allies testified that Wild Bill had approached their friend with his gun already out and shot him in cold blood. Hickok's supporters countered that Tutt drew first and that both men fired simultaneously. As evidence, they presented Tutt's pistol, which was missing a single bullet from its chamber. The gun was enough for frontier justice to carry the day. Believing the showdown to be a fair fight, the jury found Wild Bill innocent after only a few minutes of deliberation.
However pointless it might have been, the killing of Davis Tutt would prove to be Hickok's ticket to Old West stardom. A few weeks after the standoff in the market square, Colonel George Ward Nichols arrived in Springfield and wrote a story about Wild Bill for Harper's New Monthly Magazine. The article's account of the Tutt shooting was only mildly exaggerated, but other sections painted Hickok as a walking tall tale. Nichols wrote that Wild Bill had killed 100 men; that he'd once singlehandedly fought off a gang of 10 bandits; and that he rode a seemingly magical horse that obeyed his every command. When the story went to print in February 1867, it immediately became a bestseller. Gushing accounts of Wild Bill's exploits appeared in several major newspapers, and dime novelists capitalized on the public interest by penning such titles as “Wild Bill, the Indian Slayer” and “Wild Bill's First Trail.”

The Harper's story made Hickok the most famous man on the frontier, and he spent the next few years adding to his legend while working variously as a wilderness scout, lawman, “Wild West” show performer and gambler. He was involved in a few more shootouts in Kansas and Texas, but it was his duel with Davis Tutt that truly entrenched itself in the lore of the Old West. Similar “quick-draw” showdowns became a staple of dime novels, and they later found their way into legions of big screen Westerns such as “High Noon” and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.”
As Wild Bill's own death would eventually prove, the realities of frontier violence were usually much less glamorous. In August 1876, Hickok joined a poker game at the No. 10 Saloon in the rugged mining town of Deadwood, South Dakota. The aging desperado had a habit of sitting against the wall to prevent anyone from getting the drop on him, but on that day the only open chair had left him with his back facing the door. While Hickok gazed down at his cards—supposedly two pairs of aces and eights—a man named Jack McCall crept up behind him and shot him in the back of the head at point blank range. Wild Bill was dead before he ever had a chance to reach for his gun.

Ed note: This has been cross-posted from healthcare.gov
October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month – a time to remember those who have lost their lives to breast cancer and those who are battling it now, and to celebrate with those who have survived. It is also a time to reaffirm our commitment to fighting breast cancer and to remind ourselves of the importance of prevention and early detection.
In recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I had the privilege of joining actress Jennifer Aniston, who recently directed a new Lifetime Original movie exploring a family affected by breast cancer, Dr. Jill Biden, and a small group of breast cancer survivors, providers and others, to discuss lessons learned from those who have been treated for breast cancer. We also talked about how important it is to coordinate health care, so we can do more to treat and prevent breast cancer.
Breast cancer remains one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers among American women and despite remarkable advances in treatment and prevention, it remains the second leading cause of cancer death.

Regular mammography screenings help ensure that breast cancer does not take the lives of more women. The chance of successful treatment is highest when breast cancer is detected early. However, only about 67 percent of women aged 40 or older have had a mammogram in the last two years. If 90 percent of women 40 and older received breast cancer screening, 3,700 lives would be saved each year. Yet in a time when budgets are tight, costs – even moderate co-pays – deter many patients from receiving these important screenings.
Thanks to the health reform law, the Affordable Care Act, most private health plans and Medicare now cover women's preventive health care – such as mammograms and screenings for cervical cancer –with no co-pays or other out-of-pocket costs. This means that women can get services they need to detect or prevent breast cancer before it spreads or becomes fatal, without worrying that they'll have to pay for these services out of their own pockets. This year to date, 3.8 million women in traditional Medicare have gotten a free mammogram.
In addition to regular mammography screenings, there are steps that women can take that may reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Women should talk with their doctor about their personal risk for breast cancer, when to start having mammograms, and how often to have them. If they are found to be at increased risk of breast cancer because of medical or genetic history, they should talk with their doctor to decide what the best options are to reduce their breast cancer risk. With the release of the new Women's Preventive Services Guidelines, a well-woman visit is available so women have the opportunity to discuss their health care needs with their medical provider—at no additional cost.
Women also have new rights and protections against insurance company abuse under the Affordable Care Act. If diagnosed with breast cancer or another illness, women are now protected from having their coverage taken away if they get sick and when they need coverage the most.
The health reform law is also helping women who are going, or have gone through, costly breast cancer treatment. Today, insurance companies can't impose lifetime limits on coverage. And in most health plans, annual limits will be restricted. This means that your health insurance will be there right with you, covering your treatments, as long as you need it.
Beginning in 2014, it will be illegal for insurance companies to discriminate against anyone with a pre-existing condition. In the past, insurance companies could deny coverage to women due to pre-existing conditions such as breast cancer, and if coverage was attained, insurance companies set lifetime and annual limits on what the companies would spend for benefits.
These changes are making real differences in the lives of American women and families. Prevention, coupled with continued research, will help save more lives and improve the quality of life for all of us touched by breast cancer.
Election 2016: What are our leaders really thinking about climate change?
Updated
Climate change, and the policies to slow its impact, have dominated the last few election cycles in Australia. But it has barely rated a mention at the start of this campaign.
So what do our leaders really think about climate change? That question was on the mind of one curious Australian, who asked ABC News to investigate.
For the purposes of this exercise, let's focus on the leaders of the two competing major parties and the Greens.
Of course, it's impossible to know what Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and Greens Leader Richard Di Natale are really thinking.
But we can look at what each of them have said on the issue, what their policy positions are, and how they have changed over time.
Our questioner may be pleased to learn that both Mr Turnbull and Mr Shorten consider climate change a real phenomenon, caused by human activity.
In a 2010 speech from Mr Turnbull, then a humble opposition backbencher, he said that science shows "we have already exceeded the safe upper limit for atmospheric carbon dioxide".
"We are as humans conducting a massive science experiment with this planet," he said. "It's the only planet we've got. We are dealing in scientific terms with enormous uncertainty. "There is a tendency for people to point to the forecasts for the future, sea levels, temperatures, other impacts of climate change and say, 'oh well, they've over egged the pudding a little bit, it's probably going to be less dramatic than that'. "But we are dealing with uncertainty and it may well be and indeed there is considerable evidence, that it may well be that many of these forecasts that we've become so used to, in fact err on the conservative side."
Mr Shorten, in an address to the Lowy Institute last November, echoed similar sentiments, calling climate change "a crisis unprecedented in human history".
"It is an existential threat — a matter of survival. A violation of basic human safety and basic human rights," he said. "The islands of the Pacific will be first affected, but no country is immune. "Australia can benefit if we take action on climate change. Australia has a lot to lose if we do not. "The global temperature is rising and human activity is the cause. The proof is irrefutable."
The regional impacts of climate change are also a key focus for Mr Di Natale.
This topic featured heavily in a foreign policy speech he delivered to the Lowy Institute this week.
"This isn't just about preserving our environment, or transforming our economy, but as the American defence force has said, it is about protecting our national security as well," he said. "The impact of global warming is going to fundamentally change the character of our foreign relationships. "The science is crystal clear - we have to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, preferably 1.5 degrees to avoid catastrophic climate change. And to get this done is going to require an unprecedented commitment. "To fail on this front means unprecedented global and regional instability."
So on the science of climate change, one could argue there's little separating the leaders. So how does that translate into action?
What should Australia do?
Here's where the differences start to emerge.
While the major parties support global action committed to at the Paris talks, each has a strikingly different idea of what Australia's contribution should be, and how those emissions reductions should be achieved.
Mr Turnbull has agreed to continue Tony Abbott's target of reducing carbon emissions by up to 28 per cent by 2020, based on 2005 figures.
Mr Shorten's Labor Party has adopted far more ambitious figures — a 45 per cent reduction target by 2030, with an ambition to reach a "net zero" of emissions by 2050.
Senator Di Natale has chosen the most rapid path to lower emissions — up to an 80 per cent reduction by 2030, and "net zero" by 2040.
It's a similar story when it comes to renewable energy targets.
The Coalition has a target for 23.5 per cent of Australia's electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020, when the target will be reviewed.
Labor has already committed to a longer term target — of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030.
The Opposition Leader has been arguing the case that Australia will not meet its global responsibility if it persists with the Coalition's climate targets.
"We are the 13th largest polluter in the world, with the highest emissions per person in the OECD. And despite Liberal government accounting chicanery, our domestic emissions are going up, not down," he told the Lowy Institute.
For his part, the Prime Minister argues increasing the emissions target would burden the economy, without necessarily reducing global emissions.
"For Australia to go out on its own and nearly double its target … would impose a huge cost on Australians and would abandon the leverage we have to get a stronger global response," he said.
You can read more about the competing policies of the Liberals, Labor and the Greens on their websites.
How will they achieve the targets?
This is where the fractious debate surrounding climate change gets really heated.
With Mr Turnbull as Opposition Leader, Australia came close to reaching a bipartisan consensus on an emissions trading scheme (ETS) as the most effective mechanism to reduce pollution.
But it wasn't to be. Mr Turnbull was rolled by Mr Abbott in a leadership contest, with Mr Turnbull's support for an ETS a key driver of discontent in the Coalition.
From the Opposition backbenches, Mr Turnbull didn't hold back when describing his successor's climate policy.
"The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is "crap" and you don't need to do anything about it," he said.
"Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing."
The policy that was adopted, and later implemented by then prime minister Abbott — so-called "Direct Action" — will see $2.55 billion in incentives paid to polluters to reduce their emissions.
Critics argue it will cost many billions more to be effective, because it doesn't cap the total amount of emissions.
Now, as Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull has a different take on its effectiveness.
He told reporters, "We have moved from ideology in the climate change debate, to one of practical negotiation and outcomes".
But the Liberal leader isn't the only one to negotiate a policy shift.
After supporting a temporarily fixed carbon tax in government, Labor is now promising not one, but two emissions trading schemes.
One would cover the electricity industry. Labor argues its design would allow the scheme to operate "without a significant impact on absolute price levels faced by consumers".
The other scheme would measure polluters' emissions against individually predetermined baselines.
The government would not set a price on carbon, but companies who exceed their pollution caps would be required to purchase domestic or international permits to offset any emissions beyond the baseline.
The Coalition counters that Labor's scheme would increase electricity prices and put an increased burden on everyday Australians.
The Greens are proposing a more dramatic approach — to stop any new or expanded coal or gas mines. Miners would also lose access to diesel fuel rebate.
The Greens are seeking to reintroduce a carbon price. But unlike the scheme adopted by the Gillard government, there would be no free permits.
Senator Di Natale says that means coal and gas exporters would have to pay the full cost of the greenhouse gases that leak from their mining operations.
The Greens also want to impose a $3 per tonne levy on coal exports, using the proceeds to help fund the transition to clean energy, prepare for natural disasters and to provide climate finance to developing nations.
Who to believe?
With such shifting positions between, within and around the major parties, it's no wonder our curious Australian wants to know what our leaders really believe on climate change.
Ultimately, that's for them to know, and for our questioner to judge.

“There are 2 ways to learn antenna design. One way is to go to grad school. I'll teach you the other way”
-A mentor of mine
Engineers love to refer to wireless as ‘black magic'. Which is partly true. But with the right tools and the willingness to fuck it all up (a few times), you'll be making your mark on the 2.4GHz band in no time. This guide is a ‘Trial and Error' approach to antenna design. It won't be perfect, and won't cover a lot of the ‘hard' topics. You probably won't even feel smart after reading it. You may even feel a little dirty. But you WILL be able to design an antenna to ‘good enough' standards, for 2.4GHz communication (wifi, zigbee, ANT+, etc).
The basic procedure looks like this:
Pick an IC Look at the Datasheet of your chip, find the example layout section Does your application have physical size limitations? Does your Antenna have to be directional? Use the answers to the above questions to choose your antenna type (whip, wire, chip, PCB trace) Design your PCB layout based on the example layout. Size the feedline for your application Build some boards Test the antenna with an SMA connector and a spectrum analyzer, if possible. (in your enclosure if you're using one) Use your testing results to correct your design
Pick an IC
There are a lot of good ones out there. This guide is tailored to 2.4GHz band communications, which includes Zigbee, ANT+, Bluetooth, and other Zigbee alternatives. Most wireless sensors these days are based around 2.4GHz.
Choosing your chip will be determined mostly by:
1) What's already out there, and has been used a lot before. (Do some googling)
2) What protocol you want to use
3) Power requirements / range
Most of my experience is with a low power (~3mW transmit power) ANT+ chip, one of the nRFAP series from Nordic Semi. A lot of this content is a product of designing the electronics of PedalBrain, a kick ass iPhone cycling computer. I've also done some Zigbee work with 20mW transmit power for a hobby project.
Single Ended vs Differential
There are two different output types: Single ended and Differential. In this guide we will be designing an antenna for a Single Ended output. This means we only have one antenna trace that couples with ground. A differential output would require two antenna traces. However, a differential output can be converted to an single ended output with some passive inductors and capacitors. The below images show an example of a chip that is differential converted to single ended.
Follow the Examples
Most ICs will have a section in their datasheet which shows you a general layout, that should work. It pisses me off that they rarely include dimensions, and almost never have actual layout files. Ces't la vie. If it was easy then everybody could be this cool.
The nRFLO1+ datasheet gives Example schematics:
Notice that the output of the chip is actually differential but the matching components convert it to a single-ended output. Essentially this allows you to use one antenna and make things smaller. When people say ‘matching components' they are referring to the passive parts (on the above picture, L1,L2,L3,C5,C6) that take the impedance at the chips output pin, and mash it into a nice 50 ohm output that you can match your antenna to.
The nRFLO1+ also has an example BOM! How generous! Those kind Norwegians.
And now an example layout.
Crappy Examples
The examples vary a lot. Take for example, the example layout of Nordics nRFAP1 chip, which gives you tiny, grainy, examples and doesn't event mention an antenna. See that little thing sticking off on the right? That's your feedline- hook it up to an antenna. With this chip they don't give much guidance, but we'll figure it out.
Antenna Types
The basic options are:
PCB Trace. The guide will cover this type of antenna. PCB trace antennas are a good compromise between performance, repeatability, size, and cost. They are easy to tune. We will cover tuning later on.
SMA connector to external whip antenna (not covered in this guide) External whip antennas (also known as ducky antennas) are typically a bit larger, but are a good choice if you have the room. They are typically pre-tuned to a certain output frequency. These have good performance, the only drawback being their physical size.
Wire Monopole antenna (not covered in this guide) Wire antennas are easy. Just cut a piece of wire to approximately the size of 1/4th the wavelength (or 5/4, or 9/4, etc) At 2.4GHz this is roughly 30mm. The downside to wire antennas? The performance will vary greatly with small changes in length and shape of the antenna. I used a wire antenna for my first wireless project and it carried about 40-50 feet under good conditions.
Chip Antenna (not covered in this guide) RF engineers seem to hate chip antennas- they work ‘for almost no apparent reason' and can be hard to tune. From what I've seen, they are great in that they are tiny, but can be detuned easily. If you don't have to transmit very far and need a tiny footprint, they'll work fine. Make sure to include some matching components in your design so that you can tune the output. (More on this later)
Designing the Antenna
**Don't put any ground plane beneath the tail of your F Antenna!
**Put a note on the silkscreen layer, or any other layer your Mfg will see, and tell them the antenna section of the board is sensitive to added copper! Advanced Circuits will sometimes etch an order number into the copper on your board. This will change the properties of your antenna!
Standard Dimensions:
I started with an F Antenna that had a 1″ long tail, tapped 1/4″ from the left, with a 1/4″ section going to the ground plane. See the below picture for those dimensions again. The length of the feed line doesn't really matter. The width of the feed line does. See the section further down on how to size the feedline.
On my first antenna build, I decided to build a board with several designs on it, and then test each one and pick the top performer. However, I think you can get by with an F Antenna, and only building one.
Sizing the Feedline
The trace that connects your antenna to the output of your matching circuitry is called a feed line. You want to design this to be 50 Ohms at your desired transmit frequency. The width of the trace dictates the impedance- you can use the following link to calculate your trace width. You'll want to use these parameters for a standard 1 oz thickness, FR4 circuit board. You can calculate other values here:
http://emclab.mst.edu/pcbtlc2/microstrip/index.html
Dialectric thickness: Typically 62 mils (0.062 inches). In my case it was 31 mils.
Trace thickness: for a 1oz thick copper PCB, usually 1.4 mils or 0.0014″.
Trace Width: Leave this blank so it calculates it.
Relative Permittivity: 4.8
Characteristic Impedance: 50
With my values, with a non-standard thickness board (31 mils thick), I arrived at 55 mils. For a standard thickness board (62 mils), it would be roughly 108 mils.
The Ultimate Rule – Impedance Matching
As a practical engineer, our biggest rule to adhere to is ‘impedance matching'. We have a chip that sends out a signal, and we want to turn that electrical signal into a wireless signal (an EM field). Our chip and antenna have characteristics that define their impedance. If those impedances are equal, or matched, we are putting as much power into the wireless signal as we can. This is known as ‘optimal power transfer'. If we aren't perfectly matched, we will have some power loss. You can google ‘impedance matching' for the theory behind this.
We can't change the output impedance of the chip, but we can alter the impedance of the antenna, and we can put some parts in between the chip and the antenna, collectively forming a ‘matching network'. These parts can be used to change the impedance of the antenna so that it matches the impedance of the chip. The most common arrangement of parts is known as a Pi Network. If your example layout does not have matching components present; they do not show anything on the output pin of the chip, you will want to include these yourself. A Pi Network is shown below:
(Read this great App Note for more detailed info: http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snoa519b/snoa519b.pdf)
Tuning your Antenna
This is typically done with a network analyzer, one ridiculously expensive piece of equipment. They can be rented by the month for around a thousand bucks, but my recommendation is to make friends with someone at a local company that owns one. Or if you're a university student, you can usually find a professor willing to let you in their lab for a little while. Another option is to find a local design firm, and ask if you can rent out their equipment per hour. Expect 60-100$/hr for the time on the equipment, and more than that if you want one of their engineers to help out. However, if you're young and passionate about your project, people will usually try to help you out.
A network analyzer measures the properties of a network of components. You hook it up to your system (in our case, our antenna) and it uses a variety of techniques to determine the impedance of the network. They typically have 2 ports, although our tuning will be done with only one port, since we will be simply sending in a signal, and seeing how much power is bouncing back. We can deduce from this how much power has been converted into wireless energy.
The below measurements were taken with a network analyzer. At this point we actually aren't measuring any wireless signals, or wireless power, etc. Instead the Network Analyzer (NA) is measuring how much power is reflected by the antenna at various frequencies. If all the power is being reflected, none is being converted into EM energy. The lower the number here, the more efficient we are. At -10dB we are roughly 70% efficient. At -20dB we are 90% efficient.
So let's get ready to tune.
Step 1, espresso:
Step 2, calibrate the NA for a one port measurement.
This is done with a calibration kit provided w/ the NA. You hook up a shorted end, an open end, and a 50 ohm end in succession. Keep in mind the shape of the cable attached will affect your results, so calibrate it with that in mind. Once you calibrate to a certain shape of the cable, test your antenna with that same shape. This is often done by taping the cable down to the table to hold shape.
Step 3, solder an SMA connector to your antenna.
To do this I had to drill a small hole through the board where the feed line began. I then scratched off the solder mask on a small portion of the feed line, and in several places on the bottom ground plane of the board. I stuck the SMA connector through the hole and soldered it up.
An Edge Mount SMA connector- J657-ND
Vertical Mount SMA connector- J500-ND
Step 4: Hook it up, start hacking away
PCB Trace Antennas, more specifically the F-Antenna (also called PIFA), is a simple antenna to tune. Everything can be done by varying the length of the tail. This is accomplished by slicing your antenna to various lengths with an exacto knife. Don't you love working on hardware? If you think about it, it makes total sense. If you make the antenna shorter, your resonant frequency will have a shorter wavelength, and therefore a higher frequency. So cutting your antenna shifts it up in frequency. This is why you want to design your antenna long to begin with, since it's much easier to cut it than to add on to it. If you do have to go down in frequency, you can actually add copper tape, although the barrier between your PCB trace and the copper tape will often throw off your results. Rule of thumb, on your first design, make the antenna a bit longer than it needs to be. Then you can try different sizes easily.
On the plots, the vertical lines represent the band we are operating in. Ideally we want the trough close to our center frequency, 2.45GHz.
First measurement, with the full antenna:
Second measurement:
Third measurement
Fourth:
Fifth:
Sixth:
Important thing to remember- everything surrounding your antenna will affect the performance. This means your case, battery, wires, connectors, a user's hand, etc. The trace above and below are measured with the same exact size of antenna, but the trace below has a plastic case and battery in place. Notice the difference:
Seventh:
Finally, the eight and final measurement. Close enough to be happy.
Smith Charts
Power loss is one way to look at our antenna, but another common method to visualize the parameters of an antenna is called a Smith Chart. Here is an example of a big scary looking smith chart:
Basically a smith chart is a convenient way to picture real and complex impedances on one graph. Note that the impedances are normalized, typically to 50 ohms. This means that your true impedance is found by multiplying the magnitudes on the chart by 50. Every network of components has a real and complex characteristics which define their impedance. The real part of the impedance is noted by the expanding circles, whose diameter is noted along the horizontal line in the middle of the smith chart. The imaginary part is noted by the lines that bend away from the horizontal line. Together, where they intersect, forms a point on the smith chart which represents the impedance. The top half of the smith chart represents an inductive impedance and the bottom half represents a capacitive impedance.
A network analyzer can display a smith chart as well as the power loss we did before. We are shooting for 50 ohms impedance, but chances are we will be a bit off. The below image (from a National Semi app note) shows how to get closer to 50 ohms by changing values of the matching components we added before:
From what I've seen, if your chip's datasheet has a good section on your example layout, and gives you values for matching components, you probably won't need to worry about smith charts. So all is not lost if none of this makes sense. However, smith charts will help you fully understand what is happening.
Hooray! We're done. Everyone's happy. Reward yourself with a little network analyzer Mario:
FCC/CE Testing
If you're going to make more than a few (I believe the official number is 5) of your design, you will have to get FCC (or CE for Europe) certified or your device can be taken off the market. If you plan on only making small batches, using a wireless module that is already FCC certified might be a better solution.
My most recent design for PedalBrain was FCC and CE certified without any major problems. There were hiccups along the way, but we were able to bring the output power down a bit to pass the tests. This is, however, an expensive exercise, so do your best to avoid it.
Email me if you use this guide, I would be happy to see what you come up with. Also email with questions if you run into problems. You can reach me at my first name DOT my last name (hint, they are in the domain) @gmail.com
Now go build some stuff!

SÖDERTÄLJE. Södertälje Kings var illa ute mot Norrköping Dolphins.
Men i den sjunde och avgörande finalen säkrade de regerande mästarna andra raka guldet.
–Vi grävde ett dödshål, men kom tillbaka som kungar, säger Toni Bizaca.
Norrköping Dolphins sumpade chansen att vinna SM-guldet på hemmaplan i torsdags. I stället tvingade Södertälje Kings fram en sjunde och avgörande match i Täljehallen.
Och på hemmaplan kunde de regerande mästarna försvara sitt guld.
– Det är ett mer än underbart slut på säsongen. En sjunde match hemma i full hall och nu två guld i rad, säger Toni Bizaca till MVP för andra året i rad.
Norrköping hade dock greppet om den första perioden, men med minuten kvar tog Södertälje ledningen.
Hemmalaget, ledda av Martin Pahlblad och John Roberson,behöll greppet i den andra perioden. Efter ett fempoängsspel kom Dolphins dock tillbaka till 38-38. Men i stället för att ta tillbaka kommandot var det Kings som drog ifrån.
48-40 i paus
Efter två treor av Mantas Griskenas och Toni Bizaca (stjärnans första poäng i matchen) kunde Södertälje gå till halvtidsvila med 48-40.
Kings utökade ledningen och inför den sista perioden hade de regerande mästarna en elvapoängsledning, 65-54, mycket tack vare Roberson.
– Jag hade en bra första halvlek sen är det så skönt att han bara går in och tar över, säger Pahlmblad.
Dolphins krympte Södertäljes ledning till fyra poäng med far minuter kvar. Men närmare än så kom de aldrig. Kings vann till slut med 92-80 och precis som i fjol blev Roberson en av de stora hjältarna.
– Jag är ingen hjälte. Om det inte vore för mina lagkamrater och coacherna hade vi inte varit här. Jag försöker bara göra mitt bästa, säger han.
– Det är en helt otrolig känsla. Att få göra det här på hemmaplan inför den här publiken. Vi hade inte klarat det utan dem.

LONDON — The results from the Bank of England's latest health check on Britain's top banks are in, with one bank failing, one coming razor close to failing and a third looking bad enough at the end of 2013 to warrant significant fund-raising.
The central bank said on Tuesday that the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Lloyds Banking Group and the Co-operative Bank would not have had sufficient capital in 2013 to comfortably weather its hypothetical financial storm, although it added that Lloyds had raised enough capital this year to be considered out of danger.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, which just barely passed the test, submitted a revised capital plan during the process announcing its intention to raise £2 billion, or about $3.13 billion, in debt capital that can convert to equity to bolster its position.
Only the Co-operative Bank completely failed the test, as was widely expected. The bank was required to submit to the Bank of England a new capital plan, which was approved. Under that plan, it will reduce its risky assets by £5.5 billion by the end of 2018.
“This was a demanding test,” the governor of the Bank of England, Mark J. Carney, said in a news release. “The results show the core of the banking system is significantly more resilient, that it has the strength to continue to serve the real economy even in a severe stress.”
The stress tests were published at the same time as the bank's semiannual Financial Stability Report, which provides an overview of the strength of the financial system. In the report, the bank said the global economic outlook has worsened since its first-half review, and concerns about geopolitical risk and weak growth have risen.
Mr. Carney said the most important risks to global stability were international, noting that while the sharp decline in oil prices should help the British economy, it could pose risks to financial stability.
The banks, however, are in better shape to cope with any headwinds, Mr. Carney said.
The stress test found that core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of banks' ability to weather financial shocks, across the eight institutions would be reduced to a low of 7.3 percent in 2015 from 10 percent in 2013.
The tests are intended to assure investors that the banks can survive the sort of financial storm that brought them to their knees in 2008 and that required billions of dollars in taxpayer support.
The examination was performed on seven banks and one building society: Co-Operative Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Santander UK, Standard Chartered, and the Nationwide building society. The last five of those institutions were found to have no problems.
The Bank of England assessment came less than two months after the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority tested the health of Europe's banks against a future financial shock.
The E.C.B. test, known as an asset quality review, focused on 130 banks in the 18-member euro currency bloc, while the authority's test also included banks in Britain, Sweden and other European Union countries that do not use the euro. In the European Banking Authority's stress test, 14 banks fell short of the capital requirements and were ordered to add capital. None of those banks were in Britain, and several had already raised capital in anticipation of the review.
The Bank of England's tests were intended to measure reactions to more country-specific risks, namely the levels of indebtedness in Britain and the dominant role housing plays in its economy.
The situation the Bank of England used in its hypothetical crisis was dire: The British pound plummets 30 percent amid growing fears about the country's debt. The fall-off causes inflation to rise to 6.5 percent in early 2015. The central bank responds by raising rates, and 10-year government bonds yields peak just below 6 percent. Real gross domestic product falls to 3.5 percent below its third-quarter 2013 level, unemployment hits 12 percent and home prices fall 35 percent. Commercial real estate collapses 30 percent and over the three years, bank profits would be reduced by £90 billion.
Under those conditions, the central bank examined what would happen to the banks' core Tier 1 capital ratios in the event of a housing crisis and a financial downturn. It then considered plausible actions the banks would take, and how capital levels would react.
The Royal Bank of Scotland reported core Tier 1 capital of 10.8 percent. In the shock scenario, that would fall to 4.6 percent, just above the 4.5 percent threshold deemed by the Bank of England as prudent. R.B.S. said it could take action to raise that figure to 5.2 percent.
“We recognize that there is still much work to be done to improve the resilience of our balance sheet,” said Ewen Stevenson, the chief financial officer at the Royal Bank of Scotland. Taking into account further potential conduct and litigation settlements and redress, he said the bank remained on track to reach its core Tier 1 capital ratio targets of 11 percent by the end of 2015 and at least 12 percent by the end of 2016.
Lloyds's most recently reported core Tier 1 capital figure was 12 percent. It was estimated that it would fall to 5 percent in the crisis scenario and would increase to 5.3 percent with management action.
The Co-Operative Bank's most recent Tier 1 capital figure was 11.5 percent. In the stress scenario, its capital would be depleted, the bank said. In a bid at transparency, the bank calculated the ratio, which came in at negative 2.6 percent, regardless of what management would do.
Neil Williamson, co-head of EMEA Credit Research at Aberdeen Asset Management, noted that Lloyds and RBS did better than they had on the European stress test because their 2014 capital-raising efforts were taken into account. “The clean-up of their balance sheets has resulted in a more comfortable result under the U.K. test,” he said.
The central bank also performed a qualitative assessment of the eight lenders' stress-testing and capital-planning frameworks, which produced mixed results. “There was a wide variation in banks' ability to provide accurate data and in the strength of bank's modeling approaches,” the report said.
The bank's presentation revealed a significant weakness to the tests: It was geared toward concerns from the first half of the year – the rocketing price of houses – and not current headwinds, like plummeting commodity prices or a more severe emerging market correction.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Countless workers in the United States are trapped in jobs they would like to leave because they cannot get health insurance elsewhere, calcifying innovation and mobility in the world's largest economy.
An executive is seen in this undated handout photo. REUTERS/Newscom/Handout
Daunted by health-care costs, a would-be technology entrepreneur in Texas decides not to start her own business. A communications expert in Washington decides not to strike out on his own. And a freelance magazine editor in Brooklyn decides to take a less satisfying corporate job.
“I would rather be freelancing, no question,” said Jessica Tolliver, a former editor who now works in public relations. “I got my work done in less time, because once I finished what I had to do, the time was my own.”
Economists call this phenomenon “job lock,” and studies suggest that it keeps between 20 percent and 50 percent of workers from leaving their current jobs.
Because health insurance is tied to employment in the United States, workers who leave their jobs can see health bills skyrocket if they strike out on their own or take a position with a company that offers fewer benefits. Workers who would like to retire early stay on, unable to qualify for the government's Medicare program until they turn 65.
And those who have existing health problems may not be able to get coverage at all.
Job lock is difficult to measure because many employees don't like to advertise their unhappiness. But economists and small-business advocates say it takes an enormous toll on productivity.
SLOWING INNOVATION
“We can definitely say that it's slowing down the rate of innovation,” said Tim Kane, an economist with the Kauffman Foundation which promoted entrepreneurship.
For Mike, a Washington-based communications professional who did not want to use his last name, health costs may force him to pass up the chance to be his own boss at a time when he could easily pick up several major clients.
With two children at home, Mike said he was reluctant to abandon the generous benefits he gets at the trade group where he currently works. Self-employment would probably mean spending more for fewer benefits.
“I don't want a bad event to knock me and my family out of the box,” he said. “It's a real hurdle.”
As head of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, Todd Stottlemeyer frequently encountered would-be entrepreneurs who let their ideas go stale and their products languish on the workbench because they did not want to shoulder their own health care costs.
When he asked audiences if health insurance has affected their employment decisions, often half the hands in the room would go up.
“There are lots of factors that go into why somebody starts a business or doesn't start a business: Do I have a good idea, do I have capital, do I have risk tolerance?,” said Stottlemeyer, now an executive at a hospital chain. “Being able to get health insurance ... should not be one of those determinant factors.”
Making insurance more affordable for the self-employed could lead to a wave of new businesses, one study suggests.
New Jersey saw a 14 to 20 percent rise in entrepreneurial activity due to a 1993 law making it easier for the self-employed to afford health insurance, a study by Philip DeCicca of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario found.
Roughly 60 percent of the U.S. population now gets its health coverage through work, but the system is increasingly strained due to rising costs.
Congress is working to overhaul the troubled system. The Democratic majority hopes to pass a law which President Barack Obama can sign by the end of the year. However, employer-based care is likely to remain a bedrock of any new approach.
The link between healthcare and jobs evolved during World War II, when the government imposed wage controls but allowed companies to adopt health-insurance plans to lure employees.
Small-business groups have often complained this unfairly tilts the playing field toward large employers that have the clout to negotiate rates that are 18 percent lower on average, according to the Commonwealth Fund.
Consequently, workers at small firms are much less likely to have health insurance. While 99 percent of companies that employ more than 200 employees offer health coverage, only 49 percent of companies that employ between 3 and 9 workers do so, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
Part-time workers are also less likely to get benefits than full-time employees, according to Kaiser.
Related Coverage FACTBOX: Healthcare in the United States
Self-employed workers face a further disadvantage because they cannot deduct health-insurance payments from their income taxes, unlike companies that maintain a payroll.
As a freelancer, Tolliver could work from wherever she and take playground breaks with her daughters. But a $1,200 monthly healthcare bill ultimately led her to take a job where insurance only costs her $200 per month.
“It would be obnoxious to say were struggling to put food on the table. But that said, it was a lot of money.”

Welcome to the Unofficial Cuusoo User's Guide.
Section Descriptions
Supporting a project is easy, but this section explains what that really means. It also tells you more ways that you can support your favorite projects indirectly.
What is Cuusoo?
But what is it Really?
How does that work?
Why is this SO AWESOME?
Why should I care?
Cuusoo Trivia
3 projects: the Shinkai*, the Hayabusa*, and Minecraft have made it to the Product Stage
3 project: Serenity, The Winchester, and The Dark Bucket made it to the review stage and were rejected
4 projects: Western Modular, Eve Online ship, Legend of Zelda, and Back to the Future are currently being reviewed
1 project: Portal 2, is pending review
This is a Part 1 of a short series of articles about Cuusoo for beginners through superusers. It is derived from the presentation I gave at Brick Fiesta earlier this year.The purpose of the document is to introduce people to the ins and outs of Cuusoo, provide some tricks and hints interacting with the site, and clear up some of the misunderstanding and confusion that people have about what Cuusoo is all about.Although each entry is mostly complete, this is a living document. I will refresh and update they various parts as new details come to light (or I notice typos).As always, feedback is welcome!Part 7: Creating "Successful" ProjectsJust a general instruction and why you should care about Cuusoo.This section explains how to navigate Cuusoo and find projects that may interest you.This discusses the social elements of Cuusoo and how to tell Cuusoo what you think about the siteHow to follow Cuusoo content and what the different settings mean as well as User profiles. Part 6: Creating Projects and Verboten Subjects Here is where we discuss Cuusoo's rules for posting projects as well as covering what Cuusoo will and won't let you post.Part 7: Creating "Successful" ProjectsCurrently Unpublished. In this section I will talk about what is common in the "successful" projects (those with high support, not necessary those at 10k),and ways to help you get there.Cuusoo means "Wish" in JapaneseCuusoo is a site where people can suggest new Lego products.A person posts their concept on Cuusoo. If they can get 10,000 other people to support their idea, then The Lego Group (TLG) will review the viability of the idea.This review will be based not only on the marketability of the concept but also how well the concept fits with TLG's brand standard and their access to the intellectual property. If the project passes the review stage then TLG will create a producton the submitted idea.It should be obvious to anyone who visits this site that I am a BIG fan of Cuusoo. Why is that? I am amazed TLG even considered doing this! Really, just think about it...TLG has given us all a platform in which we can tell them, in explicit details, what we want them to make AND they give us a forum in which we can try to get support for that idea to PROVE that it is marketable.What other company does that? Seriously, think about it. What other company says "Do you want us to make something for you? Put it on our website and if enough people support that idea, we will give it some serious thought."Since you are on this site I can make two reasonable assumptions. First off, you probably really like Lego. That is an easy one with a very high likelihood (who doesn't like Lego?). The second assumption, which is a lot less likely though still probable is that you are not German. I know this because I monitor my website traffic and the majority of my traffic is not from Germany. Sure, some of you are and I am glad to have you, but most of you are not.It might sound like I have gone totally off the rails here but this is important to my point actually. Many fans of Lego, many U.S. fans that is, don't realize, that the U.S. is NOT the primary market for Lego. TLG sells more Lego to Germany than to the entire U.S. In FACT, the U.S. is not even second, it is third!TLG, like any intelligent business, designs their product to appeal to its primary customer, in this case Germany. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, It's how business works. Does TLG ignore every other country? No, of course not, but your market is given the respect it deserves.So, Why should you care about Cuusoo? You should care because Cuusoo is your direct line to TLG. When you support a Cuusoo project you are telling TLG, "I am a Lego customer and THIS is what I want you to make for me." How COOL is that?As of the creation of this document 11 projects have reaches the requisite number of votes to be reviewed.* Note: The Hayabusa and Shinkai predate the "Global" release of Cuusoo. They were only required to reach 1000 votes to get reviewed, but at the time, Cuusoo was limited to Japanese users only.
How does "Four Loko: Banned in Boston" grab you? The Boston City Council this week will consider a formal inquiry into the health risks posed by Four Loko, a brand of beverages that is what you'd get if you mixed some Red Bull with vodka, then dumped some sugar into it.
City councilors John Connolly and Mark Ciommo - whose Allston/Brighton district is loaded with the sort of people who might drink the stuff - want to convene a session to consider "any appropriate action" the city could take against Four Loko.
The two point to warnings from federal and local college health officials about the risks posed by combining alcohol and caffeine and to efforts by local colleges to get their students to stop drinking the stuff. Last week, a Northeastern student was hospitalized after possibly excessive Four Loko consumption - along with possibly excessive vodka consumption.

The film is about a "disastrous retreat” and lacks any “Chinese values”.
Christopher Nolan's Second World War epic Dunkirk has been resonating with worldwide audiences, however, China has now boycotted the film less than a week into its opening.

The film was released in China last Friday (September 1) and, as the Global Times reports, has recorded “gloomy numbers” since its release.
Cinema-goers in China did not receive the film as well as Western audiences, potentially for its glorification of General Harold Alexander who helped oversee the mass evacuation. Though lauded as a war hero in the UK, Chinese audiences criticise the figure for being responsible for the retreating of Chinese troops into India from Burma in 1942, resulting in the death of thousands, reports The Telegraph.

New Weekly, a Chinese magazine, drew comparisons between Dunkirk and the Chinese action movie Wolf Warrior 2: “Wolf Warrior 2 depicts complete victory, whereas Dunkirk is about a disastrous retreat, which is very different from traditional Chinese values, so it will not perform very well at the box office.”

Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan recently revealed that he considered making Dunkirk without a script. In an interview, Nolan says he “got to a point where I understood the scope and movement and the history of what I wanted the film to address, because it's very simple geography.
However, the big-budget war movie was recently critiqued for shunning the role of the Indian army in the historic battle. The Indian Times write that “the Indian Army that had started the war with a little over 1,94,000 men had expanded to nearly 2.5 million men, becoming the largest volunteer army in history,” during the battle and “yet this significant contribution is missing”.
Glass Brain is a tool that maps the electrical activity of your brain in realtime, creating a 3D visualisation that you can navigate with a gaming controller.
The anatomically realistic 3D brain will show realtime data from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals taken from a specially-designed EEG cap. This data is mapped to the source of that electrical activity, i.e. the specific part of the brain. The underlying brain model is generated through MRI scans so that the EEG data is accurately mapped to an individual's brain model.

Different colours are given to the different signal frequency bands to create a beautiful interactive artwork that seems to crackle with energy, showing how information is transferred (or at least estimated to do so) between different regions of the brain.
Glass Brain was born out of a collaboration between Neuroscape Lab at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Swartz Centre for Computational Neuroscience at the University of California San Diego.

The project was spearheaded by Adam Gazzaley, associate professor of Neurology, Physiology and Psychiatry and director of the Neuroscape Lab. He told Wired.co.uk that it grew out of a couple of projects that he and his team have been working on in the lab. The first project is realtime EEG; Gazzaley's lab has been exploring building 3D immersive video games that take neural data from a person playing a game and feed it back into the game mechanics. In order for this closed-loop approach to work, it requires data to be supplied in as close to realtime as possible.
Secondly, Gazzaley has been working on educating and entertaining audiences about the brain, showing what the organ looks like and overlaying MRI and EEG data. "It's fun for an entertainment piece, but it's full of artefacts. It's a beautiful rendition but it doesn't go further than that," he explains.

Glass Brain takes the science that goes into the visualisation and improves upon the quality of the EEG data so that it's corrected for artefacts, is closer to realtime and the sources of the EEG data are mapped more accurately. "The first goal for Glass Brain was still largely to show people for educational purposes and to show what realtime EEG data might look like. Once we have this, it can potentially have a benefit as a realtime diagnostic tool for surgeons and neurologists and perhaps a therapeutic tool," Gazzaley told Wired.co.uk.
Displaying EEG data in close to realtime presents a major challenge. When you want to take the noise of raw EEG data and turn it into signal by converting the frequency domains and localising the sources, it adds processing time. Collaborators from the Swartz Center had been building algorithms that improved EEG processing, so these skills were combined with Gazzaley's visualisation skills using the Unity game engine. "I'm really interested in bringing consumer-facing tech into neuroscience," he says.
To help provide some processing muscle, the team also collaborated with Nvidia, which offered up some powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), which help shave milliseconds off the data delay. A company called Cognionics developed a 64-channel EEG cap for use with Glass Brain.

The biggest challenge was working out how to convert so much data into an aesthetically pleasing visualisation. "The complexity of the brain is a marvel in itself, but we have to make decisions as to how we convert data into the stuff we see," Gazzaley says.
The next challenge is to try and correlate events taking place in a game and the activity taking place in the brain of the person playing that game. So, for example, if a sign appears in the game, can the team map the parts of the brain that fire as the person sees it? "How do you filter it in a way that it appears from the background? The brain is such a busy place," he adds.
Once the team manages that, they want to do a closed-loop experiment. "Take that realtime EEG data that's localised to the sources in the brain and feed it into the game algorithms -- so you can learn how to play games that teach you how to regulate your own neural activity."

Gazzaley says that the team is at the early stages of this, but he has already experimented with using the Oculus Rift to navigate the Glass Brain. "If you had a friend or colleague wearing the EEG cap, you can fly in virtual reality into their functioning brain in realtime. You can fly into your own functioning brain if you like!" "The first time I was able to take an Xbox joystick and move it into the brain and see it's beauty, was amazing. But putting on the Oculus Rift and flying into the Glass Brain and seeing so much neural data -- both structural and functional -- that was an emotional experience."
He suggests that this opens up the possibility of creating games where players must travel to different parts of their own brain and try and increase activity in different parts of their brain in order to affect gameplay.
The Glass Brain has already been demoed at SXSW and Gazzaley hopes that one day people will be able to explore their brains in science museums.
PITTSBURGH -- Steve Pederson deftly guided Pittsburgh through conference realignment from the crumbling Big East to the rebuilt ACC. The longtime athletic director could never find stability for the football program.
When Paul Chryst left for Wisconsin on Wednesday to send the Panthers into their fourth coaching search in four years, it cost Pederson his job.
The school parted ways with Pederson in what chancellor Patrick Gallagher called a mutual decision but one necessary for Pitt to move forward following the latest setback for a football program stuck in neutral. Pederson had nearly four years remaining on a contract that ran through 2018.
Randy Juhl, vice chancellor for research conduct and compliance, will serve as Pitt's acting athletic director. Offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph will serve as interim coach for the Panthers as they prepare for the Armed Forces Bowl on Jan. 2 against Houston. The announcements came as Chryst was being introduced as Wisconsin's coach following three seasons at Pitt.
"On behalf of the entire Pitt community, I would like to thank Paul Chryst for his efforts the past three years," Gallagher said in a statement. "He leaves the program with a strong foundation for future success, both on and off the field. Before beginning a robust national coaching search, Steve Pederson and I spoke this morning and we mutually agreed that this would be the appropriate time to make a change in athletic department leadership."
Pederson kept the Panthers at the forefront of conference realignment, announcing in September 2011 that the school was joining Syracuse in a move from the Big East to the ACC. The bold stroke kept Pitt out of the mad scramble that ensued, but it did little to stop the churn atop a football program that has struggled to generate momentum on the field or much enthusiasm off it.
Pederson forced out Dave Wannstedt following an 8-5 season in 2010 and brought in Miami (Ohio) coach Mike Haywood. Haywood's tenure lasted all of 16 days before he was fired following a domestic incident at his home on Dec. 31, 2010. Forced to scramble, Pederson hastily brought in Todd Graham from Tulsa. Graham made it through a 6-6 year in 2011 before sprinting to Arizona State.
Chryst's hire brought the program a sense of calm but also the same mix of spirited wins and befuddling losses. Attendance stagnated at Heinz Field and when Chryst was lured home to Wisconsin by athletic director Barry Alvarez, the Panthers were forced to begin another search.
It's one they will do without Pederson after his second stint at Pitt ended abruptly. He served as athletic director from 1996-2002 before spending five turbulent years at Nebraska only to return to the Panthers in 2007. The vision he set forth to lead the Panthers back to football prominence never materialized.
"With major decisions to be made about the future of football, I thought it was in the best interest of the University of Pittsburgh for Chancellor Gallagher to assemble his own team," Pederson said in a statement. "I am a Pitt and City of Pittsburgh fan, and want what is best for everyone moving into the future."
A new screenshot of Windows 8 has surfaced, showing an early look at what Microsoft is planning for the newly styled Windows 8 out-of-box experience. The screenshot, which was posted in a thread on MyDigitalLife, is believed to have originated from the Chinese forum PCBeta. The above photo shows a departure from the traditional Aero Basic wizard dialogs as used in the post-installer stages of Windows Vista and 7, opting instead for a Windows Media Center-like appearance. The photo has been recreated in a Photoshop mockup by Neowin member Jimmy422 to give a better idea of what the OOBE will look like:
It is not yet known whether the boot-from-disc installer will indeed take on a similar appearance, or whether the appearance of the installer inside Windows has changed from earlier screenshots leaked late last month. There is another screenshot from the same thread which suggests this possibility, as shown below. The current boot-from-disc installer for Windows Vista and 7 uses fake Aero windows over a wallpaper.
In the same thread, MyDigitalLife user "canouna" has posted images of the new Black Screen of Death in Windows 8. The new design is extremely minimal, choosing to display only the faulting memory address location and the system file instead of information on what to do next, as was the case for previous Windows NT-based operating systems. However, this screenshot is not new and was spotted as early as late last month.
The same user has also teased an image of the new bootscreen for Windows 8, but most of the image is currently obscured. It is assumed the image will be revealed in the days to come.
Image Credit: MyDigitalLife
Update: Screenshots of the entire installation process for Windows 8 M3 have surfaced on the web through Chris123nt.com. The screenshots come from a 797x build. Judging from these screenshots, it appears that the boot-from-disc installer will indeed use this new styling.
Sinn Féin will table a ‘Green Paper' on Irish unity at Cabinet after entering government in Dublin after the next General Election in the South, where, once a ‘United Ireland' is achieved, unionists will be in the coalition talks mix following every ensuing Dáil poll for the foreseeable future.
That's the plan, anyway, according to Sinn Féin TD for Cork South-Central, Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire, who confirmed to an audience in the Bogside this week that his party believes its strategy of ending partition by wielding power both North and South is very much on course, following extremely positive election results over recent months.
Mr. Ó Laoghaire was among the participants in the last of a series of talks organised as part of the 25th Gasyard Féile.
He was joined by Derry businessman John McGowan, former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) deputy chairman Terry Wright, and former victims commissioner Patricia McBride, for a debate on an ‘Ireland - An Agreed Future' in the Pilots' Row centre on Monday evening.
Mr. Ó Laoghaire echoed George Galloway who, five days earlier in the same venue, quoted Lenin's observation that there sometimes came “decades when nothing happened and weeks when decades happened”.
“The last year or two has had enormous significance for Irish politics, for politics in the North, and for politics in Britain,” said Mr. Ó Laoghaire.
“I think [events] have very much changed the dynamics in Ireland, in Britain, and in terms of the relationships between the two, but I also think it's true to say that the next few years will also see decisions that will potentially be of even greater significance and could change the course of Irish history,” he added.
The Cork republican said he believed a ‘United Ireland' was inevitable but cautioned that it was something that needed to be achieved through activism and persuasion.
London's decision to remove the North from the European Union against the wishes of the majority of its population changed the “political context very dramatically” and provided republicans with an opportunity, he suggested.
“Brexit is the obvious factor. The fact that the North is being taken out of the EU against its will, the implications for the border, the possibility of a hard border, and indeed on relations between the Irish state and the British state [are factors],” he said.
The Sinn Féin representative said his party would continue to agitate against Brexit at all levels of democratic assembly from local councils to Brussels and Strasbourg.
But he also indicated that one of his party's primary objectives was to be in government in Dublin as soon as possible in order to move to end partition.
“We would be seeking to take concrete steps, producing a Green Paper on Irish unity [one's already been prepared] that would maximise cross-border cooperation, that would, in short, be an advocate for Irish unity, rather than simply having it as a stated policy preference, that would actively pursue Irish unity.”
He suggested the Irish government should already have adopted Sinn Féin's Green Paper but promised his party would do so once in power.
Having sketched Sinn Féin's strategy for achieving its principal objective, Mr. Ó Laoghaire also cited what, he argued, were insistent economic arguments for unification.
Mr. Ó Laoghaire pointed to Dr. Kurt Hübner and Dr. Renger Van Nieuwkoop's ‘Modelling Irish Unification' paper of 2015, which estimated that “in total, Irish unification could boost all-island GDP in the first eight years by as much as 35.6 billion Euro”.
“The people we must convince are those who are opposed, who are ambivalent, we must persuade them of the benefits of Irish unity for its economic benefits and I think that the case on that is becoming stronger all the time,” he said.
“The report by Kurt Hübner was a very convincing piece of work.
“I think we need to convince them that it works for jobs, for agriculture, for industry and investment,” he said.
Equally, Mr. Ó Laoghaire suggested a ‘United Ireland' would remove the democratic deficit currently suffered by the North's 1.8million people returning representatives to an overseas multi-national parliament that represents 65million people.
He observed that the North would return around 28 per cent of representatives to any new All-Ireland parliament created in the event of Irish unity, and that unionists would make up approximately 14 per cent of that quota.
“A unionist party or a party representing that tradition in a ‘United Ireland' would have to be considered in any coalition negotiations in any election that came up and if the unionist electorate fragmented and started to vote for a broader range of political parties representing a broader view [political parties] would have to take account of that,” he said.
Mr. Ó Laoghaire's conviction that a ‘United Ireland' makes sense economically was shared by Mr. McGowan (Here), however, one of those he needs to convince wasn't so sure.
Mr. Wright, who professed himself a UK republican said the very failure of the North economically - it requires a £10billion annual bail our from the British exchequer - made him seriously doubt the prospective economic prospects of a United Ireland.
He also suggested the ongoing failure of nationalists and unionists to agree a shared cross-party power-sharing platform at Stormont didn't bode well for republicans trying to persuade unionists to support a United Ireland.
“The current impasse at Stormont would suggest that finding agreement would be a huge ask. It speaks for itself at present, a lack of trust is destructive of any foundation, on which any possible future can be built and sustained. So, maybe before we get an ‘Agreed Ireland' we might try to get an ‘Agreed Stormont ‘first.”
Mr. Wright also pointed out how economics was only half the story, noting that deep-grained mindsets could be unshifting on both sides.
He remembered recently asking a veteran unionist councillor how they normally sold the Union to electors on the doorsteps while on canvas.
“I asked him: if you're a unionist and you're on a doorstep and you have to convince someone why they should vote ‘Union', for the Ulster Unionist Party, what would you say?”
“This is what he said: ‘My grandfather was a unionist, my father was a unionist, I'm a unionist, I was born a unionist, and will die a unionist'.
“Most of us were pulling our hair out by the time he'd finished,” said Mr. Wright.
Mrs. McBride, a self-professed republican whose father Frank died after being shot by loyalists in 1972, and whose brother Antony was killed by the SAS while on IRA service with Derry republican, Kieran Fleming, in 1984, agreed making the case for a ‘United Ireland' to those who need to be persuaded won't be easy.
“If we're talking about an 'Agreed Ireland', the first step is who do we need to bring along with us. The clear answer is the unionist community in the North of the island,” said Ms. McBride.
She said an ‘Agreed Ireland' - by definition - couldn't be proscriptive.
“An agreed Ireland is about a rights-based approach to creating a new society and, within that, we have to take into consideration the economic, social and cultural impact on the citizens,” she said.
LOS ANGELES – Glen Davis played 5:14 in his Clippers debut.
He did not step on the floor until the third quarter was all but expired. Yet his impact, even if theoretical, was palpable.
“He's great,” said Darren Collison, who starred in the fourth quarter of the Clippers' 101-93 win over the Rockets Wednesday. “You can already feel that he's going to bring this team to another level. We need his presence and that's another big body for us. He played five minutes today and it just seemed like he had impact on the game. Just imagine if he had more minutes, he's going to have more of an impact, once he starts getting familiar with everyone else.”
When he checked in for DeAndre Jordan with 1.8 second left in the third, the Staples Center crowd greeted him with a standing ovation. Seconds into the fourth quarter, he forced a jump ball with Jordan Hamilton and won the tip. Later, he toppled over after being fouled on a driving layup attempt and all four of his new teammates on the floor with him rushed to help him up.
“I was a little nervous at first,” Davis said of his debut. “My heart was beating really fast. I haven't played in a couple of days, so I felt winded a little bit. It felt good, I was really nervous out there. I got the jitters out with my first shot and that kind of helped me a little bit. I got in the flow, got a couple blocks, got a couple of fouls. (I almost fouled out, right?) I'm glad I could contribute and do something to help.”
Davis scored two points, making a pair of fourth-quarter free throws, blocked two shots, committed three fouls, had two rebounds, kept two more plays alive on the offensive glass and took, and missed, a step-back jumper without hesitation.
Before the game Head Coach Doc Rivers said he was unsure how much Davis would play Wednesday, but certainly had a vision for how the 28-year-old big man will help to go forward.
“It is going to give us more depth at the 4 position,” Rivers said. “He's a bruiser, banger, rebounder. He's just a unique type of player. For as big as he is, he moves well. He can play defense and he can shoot. He did a lot of little things that help to win teams get over the hump.”
Davis said among all of the reasons he chose to sign with the Clippers despite other suitors, the chance to reunite with Rivers and potentially win a second championship were at the top of his list of priorities.
“You want to come here and play,” Davis said. “Because of the weather, the atmosphere, and what they're trying to accomplish. But I'm playing for an NBA championship. I'm not here to do the Hollywood thing and be in movies and commercials. I don't want that, I want another ring. That's why I came here, that's why I chose to come here. You don't get any younger, you get older. And being my age, and being still in my prime, why not come here and play for something like that.”
It has been a whirlwind few days for Davis. After being waived by the Orlando Magic Friday afternoon, he signed with the Clippers (40-20) on Monday morning in New Orleans. He was introduced to his new teammates at a breakfast meeting, met the media at Smoothie King Arena that evening, sat in the locker room during the game as he awaited the team's return to Los Angeles for his required physical examination, and was put through an extended workout Wednesday after shootaround.
“He had a work out in the morning,” Jared Dudley said. “They basically killed him all day and then go put him in the game, so I think by Saturday, him getting his legs underneath him, he'll be a lot better.”
Still, he played with the kind of energy and reckless abandon that nearly everyone associated with the Clippers expected, particularly Rivers, who coached Davis for four seasons in Boston. He's played with J.J. Redick and Hedo Turkoglu in Orlando, but even the players he suited up with for the first time noticed.
“I am excited about Baby [Glen Davis] and his spirit and the passion that he plays with is contagious,” Chris Paul said. “I think that our second unit could use it. He is one of those guys that plays with a purpose, plays with the passion and a great, great mix and blend I think for what our team needs going forward.”

Just hours before residents heard the news Thursday morning, the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation itself learned that it will be responsible for running the recreational marijuana trade starting next year.
Although the Crown corporation has been preparing for that possibility, the NSLC now has less than seven months to create a whole new business, almost from scratch.
Just 48 hours into the task, NSLC spokesperson Beverley Ware said there are plenty of unanswered questions.
"We're in planning mode at the moment," she said. "We need to determine how many stores will be carrying cannabis. We need to determine where they will be. We need to determine how it will be displayed, how it will be distributed across our network.
A spokesperson for the Justice Department said the government involved the NSLC in discussions about distribution models for months.
"We wanted to keep the organization involved to avoid any surprises once decisions were made and to ensure they could quickly act if they were selected to distribute and retail cannabis," said Sarah Gillis. "They were notified about the final decision as soon as possible."
Training employees
Ware said employees will receive training before products hit the shelves.
"Our employees, of course, need to have training in how to deal with this product, so we do have a lot of work to do before July of next year."
NSLC spokesperson Beverley Ware said there are still many unanswered questions about how the corporation will handle marijuana sales. (Jean Laroche/CBC)
That training will include the ability to offer customers advice, the way NSLC employees currently do when it comes to wine suggestions.
"We need to make sure that the programs are up in place, that they can make informed recommendations to our customers," Ware said. "They need to know the products."
The corporation hasn't started negotiating with suppliers yet, nor does it know how many varieties will be available to customers.
Local suppliers
On Thursday, Justice Minister Mark Furey made it clear he would like to see liquor stores stock locally grown marijuana but said it was likely that demand would outstrip supply and the liquor corporation would be forced to buy out of province.
Asked about the possibility of stocking small-batch productions similar to popular microbrewery brands of beer and cider, Ware didn't rule out the possibility.
"Well we do support local, as you know," she said. "We have the local craft brewery market. We have the local spirits market, the local wine market — and they're extremely popular with Nova Scotians. They like and support their local products.
"So whether or not we'll have a Nova Scotia section for marijuana, as we do for alcohol, I mean, that's something that will have to be determined."

Hidden from children
The federal government's proposed Cannabis Act stipulates that marijuana cannot be displayed or promoted anywhere it can be seen by young people, which poses a challenge for liquor stores that allow those who are under 19 on site.
But the proposed bill also allows "a person who is authorized to sell cannabis or cannabis accessories to promote it at a point of sale (e.g. retail store), if the promotion is limited to price and availability."
"We're looking at options on how this would be displayed," said Ware. "Children cannot see the display so we need to look at details such as does this need to be a separate room or does this mean that it could be displayed like cigarettes where they're all hidden?"
In just a few weeks, it will be time to pack up the beach towels, tanning oils, and tanning oils and say goodbye to Jersey Shore for good. How will you fill your Thursday nights at 10 p.m.? MTV is hoping to hit pay dirt (mud?) several hundred miles southwest of New Jersey with Buckwild, a new reality series about nine young-adult friends in small-town West Virginia who say they are living by the motto, “Whatever happens, happens.” And what seems to be happening is a lot of riding down hills inside giant tires, driving trucks dangerously through mud, tearing up the trails on ATVs and motorcycles, drinking, body licking, fighting with neighbors, and doing Jackass-y stunts that sometimes involve construction equipment. But don't worry, there's a heartfelt side to all of this ruckus, as you will see in this two-minute trailer, when one guy gives flowers to a girl he's sweet on.
Buckwild debuts Jan. 3 at 10 p.m., and MTV will be airing two half-hour episodes back-to-back each week for six weeks, which means that conservative watchdog groups will have a fairly small window in which to be up in arms.
UPDATE: ‘Buckwild' producer defends show after senator slam
While we have the old guard in St. Louis to thank for establishing a craft beer culture, without a doubt 2011 was a watershed year for beer in our town. We saw four amazing breweries open in our town and change what people thought about beer in St. Louis.
We saw each new brewery bring something new to our local beer scene, providing us with classic styles or more esoteric offerings. While Perennial Artisan Ales has produces some examples of traditional styles, they're definitely known for their more unique experiments.
While owners Phil and Emily Wymore have enjoyed seeing tremendous growth with their year-round creations, the heart of Perennial was always about producing those one-off, barrel-aged beers. But barrel-aged beers have a cost and that cost is availability.
There is only so much room for beer that sits in barrels for months (or even years) at a time. Which means that only so many people can get their hands on these special creations. And while the parties to release these beers are fun, there are only so many one can do without problems cropping up.
To combat any future issues all while providing a fertile ground to create these barrel-aged beers, Perennial has announced the Société du Chêne (Society of Oak) membership.
Because this membership will be a highly sought-after ticket, the 2015 memberships will be available via an online lottery beginning on Thursday, March 5th at 9:00am and will end Sunday, March 8th at 9:00am. All entries will be random, entering at 9:01am on 3/5 has the same chance as 8:57am on 3/8.
Each membership will be $240 (tax included) and will include:
One bottle of each of the following beers Funky Wit Apricot 375ml Funky Wit Raspberries & Rhubarb 375ml Funky Wit Charentais Melon 375ml Barry Rye 2.0 (Dark Rye Ale aged in Rye Whiskey Barrels with Blackberries) 750ml La Bohème (Wine Barrel-Aged Sour Brown Ale with Michigan Tart Cherries) 750ml Savant Blanc (Belgian Blonde Ale aged in Chardonnay Barrels with Chardonel grapes) 750ml Savant Beersel (Belgian Pale Ale aged in Red Wine Barrels with Chambourcin Grapes) 750ml Pro”CATS”tination (Wine barrel-aged saison with Brett & Lacto. Brewed in collaboration with Off Color and Northdown.) 750ml Hoosier Love (Wine Barrel-Aged Sour Brown Ale with Persimmons. Brewed in Collaboration with The Libertine) 750ml Anniversaria 2015 (Blended Solera-Aged 100% Brettanomyces Belgian Pale Ale) 750ml
a Société du Chêne glass
10% discount on all on-premise purchases with valid membership ID (does not include bottles to go or merchandise)
One entry to a Members-Only party. Details to be released at a later date. (Trust us—we'll make it a good one)
The ability to purchase a one-bottle allocation of Abraxas, Sump & 17.
Now, for some of the rules and regulations for this club (because people love to find loopholes!):
One membership per person.
Each of these beers will be released at some time during the membership period. Perennial will release the beers when they feel that they are ready. For this reason, a release schedule will not be shared in advance. If, for some unforeseen reason, a beer is unable to be released, partial refunds will be provided.
If there are excess bottles available, (depending on the number) bottles will either be offered to members for purchase, sold on or off-premise in the Perennial Tasting Room or sold on-premise at The Side Project Cellar.
In the event that their spirits barrel-aged beers mature during the membership period, members may also be given the ability to purchase an undetermined allocation of these beers as well.
Bottles must be picked up in the tasting room. Under no circumstances are they able to ship bottles.
Members may designate one trustee to pick up his or her bottles from the tasting room. Membership benefits do not apply to trustees.
2016 Memberships will be offered first to 2015 members. Renewal is, of course, optional.
And because people love to skirt the rules of lotteries (lord knows I know this all too well) here are the lottery rules:
Members will be selected via lottery at www.perennialbeer.com/societe. The entry window will begin Thursday, March 5th at 9:00am and will end Sunday, March 8th at 9:00am. THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE TO ENTERING EARLY. ENTRIES ON THURSDAY HAVE THE SAME CHANCE OF BEING SELECTED AS ENTRIES ON SUNDAY.
Entrants must be 21 at time of entry.
One entry per person. Multiple entries, identified either by name or by email, will be discarded.
Entrants will be notified on Monday, March 9th.
Either member or his or her trustee must be available to make payment of $240 and pick up membership card and glass in the tasting room on either Thursday, March 12 or Friday, March 13 between 4:00PM and 10:00PM. Trustees must present either a photocopy or mobile photo of the member's ID at this time.
Any questions about the club should be sent to societe@perennialbeer.com. That will be your one-stop shop for answers.
When working with Arduino and other boards, most people just set the bare PCB down on the bench, hook up cables and components, and go. As long as your benchtop isn't made of metal, and as long as you're careful, this can work fine. But it's not ideal.
Clipped leads and other random metal bits tend to get underneath the board, where they can short across the exposed solder points, causing erratic behavior and even damage. Plus, those bare points will scuff up a nice benchtop pretty fast.
You could put the thing in a case, but most dev boards have wires coming in from all sides — cases end up being more hole than wall. It's cleaner and easier to just give your board a lift by adding rubber feet built from off-the-shelf hardware.
WEST DEPTFORD, N.J. (CBS) — A West Deptford police officer is off the job after he is accused of tampering with evidence and filing false reports.
For the last four years on the force, 30-year-old Officer Thomas McWain has won awards for cleaning up the streets of New Jersey and making arrest after arrest for drug possession.
He had a proclamation given to him by West Deptford Township last year. It called him “a source of pride” for the township.
Officer McWain even did an interview with a TV station in Houston where he talked about the lengths he would go to “help” someone gets into rehab.
What Officer McWain didn't mention is that he may have been setting people up and profiting off those arrests.

“Here's a guy making all these drug arrests every month and you are sitting there going, ‘My god this guy is phenomenal…he's a go-getter' and then you find out it is not what it appears to be,” said Chief Samuel DiSimone, with the West Deptford Police Department.
DiSimone says in April some bodycam footage of McWain came to his attention which shows the officer's alleged misconduct. It led to a 6-month investigation.
Authorities now believe McWain was somehow convincing people to hang out with him and bring drugs.
Authorities say Officer McWain would show up in a patrol car, make an arrest and then convince that person to go to rehab. Not necessarily because he cared about their well-being, but allegedly because it was a scheme to funnel people in a drug rehab center that Officer McWain allegedly had a financial stake in.
“I worry the people of West Deptford or even Gloucester County, or even of all South Jersey will think that that is how everybody is here and they are not. I would like people to know we are the people who found this out first we did not hide it we did not sweep it under the rug,” said DiSimone.

McWain has been with the West Deptford Police Department since 2013.
He was suspended without pay on Monday and is scheduled to appear in court next month.
The Mathematical Tables Project[1][2] was one of the largest and most sophisticated computing organizations that operated prior to the invention of the digital electronic computer. Begun in the United States in 1938 as a project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), it employed 450 unemployed clerks to tabulate higher mathematical functions, such as exponential functions, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. These tables were eventually published in a 28 volume set by Columbia University Press.
History [ edit ]
The group was led by a group of mathematicians and physicists, most of whom had been unable to find professional work during the Great Depression. The mathematical leader was Gertrude Blanch, who had just finished her doctorate in mathematics at Cornell University. She had been unable to find a university position and was working at a photographic company before joining the project.
The administrative director was Arnold Lowan, who had a degree in physics from Columbia University and had spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton University before returning to New York without a job. Perhaps the most accomplished mathematician to be associated with the group was Cornelius Lanczos, who had once served as an assistant to Albert Einstein. He spent a year with the project and organized seminars on computation and applied mathematics at the project's office in Lower Manhattan.
In addition to computing tables of mathematical functions, the project did large computations for sciences, including the physicist Hans Bethe and did calculations for a variety of war projects including tables for the LORAN navigation system, tables for microwave radar, bombing tables, and shock wave propagation tables.
The Mathematical Tables Project survived the termination of the WPA in 1943 and continued to operate in New York until 1948. At that point, roughly 25 members of the group moved to Washington, DC to become the Computation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Blanch moved to Los Angeles to lead the computing office of the Institute for Numerical Analysis at UCLA and Arnold Lowan joined the faculty of Yeshiva University in New York. The greatest legacy of the project is the Handbook of Mathematical Functions,[3] which was published 16 years after the group disbanded. Edited by two veterans of the project, Milton Abramowitz and Irene Stegun, it became a widely circulated mathematical and scientific reference.
The St. Louis Cardinals have constructed a team that does well at putting the ball in play. And when the Cardinals make contact, they often hit ball on the ground. This tendency has been the subject of some study in sabermetric circles. Back in 2012 at Fangraphs, Jeff Sullivan first delved into the Cardinals' good fortunes on grounders. In that piece, Sullivan makes the following observation:
When you think offense and batted balls, you think fly balls and line drives. Fly balls for homers, and line drives for singles, doubles, and triples. This year, the league-average wOBA on fly balls is .352. The league-average wOBA on line drives is .679. Meanwhile, the league-average wOBA on grounders is .214. The league-average BABIP on grounders is .235. Grounders aren't exciting, and grounders aren't what drives an offense forward. Grounders are how you make a lot of outs.
That statement was just as true in 2014 as when Sullivan penned it in 2012. Here are the wOBA and wRC+ by batted-ball type for MLB as a whole in 2014:
FB: .335 wOBA, 114 wRC+
LD: .684 wOBA, 355 wRC+
GB: .220 wOBA, 35 wRC+
Liners are the most desirable batted-ball type a hitter can create when putting lumber to horse hide, but fly balls are where the power is generated. Isolated Power (ISO) is a stat similar to Slugging Percentage (SLG) except that it excludes singles and reflects only a player's extra-base hits. For a bit of context, the ISO for MLB as a whole in 2014 was .135. Here is the ISO by batted-ball type for all of MLB in 2014:
FB: .378 ISO
LD: .190 ISO
GB: .020 ISO The Cardinals' 21.3% LD rate tied for the fourth-highest team LD rates in the majors last season. Their 46.5% GB rate was the seventh highest in MLB. The 32.2% FB rate St. Louis posted in 2014 was the 25th highest in the big leagues; or, the sixth lowest. The Cardinals' 1.44 GB/FB ratio was the majors' seventh-highest last year. Given that most power-hitting in the majors comes via the fly ball, it isn't surprising that the Cards, a team that hit relatively few flies last year, struggled to hit for power. The club's .116 ISO was the third lowest in the majors.
The Cardinals' struggles in the power-hitting department have caused them to make over their bench. Gone are the light-hitting Daniel Descalso and Mark Ellis. Signed is the heavy-hitting Mark Reynolds . Upon the announcement of the deal, we looked at how Reynolds was an anti-Cardinals as a hitter, a bizzarro Birdo at the bat, because of his penchant for hitting for power, swinging and missing, and striking out. But Reynolds's batted-ball profile also represents the antithesis of what has become the Cardinal (hitting) way in recent seasons.
Reynolds hits very few grounders, just 36.6% over his career. During Reynolds's seven years in the majors, his GB rate has typically been about six or seven percentage points below the MLB as a whole. Last season, Reynolds posted a 38.1% GB rate that was 6.7 percentage points below the MLB's collective GB rate of 44.8%. Reynolds is a fly-ball hitter. His FB rate as a hitter has typically been eight to ten percentage points higher than normal. In 2014, Reynolds's 48.1% FB rate was 13.7 percentage points higher than the MLB overall rate of 34.4%.
Given Reynolds's 0.78 GB/GB ratio (which equaled his career ratio), it's no wonder that Reynolds's ISO of .198 was 65 points above the MLB's overall ISO last year.
St. Louis Post-Dispatch by beat writer Derrick Goold early in 2013: Comparing the batted-ball profiles of the 2014 Cardinals as a whole and Reynolds reminded me of former pitching coach Dave Duncan's effort to persuade veteran Brad Penny to throw more sinkers during spring training, as reported in theby beat writer Derrick Goold early in 2013:
During spring training in 2010 as the Cardinals tried to indoctrinate fastball jockey Brad Penny into the organization's philosophy of sink, pitching coach Dave Duncan and his staff kept a running tally for Penny's benefit on a markerboard in the coaches' office.
In one column, the pitching coach counted every fly ball allowed during spring, and in another all of the groundballs. Beside each was the number of extra-base hits in the air or on the ground. That number, so much higher by the fly ball totals, showed that when it came to pitches put in the air "extra bases are everywhere," a coach said. Duncan wanted to prove to Penny, who had the game's hottest fastball for several years and an eagerness to flex it high in the zone, the benefit of staying down, down, down.
"Hell," Penny said later, "why I haven't been trying to get ground balls all the time?"
"Hell," Penny said later, "why I haven't been trying to get ground balls all the time?"
Looking at the 2014 Cardinals offense, one might wonder: "Hell, why haven't they been trying to hit more balls in the air?" It seems that the signing of Reynolds signifies an effort to diversify their offensive attack so that it has a bit more aerial bombardment to it.
Microsoft's New Logo: Hip to Be Square
Microsoft on Thursday updated its corporate logo — changed for the first time in a quarter of a century.
Unveiled at the Boston opening of the company's 23rd Microsoft store this morning, the new mark retains the same color scheme as its predecessor, but swaps out its wavy edges for the straight lines of a simple four-pane colored window, reminiscent of the tiled look of its new Windows Phone and Windows 8 operating systems.
“From Windows 8 to Windows Phone 8 to Xbox services to the next version of Office, you will see a common look and feel across these products providing a familiar and seamless experience on PCs, phones, tablets and TVs,” Microsoft exec Jeffrey Meisner said in a company blog post. “This wave of new releases is not only a reimagining of our most popular products, but also represents a new era for Microsoft, so our logo should evolve to visually accentuate this new beginning.”
Derby County has been named the Johnstone's Paint Community Club of the Year at The Football League Awards 2015.
Simon Carnall, Head of Derby County Community Trust, received the award at the gala ceremony at The Brewery, London, on Sunday evening in front of over 600 guests from clubs, sponsors and the football industry.The Football League Awards 2015 mark the 10th year of the awards, which celebrate on and off pitch excellence across The League's 72 clubs. This year all 72 clubs were nominated for at least one award.Derby County had made the shortlist after being named the Midlands regional winner, and beat off competition from Blackburn Rovers (North West Winner), Doncaster Rovers (Yorkshire & North East Winner), Norwich City (East Winner) and Brighton & Hove Albion (South Winner) to claim the overall Johnstone's Paint Community Club of the Year Award.Through Derby County's community programme it is clear it recognises the ability it has as a club to engage people, raise hopes and aspirations and improve the lives of the people of Derbyshire. The club's community trust is committed to ensuring that it meets local needs while working strategically in line with regional and national agendas. In 2014 the scheme ran 50 projects and reached more than 30,000 participants, with its flagship Derby City School Sport Partnership project helping to increase participation for young people in the community.This category recognises the community schemes that have best demonstrated success at engaging with the local community in the 2014 calendar year. The shortlist was comprised of five regional winners of the award. In deciding the overall winner, judges considered the objectives of the scheme, breadth of delivery, innovation, impact and achievements as well as the leading individual project from the last 12 months.On winning the award, Simon Carnall said: "It's huge for the football club, from the owners to the chief operators to the board of trustees.

WATCH ABOVE: Florida investigators call bizarre shooting a case of justifiable homicide. WFLA's Candace McCowan reports.
A Florida teen came out of his bedroom Tuesday morning, rifle in hand, to crying pleas for help. The masked man pointed a gun at his mother and then at him…that's when the teen opened fire and killed his father.
Eighteen-year-old Malachi Heisler says he was home with his mother, 37-year-old Jolene Andrews, her boyfriend and his younger sister when the interruption occurred.
“I woke up to my name being called, okay. I heard the words Malachi and help, that's all I heard when I woke up,” Heisler explained to WFLA while a bandana covered part of his face.
The suspect pointed a gun at his mother before turning it on him. Malachi, in turn, was carrying an assault rifle.
“I had about 5 to 6 seconds to make a decision,” he added.
He eventually pulled the trigger and changed his life forever.
Upon closer investigation of the body, which was dressed in swat-type gear with a ski mask — the teen quickly recognized markings and tattoos that belonged to his father, 46-year-old John Heisler, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, according to authorities.
A restraining order had been put in place in April after the elder Heisler was handed a felony charge for possession of firearms, according to ABC.
Malachi was questioned at length following the incident and was released hours later when the Pinellas County Sheriff said he wouldn't be charged, even though the father's weapons turned out to be BB guns.
“I had a feeling that something like this would happen but I didn't know when,” Malachi continued. “He wasn't a good dad, no [expletive] father of the year awards.”
Families who rely on state help to pay their rent will have to find hundreds of pounds extra every month to to avoid eviction because of the government's freeze on housing benefit, the homeless charity Shelter has warned.
Demands from Shelter and other housing organisations for a government rethink come as a number of local authorities – mostly in the south of England – report that many of those being evicted and rendered homeless are now in full-time work, typically in public sector jobs such as teaching or nursing.
Ahead of this week's budget, the charities are calling on ministers to end the freeze, which is set to run until 2020, and to build more affordable homes in areas of need, or to risk a further explosion in the already rapidly rising numbers being placed in costly emergency accommodation by their local authorities.
One single mother of two young children in north London who works full time as a teacher told the Observer she had always thought her job, and contribution to the community, would ensure she could find a respectable home. Instead, after her partner left and her landlord put up the rent to a level she could not afford on her own, she was evicted. She is now living at a B&B in east London where her children have no room to play.
“It is really sad that there is nothing available for someone in my position,” she said. “I genuinely thought that being a teacher I would be OK. To think that the government cannot do better for me and my children is really terrible.”
The new research by Shelter has found that inone in four areas of England, the combination of rising rents and the benefit freeze means families with one or two children living in a two-bedroom rented home and claiming housing benefit will have to find at least £100 extra rent a month over the next year.
In many parts of southern England the shortfalls will be more than £200 a month. In London they will rise in areas such as Tower Hamlets, Greenwich and Hackney to nearer £400 a month. In Camden, the shortfall will be over £600 a month, rising to £1,252 in Kensington and Chelsea.
The housing benefit cap was first announced by George Osborne as part of a drive to cut £10bn from the benefits bill. But the policy is backfiring, and hitting those in work and landing local authorities with the bill for emergency housing for the homeless.
The number of households that have become homeless after an eviction over the past year is up 12% compared with a year ago at 18,820 while the total number of households in temporary accommodation has risen to 74,630, up 9% on a year earlier. Eviction by private landlord is now the most common cause of homelessness.
Roger Harding, director of communications, policy and campaigns at Shelter, told the Observer: “We have grave concerns that the current freeze on housing benefit is pushing hundreds of thousands of private renters perilously close to breaking point at a time when homelessness is rising. For those hit by the freeze, housing benefit is failing to bridge the widening gap between escalating private rents and incomes that simply can't keep up.
“Whether you're a struggling family, or a young person on a low-paid zero-hour contract, in many areas of the country you'll face a grim uphill battle to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. And if you have to move, you'll find it extremely tough to find a landlord prepared to accept a rent you can afford.
“With next week's spring budget looming large, we're calling on the government to abandon the freeze in the short term or risk making more people homeless. Ultimately, if the government wants to cut the welfare bill in the long term, they should concentrate their efforts on building genuinely affordable homes that low earners can actually afford.”
Shelter calculated the maximum amount of local housing allowance (the name for housing benefit claimed by private renters) that households would be eligible for in 2017-18, and then set this against the cost of renting in different parts of the country to establish the deficits people would face.
The alarm has also been sounded by the Local Government Association in its official submission to government ahead of the budget. It points out that the failure to build sufficient affordable homes over the last few decades has driven ever more people into expensive rented accommodation, which has to be topped up with housing benefit. When renters find they can no longer meet the costs, the local authorities are statutorily obliged to find them emergency accommodation.
The LGA submission says: “It is local government that is picking up the pieces from the long-term failure to build homes that are affordable for families … placing more families in expensive temporary accommodation [and] costing councils £3.5bn in the last five years, rising 43% in that time.”
In many parts of London the problem has reached “breaking point”, according to the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville. In his area, the average price of a home has increased by 82% in the past five years, with rises higher than anywhere in the country in the past 20 years. Private rent now averages £1,800 a month for a two-bedroom flat, a 34% increase since 2011. Shelter calculates that in Hackney Hackney families renting a two-bedroom home and claiming housing benefit will face a shortfall of £383.51 a month in 2017/18 as a result of rent rises and benefit freezes.
Glanville said: “This means there will be more people who cannot find the extra and who are at risk of being evicted. People assume that it is the unemployed who end up in emergency accommodation but it is so much broader than that. We are finding it is people who are in in work, who are striving and key jobs, such as teachers, nurses and trainee police officers. I don't know how the government expects people to go out to work, take their children to school and then return to one room.”
Today, in a letter to the Observer, the heads of 15 charities and other organisations representing vulnerable people with mental health and other conditions that mean they live in “supported housing” – whose rental costs are currently covered by housing benefit – voice their concern about the impact of proposed cuts on the most needy.
“Such housing provides safe and independent long- or short-term support for people with learning disabilities, women and children escaping domestic violence, older people, people living with mental illness, people who are homeless and others,” they say.
“Until now, they could rely on housing benefit to cover their rent and some service charges. Yet, under government plans, their benefit will be capped by an arbitrary formula and most will need a top-up from their local authority to fund this crucial help. As local councils already face vast budget cuts, this will cause problems and uncertainty. The current funding system is not perfect, but the proposed system jeopardises the wellbeing and safety of many vulnerable people – the human and financial costs could be great.
“This can only spell bad news for our NHS, care and other public services left to pick up the pieces. We urge the government to give the people who rely on supported housing a guarantee that they can access this housing in the future.This requires a new fair funding system that recognises the higher cost of this housing and is built on the actual needs of vulnerable people.”
Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: “Homelessness in England has risen for the sixth year running, while temporary accommodation and B&B placements are up 52% and 250% respectively since 2009/10.
“We need housing benefit that actually covers the cost of renting, a stronger focus on preventing homelessness, and more support made available to homeless people trying to find a home to rent. At the same time, we need decisive action to make renting more accessible and affordable, along with radical solutions to tackle the severe shortage of truly affordable homes.”
The Department for Work and Pensions said: “The changes to housing benefit are restoring fairness and ensuring there are no perverse disincentives that trap people on benefits. But we understand that there are some people who will need additional support. That is why we are providing £870m in discretionary housing payments to support those who need it the most. Even with the reforms, we continue to spend £24bn a year on housing benefit.”

The Python subprocess module is a powerful swiss-army knife for launching and interacting with child processes. It comes with several high-level APIs like call , check_output and (starting with Python 3.5) run that are focused at child processes our program runs and waits to complete.
In this post I want to discuss a variation of this task that is less directly addressed - long-running child processes. Think about testing some server - for example an HTTP server. We launch it as a child process, then connect clients to it and run some testing sequence. When we're done we want to shut down the child process in an orderly way. This would be difficult to achieve with APIs that just run a child process to completion synchronously, so we'll have to look at some of the lower-level APIs.
Sure, we could launch a child process with subprocess.run in one thread and interact with it (via a known port, for example) in another thread. But this would make it tricky to cleanly terminate the child process when we're done with it. If the child process has an orderly termination sequence (such as sending some sort of "quit" command), this is doable. But most servers do not, and will just spin forever until killed. This is the use-case this post addresses.
Launch, interact, terminate and get all output when done The first, the simplest use case will be launching an HTTP server, interacting with it, terminating it cleanly and getting all the server's stdout and stderr when done. Here are the important bits of the code (all full code samples for this post are available here), tested with Python 3.6: def main (): proc = subprocess . Popen ([ 'python3' , '-u' , '-m' , 'http.server' , '8070' ], stdout = subprocess . PIPE , stderr = subprocess . STDOUT ) try : time . sleep ( 0.2 ) resp = urllib . request . urlopen ( 'http://localhost:8070' ) assert b 'Directory listing' in resp . read () finally : proc . terminate () try : outs , _ = proc . communicate ( timeout = 0.2 ) print ( '== subprocess exited with rc =' , proc . returncode ) print ( outs . decode ( 'utf-8' )) except subprocess . TimeoutExpired : print ( 'subprocess did not terminate in time' ) The child process is an HTTP server using Python's own http.server module, serving contents from the directory it was launched in. We use the low-level Popen API to launch the process asynchronously (meaning that Popen returns immediately and the child process runs in the background). Note the -u passed to Python on invocation: this is critical to avoid stdout buffering and seeing as much of stdout as possible when the process is killed. Buffering is a serious issue when interacting with child processes, and we'll see more examples of this later on. The meat of the sample happens in the final block. proc.terminate() sends the child process a SIGTERM signal. Then, proc.communicate waits for the child to exit and captures all of its stdout. communicate has a very convenient timeout argument starting with Python 3.3 , letting us know if the child does not exit for some reason. A more sophisticated technique could be to send the child a SIGKILL (with proc.kill ) if it didn't exit due to SIGTERM . If you run this script, you'll see the output: $ python3.6 interact-http-server.py == subprocess exited with rc = -15 Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8070 (http://0.0.0.0:8070/) ... 127.0.0.1 - - [05/Jul/2017 05:48:34] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 - The return code of the child is -15 (negative means terminated by a signal, 15 is the numeric code for SIGTERM ). The stdout was properly captured and printed out.
Launch, interact, get output in real time, terminate A related use case is getting the stdout of a child process in "real-time" and not everything together at the end. Here we have to be really careful about buffering, because it can easily bite and deadlock the program. Linux processes are usually line-buffered in interactive mode and fully buffered otherwise. Very few processes are fully unbuffered. Therefore, reading stdout in chunks of less than a line is not recommended, in my opinion. Really, just don't do it. Standard I/O is meant to be used in a line-wise way (think of how all the Unix command-line tools work); if you need sub-line granularity, stdout is not the way to go (use a socket or something). Anyway, to our example: def output_reader ( proc ): for line in iter ( proc . stdout . readline , b '' ): print ( 'got line: {0}' . format ( line . decode ( 'utf-8' )), end = '' ) def main (): proc = subprocess . Popen ([ 'python3' , '-u' , '-m' , 'http.server' , '8070' ], stdout = subprocess . PIPE , stderr = subprocess . STDOUT ) t = threading . Thread ( target = output_reader , args = ( proc ,)) t . start () try : time . sleep ( 0.2 ) for i in range ( 4 ): resp = urllib . request . urlopen ( 'http://localhost:8070' ) assert b 'Directory listing' in resp . read () time . sleep ( 0.1 ) finally : proc . terminate () try : proc . wait ( timeout = 0.2 ) print ( '== subprocess exited with rc =' , proc . returncode ) except subprocess . TimeoutExpired : print ( 'subprocess did not terminate in time' ) t . join () The sample is similar except for how stdout is handled; there's no more calls to communicate ; instead, proc.wait just waits for the child to exit (after SIGTERM has been sent). A thread polls the child's stdout attribute, looping as long as new lines are available and printing them immediately. If you run this sample, you'll notice that the child's stdout is reported in real-time, rather than as one lump at the end. The iter(proc.stdout.readline, b'') snippet is continously calling proc.stdout.readline() , until this call returns an empty bytestring. This only happens when proc.stdout is closed, which occurs when the child exits. Thus, while it may seem like the reader thread might never terminate - it always will! As long as the child process is running, the thread will dutifully block on that readline ; as soon as the child terminates, the readline call returns b'' and the thread exits. If we don't want to just print the captured stdout, but rather do something with it (such as look for expected patterns), this is easy to organize with Python's thread-safe queue. The reader thread becomes: def output_reader ( proc , outq ): for line in iter ( proc . stdout . readline , b '' ): outq . put ( line . decode ( 'utf-8' )) And we launch it with: outq = queue . Queue () t = threading . Thread ( target = output_reader , args = ( proc , outq )) t . start () Then at any point we can check if there's stuff in the queue by using its non-blocking mode (the full code sample is here): try : line = outq . get ( block = False ) print ( 'got line from outq: {0}' . format ( line ), end = '' ) except queue . Empty : print ( 'could not get line from queue' )
Direct interaction with the child's stdin and stdout This sample is getting into dangerous waters; the subprocess module documentation warns against doing the things described here due to possible deadlocks, but sometimes there's simply no choice! Some programs like using their stdin and stdout for interaction. Alternatively, you may have a program with an interactive (interpreter) mode you'd like to test - like the Python interepreter itself. Sometimes it's OK to feed this program all its input at once and then check its output; this can, and should be done with communicate - the perfect API for this purpose. It properly feeds stdin, closes it when done (which signals many interactive programs that game's over), etc. But what if we really want to provide additional input based on some previous output of the child process. Here goes: def main (): proc = subprocess . Popen ([ 'python3' , '-i' ], stdin = subprocess . PIPE , stdout = subprocess . PIPE , stderr = subprocess . PIPE ) # To avoid deadlocks: careful to: add
to output, flush output, use # readline() rather than read() proc . stdin . write ( b '2+2
' ) proc . stdin . flush () print ( proc . stdout . readline ()) proc . stdin . write ( b 'len("foobar")
' ) proc . stdin . flush () print ( proc . stdout . readline ()) proc . stdin . close () proc . terminate () proc . wait ( timeout = 0.2 ) Let me reiterate what the comment in this code sample is saying: When sending input to a line interpreter, don't forget to send the actual newline.
Always flush the stream after placing data into it, since it may be buffered.
Use readline to get input from the line interpreter. We have to be very careful to avoid the following situation: We send data to the child's stdin, but it doesn't get the complete input for some reason (lack of newline, buffering etc.) We then invoke readline to wait for the reply. Since the child is still waiting for input to complete (step 1), our step 2 may hang forever. This is a classic deadlock. In the end of the interaction, we close the child's stdin (this is optional but useful for some kinds of child processes) call terminate and then wait . It would be better to send the child process some sort of "exit" command ( quit() in the case of the Python interpreter); to terminate here is to demonstrate what we have to do if the other options are unavailable. Note that we could also use communicate here instead of wait to capture the stderr output.
Interact using non-blocking reads and stoppable threads The final sample demonstrates a slighly more advanced scenario. Suppose we're testing a long-lived socket server, and we're interested in orchestrating complex interactions with it, perhaps with multiple concurrent clients. We'll also want a clean shut-down of the whole setup of threads and child processes. The full code sample is here; what follows are a couple of representative snippets. The key ingredient is this socket reading function, meant to be run in its own thread: def socket_reader ( sockobj , outq , exit_event ): while not exit_event . is_set (): try : buf = sockobj . recv ( 1 ) if len ( buf ) < 1 : break outq . put ( buf ) except socket . timeout : continue except OSError as e : break Best used with a socket that has a timeout set on it, this function will repeatedly monitor the socket for new data and push everything it receives into outq , which is a queue.Queue . The function exits when either the socket is closed ( recv returns an empty bytestring), or when exit_event (a threading.Event ) is set by the caller. The caller can launch this function in a thread and occasionally try to read new items from the queue in a non-blocking way: try : v = outq . get ( block = False ) print ( v ) except queue . Empty : break When all is done, the caller can set the exit Event to stop the thread (the thread will stop on its own if the socket it's reading from is closed, but the event lets us control this more directly).
You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you can get free pizza on Reddit. And there, in the Random Acts of Pizza subreddit (tagline: “Restoring Faith in Humanity, One Slice at a Time”), Stanford computer scientists say they've found the perfect conditions for a natural experiment in human altruism.
“We were kind of interested in what happens if you ask for a favor online. What factors influence the success?” says Tim Althoff, one of the co-authors of the Stanford study. “This Random Acts of Pizza community is really unique because it naturally controls for confounds. It controls for these incentives, because you don't receive anything back.”
Random Acts of Pizza is indeed unique. It's where broke, hungry students can go while cramming for finals and ask a random Samaritan for a double-cheese, please. It's where out-of-work dads request a pizza to feed the kids until the next unemployment check. But not all pizzas are distributed equally. Althoff and his colleagues wanted to see how language had an effect on these requests–what strategies were people using that won them pizza, in the end?
After analyzing 5,700 free pizza requests, the researchers discovered that free pizza corresponded with a hierarchy of needs. The unemployed were most likely to receive free pizza, followed up by poor families. The least likely to eat pizza for free were the people who posted because they simply had a drunk hankering for it. Makes sense.
But researchers discovered a few other interesting factors, too. While they thought that shorter requests for pizza might be more effective, longer word counts actually proved more successful. So was expressing gratitude. Pledging to pay it forward was also another highly rewarding technique. Users who ended their requests by promising to do the same for someone else received more free pizza than those who didn't. But at the same time, researchers discovered, only 10% of the people who said they would return the favor actually did.
Unlike crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter, Random Acts of Pizza doesn't give out rewards for delivering someone else a pizza. Only warm fuzzies. And researchers say that because of these unique conditions, they'll be able to apply their techniques to even more communities like Reddit. They've set their sights on online philanthropy communities like DonorsChoose, in which people can donate to individual public school teachers' classroom projects.
“We hope that practical implications are that if you understand what factors are important, maybe you set up a community in a way in which people help each other out effectively. What are the factors that are important that you should incorporate into your writing to be successful?” Althoff says. “You can also do that with automatic techniques, automatic tools that could that help you check your writing.”
