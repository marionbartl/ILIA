Researchers analyzed 31 review studies from 1978 to 2014 and established that research funding from both the sugar industry and artificial sweetener companies was more likely to lead to biased conclusions on sweetener's effects on weight loss. This research comes after documents released earlier this month revealed the sugar industry paid off scientists in the 1960 's and 70's to downplay sugar's role in obesity and focus on saturated fat instead.We speak with Lisa Bero from the University of Sydney, who studied industry impact in artificial sweetener and sugar research . They told us why conflict of interest is one reason the safety of artificial sweeteners is still so controversial.We examined reviews of studies on the beneficial effects of artificial sweeteners on weight loss and reviews that looked at potentially harmful effects, such as diabetes. We identified 31 relevant reviews and found that reviews funded by artificial sweetener companies were about 17 times more likely to have results that favor artificial sweeteners. This is significant as the data found in these studies is used to develop dietary guidelines. These studies were also likely to have more favorable conclusions than those that were independently funded.Four reviews we looked at were funded by “competitor companies” that marketed sugary drinks or water, with all four of these reviews having conclusions that did not favor artificial sweeteners. This demonstrates that it is important to be critical of reviews that are funded by any food or beverage related industry, not just the artificial sweetener or sugar industry. Additionally, about one third of the reviews did not even disclose their funding sources, so transparency around author conflict of interest and research funding sources for this area of nutrition research is lagging behind other fields.When we assessed the quality of the reviews, we found that there was no difference in quality related to funding source. This means that the differences in conclusions and results cannot be captured by the standard tools used to assess quality of reviews, but are likely due to subtle differences in inclusion of data or the interpretation of results.We have a comprehensive sample, not a representative sample. We used systematic review methods, so we attempted to identify all reviews of artificial sweeteners and their effects on obesity, not a sample of them. In our study, we looked at published reviews that included human research studies comparing one or more artificially sweetened beverages to water, sugar sweetened beverages or mixed comparisons where the effects on weight were evaluated as a primary or secondary outcome through BMI score or other measures of overweight and obesity.Yes, in addition to our most recent study on artificial sweeteners, our research group at the Charles Perkins Center has conducted a number of empirical studies demonstrating bias in drug industry, tobacco industry and chemical industry funded studies.Industry can provide financial support for research, but this is a benefit only if the sponsor cannot influence the design, conduct or publication of the research. One way to minimize the influence of any individual sponsor is to put all industry funding into a common fund that is then administered by an independent group that does not involve any of the funders.Feature image: Amy van der Hiel on Flickr
I never compared them to Hitler. The definition of authoritarian is: "favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority, especially that of the government, at the expense of personal freedom." I would certainly argue that Trump has demonstrated this tendency: their decrying of net neutrality, their desire for Apple to hand over the keys to unlock iPhones to the FBI, their desire to execute Snowden for "treason," their statements about opening up libel laws, their mandate for the death penalty for anyone who kills a police officer, their propensity for torture, their statement that soldiers will commit war crimes because Trump is a strong leader, and their treatment of protestors. I would definitely describe them as a nationalist, which is defined as "a person who advocates political independence for a country." Their slogan "America first" and their denouncement of globalism for "Americanism" certainly fits the definition of a nationalist. Their distaste for immigrants (even more educated immigrant groups like those receiving H-1B visas) also fits within the designation of a nationalist. So, according to the definition of fascism ("an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization"), Trump certainly seems to at least somewhat fit within this designation. I never said that every right winger (or even anywhere close to the majority) promote or adhere to fascism. Trump's vein of conservatism is demonstrably closer to fascism than any of their contemporaries.
Another element of many fascist regimes is a quasi-level of worship among the leader's supporters. The term "God emperor" certainly indicates that level of reverence, and it is unseen among any other recent American candidate's followers. "Hilldog" doesn't imply that your candidate is flawless. The refusal of many Trump supporters to admit any faults in their leader is also indicative of the level to which Trump supporters venerate him.

One example that particularly stuck out to me, was the image that associated the European Union with Judaism - with a golden star underneath a sticker of the EU, echo brackets surrounding the name "European Union," and the words six-million written next to it. That imagery certainly harkened back to propaganda seen during the Nazi regime, when Nazis attempted to propagate the idea that Jews secretly control the world. Many images are tagged "deport Islam." Here are several examples of outright racism captured on TheDonald: https://i.reddituploads.com/b1d74b3c72c9414b973f3ff86700c2f1?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=1c7e133af9d0f054ae9b77186ad77c83

A knock at the door... then burglars burst in and battered father of a perfect family
Paul Kohler was left with 'life changing' injuries after being savagely beaten
 They are still in hospital and has undergone six operations to rebuild their face
Mr Kohler had been playing board game with their family when doorbell went
Burglars straddled and punched the lawyer shouting 'where's the money'
Men attempted to use gaffer tape to tie down their screaming wife Samantha
The 50-year-old was held down as three men beat their academic husband
Their daughter and their boyfriend were upstairs and alerted police to the scene
Two 'blood-soaked' men arrested while police hunt the other two suspects
A Polish man, 32, has been charged with GBH and aggravated burglary
A second man, 23, has also appeared before Wimbledon Magistrates' Court
Bloodied: Paul Kohler was left with 'life changing' injuries following the brutal attack at their family home
A top legal academic was savagely beaten when they answered the door of their £2million home to a gang of knife-wielding robbers.
Father of four Paul Kohler, 55, suffered life-changing facial injuries after four masked men leapt on them screaming, ‘Where's the money?'
The university lecturer desperately tried to fight off the ‘sadistic' attackers as they hit their wife and attempted to hood them and tie them to a chair with gaffer tape.
They were probably saved from a worse fate thanks to their daughter who locked themselves in their bedroom after hearing the commotion and dialled 999.
Police raced to the property where they arrested one blood-soaked suspect and another as they cowered underneath a parked car nearby.
Police are still hunting for the two remaining suspects, who are believed to be in their 20s or 30s and of eastern European heritage. They are also looking for a silver VW two-door cabriolet car used as a getaway vehicle.
Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan, who is leading the inquiry, said the house was left ‘covered in blood' in the most brutal assault they have seen in more than 20 years of policing.
Detectives believe Monday night's robbery – as the family played a board game – was well-planned and targeted but are perplexed by the motive behind the ultra-violent attack.
One line of inquiry is that Mr Kohler, who is head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, is the victim of mistaken identity or that the gang simply struck at the wrong house.
A 23-year-old Polish man appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court this morning and was charged with grevious bodily harm and aggravated burglary. They were remanded in custody until August 27 where they will reappear at Kingston Crown Court.
Yesterday, a 32-year-old Polish national was remanded in custody at the same court having also been charged with GBH and aggravated burglary.
Happy family: Mr Kohler is pictured with, from left, their daughters Eloise and Saskia, wife Samantha and daughters Bethany and Tamara.  They are currently undergoing operations in hospital to rebuild their face
Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan, of Merton Burglary Squad, said: 'The victim and their family are distraught and they cannot understand why they were targeted in this way. We believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property.
'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough, and I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area between 21:00-23:00hrs to come forward and speak to us if they heard or saw anything suspicious. We are also seeking information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used.
'The fast response to the 999 call ensured that two suspects were apprehended and the victim could receive immediate first aid.
'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.'
Mr Kohler remained in hospital where they have already undergone six operations to rebuild their face.
They will have to have further reconstructive surgery to repair a shattered eye socket and forehead.
Couple: Mr Kohler (pictured with their wife Samantha), is Head of Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Last night, Samantha said their husband fought tirelessly to survive, saying: 'He was so brave'
Mr Kohler's wife Samantha MacArthur described the attackers as ‘cowardly and wicked' and praised their husband's bravery.
The couple married in April in Jesus College Cambridge where their four daughters were bridesmaids.
Miss MacArthur, 50, said: ‘This was just totally pointless and totally cruel and cowardly. What sort of men, covering their heads, hold a man down and just beat them for no reason?'
‘He is amazingly brave. Three men were beating them up and they didn't stop. They fought the whole way and I'm sure if they hadn't it would have been a lot worse for all of us. It was incredibly traumatic and we are very angry and upset. We have no idea what has happened. We have no reason.'
The attack took place as the couple played a board game with daughter Eloise, 24, and their boyfriend at their home in Wimbledon, south-west London.
Proud parents: Mr Kohler and their wife Samantha are pictured with their daughter Eloise, who dialled 999
Couple: Mr Kohler (left) had gone into the kitchen of their home (right) when they heard the doorbell at about 10pm
During a break in the game, Miss MacArthur and the youngsters went upstairs and Mr Kohler went into the kitchen when they heard the doorbell at around 10pm.
They answered the door to a smartly dressed man who proceeded to pull a balaclava over their face before barging into the house and punching Mr Kohler in the face. Three masked accomplices then charged inside and knocked Mr Kohler to the ground.
One sat astride Mr Kohler's chest and pummelled their face as the others kicked them and attempted to wrap their head in tape.
Miss MacArthur said: ‘I heard them starting to shout “Help” so I ran out of the bedroom and met two masked men on the landing.
CCTV footage in Wimbledon Town Centre shows the suspect running across the street at 10.03pm
Metropolitan Police are appealing to anyone who saw the man or a silver Volkswagen on the night in question
‘One of them pushed me over on to the ground and put clothing over my head. I could just hear Paul shouting, “Why are you doing this?” They were just screaming in pain as they hit me.'
Police arrived at the house in minutes after their daughter locked themselves in their room with their boyfriend and rang 999.
After arresting two men, officers found a trail of discarded stolen property including iPhones, laptop computers and jewellery. A large kitchen knife was also tossed away.
One suspect is a Polish national who travelled to the UK after spending eight years in prison for an unknown offence in their homeland.
Scene: Mr Kohler's daughter was upstairs with their boyfriend in the house in Kings Road, Wimbledon (pictured)
A CCTV camera caught one of the escaped robbers as they ran off towards Wimbledon town centre.
Miss MacArthur, who runs a bar in London's Covent Garden with their husband, said the family is ‘shaken' but added: ‘We stayed at home last night and we are not going to let this stop us living in our own house.'
Mr Kohler's brother Marcus said they had described one of their attackers as a ‘sadist'. Describing Mr Kohler's academic work, they said: ‘He is a force of positive teaching and looks after their students, so this is just totally alien.'

The wreck of a steamship that went down in Georgian Bay during a storm 136 years ago has been found, with what could be human remains onboard.
American shipwreck hunters Jared Daniels, Jerry Eliason and Ken Merryman revealed their summer discovery to coincide with the anniversary of the Jane Miller's sinking Nov. 25, 1881.
The 24-metre package and passenger steamer went down with 25 people aboard, including the crew.
The wreck was found in Colpoys Bay, an inlet of Georgian Bay leading to Wiarton on the east side of the Bruce Peninsula north of Owen Sound in Georgian Bay.
The ship mostly is structurally intact with its mast still standing, rising within 23 metres of the surface. The shipwreck hunters also reported spotting what could be remains of bodies.
Merryman, who's hunted shipwrecks for more than 40 years, said it was exciting to find the missing vessel.
“People call these things time capsules and they absolutely are,” they said from their home in Minnesota.
“That ship took on 10 to 20 tonnes of cargo, so now the archeologists have a snapshot of 1880s life on the Bruce Peninsula with what kinds of things are there.”
Finding the ship is a major discovery for the area, said local marine history author Scott Cameron.
They said there aren't many ships left from that era and it holds substantial archeological significance.
“It certainly tells a story and there is a big story to go with it,” said Cameron.
The Jane Miller was launched in 1879 on Manitoulin Island. Cameron wrote a story about the ship, available on their website at steamboatstories.ca.
The coastal steamer ran between Collingwood and Manitoulin with stops along the way, taking on passengers, farm goods and other freight.
“Rather cranky,” the ship was short and stumpy with a high profile and shallow draft that made it roll heavily in stormy seas and made it difficult to handle, Cameron writes. The night it sank it carried a heavy load from Owen Sound to Meaford, where more freight and passengers were picked up.
Witnesses on shore last saw what was assumed to be the Jane Miller heading toward Wiarton.
The hunters aren't disclosing exactly where or how far down they found the wreck, to allow government officials time to determine how to proceed with preservation and protection.
The wreck was found upright, all but one of its davits that held the lifeboats still standing.
The hull and main deck cabins are intact, but the upper cabins have collapsed.
Their Ontario permit didn't allow the hunters to enter the wreck, but they saw what could be bodies.
In a post at scubaboard.com, Daniel said they made out 16 bodies in different parts of the ship, while Merryman said identification was difficult because of mussel encrustation.
“I kind of suspected we might see human remains, and maybe we did, but it was hard to tell from the zebra mussels,” said Merryman. “It is hard to say.”
Merryman and Eliason have hunted wrecks together for about 27 years and found 20 working together.
Merryman, a founder of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Preservation Society, said history told them the Jane Miller went down between Big Bay, at the mouth of Colpoys Bay inlet, and what was Spencer's dock. They looked past the dock location, theorizing the captain might have shot past it in order to drift into Wiarton.
It was on about the second or third pass that their sonar picked up the wreck.
“We found it fairly quick and it was in a diveable depth,” said Merryman. “Nowadays, that is fairly unusual. We weren't expecting that.”

George Osborne shocked smokers with a higher than expected hike in the duty on cigarettes today.
The Chancellor ordered an increase of five per cent above the rate of inflation, effective from 6pm tonight.
The hike today will see prices will go up 37p. They have previously pledged to hike tobacco duty, as part of an escalator lasting until 2014, by at least 2 per cent above the rate of inflation every year.
Drinkers will also face added pain with the Chancellor confirming that alcohol will be subject to a rise in duty of 5.7 per cent – this will see the price of a pint of beer rise by an average 5.4p, effective from March 26.

Cigarettes and alcohol: Prices of cigarettes will go up 37p from 6pm tonight
The average bottle of wine will now rise by 9p to around £5 for the first time, according to industry figures, with duty increasing from £1.81 for every bottle, to £1.90.
Drinkers and smokers have faced steep increases in duty in recent years after the 2010 Budget set two years of rises at inflation (the higher Retail Prices Index measure) plus two per cent.
The rise of five per cent plus inflation on the cost of cigarettes will answer the call by health campaigners to increase prices, as the cost of smoking related illness to the NHS remains one of the highest.
The Chancellor said: 'Smoking remains the biggest cause of preventable illness in this country.
'There is strong evidence that increasing the price of cigarettes deters people from smoking.'
Economists believe that an extra one per cent in alcohol duty benefits the Government finances by £60million and £30million is gained from adding one per cent to cigarette duty.
The extra revenue will help to offset raising the income tax threshold for millions of workers, which will cost the Treasury £3billion a year.
Increase on alcohol duty is being introduced under the duty escalator announced in 2008 by the previous Government. Beer taxes have increased 42 per cent since the Budget that year.
The 'sin taxes' come despite official inflation figures showing that prices of alcohol had leapt by 2.6 per cent in February — the biggest ever increase for the month.
The latest inflation figures published yesterday show the rate of inflation on most types of alcoholic drink has risen significantly since December 2011.
The rises are likely to anger those in the pub and brewing industry who have accused the Coalition of putting up to 1million jobs at risk with the changes.
Research in parliamentary constituencies showed that London and Westminster had the most pub-based jobs in the country at 11,000, followed by Manchester Central (5,700), Birmingham Ladywood (5,500) and Liverpool Riverside (5,300).
It added that the beer and pub trade adds more than £21billion to the UK economy every year and £13.4billion in UK wages are dependent on the trade each year.
Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: 'This is a huge lost opportunity to put British jobs and pubs first. Beer tax has now risen by 42 per cent since the misguided ‘escalator' policy was introduced just four years ago.
'It means the loss of over 5,000 jobs this year, and hundreds of pub closures.'

The Summer of 2013 has descended upon the Portland Trail Blazers. Normally off-season vacation means a relief from day-to-day stress, punctuated by a few high points. For the Blazers the stress is just starting.
This team had it easy during the regular reason. Low expectations, a season spent kicking the tires on their rookies...how could they lose? It boiled down to an 82-game experiment, a time to take stock, explore lingering questions. The waiting is over now. Whether they Blazers have the answers or not, they're going to have to make decisions this summer that will make or break their future. Consider how many issues they face:
1. Don't look now, but LaMarcus Aldridge has only two years remaining on their slightly-less-than-max-level contract. Normally two years is half an eternity in the NBA, but Aldridge's contract just got radioactive. The Blazers have to be concerned about its half life. We don't know the ending of the Aldridge saga in Portland but we do know that the Blazers cannot allow them to walk away without compensation. Next summer the Blazers and Aldridge will choose between two outcomes: extension and trade. That moment will brand this franchise for the foreseeable future both on the court and on the cap roll.
The Blazers will need to know whether they're capable of building enough of a roster around Aldridge to make a deep playoff run. Aldridge will need convincing as well. He'll turn 29 in the summer of 2014. The next contract they sign will exhaust their NBA prime. As one of the premier power forwards in the league he's not likely to sign for less than a max deal and he's not likely to sign with a team that's not going anywhere. The Blazers will need to pony up in both departments to get them to forego the free agency experiment and marry themselves to them.
2. Barring a total meltdown and team restructuring, this summer will carry two significant "lasts" for the team: last time with this much cap space, last lottery pick. Talent-for-talent the Blazers will rise to a more advantageous trade position in the future, but that's it. They'll never be able to execute the kind of unbalanced trades they can achieve this summer. They'll not have the cash for free-agent signings. If they're this high in the lottery again something went wrong.
3. This is Neil Olshey's second summer pushing the buttons while sitting in the chair from which two predecessors were abruptly ejected. I do not have any sense that Paul Allen is considering jettisoning Olshey, but that story could change.
The Blazers had significant cap space last summer. Quick, name Olshey's successful free-agent signings. If you're not scratching your head right now, you must be Neil Olshey. Charisma and the ability to lure players to Portland are Olshey's supposed strong points. If they should come up empty again their ability and credibility will be called into doubt...and rightly so. Blazer fans (and one would presume Blazer bosses) have been promised a coherent, if not wonderful, strategy since Olshey came on board. Will anybody believe that's true if the team can't land its man (or men) this summer? Unless we're dazzled within the next few months Olshey's seat will become uncomfortably hot in the court of public opinion if not in actuality.
4. It goes without saying that the Blazers will never be in more desperate need than they are right now. Or at least they better not be in more desperate need. They'd probably need to add 6 guys to the rotation to make a credible second-round threat. They might have .5 of those 6 on the roster already. (Note there was a decimal point in there.) They're not going to be able to get all half-dozen at once but they absolutely, positively need 2 players who instantly raise the level of the roster plus another strategic veteran with their room exception and/or a promising rookie with that draft pick. The only substitute would be a bona fide star in place of any 2 of those assets. If they come up short of that target we're looking at another season of intolerably high minutes for the core group and fading success for the team as a whole.
If you're getting the sense that the odds are stacked against the Blazers, you may be right. The stakes are high, the needs great, and nothing is guaranteed. The last time this franchise saw a summer with this combination of importance and uncertainty was 2007. That's when the Blazers held the #1 overall pick and had to choose between Greg Oden and Kevin Durant. No single choice the team faces this summer will be that weighty but the sum total will certainly shape the franchise for the next 4-5 years. They'll either be heading for the next (much closer to final) step in a big buildup or putting one and a half of their feet on the slippery slide to a tear-down.
This off-season could be a dream come true or it could be a nightmare. Likely the team and its fans will end up having to compromise with something in between. Whichever way it goes, it's guaranteed to be interesting.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — It's been almost a year since President Donald Trump won the election, and a group of people strongly opposed to their presidency rallied nationwide to re-energize the anti-Trump movement.
A crowd gathered at Thomas Paine Plaza Saturday afternoon as the group “Refuse Fascism” held a rally, where about 100 people or so listened to speakers before marching through Center City.
The same group held rallies in other cities around the country, and they say it's not just a one-time event.
“We're out here today beginning daily protests, raising the demand that this nightmare must end, the Trump/Pence regime must go,” said Refuse Fascism organizer Samantha Goldman. “We're beginning a movement that is going to drive them from power through non-violent political resistance.”
It was mostly peaceful until a little skirmish, where an argument involving three people went from words, to spit, to a tackle and handcuffs.
Currently, Philadelphia Police say there were no arrests related to the protest.
The president left the U.S. on Saturday for a three-week trip to Asia.

Updated story: Investigators begin recovery efforts in deadly Southeast Alaska plane crash
All nine people aboard a flightseeing tour, eight of them passengers on a Holland America Line cruise ship, died Thursday in a plane crash near Ketchikan, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
Alaska State Troopers in Ketchikan got a report at 2:06 p.m. that the float-equipped DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter was overdue. Officials tracked an emergency locator transmitter that was activated in the vicinity of Misty Fjords National Monument, said Clint Johnson, NTSB Alaska chief.
Promech Air, a Ketchikan-based charter and sightseeing service, operated the plane and said in a statement late Thursday that the cause of the crash remained under investigation.
Troopers reported that a Temsco Helicopters pilot spotted the downed plane about 800 feet above Ella Lake against a granite rock face, troopers said. Alaska State Troopers, the Coast Guard and the Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad responded to the crash site.
The plane crashed in "an area of steep, mountainous terrain about 25 miles northeast of Ketchikan," NTSB said in a statement.
By 8 p.m., Johnson had confirmed that all nine people onboard the plane had died.
Troopers said search-and-rescue workers reached the crash site around 6 p.m. and confirmed the deaths of the eight passengers and pilot. Due to bad weather, they will not attempt to recover the bodies until Friday.
The identities of those killed in the crash will not be released until their relatives have been notified, troopers said.
"There is nothing I can say that can alleviate the pain and overwhelming sense of loss that we and the loved ones of those affected are feeling," Marcus Sessoms, president of Promech Air, said in a statement. "At this moment, all of us share the pain and anguish of this terrible event. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to everyone touched by this tragedy."
Holland America Line said in a statement earlier Thursday that Promech owned the plane that crashed and was operating a shore excursion sold through the cruise line.
"We are incredibly distressed by this situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with those onboard the plane and their families," the statement said. "Holland America Line is extending its full support to traveling companions of the guests involved."
The eight passengers had been aboard the Westerdam on a seven-day round-trip cruise that left Seattle on June 20, the statement said. On Thursday afternoon, the ship was docked in Ketchikan.
Promech Air said in a statement that the DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter single-engine plane that crashed was one of five Otters it operated.
"The Magnificent Misty Fjords by Floatplane" is one of several tours offered by Promech Air, according to the company's website. The cost is listed at $229 per person for about a two-hour trip, which includes a 10-minute water landing on a lake or fjord.
NTSB said it was sending a team from its Alaska regional office, led by investigator Brice Banning, to investigate the crash.
Chris John of the Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad said 13 volunteers with the organization went out to search the scene of the crash Thursday in two helicopters and two floatplanes. They described conditions as "very turbulent" with winds around 25 mph.
"The conditions were really steep," John said. "It was a bad crash site."
Jerry Kiffer, president of the rescue squad, said the plane was heavily damaged in the crash. It sat upright on a 60-degree slope at the base of a cliff when the responding crews arrived.
"It's kind of hanging on the side of the mountain," Kiffer said. "The floats, of course, are broken off and it's actually (lying) on top of the floats with the tail hanging out over about a 30- or so foot drop."
Those responding to the crash, they said, will likely have to use rope to steady the plane before rescue efforts move forward.
"We'll have to do some stabilization and get the aircraft safe to get inside before we start moving the victims," they said.
The National Weather Service reported scattered rain showers from about 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Thursday at Ketchikan International Airport, with winds between 6 mph and 17 mph. Wind gusts hit 26 mph around noon, according to the weather service.

A few months ago, on a blistering day in Melbourne, Australia, I found myself standing outside an open rental inspection. Having cycled 40 minutes from Carlton North to Kensington to see the place, I was a sweaty sight. I'd made an effort to dress for the occasion because, at a previous viewing, a friend overheard the agent say they wouldn't give a house to anyone who looked like me—someone with gender dysphoria.
With this in mind, I'd worn a hat under my
helmet to hide my shaved head and left my nose ring at home. I'd briefly
considered wearing a dress, but remembered I had thrown my last one out months ago—dresses make me feel like I'm wearing a weird Halloween
costume.
These are some of the more straightforward ways that applying for houses as a trans person can be a psychological mindfuck. But if you're also unemployed, don't have a considerable sum in your bank account, and can't easily pass as someone cis-gendered, you're at the end of an even more depressing set of statistics.
A recent analysis of housing in Australia reported: "Singles on welfare are among the most disadvantaged looking for housing, with less than one percent of properties affordable." Sally Goldner from Trans Victoria believes those numbers are compounded if you're transgendered. "There's a vicious cycle going on," they said. "There's a greater risk of trans people being homeless. There's a greater risk of police harassment. Once you start having these multiple disadvantages, it can be harder to pull out of the cycle."
Standing at the rental I knew I wouldn't get, homelessness felt very close at hand. In Australia, the bulk of organizations working with the homeless are religious. It may sound pessimistic, but for any trans person who has sought help from the usual agencies, discrimination is a familiar outcome.
In Australia, if an organization is registered as a religious charity, it's exempt from the Equal Opportunity Act of 2010. According to Sally, the problem is deep-rooted. "Even if the people at the roots of an organization disagree with those running it, the attitudes of those at the top mean trans people are less likely to access assistance," they said. While there is a move to be increasingly inclusive of LGBTI individuals, there's currently no legislative drive to ensure it.
A transgender friend of mine, Robin, describes the experience of homelessness as being "like quicksand." Once you're homeless, it's brutally difficult to get out of it. "Because I didn't have a home, I wasn't eligible for rent assistance. Without a fixed address, it's difficult to apply for any form of financial assistance. Without assistance, it's almost impossible to get enough money together to start a new lease."
These are all practical, frustrating, bureaucratic issues. But they're aggravated by conscious or unconscious stigmas. During one session with a Centrelink Job Provider, Robin says they were advised to "stop wearing women's clothing" if they wanted to be more employable.
Despite that ignorant suggestion, Robin did claim to have a positive experience with Centrelink, but felt the social workers wanting to help were trapped in a framework that rendered homeless trans people invisible. "It's easier to pretend we don't exist because if it's acknowledged, then they would have to do something about the problems." Robin said.
At a crisis center in Melbourne, Merinda regularly works with people who are, or have been, homeless. A large part of their job is finding them accommodation. They told me most of the time the most realistic housing options are private rooming houses. However, there are issues with the lack of regulations around them and they can be unsafe, unsanitary, and disproportionately expensive.
Merinda acts as a go-between and is sometimes asked by their clients to enquire if the rooms available are safe for trans people. Often the responses are disturbing.
"I had one guy saying, 'Is it a or a?' And asking personal questions about anatomy. I said it wasn't really relevant. I was met with, 'I'm not letting that freak live here,'" Merinda said.
For me, I considered the likelihood of ending up in one of these rooms and it felt unlikely. Then again, it can happen to anyone, like it did for my friend Jessie. It was only ever meant to be temporary. Jessie went from having a permanent base to staying with friends. Gradually everything they owned was spread out across Melbourne as they bounced from house to house. Things like making sure there were clean clothes got harder, as did organize which friends had space for furniture and personal belongings.
It got to a point where they would post on Facebook every day asking for a couch to sleep on. Each post getting slightly more embarrassed and gently desperate as the support and assistance dwindled over time. Eventually a private rooming house was their only option.
The difficulty with talking about homelessness in the transgender community is that the bigotry and lack of understanding that make it difficult to get a job (or hold it) is the same bigotry that puts you last when applying for housing. Standing in that Kensington house, without even filling in an application form, I could already feel the knock-on effects of what it would mean to not get this house, or the next one, or the next.
Giving my details to the agent, I smiled and shook their hand. I got on my bike and cycled home under the still-hot sun. I lay down on my bed and drank as much water as I could. I knew my house would come eventually. But I knew it wouldn't be that one.

Patricia Brown, seated second from right, struggles with a computer assessment program at the Center for Workforce Innovation in Richmond. Helping them is Sherrilyn Hicks, a CWI worker seated first from the right. The CWI is a city effort designed to match people with jobs in the Richmond area. Approaching from the rear of the room is the program director, Jamison Manion. (Timothy C. Wright/For the Washington Post)
The story is part of Richmond: The legacy of poverty, an ongoing Storyline series on the city's ambitious plan to combat poverty and confront its past. We've created a Facebook group to discuss unemployment, underemployment and poverty in America – and what cities can be doing to help. To share your experiences or follow the conversation, join here.
Read Part One, Part Two, and Part Three. Read more about national policy, including lifetime benefits caps and job-training.
RICHMOND — By the time Patricia Brown reached their lifetime limit on federal welfare benefits in August, at least 544 other recipients in Virginia this year had maxed out before them
A year before that, 1,050 recipients ran out their 60-month clocks, and a year before that, 918.
All in all, in the last five and half years, about 4,300 people in Virginia hit their lifetime limits. The roll, now at its lowest point since welfare reform went into effect in 1997, is about 27,000 cases. People come off and on, some with greater needs than others, though the trajectory is steadily downward.
Those who were able-bodied and had been enrolled in the welfare-to-work program generally found low-skilled, low-wage jobs, the kind of work that requires two jobs to support a family or ongoing public assistance through food stamps, subsidized housing and health insurance. How many kept that work is unknown, as is what happened to those pushed off the rolls without a job waiting.
“I wish we had more data on what happens to people after they leave. Do they stay stagnant? Do they slowly progress? Does the challenge become too great for them?” says Mark Golden, manager of Economic Assistance and Employment for the Virginia Department of Social Services.
The goal is to see that welfare recipients never hit the lifetime limit, and that they leave the rolls prepared for work, banking time they don't need should harder days return. This is one reason Virginia structures its welfare-to-work program as it does: two years on assistance, two years off, two years on, two years off, one year on. It's one of the few states to set up an intermittent clock with mandated breaks.
“It creates a sense of urgency for the participants and for staff working with that client, as well, knowing you have two years before you're pushed off the rolls,” Golden says. “Most people cycle through very quickly. They're on for six months and then they find a job.”
But this is one of those policies that Jamison Manion, director of Richmond's Center for Workforce Innovation, finds more harmful than helpful when it comes to finding decent-paying jobs for people who have little education. “Two years is just not enough of an on-ramp for people,” Manion says.
Manion has added the two-year clock to their list of short-sighted federal and state policies. It sits alongside their exposition earlier this week on the nature of federal policies that are quick to penalize those walking the tightrope from public assistance to self-reliance.
 They are not alone in their ire.
“If you really want to grow people out of poverty, you can't cut their lifelines off,” says city councilwoman Ellen Robertson, a leader in Richmond's massive effort to reduce its poverty (of which the workforce innovation is the centerpiece). “We need to move them to sustainability with lifeline services, and then we can start talking about how to get them beyond that. And we need to get beyond the myth that people of poverty want to be poor because it's an easy way to live.”
So, who, generally speaking, are those who reach the 60-month limit and why? In the lingo of welfare reform, they are often called the “hard to serve.” Fair warning, when LaDonna Pavetti, vice president for family income support policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says the answer is “really depressing,” it's really depressing.
Pavetti was lead author of a 2006 paper that looked at the results of a project in Ramsey County, Minn., that offered intensive, individual help to welfare recipients zeroing in the last months of their cash public assistance. It included diagnostic tests, home visits and extensive interviews.
“What they found were many more mental health issues, cognitive issues and disabilities than they had anticipated and that they had missed for five years,” Pavetti says.
Some findings from the 2006 study: “Unable to perform simple, one-column multiplication and division. Unable to recognize and name any printed number from 1-12. Unable to differentiate between numeric values. Unable to state the day of week or month, or tell time.”
Also common: Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress — sometimes related to domestic violence or sexual abuse — undiagnosed or untreated mental illness, language barriers and bodies worn out by years of physical labor.
Obviously, this is a subset of those who live in poverty. Still, it underscores the magnitude of the challenge Richmond has undertaken — and the limits to what it can do within the confines of federal and state policies that determine who gets what social supports and for how long.
Brown suffered from undiagnosed depression and anxiety, but they are treating it now. They scored high on the workforce center's reading and writing tests. The cleaning company that just hired last week gave them more hours. Them monthly paycheck will be more than triple their welfare benefit.
Some people don't leave the safety net because it provides security in uncertain times. Some don't leave because they can't. Lives are complicated. Not a day goes by at the workforce center that staff is not reminded of that.

The greatest challenge for human beings is to recognize that we are a part of the world, and not some great brain that encloses it.
It is real; we are subject to it.
For this reason, what we see and what seems intuitively real to us needs to be processed in reverse, from the moment we see it to it happening out there, to its source — a study of cause/effect relationships.
As described elsewhere on this site, our primary human error is to reverse this reversed processing, and assume that the source of the act is within us, as is its goal, thus we need to interpret it as directed at us.
The resulting combination between narcissism, paranoia and social anxiety causes most people to be unable to understand cause/effect relationships. Instead, they know only appearance.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what they must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of their sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.” “Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do them such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over them much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.” “Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in their countenance! such an openness and gentleness in their manner!” “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.” “I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.” “And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.” – Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice
As Plato told us so long ago, if two men — one evil, one good — were given the power of invisibility, we would see the good deeds of the evil man (who being of bad intent, would hide their bad deeds) and the bad deeds of the good man (who being of good intent, would hide the good but not the bad).
This asymmetry of nature puts us at a disadvantage. Appearance not only hides the true nature of things, but produces drama in us that causes us to make useless decisions.
The results are often appalling:
About a decade ago, the press got worked up over how Caltech had only zero or one black student in its first-year student class. “Look how many blacks MIT has!” It never occurred to the pundits that if Caltech were harangued into getting more black students, they'd just wind up spending a fortune to take some away from MIT. Nobody ever gets that. The assumption is that Caltech should merely create more Caltech-type black high school seniors. In contrast, I think the most underexploited center of potential talent are kids from broken families, especially boys, who don't have two parents to prod them to jump through all the hoops that the multi-year college admissions brownie-point collecting process requires. – Steve Sailer, “Where would colleges find underexploited talent?”
In our quest to help, we find a symbol (appearance) of great suffering and try to lift up the kids who are truly without hope of higher education.
We ignore the fact that all but a handful of them cannot do the work.
Because we spend our time on the pity-cases, we ignore the deserving who have encountered an unfortunate situation, namely the destruction of the American family thanks to liberal sexual liberation in the 1960s.
their week, researchers at Umea University in Sweden released a startling finding: Couples in which one partner commutes for longer than 45 minutes are 40 percent likelier to divorce. The Swedes could not say why. Perhaps long-distance commuters tend to be poorer or less educated, both conditions that make divorce more common. Perhaps long transit times exacerbate corrosive marital inequalities, with one partner overburdened by child care and the other overburdened by work. But perhaps the Swedes are just telling us something we all already know, which is that commuting is bad for you. Awful, in fact. Commuting is a migraine-inducing life-suckâ€”a mundane task about as pleasurable as assembling flat-pack furniture or getting your license renewed, and you have to do it every day. If you are commuting, you are not spending quality time with your loved ones. You are not exercising, doing challenging work, having sex, petting your dog, or playing with your kids (or your Wii). You are not doing any of the things that make human beings happy. Instead, you are getting nauseous on a bus, jostled on a train, or cut off in traffic. – Slate
But who would have thought it was important at all? It is just another lifestyle choice to be balanced against others, another factor to consider in making a decision.
If you can afford the house in far-flung Outer Suburbia, why not? It's just 45 minutes each way.
Yet our actions have consequences beyond their immediate consequences. And so, besides the driving time and gasoline cost, there are other costs to commuting.
Fifty years ago people knew that. Then the first people moved to the outer burbs and started commuting, and so prices went up in the shrinking part of the city where it was safe to live.
Competition enforced the decline. Now we all commute from the suburbs, hate it, and take it out on our dogs, wives and kids, whether deliberately or not.
The USPS is a wondrous American creation. Six days a week it delivers an average of 563 million pieces of mailâ€”40 percent of the entire world's volume. For the price of a 44Â¢ stamp, you can mail a letter anywhere within the nation's borders. The service will carry it by pack mule to the Havasupai Indian reservation at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Mailmen on snowmobiles take it to the wilds of Alaska. If your recipient can no longer be found, the USPS will return it at no extra charge. It may be the greatest bargain on earth. It takes an enormous organization to carry out such a mission. The USPS has 571,566 full-time workers, making it the country's second-largest civilian employer after Wal-Mart Stores (WMT). It has 31,871 post offices, more than the combined domestic retail outlets of Wal-Mart, Starbucks (SBUX), and McDonald's (MCD). Last year its revenues were $67 billion, and its expenses were even greater. Postal service executives proudly note that if it were a private company, it would be No. 29 on the Fortune 500. […] Since 2007 the USPS has been unable to cover its annual budget, 80 percent of which goes to salaries and benefits. In contrast, 43 percent of FedEx's (FDX) budget and 61 percent of United Parcel Service's (UPS) pay go to employee-related expenses. – Business Week
We like to think the solution to our problems is to ban bad things we have seen happen to others. But there's that asymmetry again — too much focus on the negative, and we forget about the actual task, and we end up avoiding phantoms and missing out on the point.
Unions seemed like a good solution to the problem of pushy bosses. Then we found out that they in fact become a kind of incompetence subsidy that makes it impossible to fire people, impossible to change regulations, and nearly impossible to get people to work harder than a lazy late-Soviet ambling pace.
They say they want to reduce the USPSâ€™s headcount by 20 percent over the next five years through attrition; the agencyâ€™s union contracts prohibit layoffs. What's more, Donahoe wants to close post offices and move some of their operations into convenience stores and supermarkets, where nonunion workers can staff them. […] The USPS has historically placed the interests of its unions first. That hasn't changed. In March it reached a four-and-a-half-year agreement with the 250,000-member American Postal Workers Union, which represents mail clerks, drivers, mechanics, and custodians. The pact extends the no-layoff provision and provides a 3.5 percent raise for APWU members over the period of the contract, along with seven upcapped cost-of-living increases. The union is happy. “Despite the fact that the postal service is on the edge of insolvency, the union and management have reached an agreement that is a ‘win-win' proposition,” said APWU President Cliff Guffey on the union's website.
If we were not blinded by years of propaganda, both paid and unpaid, from the people and media events around us, we would see this for what it is: parasitism.
Yet we want to avoid the appearance of disappointing, upsetting or “oppressing” others.
On and on, south of heaven.

The House passed a budget largely in line with the governor's request, but the plan has stalled in the Senate, where four crucial lawmakers have refused to go along. One of them, Senator Carolyn S. Allen of Scottsdale, said they disliked the cut in the income and corporate tax that was negotiated by their fellow Republicans in the House in exchange for the sales tax increase.

“I think the governor has made a drastic error in judgment,” Ms. Allen said in a telephone interview. “I like her, but I think they are too desperate.”
On Tuesday, Senator Pamela Gorman resigned as majority whip, saying in an e-mail message to the Senate president, Robert Burns, that the tax battle was “taking on a life of its own that is not healthy for our caucus, nor our party.”
The entire budget process has been two parts pain and one part folly, including a moment in June when lawmakers, facing a midnight deadline, tried to metaphysically halt the fiscal year by taking the clock down from the Senate wall. They are also considering mortgaging the state Capitol as well as a historically significant limestone cave system owned by the state.
Ms. Brewer's reputation as a conservative has been damaged by their proposal to raise the sales tax, and some of their colleagues in the party, which is dominated by conservatives, have whispered about challenging them in the 2010 Republican primary.
“The economic downturn has created a very difficult scenario for any elected official who is a fiscal conservative,” Paul Senseman, Ms. Brewer's director of communications, said in an interview.
Arizona finds itself in a worst-case scenario among states that have been hammered by the foreclosure crisis. One of the fastest-growing areas in the country for years, the state has seen its population — and needs — explode over the last decade, and development has more than helped cover the costs.

The state's principal revenue source is its 5.5 percent sales tax (with city tax added on, the average tax is about 9 percent), followed by the personal income tax and the corporate tax. Counties and school districts collect property taxes.

With the number of new building permits plummeting, revenues from the big-ticket items associated with new homes, which had fueled much of the state's budget in recent years, also fell.
As secretary of state, Ms. Brewer was first in line to take over when Ms. Napolitano left to become homeland security secretary in January. Ten days after their ascension, Ms. Brewer had to face their first budget crisis, and they made it clear that big cuts to schools and health care were not going to fly, and that they thought the state would need to raise the sales tax.

Thinking they could avoid a governor's veto of their plan, which had deep cuts, by running out the clock, Republicans wrangled over the budget for the 2010 fiscal year until the last minute. But the governor vetoed most parts of the budget except those needed to keep the state running, and then called legislators back for a special summer session to clean up the rest.
Ms. Brewer has found no succor among Democrats, whom they largely edged out of budget negotiations in the spring. They, too, are upset about their proposed cut to personal and corporate taxes, which they say will wipe out almost all the money gained with a three-year sales tax increase. Democrats say they are baffled by the inability of the majority party to make a deal with the Republican governor.
“They have shown complete and total failure to govern,” said Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat and the assistant leader of the party's caucus in the House. “They have had seven months, and they can't get this done.”
If any of this spells trouble for the Republicans, their leaders are not saying so. “That just speaks to how diverse our state party is,” said Matt Roberts, a spokesperson for the Arizona Republican Party.
Critics of President Obama and the Democratic National Committee are seizing on documents released by hacker “Guccifer 2.0” that purportedly show top Obama officials were also huge fundraisers — including former FCC chairperson Julius Genachowski, who the documents say collected just under $3.5 million in donations for the DNC and another pro-Obama group.
The fact that Genachowski raised a lot of money for Democrats isn't new, but the massive figure released by Guccifer is. As noted by Multichannel.com, Genachowski is listed in public elections records as a bundler who gave at least $500,000 in 2008 — meaning they or their immediate family collected checks from other donors in excess of that amount. The election records don't list the exact amount they collected.
Genachowski (or their family, the records don't specify) gave $11,445 toward Obama's 2008 election, according to the previously released records.

But the New York Observer — owned by Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner — has gone so far as to call it pay-for-play. The “Guccifer” documents also identified other high-ranking Obama appointees as top donors.
Genachowski did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
DNC interim chair Donna Brazile issued a statement cautioning that the documents have not been authenticated, and said the hack seemed to be the work of Russian agents, possibly trying to help Trump.
“There's one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that's Donald Trump,” Brazile said.

Still, the leaked documents do not conflict with the previously available campaign finance records.
During Genachowski's tenure, they led the FCC's 2011 vote to approve Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. The FCC also created the National Broadband Plan, which aimed to provide a roadmap for full broadband access to every American but has been criticized by some economists as a hindrance to innovation.
Before joining the FCC, they worked at the internet and media behemoth IAC. Their bio at their current company, Carlyle Group, says they have been a longtime advisor to President Obama on tech.

“Guccifer 2.0” released what the hacker claims are the records for around 100,000 DNC donors on Tuesday night, including contact information and the amounts of their supposed donations.
For the record: This story has been updated since initial publication to reflect that public records show Genachowski was a bundler and did not make all of the contributions personally.
Susan Moriarty says they and their client are preparing a dossier of online abuse for the federal police after Queensland police investigation
A lawyer says they have received a violent threat over their role at the centre of a high-profile race discrimination case and that their client is preparing a dossier of online abuse to send to police.
Solicitor Susan Moriarty contacted Queensland police about a “particularly distressing” threat over their handling of a lawsuit targeting Queensland University of Technology students under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which included the threat: “We are coming to get you.”
It forms part of a bid to appeal against the federal circuit court's dismissal of proceedings against the students by Moriarty's client, former QUT Indigenous studies unit staffer Cindy Prior.

Prior also plans to lodge a complaint with the Australian federal police over the abuse they have received after publicity about their case.
This included a Facebook private message last Friday telling them they were a “racist bitch” who was “not fit to shovel shit”.
Moriarty has detailed in court papers a message, which nominated the Australian's letters to the editor email address as a point of contact, and linked to a story by the newspaper about their role in the case.
An affidavit filed by Moriarty states that police attended their Brisbane law firm on 14 November after their office manager “forwarded emails on to me emailed to the firm over the weekend, one of which, linked to the Weekend Australian article, read: ‘We are coming to get you'.
“For reasons relating to my particular family circumstances I found that particularly distressing,” they said.
The message contained the subject line “blackmail and extortion”, stating it was from “Readers of The Australian <letters@theaustralian.com.au>”.
Prior's lawyers have argued in court that the Australian's extensive coverage of their case has enabled a “platform” for those campaigning to wind back section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which makes it unlawful to “offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate” others on the grounds of race, colour or ethnicity.
They filed material showing coverage of the case, mainly by the Australian, had received 24,500 online comments, include alleged calls for violence against Prior.
Moriarty told Guardian Australia a female police officer investigating their complaint had advised them to contact the Australian and ask them to disable online comments on its coverage of the case “because they were inciting violence”.
A Queensland police spokesperson confirmed officers provided that advice but said they did not launch an investigation, as Moriarty did not make a formal complaint. Moriarty said they did not contact the Australian as they doubted it would take action.
The solicitor said they were shocked at this response by police, adding: “I can assure you they attended my office because I made a complaint.”
“What on earth were they doing at my office on 14 November after my office manager telephoned and said that I needed to speak with police about a death threat?
“As an employment lawyer, I can tell you the words ‘formal complaint' mean something and at no stage did they tell me I needed to ‘formalise' my complaint.
“Better still, they phoned 30 minutes to an hour later and said they were trying to track down the [threatening] emails and how difficult it was because they were false email addresses.”
Moriarty said they have asked Prior to collate a dossier of abusive and threatening online messages to report to the AFP.
“This has been the subject of commentary not just in North America but in Europe as well,” they said. “There are many other Facebook posts but the problem is they've been travelling at such a rate over the past six months, I've not been able to keep up.
“But certainly I've asked them to prepare a dossier and we're going to the federal police because this has got to stop.”
Moriarty said Prior had been lambasted by trolls who wrongly assumed they had not worked since their successful WorkCover claim against QUT.
In fact, Prior had been working for the past 15 months but Moriarty decided against including details of their employer in court material out of concern that they could be targeted at their workplace.
Moriarty's account of the alleged threats forms part of their case for the federal court to allow Prior's appeal outside the deadline for lodging it. The application will be heard on Friday.
The Australian story referred to in the alleged threat towards Moriarty involved former QUT student Kyran Findlater, who spoke of correspondence with Moriarty over their client's request to settle their complaint out of court for $5,000.
Moriarty claimed that Findlater had breached confidentiality terms of the settlement by giving the interview.
Findlater was among students who commented on the QUT “Stalker Space” Facebook page after Prior asked three white students, including Alex Wood, to leave an Indigenous-only computer room in 2013.
Prior, in a $250,000 lawsuit that ultimately went to court naming QUT and three students, argued unsuccessfully that the Facebook comments breached section 18C. On Friday a court ordered them to pay the students' estimated legal costs of more than $200,000.

At a London launch, we got our first look at Nintendo's hybrid gaming system, as well as playing Zelda, Splatoon 2 and more
Some are calling it Nintendo's last chance. At least at manufacturing a games console. The creator of smash-hit machines since the original Nintendo Entertainment System in 1983 suffered an ignoble commercial failure with Wii U. Announced last year and revealed in full on Friday, the new Nintendo Switch machine has a lot to prove.
Why I am confident enough to pre-order a Nintendo Switch Read more
It's a typically idiosyncratic creation. Described as a hybrid system, it works as a traditional home console, plugging into your TV, but it can also be slid out of its dock and played on the go, via a built-in screen. The concept is fascinating, merging the portable and home experiences into one product, but what about the practice?
On Friday afternoon, Nintendo held hands-on events in several cities around the world. Outside the Hammersmith Apollo in London, a long queue of lucky fans, media types and industry insiders waited patiently, many bleary-eyed from having stayed up until 4am watching Nintendo's Switch console livestream from Tokyo. All were eager to get inside, away from the cold and towards Nintendo's future. Here's what we discovered.
Hands-on with the machine

Immediate first impressions. It's small. The central tablet-shaped unit is smaller than a Wii U GamePad and has the same size screen - 6.2 inches, which is smaller than an iPad Mini. The dock through which you connect the device to your television is just a little bulkier. The Joy-Con controllers, which can be connected to the sides of the Switch to turn it into a handheld console, are tiny. Wrap your fingers around them, perhaps for a motion-controlled game of boxing, and they almost feel like they could disappear. You might want to actually wear your wrist strap for these, and don't let your children run off with them or you'll never find them again.
Still, with their curved edges and soft finish the Joy-Con are surprisingly comfortable in every possible configuration. The grip that turns a pair of Joy-Con into something that resembles a standard controller might look a bit silly - and canine - but it nestles snugly in the hand. It was difficult, however, to get a proper feel for the weight of both the grip and the handheld mode with Joy-Con attached to either side of the screen, because they were all attached to their stands with thick security cables.

Because of the security measures, it wasn't possible to try much of the actual switching that gives the console its name, with one exception. When playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, attendees could switch from television to handheld mode by removing the Switch from its dock, which proved to be almost instant, and back again, which took a second longer. Placing the Switch in its dock didn't seem to quite have the satisfactory click expected, but that might again be blamed on the thick cable throwing off the balance.
Attendees weren't allowed to try attaching the Joy-Con to the grip or the Switch itself, but the different games around the room were set up to be played in different ways. In handheld mode, games were displayed at 60fps and 720p, which looks pretty good on a screen that small. Some games were set up with the Switch as the display and the controllers detached, and for those it was common to see players leaning in to see more closely. It works, but is best saved for when you can't use a television.
Importantly, while it wasn't usually possible to test physical switching from one mode to another, moving between games set up to be played in different ways felt natural. Those with experience with the likes of analog sticks and triggers should have no problems adapting to the feel of the different control methods.
Hands-on with the games
Here are the titles we got a chance to play.
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Photograph: Nintendo
Given the popularity of this long-running adventure series, it's unsurprising that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the only game with a substantial queue. Many of the attendees had already played this demo at E3, but on a Wii U. The Switch version is largely similar, right down to the existence of Link's Sheikah Slate, which was obviously meant to reflect the second-screen experience provided by the Wii U GamePad – an experience you can't have on Switch because when it's docked, the screen is not visible. You can of course undock your Switch and explore that beautiful world – 720p but still lovely – on the go, if only for up to three hours at a time.
1-2 Switch (Nintendo; launch title)
The game that best showed off what the Joy-Con can do was 1-2-Switch, a collection of mini games designed to get players looking away from the screen and at each other. Each mini game on show was one-on-one competitive multiplayer, each player using a single Joy-Con to perform some action mimicking real life.
Quick Draw and Samurai Training use the accelerometer and gyro-sensors inside the controllers to test your reaction times, by respectively asking you to shoot your opponent or catch the sword they swing through your open hands. The latter also demonstrates the sturdiness of the Joy-Con, since you catch the sword by clapping the controller in your hand.
Ball Count and Safe Crack demonstrate the “HD rumble” technology in the devices that can make it feel like there are little balls rolling around inside the controller. Nintendo claimed that the rumble tech is so intricate it can even make the Joy-Con feel like a tumbler full of ice cubes. It's cool, but unlikely to be used to its full extent in many games.
But the 1-2-Switch mini game everyone was talking about was Milk, for which you hold the Joy-Con vertically, wrap your fingers around it, and move it up and down while applying rhythmic pressure to the top and bottom in turn. You know, to milk a cow. In the background, the screen shows a stylised view of a cow's teats delivering the ... product. Unsurprisingly, footage has already been a hit on social media.
These mini games are great the first time you try them, and would probably go down well at parties, just like the original Wii games did a decade ago, but the collection lacks the lasting appeal required to justify a purchase. It's a shame Nintendo hasn't chosen to bundle it in with the console, especially given the popularity of Wii Sports.
Snipperclips (Nintendo; March 2017)
Another game that caused a lot of buzz on the showroom floor was a cooperative 2D puzzle game that involves two shapes with feet and faces cutting chunks out of each other in order to create new shapes and solve challenges. Played in pairs with a Joy-Con each, Snipperclips fits well with the tendency players have to lean in when using the Switch on its kickstand as the display. Its unique mechanic feels very refreshing, and appropriate for a Nintendo console, but Snipperclips might not be as new as it seems. A very similar game called Friendshapes, from brothers Tom and Adam of SFB Games, was playable at EGX's Leftfield Collection back in 2015.
Arms (Nintendo; March 2017)
Arms is reminiscent of the boxing game in Wii Sports, albeit with characters whose arms extend on springs and end in a variety of weapons. Hold two Joy-Con vertically and turned so that the buttons face inwards – which is still comfortable but makes you grateful for the wrist strap – and punch. You can also tilt the controllers to move, turn them inwards to shield, punch both at once to grab, press L and R to dash and jump, and press ZL or ZR to use a character's special move - heal while shielding, hover, teleport and so on. There's plenty of strategy here, but just as boxing was the lesser played of the Wii Sports games because it required each player to have a nunchuck, Arms is likely to suffer from its need for two Joy-Con each, especially given their listed price of £75 a pair.
Splatoon 2 (Nintendo; summer 2017)
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Splatoon 2. Photograph: Nintendo
Despite promises of a full sequel, Splatoon 2 feels very similar to the original, which will probably be just fine for those who racked up dozens or hundreds of hours and just want more of the same, or those who skipped the Wii U altogether and will experience it for the first time on Switch. The demo did include one new weapon, Splat Dualies, which let your squid shoot their coloured ink from both hands at once. Using motion controls – in this case in handheld mode – still feels gimmicky, fun at first but not ideal for fast-paced competitive play.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo; 28 April)

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe isn't pretending to be anything more than an upgraded version of Mario Kart 8, which will suit both those who want to bring that experience with them when they upgrade from Wii U to Switch, and those who've never played the game before. Changes include the introduction of a battle mode, some new characters including ones from Splatoon, and an optional smart steering feature that keeps players on the track.
But the biggest Switch-specific feature, of course, is the ability to play in many different ways. At the event, attendees could play eight-player local multiplayer in handheld mode, with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller in television mode, or with the Switch on its kickstand and two players each using one Joy-Con in a tiny steering wheel. Any way you play it, Mario Kart 8 is still great.
Fast RMX (Shin'en; March 2017)
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fast RMX. Photograph: Nintendo
This colourful futuristic racer looked great in 1080p and 60fps on the television mode, but it would have been good to test out how it plays in handheld mode, whether you can still play two-player splitscreen and if that causes the frame-rate to drop. Still, with little more to worry about than staying on the track and switching your anti-gravity vehicle's colour in time to catch boost strips, Fast RMX is good simple fun.
And the rest
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sonic Mania. Photograph: Sega
Sonic Mania (Sega; Spring 2017) was described as a homage to Sonic. It's neither a new game nor strictly a reboot. The demo was the first level of the original Sonic but with added Tails and dash ability, and a different boss encounter at the end.
Skylanders Imaginators (Toys for Bob; Activision; 3 March) was demonstrated the NFC, with players bringing Skylanders into the game by tapping them against the right Joy-Con. It works well, but feels less magical than placing them on a solid pedestal.
Super Bomberman R (Konami; 3 March) was also played with two players with a Joy-Con each, leaning into the Switch on its kickstand. This setup seems to work well for retro-type games, and we'll probably see more come to Switch.
Just Dance 2017 (Ubisoft; 3 March) also worked well with each player holding just one Joy-Con, their small size and light weight an advantage for those who want to forget they're holding a controller at all.

Our verdict
As its name suggests, the main selling point of the Switch is the ability to play it in all sorts of different configurations. Though it was disappointing not to be allowed to try many of these actions at the event, most of the configurations were available and proved viable even if they sacrificed some resolution or power or – in the case of leaning in to better see the Switch on its kickstand – comfort. The question is whether people will see these options as reason enough to buy.
If we're going to question the necessity of certain features, when will we see why the Switch needed a capacitive touch screen? What games will make the HD rumble worth whatever extra cost it added to the expensive Joy-Con controllers? Without having 1-2-Switch bundled in with every console, will players care about the motion controls and will developers bother to create more games that use them? Will there be enough online content to justify paying a monthly subscription after the free introductory period ends?
Of course, you could just see these features as a bonus to a console that looks and feels great, but then the selling point has to be the games. As far as launch titles go the Switch is lacking, but then the hardcore fans who'll buy the console on day one will likely be satisfied with just the huge open-world Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And for those who wait for Christmas there'll be lots more to choose from, supposedly including a new open-world Mario game in Super Mario Odyssey.
As for third-party developers, word on the show floor was that the Switch is far easier to develop for than the Wii U, which could translate to better third-party support. Given the architecture is apparently similar to the latest Sony and Microsoft machines, it should at least be easier for developers to port across their PS4 and Xbox One games to bulk out the Switch library. Whether they do this or not will depend on whether the console shows signs of success. Low initial sales can quickly cause a vicious cycle in which publishers withdraw support and further lower a console's chances.
This was a fun event, filled with familiar Nintendo experiences, but doubts remain. Given what happened with the Wii U, here's hoping Nintendo can switch things up.
One of the lead House investigators into the Benghazi terrorist attack called for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to testify before Congress about information provide by State Department whistleblowers, adding that they would support issuing a subpoena if they refuse.
“I would hope that they would step up and help us out,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, replied when Charlie Rose asked them if they want the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to subpoena Clinton. Chaffetz emphasized that the committee is not yet ready to issue such a summons, but noted that “we do have whistleblowers stepping up, [so] I think we're going to get serious about forcing people legally to [testify].”
Chaffetz — sounding as if they wanted to avoid saying anything that would seem to vindicate critics who dismiss the current Benghazi investigation as a witch-hunt designed to hurt Clinton's ability to win the presidency in 2016 — said that if Clinton will not voluntarily appear, then “at some point, yeah, I'll be supportive of [a subpoena].”
The lawmaker explained that, among other things, he'd like to hear Clinton describe their conversation with deputy chief of mission Gregory Hicks, to whom they spoke by phone at 2 a.m. local time after the first assault on the U.S. mission in Benghazi.
Hicks also testified that they were instructed not to meet with Chaffetz when they traveled to Tripoli to investigate the Benghazi attacks. They said that Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills berated them for having a classified, one-on-one meeting with Chaffetz. Mills wanted the Chaffetz meeting to take place only in the company of a State Department attorney.
Clinton appeared before the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committees to testify about the attacks in January.

If you're a prudent sort of person, you may have prepared an advance directive. That's a document designating who should make decisions on your behalf if you're ever stricken with an illness or injury making you unable to express your own wishes. It also gives directions about end-of-life care.
Unfortunately, most of us aren't prudent people, as demonstrated by new research from the University of Pennsylvania, and published in the journal Health Affairs. The researchers analyzed 150 previous studies involving 750,000 subjects conducted over the past six years, in an effort to find out how many adults had completed a living will, a healthcare power of attorney, or both.
The Penn researchers found that nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults — 63 percent, to be precise — had not completed either of those documents. Only 29.3 percent had written a living will that contained specific end-of-life directions, such as how and even whether they should be kept alive on a ventilator or with a feeding tube, in the event of a catastrophic brain injury with unlikely recovery chances. And just 33.4 percent had designated someone to receive healthcare power of attorney, the authority to make decisions on their behalf.
People suffering from chronic illnesses were slightly more prepared than the average — 38.2 percent had prepared advance directives, for example — and people age 65 and older had the documents 45.6 percent of the time, compared to 31.6 percent among younger adults. In addition to easing emotional and financial burdens on family and loved ones, these documents also help the country at large by lightening the resources required of the legal and medical industries.
"Most experts agree that some form of written directives are a key component of advance care planning, and yet rates of completion are low and do not appear to be increasing," says Dr. Katherine Courtright, a Penn medical school instructor and one of the study's authors, in a press release. "We need to address common barriers to completing these important documents on a national level, particularly among chronically ill patients who are at higher risk for critical illness and death."
The full-length Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer has arrived and whether you've decided to watch it or not , there's no denying, everyone's talking about it. If you have watched it and you're dying to pick apart every little thing you saw, you're in the right place because we're about to do a deep drive into the footage. If you don't want to have anything spoiled (or even potentially spoiled!) you need to run away now and never come back. If you're looking for some coverage of the trailer which won't ruin it for you, here are the best spoiler-free reactions we could find. Still here? Ok, let's talk about what we saw…
Read more: Every Star Wars movie, ranked from worst to best
Where is Kylo Ren and the First Order?
The first shot of the trailer sees Kylo Ren on a ship looking out across a busy hanger bay (0.02). This obviously isn't Starkiller Base which was destroyed in The Force Awakens so is it simply the First Order ship they escaped on? Either way, it looks like it's all hands on deck as the First Order prepares for war with multiple droids and machines being assembled in front of him. The ship seems to appear in a couple of shots in the trailer - when Finn is undercover (0.55) (more on that later) - but where are they heading? Perhaps to the red-streaked mountain base we see later on? It's a possibility but I guess it could be an entirely different ship all together. One First Order ship must look like another after all.

What's so important about that red mountain base?
Throughout the trailer we see shots of a mountain base infused with red (kyber?) crystals and at first glance it appears to be a First Order stronghold, begging the question, is this where Kylo Ren made their lightsaber? If you watch closely though, I think it's more likely that this is where the Resistance forces set up camp after they have to evacuate Resistance HQ on D'Qar ( which is rumoured to happen in the first few minutes of the movie ).
When we first see the First Order AT-AT Walkers (did you notice the armour they have on their legs now to protect against being pulled over?) and ships facing off against a mountainside (0.09) they're kicking up red dust, suggesting they're at the red mountain. However, these Walkers are facing the mountain… they don't have their backs to it. Then we see Kylo Ren and their forces walking into what looks like a mine which is streaked with red stone (0.14), and if you're wondering why I think they're walking in, instead of out, look at their shadows…
At another point in the trailer, we see the Millennium Falcon being pursued by TIE Fighters through a maze of red crystals (1.31) which suggests this is well into, or near the end of, the movie as the MF is currently on Ahch-To with Rey and Luke. And then there's a brief shot of General Organa watching some base doors close from the inside (1.50) and while it's hard to tell if this is at the red mountain, there are a few things which lead me to believe it is.
Just before, we see some Icewolves run inside the red mountain base with the doors closing (1.49) - we can see the red streaks in the mountain side behind them - and while it could be just misdirection that we then immediately watch Leia standing inside a base with the doors closing, the presence of the Icewolves leads me to believe that the base is located somewhere cold. So what? Well, the uniforms worn by the First Order forces following Kylo Ren into the mountain at the beginning of the trailer also led me to believe the red mountain is somewhere cold - you only get a brief look but they look pretty bundled up, similar to the Snowtrooper uniforms we've seen before - and we know the First Order forces are attacking/trying to take the red mountain so it fits that it's a Resistance base.
Also, the Icewolf in the Star Wars universe is native to… *drum roll* the planet Spintir . Want to know what we know about Spintir? Not much: “Spintir was a planet in the Spadja sector of the Outer Rim that was home to a Jedi temple known as the Dawn Temple, and an unusually high number or mammals. Spintir was a wealthy trade world.” But the fact that it was home to a Jedi temple would again seem to imply that it's a Resistance stronghold, as well as why the First Order would want control of it - all those kyber crystals! It may even be the place Kylo Ren made their lightsaber before they went rogue and joined Snoke.
Why is Luke so scared?
As you've no doubt heard a million times since the first Star Wars: The Last Jedi teaser dropped, Luke thinks it's time for the Jedi to end and the new trailer might reveal why. It's clear that Rey's got skills with the Force and the lightsaber, but their abilities may in fact be the reason that Luke refuses to train them as a Jedi. There's a moment where they split the rock they're standing on and Luke's face says it all (0.50). He's afraid, they have a massive amount of power. And if that wasn't enough of a hint for you they actually say, “I've seen this raw strength only once before. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.” (0.54)
Read more: Why does Luke want the Jedi to end? 5-Star Wars: The Last Jedi theories
We just presumed that Luke already didn't want to train any more Jedis when Rey finds them on Ahch-To and that they would need to persuade them into training her, but it now looks like they begin their training, but then stops because he's afraid of their power. It's obvious that he's remembering what happened to Kylo Ren (AKA, Ben Solo) and they see a similarity in Rey - could this hint at a deeper (perhaps family) connection between Kylo Ren and Rey? This leads us onto another interesting point…
Who is Snoke REALLY talking to?
This trailer is really clever. The way it's shot makes for an action-packed, thrill-inducing teaser which whets your appetite for the movie to come, BUT it also keeps things pretty vague. You might think you know what it's trying to tell you, but actually, the order with which scenes are used and the way voice overs are included can actually be really misleading. For example, at first watch, you probably think Snoke is talking to Kylo Ren when they say: “When I found you, I saw raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special,” (starts at 0.05). This fits with what Luke says later about Rey's “raw” power making us believe in a connection between the pair, but we never see Snoke say this so it could come at any point in the movie and be directed at anyone.
Again, when Rey says: “Something inside me has always been there. Then I was awake.... and I need help,” (starts at 0.34) you believe she's talking to Luke because we're watching scenes of them on Ahch-To with him, but we never actually see them say this… it's just a voice over. The moment we do actually witness Rey say something, it's to Kylo Ren and they say: “I need someone to show me my place in all this” (2.05), but couldn't this just be the second half of what they were saying earlier? Couldn't they have gone to find Kylo once Luke refuses to train them and ask them for help?
This takes us back to Snoke. As with Rey, there's only one point in the trailer where we see them actually speak and it's when they say “destiny” (2.00). It's the end of a sentence which we began hearing earlier in the trailer and as a whole it reads: “Fulfil your destiny”. We don't see who he's saying this to but you could be forgiven for thinking it's Kylo Ren, especially as they're talking about them completing their training and fulfilling their destiny in The Force Awakens, but immediately after we see an image of Rey bent back in pain being tortured by Snoke (we can see their yellow robe in the background). If we make the educated assumption that Snoke is talking to Rey, couldn't this also mean that they were speaking to them when we heard their voice over from earlier on in the trailer? Just as Luke's mention of Rey's “raw” power seems to fit with what Snoke said earlier, Snoke's reference could equally mirror what Luke says… it works both ways.
So what about Kylo Ren? Well, he's not left out either. In fact, they get a good chucky voiceover which seems to imply he's struggling with the guilt over killing their father ( something director Rian Johnson has already revealed will be the case ). They say: “Let the past die. Kill it, if you have too. That's the only way to become who you were meant to be,” (starts at 1.09) while we watch images of them destroying their helmet. Later on we also see them hesitate over whether to attack a ship they know their mother, General Organa, is on and while what they say resonates with himself, I think it's unlikely he'd talk out loud to themselves for such a long period of time. I think it's more likely he's speaking to Rey, but the point is that we don't really know. Almost everything said in this trailer could apply to various people and it's only the way it's presented that makes us feel like we have a clue. Clever.
Why does Rey go to Kylo Ren?
We know from the trailer that Luke refuses to train Rey and that they ultimately go to Kylo Ren for help (or at least we think we do), but why would they leave Ahch-To? Even if Luke was being stubborn and refusing to change their mind, I think it's unlikely they would give up without a fight and leave perhaps the only known Jedi master who isn't evil. Unless they were made too… fair warning, I'm heading into major speculation mode.
Read more: The best Star Wars: The Last Jedi theories, analysed
We see Rey walking toward a crumbling monument surrounded by mist in the trailer (0.41) and although she's dressed in their travel clothes, we know it's not from when they arrived on Ahch-To. I think it's likely that this is the Jedi Temple Luke was looking for when they went missing and Rey goes off to explore it hoping for answers. We see nothing related to this scene until later in the trailer when Rey dives into some water and comes out to see Luke standing in front of their (1.52). Now, it's pure speculation but I think based on the environment we can safely say it's part of the same sequence and that Rey dived into the water to explore the Jedi Temple - perhaps it's partly submerged? When they come back up, Luke is not happy. What am I basing this on? An earlier shot which sees them say: “This is not going to go the way you think,” (1.48) which, again, appears to be in the same environment. When they say this though, he's lying down… in fact, it looks like he's been knocked down so I'm speculating they confronted Rey after they entered the Temple and a tussle ensued which is probably what sparks their departure from Ahch-To.
Why is Finn dressed in a First Order uniform?
It looks like Finn is back where they started in the trailer - among the First Order - but don't worry, he's not switched sides, he's undercover. Our first look at Finn comes well into the trailer when he's facing down Captain Phasma amongst the fiery wreckage of what I presume is a First Order ship/base (1.42). But rather than focusing on the impressive imagery, check out what Finn's wearing… that's a First Order uniform. We see it again as he's walking in front of some Stormtroopers (1.55) and while it looks like he's been captured, the only reason he'd be wearing a First Order uniform is if they were trying to infiltrate a First Order base. This fits with what director Rian Johnson has already revealed about Finn's storyline - that he, Rose, and potentially Poe have their own mission to help bring down the First Order in The Last Jedi - and this shot shared by John Boyega.

A temple in Bihar was apparently cleaned and the idol washed after Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi paid a visit there.The temple is located in Madhubani district's Parmeswaristan, 160 km from the state capital Patna."I was invited there by the people. But after leaving I was told that the idols in the temple were washed," said Mr Manjhi, who belongs to the Mahadalit or the most backward castes."I don't blame them (the people) for this act, because their values are these, not ours. Now I want to complain about this act as it is not a class bias, it is caste bias," they added.The man who tipped them off about the clean-up act was Ramlakhan Ram Raman, a senior cabinet minister, the Chief Minister said.But Mr Raman, who belongs to the Dalit community, has denied telling the Chief Minister any such thing. "This is not in my knowledge," they categorically told NDTV. Mr Manjhi was handpicked by JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar as their successor in the top job when they stepped down after the assembly poll debacle this May. As a member of one of the most backward castes, Mr Manjhi has committed themselves to the welfare and uplift of Mahadalits.
In the vein of the breathalyzer, Philips has developed an on-the-go drug test, that can be used by the side of the road to test suspected imbibers for cocaine, heroin, cannabis, amphetamines and methaphetamine. Unlike the standard alcohol testing equipment, this one is used by having the suspect spit into a small receptacle, which is then inserted into the measurement chamber which contains magnetic nanoparticles coated with ligands that bind to one of five different drug groups, delivering color coded test results in about 90 seconds. Philips , which has been developing the device since 2001, built it as an optical device that would be easy to mass produce for law enforcement. The company expects to ship them by the end of the year, though there's no word on exactly which markets will employ them as of yet.[Via The Coolest Gadgets

On Thursday, one day after the horrific mass shooting that left 14 dead and 21 wounded in San Bernardino, California, Republican presidential candidates spoke to assembled members of the Republican Jewish Coalition. And unsurprisingly, several of them had terrorism on the brain.
Read: What We Still Don't Know About the Mass Shooting in San Bernardino
Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who Wednesday tweeted their prayers and thoughts for the victims and families affected by the senseless tragedy, was feeling much tougher this morning. "This is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home," they told the RJC audience, according to Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel. This "horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war, whether or not the current administration realizes it," they continued.
Appearing on stage later in the day, Donald Trump told the same group that President Obama's refusal to use the term "radical Islamic terrorism" was proof "there is something going on with them that we don't know about." Through a series of retweets, Trump indicated that when events like the one that occurred inSan Bernardino happen, they see a bump in the polls.
Mike Huckabee also got in on the action, accusing the president of moving with "lightning speed" to push for additional gun control measures in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, while ignoring the threat of "radical Islamic terrorism."
It doesn't take a Harvard law degree to identify the inspiration and source of the San Bernardino slaughter: radical Islamic terrorism. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee)December 3, 2015
Concealing the truth & ignoring the obvious for the simple sake of a pro-Islam PR campaign is an insult to the American people. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee)December 3, 2015
But for all of the GOP's concerns about the terrorists lurking in the homeland, they apparently aren't as eager to stop those terrorists from getting their hands on guns. On Thursday night, just 24 hours after the shooting, Senate Republicans—including Cruz and fellow Republican presidential candidates Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Lindsey Graham—voted to block a proposal that would prohibit the sale of firearms to anyone on the government's no-fly list, among other gun control measures put forward by Democrats.
The vote adds to frustration over the Republican response to mass shootings. The party's presidential candidates faced a storm of criticism Wednesday night for tweeting seemingly hollow offerings of "thoughts and prayers" to the victims and families affected by the massacre in San Bernardino, while actively rejecting any suggestion that new gun control measures might be necessary to stop the almost daily mass shootings in the United States.
Praying for the victims, their families & the San Bernardino first responders in the wake of this tragic shooting. — Jeb Bush (@JebBush)December 2, 2015
My thoughts & prayers go out to those impacted by the shooting in San Bernardino, especially the first responders. -John — John Kasich (@JohnKasich)December 2, 2015
The palpable outrage reached its peak with Thursday's New York Daily News front page Thursday, widely criticized by conservative news sites like Breitbart and Glenn Beck's The Blaze, that boldly announced "God Isn't Fixing This."
Unlike Cruz and Trump, who were quick to jump to conclusions about the San Bernardino shooters' motives, Democrats, including Obama, has been more circumspect Thursday. "At this stage, we do not yet know why this terrible event occurred," they told reporters at a White House briefing. Obama conceded that it could, indeed, be part of a terror plot, but that there may have been "multiple" motivations behind the incident.
Pivoting to the issue of gun control, Obama said that given the frequency of tragic events like the one in San Bernardino, Americans have begun to think that there's nothing that can be done. "As the investigation moves forward it will be important for all of us, including our legislatures, to see what we can do to make sure, when individuals decide they want to do somebody harm, we make it a little harder for them to do it," they said. "Because right now it's just too easy."
As Republican presidential candidates zeroed in on the threat of terrorism, Democrats echoed Obama's calls for additional gun control measures.
I refuse to accept this as normal. We must take action to stop gun violence now. -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton)December 2, 2015
Bernie Sanders, too, is fed up.
Mass shootings are becoming an almost-everyday occurrence in this country. This sickening and senseless gun violence must stop. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders)December 2, 2015
Sanders isn't wrong. According to a tally compiled by the Washington Post, Wednesday's tragedy was the 355th mass shooting of the year.

WASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is making it clear that Israel will not wait to take out Iranian nuclear facilities.
In heated comments toward the United States, the Israeli prime minister said that it's becoming clear that diplomacy will not work with Iran.
“The world tells Israel, `Wait. There's still time,'” Netanyahu said Tuesday, according to The Associated Press. “And I say: `Wait for what? Wait until when?' Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before Israel.”
The Obama administration has consistently stated that they don't want to go the military route against Iran and give more time for the sanctions to force Tehran to give up its nuclear ambitions.
Netanyahu worries Iran will continue developing nuclear technology without giving the Islamic nation a firm timeline to stop.
“If Iran knows that there is no deadline, what will it do? Exactly what it's doing. It's continuing, without any interference, towards obtaining nuclear weapons capability and from there, nuclear bombs,” they said, according to Haaertz.
Defense Minister Ehud Barak tried to downplay the harsh rhetoric, saying in a statement to Haaertz that the tension between the U.S. and Israel should be ironed out “behind closed doors.”
The Israeli paper also reports that the White House denied Netanyahu's request to visit President Obama at the end of this month.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver addressed the media Thursday and said they are open to altering the league's age-limit rule.
“It's not working for anyone,” Silver told reporters.
The current rule states a prospect must be 19 years old and a year removed from high school to enter the draft.
Per USA Today:
“The college coaches and athletic directors I hear from, they're not happy with the current system. And I know our teams aren't happy either, in part because they don't necessarily think the players who are coming into the league are getting the kind of training they would expect to see among top draft picks in the league,” Silver said. The league at one point favored increasing the age limit to 20 and the National Basketball Players Association preferred allowing players to go from high school to the NBA. However, Silver is willing to examine ideas and find a solution that works for players and the NBA. “We're going to come together with everyone who is interested in the community, whether it be the colleges, of course our union, agents, lots of points of view out there, and see if we can come up with a better system,” Silver said.
The discussions Silver suggested are expected to take place during the course of next season, with a change perhaps coming as soon as the next draft.
” I do know that as I talk — increasingly the veteran players in this league, as well, feel that the young players are not coming in game ready in the way that they were when they were coming out of college,” Silver said.
“And we're also seeing a dichotomy in terms of the international players. … Many of them have been professional for up to three years before they come into the league and have a very different experience than what we're seeing from American players coming through our college programs.”
Image copyright AFP Image caption China moves up one place in the rankings to 28th
The UK has edged up the global rankings in a major annual survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Its Global Competitiveness Report sees the UK rise one spot to ninth on the list, while Switzerland and Singapore retain first and second place.
The US improved its competitiveness position for the second consecutive year, climbing two places to third.
But the WEF warns that the global economy's health is at risk, despite years of monetary stimulus and reforms.
Each year, the WEF, best known for its annual Davos economic meeting, benchmarks countries against 12 factors, including infrastructure, education and training, labour market efficiency, technological readiness and innovation.
The aim is to produce a comparative picture of what is driving competitiveness, productivity, and prosperity in 144 countries.
The UK wins plaudits for adopting technology to enhance productivity, and for its general business environment.
Finland (4th) and Germany (5th) both drop one place.
Among emerging market economies, Saudi Arabia (24th), Turkey (45th), South Africa (56th), Brazil (57th), and India (71st) all fell in the rankings. But China (28th) rose one position.
The report said that that top-ranked countries had common factors driving competitiveness.
"The leading economies in the index all possess a track record in developing, accessing and utilising available talent, as well as in making investments that boost innovation.
"These smart and targeted investments have been possible thanks to a co-ordinated approach based on strong collaboration between the public and private sectors," the report said.
Risks
In Europe, the report warns of a widening split between countries in the South and North.
"While the divide between a highly competitive North and a lagging South and East persists, a new outlook on the European competitiveness divide, between countries implementing reforms and those that are not, can now also be observed," the WEF said.
The report also sounds a warning that the health of the global economy is at risk, despite years of what the WEF calls "bold monetary policy".
It saw "uneven implementation of structural reforms across different regions and levels of development as the biggest challenge to sustaining global growth".
Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairperson of the WEF, added: "The strained global geopolitical situation, the rise of income inequality, and the potential tightening of the financial conditions could put the still tentative recovery at risk and call for structural reforms to ensure more sustainable and inclusive growth."

MIDDLETON, Wis.--Spectrum Brands Holding, Inc. announced plans Wednesday morning to expand its world headquarters building in Middleton.
The company said this is to accommodate the expected continued growth over the next several years.
They said the 30,000-square-foot addition is scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2017 with groundbreaking set for next month.
The new positions are expected to be in administration, marketing and technology.
The company moved into its new Deming Way location in October 2013. They said the Middleton facility was built to accommodate as many as 675 positions which they reached nearly 2-1/2 years later.
“Since our origins 110 years ago as a battery manufacturer on Madison's east side, our Company has played a significant role as a major employer in Dane County and other parts of Wisconsin,” said Andreas Rouvé, Chief Executive Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings. “We are pleased to further increase our long history of investment in Wisconsin, which adds to our nearly $100 million of direct economic impact on the state each year.”
Spectrum Brands is a global consumer products company that includes the following brands: Rayovac®, Remington®, George Foreman®, Black+ Decker®, and IAMS®.
Richards Staying…For Now
-The New York Rangers announced this past Friday that they would not use their compliance buyout this off-season on F Brad Richards. If they had used it, it would have cleared over $6 million in salary cap space. Short of the 33 year-old having a monster season, I would bet the farm that they use the compliance buy out on them next off-season (when they need to resign G Henik Lundqvist, F Ryan Callahan, D Dan Girardi and others). Keeping Richards around means they won't be active in free agency in 2013. They'll need to use their remaining cap space on keeping D Ryan McDonagh, F Carl Hagelin, and C Derek Stepan in New York City. Just because they won't be active in free agency doesn't mean they won't be making trades…
Justin Falk Is a Ranger
-In a move that happened right before the start of the 2013 Draft, the Rangers acquired Minnesota Wild D Justin Falk for F Benn Ferreiro and a 2014 6th round pick. The 24 year-old Manitoba-native recorded three assists, 53 hits, and 40 PIMs in 36 games this past season. If the Rangers retain McDonagh, they have their top six defensemen. If Falk and the Blueshirts can get a deal done (he is also a RFA), they would be the first option if someone gets hurt on the blueline.
Draft Recap
-Glen Sather and the rest of the Rangers didn't have much to do early in the draft on Sunday. They traded their first round pick to Columbus in the Rick Nash trade (19th overall – the Blue Jackets took LW Kerby Rychel) and sent their 2nd round pick to San Jose in the Ryane Clowe trade (49th overall – the Sharks took LW Gabryel Paquin-Boudreau). The Rangers had three 3rd round picks (C Adam Tambellini – 65th overall, LW Pavel Buchenivich – 75th overall, LW Anthony Duclair – 80th overall), one 4th round pick (D Ryan Graves – 110th overall), and one 6th round pick (G – Mackenzie Skapski – 170th overall)
Welfare to work group chief resigns in the wake of investigation into allegations of fraud at their company
Emma Harrison, the head of the A4e welfare-to-work group, has stepped down from their role as David Cameron's personal adviser on problem families in the wake of their firm being investigated over allegations of multiple fraud.
Harrison has been struggling to combat the claims of fraud, as well as questions about the size of the dividends they have been handing herself, largely funded by government contracts to help the unemployed find work.
Harrison said: "I have asked to step aside from my voluntary role as family champion as I do not want the current media environment to distract from the very important work with troubled families.
"I remain passionate about helping troubled families and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute in an area where I have been active for many years."
There had been signals emerging from No 10 that David Cameron was deeply uneasy about Harrison's role as an adviser as the allegations of fraud started to emerge. They had previously described their approach as "inspirational".
The chairperson of the public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, called for all A4e contracts – worth £140m – to be suspended pending the outcome of police inquiries, with unemployed people transferred to other contractors.
"There needs to be a clean bill of health before a company such as this is allowed to continue with major government contracts. The committee found that the company and its practices are worrying to say the least," they said.
The government is unlikely to accede to their request, partly because it would mean an enormously disruptive transfer of the unemployed from one contractor to another. A4e is probably the single largest provider to the Work Programme.
Cameron appointed Harrison as troubled families tsar in November 2010, even though in June 2009 the Observer disclosed that there had been a fraud inquiry into A4e's Hull office.
Downing Street said little about their resignation saying: "We respect their decision and thank them for their work."
Them influence had been on the wane, as Cameron subsequently appointed Louise Casey, a senior civil servant, to take overall charge of helping 120,000 troubled families.
A4e has been insisting the scale of the fraud is likely to be limited, and confined to schemes set up by the previous government. But the controversy comes at an unwelcome time for the government as it tries to fend off criticisms of its separate work experience programmes.
It also emerged on Wednesday that an A4e subsidiary has been contracted by the cabinet office to advise the government on how to design and implement payment by results agreements for problem families. The shadow welfare secretary, Liam Byrne, wrote to cabinet office minister Francis Maude to ask how much the contract was worth and whether it was being reviewed.
Since the general election A4e has won more than £200m worth of contracts to run welfare-to-work schemes.
A4e, an abbreviation of the company's previous name Action for Employment, has five shareholders who were paid £11m in dividends last year, of which Harrison received £8.6m.
This was despite the firm's failure to meet government targets on finding jobs for the unemployed.
Pressure began to build on Harrison this week after it emerged that Thames Valley police visited the firm's offices in Slough over claims of fraud last Friday. The force has confirmed it arrested four people in connection with the investigation.
A police spokesperson said that the case was referred to the force by the Department for Work and Pensions.
As part of the investigation two women, aged 28 and 49, and two men, aged 35 and 41, were arrested on suspicion of fraud on 18 January from addresses across the Thames valley, and are on police bail until mid-March.
The Guardian disclosed on Thursday that A4e had to repay public funds on five separate occasions after government investigations into fraud allegations found evidence of "irregularities"; and that the company had compelled jobseekers to work unpaid in its own offices for at least a month at a time.

1 recommendation Zenit Premium Member Bleh It looks like VZ has three different GUI design languages going in this build! The guide looks a lot like the old Motorola iGuide Comcast uses on the non-X1 boxes.
I have to say that Comcast actually built a great UI with the X1 platform - some of the features VZ is adding in this update seem rather trivial, like auto-tune to HD.
As time goes on, my need to switch to FIOS when (if) it ever comes to my area as mandated by franchise is decreasing. The only attractive part really is the upload speed on the internet service, but what's the point if VZ is going to have peering issues?
Besides I am not tempted to give money to that corrupt jerk McAdam whom is letting most of the VZ landline footprint rot. If they leaf, sure.

Upload is not usually impacted by peering issues but destination server, it's download. Not to say that couldn't be an issue--but.
My VHO never had Netflix issues because they peered w/ L3 not the more troublesome transit providers.
Most of that is old news because Netflix paid up now and if you follow the Comcast filings it demonstrates that Netflix hand's weren't 100% clean either. They were specifically choosing transit providers w/ settlement-free peering arrangements to lower their cost, and squeeze the operators and transit providers.
Copper is dead, so get over it. There is no phoenix G.superfast that can fix it for reasonable $$$.

1 recommendation Zenit Premium Member Re: Bleh Yeah, its dead. But that does not mean VZ should just literally abandon over half its footprint and replace it with LTE as a "solution".
There was plenty they could have done to keep it alive a little longer in suburban areas that don't have FIOS (VDSL2 for example). Instead they duct-tape and trash bag allowing a public utility to become permanently damaged.
Sell off the areas if you don't want them! Oh wait, then they could not hold them hostage for LTE if there is no Cable provider in the area...
Anyways regarding upload, I did not phrase that well. What I meant is that the high upload speed is really the main advantage now in my eyes - complaints about congestion at peering points seem to be more common with FiOS now than in the past.

I figured since the old interface always seemed to improve with the minor updates, this new screen would be great. Wow, was I wrong.

Officiating.
The NBA's dirty little secret.
Or is it even that much of a well-kept secret? Seemingly every NBA fan I know carries a chip on their shoulder to varying degrees over the way the games are officiated.
Superstar officiating. Playoff vs. regular season officiating. Home vs. road officiating. Make up calls. Late whistles. Phantom whistles.
I seriously think that many people have developed a psychosis where they think that the referees are out to get them their team. But maybe, through their egregious incompetence, the refs actually are.
The first round series between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Memphis Grizzlies has to be one of the more entertaining matchups in playoff history. Last night's game just set an NBA record by going into overtime for the fourth straight time in the series. Four straight overtime games between two teams.
These games are a grind and have been decided by the slimmest of margins.
After game five the Oklahoma City Thunder find themselves down three games to two after a heartbreaking loss in overtime at home. After a Kevin Durant heave from well behind the three point line bounced off the rim into the waiting hands of Serge Ibaka, Ibaka's last second fling went in just after the red lights lit up on the backboard.
As the announcer on NBATV said, it was an "eyelash" too late.
Except it wasn't.
I knew before the Thunder inbounded the ball for their last possession that the game clock was wrong. They just showed multiple replays of the previous possession where Zach Randolph was the last player to touch a ball that went out of bounds. NBATV went forward and backward through the play with the clock running in the bottom right corner of the screen so anyone sitting at home could see who touched the ball last and how much time was on the clock.
After the referees correctly decided that the ball belonged to Oklahoma City they reset the game clock, which had gone down to 2.6 seconds. The problem was that they reset it to 2.9 seconds. The problem was that there were still 3.1 seconds left.
The referees reviewed the play and reset the clock to the wrong time. In game five of a tightly contested playoff series they managed to put the wrong time on the clock before the last play of the game... Because of course two tenths of a second could never be important in that type of situation.
Their replay process led them to be two tenths of a second off. Let me illustrate how absurd that is.
I took the following pictures with my phone by freezing the replay that NBATV showed while the referees were deliberating. Using my DVR and smartphone I achieved a greater degree of accuracy than the referees could with the "technology" they are using for replay.
Forgive the quality of the shots. Hilariously enough, however, they are crystal clear in their ability to illustrate the correct time that should have been put on the clock. Just imagine that these murky, milky shots are how the game looks through the eyes of the referees...
This is before the ball bounces. Notice how it is blocking the middle of the H and is above the left side of the U.
Here is where the ball bounces. This is where the clock should have stopped. Notice how the ball has moved down so that it is completely covering the left side of the U and has moved to the right of the middle of the H.
Here's the final shot. The ball has now moved back towards the H and completely off of the U. Its path has been shown to move from the left to the right and down, then back up. It has clearly bounced. 100% clear. There is still 3.1 left on the game clock.

I actually considered researching better still frames, but in the end my tv selfies seemed like a great way to toss salvos at the insane inaccuracy of the 2.9 second ruling.
It's pretty interesting that they were able to use the replay technology to conclusively rule Ibaka's shot was too late, but they couldn't get the clock right on the review exactly before that play. Based on the track record from that call, maybe they didn't even review the video of Serge's fling and just flipped a coin to decide the victor.
After the game I ran this error by a few people for feedback. Some were upset about the end of the game. That Ibaka was fouled on that last shot... That Randolph was over the back on the previous possession... That replay should be expanded so that corrections could be made in obvious circumstances.
That Joey Crawford inexplicably ran towards Durant like a crazy man and took the ball from them before they took (and missed) their second free throw that would have tied the game. Oddly enough, it was because they noticed an inconsistency with the team fouls on the scoreboard. How ironic is that?
But I got other responses, too. Responses to the effect that if you start looking into that last missed call, what about the one before that and the one before that... There are just too many to keep track of. Responses that replay just causes too many problems because it reveals how many calls actually are missed.
Basically, people are either upset about the poor quality of the officiating or resigned to the fact that the quality of the officiating is poor.
Go NBA.
This week the NBA finally stepped up and did the right thing by taking care of a problem (Sterling) that had gone on far too long.
My advice to Adam Silver would be to maintain that positive momentum and take care of another problem (officiating) that has gone on far too long. They could start by making sure the referees put the correct time on the clock before the final plays in playoff games...
***UPDATE***
An issue was raised as to whether the clock superimposed on the bottom right hand of the screen matched the actual game clock. Here is a picture that shows the official game clock at 3.0 seconds well after the ball has bounced.
Suppressed and censored amongst a plethora of “miracle” drugs, cures, spells, potions, snake oils and charms, perhaps the most misunderstood – and maligned – medical panacea is the cannabinoid. Most commonly found in the cannabis plant and its various species, this distressingly under-researched chemical compound has overcome persecution, legislation, and even popular opinion to claw its way back into the medical fraternity. It is also tellingly the most frequently code-named drug, surviving through the centuries as ganja, weed, marijuana, chronic, Mary Jane, or simply green – they all mean the same thing, but some monikers are more sinister than others.
Banished to the underworld in the 1970s by US President Richard Nixon's infamous “War on Drugs”, the drug that was once the “negro man's weapon to execute their designs on white women” is today the anecdotal elixir against dozens of cancers, tumours, bone disorders, pains, aches, stresses, and psychological conditions. 29 out of the 50 United States have legalised medical cannabis, and 8 among those have gone so far as to permit the sale to adults for recreational purposes. European countries like Portugal and the Netherlands – widely considered progressive – long ago abandoned the failed “war” and adopted more inclusive policies, deeming drug users victims of the substance rather than terrorists against order.
In India, the cannabis plant is inseparably intertwined with culture, Ayurveda, religion, rituals and even the Destroyer of Worlds, Shiva. Indeed, no pictorial representation of Shiva is complete without a chillum, and every Kumbh Mela and Shivratri is a free-pass for bhakts and devotees to smoke in the streets and distribute this prasaad. Even adolescents and young adults are encouraged on Holi to partake in the ritual of bhaang, an extract from the same plant served in a palatable concoction of milk and dry fruits.
Despite this public tolerance, however, the possession, sale, distribution and cultivation of marijuana and its many derivatives remains a criminal offence punishable under federal law in both countries. In the US, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, while in India it is included in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985. Punishments in India range from rehabilitation to a 20-year prison sentence – apart from monetary penalties – depending on the severity of the crime.
Conspiracy theorists assign the blame for this marijuana witch-hunt to pretty much every corporate or political body – the tobacco lobby, pharmaceutical industry, sellout doctors, Canadian loggers, white supremacists, renegade legislators, and even the illuminati – but the only real culpability belongs to the US Administration and its then-Chief Richard Nixon. Backed by the misemployed powers of the US Government and what is now considered to be deeply unscientific research, Nixon strong-armed scores of countries – including India – to outlaw hundreds of chemicals and substances found by uninformed and under-informed scientists to be “harmful to the human body and mind”. The fledgling Indian Legislature, coerced by thuggish US envoys and a variety of United Nations Conventions also spearheaded by the US, had little choice but to take arms alongside in this pointless “war”.
Now, in the wake of a pyrrhic victory with hundreds of thousands of non-violent prisoners of war, and faced with the possibility of a new and colossal tax avenue, the US is singing a very different tune. And it's about time India began doing the same. A good place to start would be with decriminalisation.
“Lots of institutions in India want to research the medical benefits of cannabis,” says Avnish Pandya, Director of R&D at the Bombay Hemp Company (BOHECO). In an uncharacteristically scientific bout, the Government of India has issued a first-ever license to cultivate and research the medicinal properties of cannabis to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). BOHECO will be collaborating with CSIR on this project to develop and supply medical grade cannabis and derivatives for research.
“Marijuana is still classified as a narcotic,” explains Pandya. “We intend to study and develop medical properties of cannabis for the treatment of epilepsy and chemotherapy induced side-effects. Depending on the decision of the Drugs Controller General of India, we may even skip the initial research phases and begin with human trials.”
However, assuming that everything goes according to plan, and that the conclusions of the research are positive, it will still be many years and several FDA approvals before any cannabinoid-based drug enters the market. This timeline, too, is highly unlikely given the maligned nature of the substance and the prejudiced predisposition of its approvers. It also does not address the ever-widening interpretation of the Fundamental Rights as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.
“Ayurveda and Indian history is explicit in its embrace of marijuana's medical benefits,” says Aditya Barthakur, an Advocate in the Bombay High Court and Pune District Court. Barthakur has filed multiple Public Interest Legislations in the Bombay High Court and Supreme Court questioning the legality of cannabis. Their PILs were dismissed by both Courts on technical grounds.
“Alcohol – a known killer and highly addictive substance – is legal and only barely policed, while a plant that far outdates any liquor and exhibits tremendous physiological and psychological benefits remains outlawed under archaic legislation. This is a clear violation of the inherent Fundamental Rights of all citizens. How can you criminalise something that is naturally occurring or grows out of the ground?” adds Barthakur.
You can read more about both PILs here on Indus Dictum.
The jury may be out on the medical benefits of cannabis, but any student of liberty and logic will concur that the State must not involve itself in the policing of private consumption, as long as no one else is harmed. The most frequent counter to this interpretation of Rights is that addiction and drug use will ascend to intractable levels if the population is permitted to access narcotics. Don't be fooled by this non-statistic; Portugal – where drug abuse has fallen by half since its decriminalisation in 2001 – is a shining rebuttal to this scare-tactic.
There are many other examples to be quoted – including the Netherlands, Australia, and most recently Canada – but why should India look to “Western” countries for leadership in legislation? Cannabis and its many forms are ingrained in the routine of Indian society, and it's no secret that foreigners head to Goa and Manali for what is proudly extolled by locals as the best marijuana in the world. Even Union Cabinet Minister Maneka Gandhi has called for the legalisation of medical marijuana, and Rajya Sabha MP Tathagata Satpathy has suggested legalising cannabis to curb the consumption of alcohol.
The tide has turned. Nixon may have rallied their misdirected “troops” against “Public enemy number one”, but experts from the medical, administrative, legal, and every other field today are unanimous: the War on Drugs is an extraordinary failure. Prime Minister Modi's administration must break the cycle and recognise that where Nixon saw evil and abuse, there is the possibility of medical benefit, criminal justice reform, and tremendous tax revenue.

They recalled the many hours they spent in engrossing conversation with their friend Eudora Welty, who was known not only for their Pulitzer Prize-winning fiction but also for their capacity for friendship. Together they edited “The Norton Book of Friendship,” an anthology of works on the topic. “The notion of doing nothing but spending time in each other's company has, in a way, become a lost art,” replaced by volleys of texts and tweets, Mr. Sharp said. “People are so eager to maximize efficiency of relationships that they have lost touch with what it is to be a friend.”
By their definition, friends are people you take the time to understand and allow understanding you.
Because time is limited, so, too, is the number of friends you can have, according to the work of the British evolutionary psychologist Robin I.M. Dunbar. They describe layers of friendship, where the topmost layer consists of only one or two people, say a spouse and best friend with whom you are most intimate and interact daily. The next layer can accommodate at most four people for whom you have great affinity, affection and concern and who require weekly attention to maintain. Out from there, the tiers contain more casual friends with whom you invest less time and tend to have a less profound and more tenuous connection. Without consistent contact, they easily fall into the realm of acquaintance. You may be friendly with them but they aren't friends.
“There is a limited amount of time and emotional capital we can distribute, so we only have five slots for the most intense type of relationship,” Mr. Dunbar said. “People may say they have more than five but you can be pretty sure they are not high-quality friendships.”
Such boasting implies they have soul mates to spare in a culture where we are taught that leaning on someone is a sign of weakness and power is not letting others affect you. But friendship requires the vulnerability of caring as well as revealing things about yourself that don't match the polished image in your Facebook profile or Instagram feed, said Mr. Nehamas at Princeton. Trusting that your bond will continue, and might even be strengthened, despite your shortcomings and inevitable misfortunes, they said, is a risk many aren't willing to take.
According to medical experts, playing it safe by engaging in shallow, unfulfilling or nonreciprocal relationships has physical repercussions. Not only do the resulting feelings of loneliness and isolation increase the risk of death as much as smoking, alcoholism and obesity; you may also lose tone, or function, in the so-called smart vagus nerve, which brain researchers think allows us to be in intimate, supportive and reciprocal relationships in the first place.
“It's huge to have good vagal tone, because it modulates our instinctive fight, flight or freeze response,” said Amy Banks, a psychiatrist at the Wellesley Centers for Women who specialize in the growing field of interpersonal neurobiology and is the author of “Wired to Connect: The Surprising Link Between Brain Science and Strong, Healthy Relationships.”
In the presence of a true friend, Dr. Banks said, the smart or modulating aspect of the vagus nerve is what makes us feel at ease rather than on guard as when we are with a stranger or someone judgmental. It's what enables us to feel O.K. about exposing the soft underbelly of our psyche and helps us stay engaged and present in times of conflict. Lacking authentic friendships, the smart vagus nerve is not exercised. It loses tone and one's anxiety remains high, making abiding, deep connections difficult.
So it's worth identifying who among the many people you encounter in your life are truly friends. Who makes time for you? Whose company enlivens, enriches and maybe even humbles you? Whom would you miss? Who would miss you? While there is no easy or agreed upon definition, what friendships have in common is that they shape us and create other dimensions through which to see the world. This can be for better or worse depending on whom we choose as friends. As the saying goes, “Show me your friends and I will show you who you are.”
The Islamic State's executions of 13 Sunni Muslim clerics last month in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, were a move by the radical Sunni movement to silence moderate voices among Iraq's Sunnis, and they deserve greater attention than they've received, the top United Nations expert on religious freedom said.
“Here a Sunni movement is executing Sunni religious leaders. That should make us think,” Heiner Bielefeldt, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, told McClatchy. “It's important to focus more attention on these particular killings, because here we are not talking about Sunnis versus Shias. This is a very clear case of atrocities committed against their own people, against religious leaders from Sunni Islam who probably have a less simplistic understanding of what Islam means.”
The executions are particularly poignant after the appearance Friday of the Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, leading prayers in Mosul's Great Nurridin Mosque. One of the first clerics executed in Mosul, according to the United Nations, was the imam of that very mosque, Muhammad al Mansuri.
Mansuri was killed June 12, the U.N. said, for failing to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State. A 21-minute video the Islamic State released Saturday showed Baghdadi preaching from the same minbar, or pulpit, that Mansuri once occupied.
Twelve other Sunni clerics were executed June 14, the U.N. says.
Baghdadi has asserted that all Muslims owe allegiance to the Islamic caliphate _ which the Islamic State declared June 29 in the areas it controls in Syria and Iraq _ and to Baghdadi, who now calls themselves Caliph Ibrahim.
Bielefeldt, a professor of human rights and human rights politics at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg in Germany, said the purpose of such executions was to silence critics of extreme movements. Those who oppose the movement, they said, “don't dare to say this publicly because it can be a matter of life and death.”
The executions apparently have had an effect. A resident of Mosul who once worked at the Great Nurridin Mosque told McClatchy on Saturday that the Islamic State is now dictating the content of Friday sermons in Mosul. The resident cannot be identified for security reasons.
Bielefeldt said understanding that the executions were meant to silence those who dissented was crucial in seeing the conflict in Iraq as not simply as one of Sunni Muslims versus Shiite Muslims.
The vast majority of Muslims worldwide “find it horrendous,” they said. “One should not think that people are very sympathetic.”
The problem of religious extremism goes beyond Islam, Bielefeldt said.
“You also see atrocities committed by Buddhist monks in Myanmar and also by radical Buddhists in Sri Lanka,” they said.
“There will always be sectarian movements, but in some countries they find fertile ground,” they said. “Obviously that's the case in Iraq.”
Mexican telecom tycoon Carlos Slim, who is ranked by Forbes as the world's second-richest man, reportedly established their own oil company.
© East News / Polaris Images Mexico to Cut Oil Production Amid Fall in Prices, State Company Spending
Mexican magnate Carlos Slim, who is also the world's second-richest man, created their own oil company named Carso Oil & Gas, media reports said on Wednesday.
The company was formed after shareholders of the subsidiaries of Slim's industrial conglomerate, Grupo Carso, voted in February 2015 to merge Carso Infraestructura, Construccion y Perforacion and Condumex Perforaciones into Carso Oil & Gas.
According to a report released by the new company, its assets amount to 3.5 billion pesos (approximately 230 million dollars), which are placed in 17.7 million shares.
Earlier in an interview with Reuters, Slim said that they remain upbeat about the energy reform in Mexico, adding that up to 50 billion dollars should be injected into the sector.
Last year, Mexico completed a major overhaul of its energy sector, effectively ending the state monopoly held by state-owned oil company Pemex and opening the sector for private investors.
Right now, Slim's core business is related to telecommunication markets in Mexico and Latin America.
Apart from the companies America Movil, Telcel and Telmex, Slim's main assets include Grupo Carso, which currently controls a number of large-sized Mexican companies.
In January 2015, Slim became the largest shareholder in the parent company of the New York Times newspaper.
Centrica chief Iain Conn's package leaps to £4.15m – enough to pay heating and lighting bills for nearly 4,000 customers
The boss of British Gas's parent company was handed a pay increase of nearly 40% last year, a raise Labour attacked as “astronomical” and a “kick in the teeth” for millions of families living in fuel poverty.
Centrica chief executive Iain Conn's remuneration jumped from £3.02m in 2015 to £4.15m in 2016, enough to pay the heating and lighting bills for nearly 4,000 customers on the company's standard tariff.
The details of the rise come at a sensitive time for energy suppliers, just days after Theresa May said the energy market was “manifestly not working for all consumers”.
Theresa May echoes Ed Miliband with promise to reform energy market Read more
Government intervention, potentially in the form of a price cap, is seen as increasingly likely after five of the big six energy companies hiked prices. British Gas is the exception and has frozen prices until August, but experts expect the company will follow suit then because of rising cost pressures.
Much of the increase in Conn's remuneration package is a £1.4m “recruitment award”, compensation for rewards they forfeited when they joined Centrica in January 2015 after a 29-year career at BP. They also received a recruitment award last year of £632,000. Their annual cash bonus rose by £178,000 to £759,000, but their £925,000 salary remained frozen.
Centrica said it recognised the sensitivity of executive pay and was very careful to be in line with its peers. A spokesperson said that in terms of financial performance, 2016 had been a very good year for the company, which posted an operating profit of £1.5bn, up by 4% on 2015.
Conn has said they firmly believe executive pay should be tied to performance. They told journalists last month: “When I joined the company I was asked to take a reduction in the top-end of what I could earn and also asked to take a reduction in my base pay and make sure 80% of it was performance-related. I believe the company is very responsible in this area.”
Although shareholders approved their current package, some have expressed concerns about the one-off recruitment award.
Conn, who earned £3.36m at BP in 2013, has not quite reached the heights of their predecessor at Centrica, Sam Laidlaw, who earned nearly £5m in 2012.
Unlike Laidlaw, Conn is comfortable talking to the media and has been robust in arguing against calls for a price cap in the face of rising energy bills. “A cap would almost certainly remove choice from the market,” they told the Financial Times. They have also said government intervention risked simply redirecting consumer anger from companies to ministers.
Labour reacted with anger to Conn's pay rise, and said it was the only party able to rein in excessive boardroom pay and help those struggling to pay their energy bills.
Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow energy secretary, said: “Over 4 million people are living in fuel poverty across Britain so the announcement today of astronomical pay increases for certain energy company CEO's must feel like a kick in the teeth to those families who will sit shivering tonight because they cannot afford to put on the heating. This is another clear example of the Tories' rigged economy.”
Inside Glanrhyd, the first solar 'eco hamlet' in Wales Read more
Campaigners said the pay rise was “simply unacceptable” and showed the need for change in the market.
Emma Hughes of Switched On, a campaign to get more council-run energy companies, said: “These ridiculous pay packets are the real reason for extortionate energy bills that leave families struggling to heat their homes. Enough of these rip-off merchants.”
Mark Todd, the founder of the comparison site Energyhelpline, said they thought it was likely but not inevitable that British Gas would hike prices in August.
“In terms of Iain Conn's salary, customers will be shocked that they received an extra 40% in 2016. The market rewards bosses that make big profits from their customers and they managed to lead the group to a £2.2bn profit in 2016,” they said.
“He gets rewarded handsomely. British Gas customers would be best to channel their anger into switching.”

The proportion of Americans reporting treatment for diabetes who took oral medications to treat their condition increased from 60 percent in 1997 to 77 percent in 2007 – a 28 percent increase – according to the latest News and Numbers from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.During the same period, the proportion taking insulin to control their diabetes fell from 38 percent to 24 percent.
The federal agency's analysis also revealed a shift in the three most commonly prescribed oral medications between 1997 and 2007. The proportion of Americans using sulfonylureas – which stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin – declined from 1997 to 2007. The proportions using biguanides – which reduces the liver's excess glucose production – and thiazolidinediones – which increases insulin sensitivity – rose during the period.
Specifically the proportions of people who were treated for diabetes who used the three most commonly prescribed oral medications were as follows:
Sulfonylureas declined from 51 percent to 40 percent.
Biguanides increased from 21 percent to 55 percent.
Thiazolidinediones increased from 5 percent to 25 percent.

BEIJING - A Tibetan monk set themselves on fire in western China and was beaten by security forces as they put out the flames, a rights group said, marking the latest in a series of dramatic protests against China's handling of its vast Tibetan areas.
Responding to spiraling unrest in Tibetan areas, Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday defended China's policies on Tibet, saying the government respects traditional culture and freedom of religious belief. They said China has invested heavily in Tibet and will continue to do so.
They also said attempts to undermine stability by inciting monks was counter to the interests of Tibetans.
Activist groups say the self-immolations are a protest against China's policies and a call for the return of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetans' exiled spiritual leader.
Group: Tibetan sets themselves on fire in protest
The Chinese government has condemned the self-immolations and says an upsurge in violence in Tibetan areas, including some deadly clashes between Tibetan protesters and security forces, are being instigated by forces outside the country wanting to separate Tibet from China.
"Any attempt to incite a small number of monks to take radical moves to undermine stability in the Tibet Autonomous Region is not in the interest of development in Tibet or the interests of the people living in Tibet," Wen told reporters at a joint press conference with visiting leaders from the European Union. "Such attempts can have no popular support."
While Wen focused their comments on Tibet, much of the recent unrest has occurred in adjoining provinces with large Tibetan populations, particularly Sichuan.
In Sichuan's Aba prefecture on Monday afternoon, Lobsang Gyatso, a 19-year-old monk from the Kirti monastery set themselves ablaze on the main street, the London-based International Campaign for Tibet said.
Security forces beat Gyatso while extinguishing the flames, then took them away, the group said in an online statement posted late Monday. It was not immediately clear whether they survived.
Two Tibetans who tried to help Gyatso were severely beaten by police, ICT's statement said.
The official Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday also reported the immolation, identifying the monk as 18-year-old Losang Gyatso. It said "police rushed to put out the fire and sent them to a local hospital," citing a spokesperson for the county government whose name was not provided. It gave no information about their condition.
Aba prefecture has been the scene of numerous protests over the past several years against the Chinese government. Most are led by monks who are fiercely loyal to Tibet's exiled Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, who fled the Himalayan region in 1959 amid an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and is reviled by Beijing.
According to ICT, 20 Tibetan monks, nuns and laypeople have set themselves on fire in China over the past year, with at least 13 dying from their injuries. The self-immolations have occurred with increasing frequency in recent weeks, and most have taken place in Sichuan's remote and mountainous Tibetan areas.
An official with the local Communist Party's propaganda department in Aba said they were unaware of the latest case. They referred media to China's official Xinhua News Agency or the Foreign Ministry for reports about self-immolations, saying that only they were authorized to release such news.
Like many Chinese bureaucrats, the official would give only their surname, Bai.
A duty officer with the Foreign Ministry said they would look into it but had no immediate information to share.
Western reporters trying to visit that part of Sichuan have been turned away by security forces.
China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the region was virtually independent for centuries and that Beijing's control is draining Tibetan culture.
Another overseas rights group, Free Tibet, said in a statement late Monday that around 200 Tibetans protested in a public square in neighboring Qinghai province's Yushu prefecture on Saturday and were surrounded by security forces, with some protesters reportedly detained. A second protest followed on Sunday, and Free Tibet quoted locals it did not identify as saying the situation in the town was very tense.
U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia said Tuesday that a 21-year-old Tibetan, Tashi Palden, was detained in Sichuan's Ganzi prefecture on Saturday after a poster appeared on the wall of a local police station warning that three Tibetans were preparing to self-immolate. It didn't say if Palden was suspected of putting up the poster. RFA said they were detained while shouting slogans in the town center calling for Tibetan independence.
The broadcaster cited local sources in Ganzi who spoke on condition of anonymity.
RFA also said an advocate of Tibetan songs and other traditional culture who worked as a civil servant in Tibet's Naqu prefecture was detained by police last week, citing a source inside Tibet who spoke on condition of anonymity. The broadcaster said Dawa Dorje was detained upon return to Tibet from Sichuan, where they urged a conference of singers to promote Tibetan language and culture through their music.
Period dramas are the ultimate form of escapist comfort viewing - and luckily, Netflix is currently streaming some of our favourites, from the Sunday night BBC adaptations you missed a few years back to lavish, Oscar-nominated features, via a handful of original dramas (of which last year's The Crown is the obvious standout). Plan your viewing session with our guide to the best, but be warned: the below content may give you unrealistic expectations of romance...
View Gallery 11 photos 1 / 11 Rex Sense and Sensibility It's hard not to fall for this sweeping big-screen version of Austen's first published work, which stars a who's who of well-mannered British acting. Emma Thompson doesn't just star as quiet, thoughtful hero Elinor Dashwood: they also laboured for five years on Sense and Sensibility's screenplay, an endeavour which eventually won them an Oscar. A pre-Titanic Kate Winslet stars as their impulsive sister Marianne, with Alan Rickman and Greg Wise as their two drastically different suitors, while Hugh Grant takes their trademarked floppy-haired, charming-but-useless schtick back to the 18th century. Austen themselves would surely be amused that the film ended up sparking a real-life romance between Thompson and Wise, who've been together ever since.
View Gallery 11 photos 2 / 11 BBC North and South Dour Northerner with a mill meets well-meaning middle class girl with lofty ideals. Such is the premise of this four-part version of North and South, Elizabeth Gaskell's socially conscious, often forward-thinking novel. The privileged Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) forced to move from the leafy south to the grim industrial town of Milton, Darkshire (do you think Gaskell was trying to make a point?) She's immediately appalled by the harsh working conditions at the local mill - and by its owner, John Thornton (Richard Armitage) Spoiler alert: regional opposites eventually attract.
View Gallery 11 photos 3 / 11 Rex Pride and Prejudice The 2005 take on Jane Austen's best-loved novel, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, is all well and good, but it's a truth universally acknowledged that this brilliant six-part BBC adaptation will always be the definitive on-screen version. Still best known for the scene in which a soggy Mr. Darcy emerges from a lake - which you definitely won't find in the original text - it's the series that made Colin Firth a national treasure (and gained them a mention in Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary and a role in the eventual films). Lake-dipping aside, screenwriter Andrew Davies lets the novel's sparkling dialogue speak for itself, making this a total joy for dedicated Austenites and for more recent initiates.

View Gallery 11 photos 4 / 11 BBC War & Peace If you missed the BBC's lavish version of Tolstoy's sweeping epic when it aired last January, now's your chance to catch up (we get it, that thousand-plus page copy you bought a few years back is just too heavy to read on the tube...) Once again on script duties is Andrew Davies, the writer behind the Beeb's iconic Pride and Prejudice mini-series, who manages to make both the war and the peace compelling. Lily James stars as ingenue Natasha Rostova, with indie star Paul Dano as the slightly sappy Pierre, while James Norton makes a suitably dashing Prince Andrei. We won't judge you if you skip some of the battlefield action, but the dazzling ballroom scene upon which the series hinges can't fail to take your breath away.
View Gallery 11 photos 5 / 11 Netflix The Crown Netflix's deep-dive into the personal conflicts, political intrigues and public controversies of Queen Elizabeth II's reign is the streaming service's most expensive original drama to date. Luckily, every penny of The Crown's rumoured £100 million budget appears to have paid off. Claire Foy gives a brilliant, sympathetic performance as Elizabeth, nailing the plummy vowels and poise of the monarch without descending into caricature - but it's Vanessa Kirby's Princess Margaret (and their controversial romance with a divorcé) that will have you gripped.
View Gallery 11 photos 6 / 11 Rex Love & Friendship Bonnet fatigue? Love & Friendship is the perfect tonic; a barbed, breezy dash through Lady Susan, the largely forgotten Jane Austen novella that the author worked on before the greatest hits, and would never see published in their lifetime. As the recently widowed Lady Susan, Kate Beckinsale is an amalgamation of all the best, bitchiest minor characters in Austen's canon, finally given their time in the spotlight, while indie queen and fashion icon Chloe Sevigny is their American sidekick. Playing fast and loose with the conventions, it's a period drama for the 21st century.

View Gallery 11 photos 7 / 11 Rex The Duchess Keira Knightley does what Keira Knightley does best in this beautifully turned-out period drama. The 'Duchess' of the title is the scandal-prone Georgiana Cavendish, née Spencer, the 18th century socialite trapped by a loveless marriage and the sexual double standard. With all the lingering shots of stately homes and Keira's intricate costumes (and wigs), you could argue there's more style than substance here, but by shedding light on just how badly women could be treated after their 'happy ending,' it's an interesting counterpoint to the classic period romance. Some striking, achingly sad parallels, too, can be drawn with the life of Diana, Georgiana's great-great-great-grand niece.
View Gallery 11 photos 8 / 11 Brooklyn Coming-of-age romances are ten a penny, but Brooklyn, adapted from the novel by Colm Toibin, is something special. Saoirse Ronan stars as Eilis, a young Irish girl whose tiny village holds nothing for them Like many before her, they cross the Atlantic, gradually finding their feet (and falling in love) in the 1950s New York until a family tragedy forces them to temporarily return home. Capturing the very particular sensation of feeling caught between a big city and your home town, not quite at home in either, Brooklyn tugs at the heart-strings without ever feeling manipulative or gushy. While this is very much Ronan's show, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent and Domhnall Gleeson are brilliant in their supporting roles.
View Gallery 11 photos 9 / 11 Wuthering Heights There have been many attempts to bring Wuthering Heights to screens big and small, but the fact remains that Emily Bronte's only novel tends to elude straightforward adaptations: it's far too weird and uncomfortable a proposition for that. But director Andrea Arnold (the woman behind Fishtank and last year's American Honey)'s take on the classic is anything but straightforward. Ditching the bonnets and flowery speeches (and generating some flustered headlines for casting a black actor, James Howson, as Heathcliff) this is Wuthering Heights redux, a film that's as stark and moody as Bronte's original.

Across six episodes, the back-stabbing, political machinations and romantic intrigues of Henry VIII's court come to life through the eyes of their 'yes' man, Thomas Cromwell (played by the brilliant Mark Rylance). With the long-awaited third installment, The Mirror and the Light poised for release next year, a second series is reportedly on the cards (Foy, obviously, won't be returning...)
It's happening! You, yes you (and me!), might be able to afford a Tesla sometime soon. On Twitter today, Musk shared that the Holy Grail of Teslas, the lower cost Model 3 sedan, will officially be unveiled next March (along with taking preorders).
@elonmusk $35k price, unveil in March, preorders start then. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 2, 2015
We've known about it since last year, but now we know when to keep an eye out for it.
At the time, Musk said “[The Model 3] will be way different from any other car on the road. But, “in a way that's really useful and just doesn't feel like a weird-mobile.” Whatever that means, I want it.
If you reserved one of the sexy Tesla SUVs (Model X), you can start customizing it now. While we're talking about Tesla, in case you missed it, the Model S broke some consumer satisfaction records, as well.
For the rest of us, start saving your pennies for the Model 3 now.

(Reuters) - Chancellor George Osborne will unveil plans to merge income tax and national insurance, as a key element of the next Conservative manifesto, the Times reported, citing sources.
The paper said Downing Street was actively considering the plan.
Fears that merging of the two systems would lead to security concerns had caused Osborne to pull back from making an announcement in April, the paper said citing a source.
“We came within a whisker of doing this at the last budget, but in the end we decided against it,” the Times quoted a source as saying.
“They are currently on two separate computer systems and we thought the risk was just too great. But it's something we could do in the next parliament.”
The Treasury's press office could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours.
HELSINKI, Oct 30 - Nokia Oyj will close its battered gaming service N-Gage next year, acknowledging failure in its first major services offering.

Nokia is looking for new revenue from online services as its traditional handset market matures, with games and music being the first focus areas.
Yet the handset maker's mobile gaming push has encountered major challenges, with consumers first shunning its dedicated gaming phones which went on sale in October 2003, accompanied by a major global advertising campaign.
The online gaming service, which opened last year, took over the N-Gage brand and also never moved beyond a niche audience of hard-core gamers.
“We will no longer publish new games for the N-Gage platform,” Nokia said on its N-Gage blog, to which a user calling themselves Jon replied: “It's a sad day for N-Gage fans.”
It said the games from its first major services offering could be purchased until the end of September 2010 and the community site would remain in operation throughout 2010.
“It's a sign of a more realistic approach. It's time to bury the dead and focus on the future,” said Tero Kuittinen, analyst at MKM Partners, adding Nokia had great opportunities in other areas, such as location-based services, micro-financing and mobile email.
Nokia's leading position in the cellphone market had attracted all the top mobile game makers — including Electronic Arts, Gameloft, Glu Mobile and Digital Chocolate — to create special games for N-Gage.
After closing the N-Gage service, Nokia will continue to sell mobile games at its Ovi Store, a smaller rival to Apple's popular App Store.
Nokia's U.S. shares were 3.3 percent lower at $12.73 by 1750 GMT.
The Bakersfield Police Department is asking for the community's assistance in identifying and locating two subjects regarding a suspicious circumstance, possible unreported kidnapping.
On June 9, 2017, at 9:54 pm, a male subject approached a female who appeared to be fleeing from them in the parking lot of Fastrip located at 4901 S Union Ave.
The male was armed with a firearm and pulled the female out of a parked vehicle and escorted them to their vehicle.
Both the male and female then drove off from the area in the below depicted vehicle. The subjects are described as:
Subject 1: WF or HF, wearing a black shirt, and blue jeans.

The global economy will contract sharply this year and recover only sluggishly in 2010, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday as it called on governments to sustain or even increase fiscal stimulus next year.
To be honest, I was kind of dreading it, but I knew I had to get to it sooner or later. I was asked to sign a release form for a couple of scenes I was in in a soon-to-be-released film about the band Ministry,. I had asked to see a screener, and it had arrived and was sitting next to my computer unopened for nearly a week.The director called and asked what I thought. So a few nights ago I stuck it on and... wow! I was shocked! It had taken over a decade to make, and... well, it was well worth the effort. It's the real thing-- the kind of no-holds-barred tell-all story that a band like the Rolling Stones can onlythey had the courage to have made. I expect to write more about the film as we get closer to release date (next year, I think). I'm only bringing it up now because I was reminded of one of my little scenes by a news story the following day about the IMF's economic forecasts , a steep drop in global output and a rebound "later this year."Before I was a blogger, I was a president. I ran Reprise Records, a division of AOL-TimeWarner. One of my jobs was to do the kinds of projections that millions of businesses do that go into national and international forecasts like the dire IMF one linked above. I spoke about the forecasting inA useless political hack from corporate headquarters-- a former hatchetman for New York Governor Hugh Carey who had been recruited by our corporation to do the dirty work involved in axing the failing Atari division of TimeWarner had done so well that they were rewarded with a sinecure, a make-believe job as the head of a nonentity, the Warner Music Group. Technically, they were my boss's boss. But before they were fired, they called me and started screaming because the projected new album by Ministry hadn't been delivered and they needed the 500,000 units.Keep in mind that I had to project what the album would sell, not just before it was recorded, but. The music business isn't like a show factory. But the new head of the Warner Music Group didn't know that and couldn't quite understand why it isn't. I tried explaining; they kept screaming. Finally I fessed up: The lead singer had been shooting smack for months and had to get into rehab before they could complete the album. Shock was followed by accusations. Why, they demanded, was I working with drug users?was wondering why I was wasting my time on the phone with a clueless politician. I told them that all artists are drug users, that it helps their creativity, and that they would have to understand that if they planned a career in the music industry. They hung up on me, and fortunately was fired before they got around to firing me.I suspect, though I have no way of knowing, that the projecting and forecasting that goes into putting together the numbers that the IMF--and, more important, Wall Street-- gets from shoe factories and car companies and investment firms are more conducive to reliable predictability than the multibillion-dollar entertainment industries'. It allows them to put out statements like this:A lot goes into those forecasts: wishful thinking, cluelessness, all sorts of pressures, hopes for those mouthwatering bonuses you've been reading about lately, budgets, dreams. Science? Not so much, I suspect.

Early Friday morning near downtown Oakland, almost 200 apartments approaching completion went up in flames, the latest in a series of suspicious construction-site fires. The day before in Sacramento, state lawmakers showed that there's more than one way to incinerate new housing.
The Legislature is famously considering more than 100 bills to ease the housing crisis; it has now passed one to aggravate it. Approved by the state Senate Thursday and sent to Gov. Jerry Brown — who should not sign it — Senate Bill 106 includes a provision exempting Marin County from housing-density standards affecting the rest of the Bay Area for more than a decade.
Amid a deepening housing shortage rooted in parochial policies that stifle all kinds of development, it's difficult to imagine a clearer legislative endorsement of the state's prevailing not-in-my-backyard ideology.
“Is it the NIMBY concept? Absolutely,” state Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Gerber (Tehama County), said before voting against the bill.
State Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco was the only Bay Area lawmaker and the only Democrat to vote against the bill. “People are being evicted,” they said. “People cannot afford homes. We need more housing, not less housing.”
The bill would extend a similar 2014 law that excuses the state's wealthiest county, including its largest cities, San Rafael and Novato, from high-density housing developments prescribed for metropolitan areas. The exemption, now set to expire in 2023, would be continued until 2028.
Marin County Democratic Assemblyman Marc Levine and other supporters of the bill have argued that lowering the density requirement enables more of the suburban-style development the county's residents would welcome and thereby increases overall housing production. But state Sen. Nancy Skinner, a Berkeley Democrat who abstained from Thursday's vote, noted that the earlier legislation provided for an evaluation of the county's affordable-housing production as of 2019. SB106 doubles down on the policy without the benefit of that report, suggesting its supporters don't really care about its housing impact.
The Legislature's ruling Democrats introduced the exemption as part of a budget-related bill addressing a variety of unrelated issues, allowing it to escape the level of public scrutiny applied to most legislation. The Assembly passed it last month.
Soaring prices, rising homelessness, and tensions over development and gentrification, which may have found their worst expression in the rash of East Bay fires, can all be traced to the state's failure to produce sorely needed housing. Judging by this legislation, Sacramento is still fiddling while Oakland burns.
Comments came after the vice-president said of Trump: ‘Do I wish I was debating him? No, I wish we were in high school and I could take them behind the gym'
Republican nominee Donald Trump implied on Tuesday that they would be willing to fight the sitting vice-president Joe Biden behind a barn.
Speaking at a rally in Tallahassee, Florida, almost precisely two weeks to the minute to when polls close there on election day, Trump said of a fist fight between the two: “I'd love that.”
The 70-year-old Republican nominee for president also labeled the vice-president “Mr Tough Guy” and said of beating up the 73-year-old Biden: “Some things in life you could really love doing.”
The comments came after Biden said of Trump on Saturday: “The press always asks me, don't I wish I was debating him? No, I wish we were in high school and I could take them behind the gym. That's what I wish.”
Biden made the comments in reference to a lewd 2005 tape recording of Trump, unearthed in early October, where the Republican nominee bragged about being able to grab women by the genitalia without their consent.
On Monday, Biden clarified their remarks in a rally, saying they meant “If I were in high school ... I want to make it clear I understand what assault is. I'm not in high school. If I were in high school.” The septuagenarian graduated from the Archmere Academy prep school in Claymont, Delaware, in 1961.
Trump seemed to welcome the opportunity to fight the vice-president. “Did you see where Biden wants to take me behind a barn? Me. They want it. I'd love that,” the Republican nominee said with relish.
Casting scorn on Biden's physical strength, Trump said, “Mr Tough Guy, you know he's Mr Tough Guy, you know when he's Mr Tough Guy? When he's standing behind a microphone by himself.”
Trump added: “He wants to bring me to the back of the barn? Oooooooooh. Some things in life you could really love doing.”
The last time a sitting vice-president engaged in a major violent altercation with a fellow politician, Aaron Burr killed former secretary of treasury Alexander Hamilton in a duel on 11 July 1804 in Weehawken, New Jersey.
Night of 2009.03.21 I dreamed I was walking down railroad tracks. After some time I started to fear that I wouldn't make it home before sunset. I went into a school. It seemed that I needed to pass through it in order to get home. One of the kids shouted "lets get him!". Another kid jumped on my back and wrapped their arms around my neck. I threw them off and their teacher scolded him. I looked through a glass window a moment later and they were beating them with a belt. Their teacher was very pretty, and had a young face. I left the school. I was no longer on a railroad, but on a dirt path instead. I came to some kind of giant stone arch that went over the path. It seemed ancient. Next I came to a very old plantation home. It was dark and rotten. I went inside. The house was full of shelves of books and old documents. I wondered if anyone knew about them. I wanted to look for something interesting but I knew I didn't have time. I grabbed a book from one of shelves and put it in my backpack. I left the house. I hadn't traveled far from the house when everything suddenly became pitch black. I was very afraid. I heard a rustling sound and some kind of pig-like animal ran past me. I knew I couldn't continue along the patch in this darkness. I decided I would go back to the old house and sleep for the night. I backtracked, looking for the house. Quickly, I became lost in the darkness and wasn't even sure if I was still on the path. I began to panic. I started running through the darkness. I came to a very high chain link fence with razor wire at the top and red warning signs on it. Through the fence I saw several dark buildings and what looked like guard posts. An old white pickup truck pulled up on the other side of the fence. An old man with a large bald spot got out. They were holding a shotgon. I ran. I heard them shout "you can run but we'll still get ya'". I ran faster. Something was chasing me. I came to another chain link fence, half as high as the first. I flew up it. I grapped the razor wire at the top and pushed it down. I hit the ground on the other side running. I ran for hours through the dark forest. Eventually I saw my grandfather's work shed. The light was on and the large doors were open. I could see them sitting on a stool as I got closer. I ran inside and told them something was after me. I searched for something to use as a weapon. Suddenly two animals ran into the shed with us. One was a black boar looking thing with porcupine needles. The other was a pink pig-like creature. My grandfather cut them up with an axe. THE END
Period in Korean history when Silla and Balhae coexisted in the south and north of the peninsula, respectively
Not to be confused with modern-day Division of Korea
North–South States Period (698–926 CE ) is the period in Korean history when Later Silla and Balhae coexisted in the south and north of the peninsula, respectively.[1][2]
Later Silla [ edit ]
After the unification wars, the Tang Dynasty established territories in the former Goguryeo, and began to administer and establish communities in Baekje. Silla attacked the Chinese in Baekje and northern Korea in 671.
The Tang Dynasty then invaded Silla in 674 but Silla defeated the Tang army in the north. Silla drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula by 676 to achieve unification of most of the Three Kingdoms.
Later Silla was a golden age of art and culture,[3][4][5][6] and Buddhism became a large part of Silla culture. Buddhist monasteries such as the Bulguksa are examples of advanced Korean architecture and Buddhist influence. State-sponsored art and architecture from this period include Hwangnyongsa Temple, Bunhwangsa Temple, and Seokguram Grotto, a World Heritage Site.
Later Silla carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, which acted like the Phoenicia of medieval East Asia,[7] and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River.[8][9][10][11] Later Silla was a prosperous and wealthy country,[12] and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju[13] was the fourth largest city in the world.[14] [15][16][17]
Buddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists[18] and contributed to Chinese Buddhism,[19] including: Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang,[20][21][22][23] and Kim Gyo-gak, a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.[24][25][26][27][28]
Silla began to experience political troubles in the late 9th century. This severely weakened Silla and soon thereafter, descendants of the former Baekje established Later Baekje. In the north, rebels revived Goguryeo, beginning the Later Three Kingdoms period.
Later Silla lasted for 267 years until, under King Gyeongsun, it was annexed by Goryeo in 935.
Balhae [ edit ]
Balhae and Silla in 830.
Balhae, the name of which was another transcribed version of Mohe (靺鞨, a Tungus Tribe speaking a language like Manchurian and Sibe), was founded after Goguryeo had fallen. It was founded in the northern part of former lands of Goguryeo by Dae Joyeong, a former Goguryeo general[29][30] or chief of Sumo Mohe,[31][32][33] after defeating the military of central government of Tang Dynasty at the Battle of Tianmenling. Balhae controlled the northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, much of Manchuria, and expanded into present-day Russian Maritime Province. Balhae styled itself as Goguryeo's successor state.
In a time of relative peace and stability in the region, Balhae flourished in culture, especially during the long reign of the third King Mun (r. 737-793) and King Seon. At that time, Balhae was a culturally advanced country, so that even China referred to this kingdom as "a prosperous country of the East."[34] However, Balhae was severely weakened by the 10th century, and the Khitan Liao Dynasty conquered Balhae in 926.
Goryeo absorbed some of Balhae's territory and received Balhae refugees, including the crown prince and the royal family, but compiled no known histories of Balhae. The 18th century Joseon dynasty historian Yu Deukgong advocated the proper study of Balhae as part of Korean history, and coined the term "North and South States Period" to refer to this era.
Language [ edit ]
Due to the lack of linguistic evidence, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion for the linguistic relation between the Balhae and Silla languages.
Shoku Nihongi implies that the Balhae language, a Goguryeo language, and Silla language share a close relationship[clarification needed]: a student sent from Silla to Japan for an interpreter training in Japanese language assisted a diplomatic envoy from Balhae in communicating during the Japanese court audience.[citation needed]
One terminology that people of Balhae used to describe "a king" is Gadokbu (transcribed as 可毒夫).

A former Stanford University student and swimming champion is facing up to 10 years in prison after they were convicted of raping an unconscious woman they met at a campus party last year, Santa Clara County officials said Wednesday.
A jury found Brock Allen Turner guilty of three counts of sexual assault in Santa Clara County Superior Court on Wednesday afternoon, officials said.
“Today a jury of Santa Clara County residents gave a verdict which I hope will clearly reverberate throughout colleges, in high schools, anywhere where there may be any doubt about the distinction between consent and sexual assault,” District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. “No means no, drunk means no, passed out means no, and sex without consent means criminal assault.”
Two graduate students riding bikes on Lomita Court around 1 a.m. Jan. 18, 2015, found Turner, a 19-year-old first-year student at the time, on top of a partially clothed woman in a field near campus fraternity houses.
“She was lying on the ground unconscious, not moving,” Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci said when Turner was accused that month.
Both students restrained Turner as they tried to get away and called police, Kianerci said. The woman, who is not a student, was taken to a hospital and treated for their injuries.
Turner smelled of alcohol when they were arrested and told police they had seven cans of beer that night and thought they were having consensual sex with the woman, who authorities said was breathing but “completely unresponsive” as they lay near a tree and a trash bin.
“He stated that they were drunk but was able to remember everything,” the police report says. “His head was a little fuzzy due to the effects of the alcohol, but they consciously decided to engage in the sexual activity with victim. They were having a good time with victim and stated that they also seemed to enjoy the activity.”
The woman told police they had four whiskey shots and two shots of vodka that night but couldn't remember anything after talking to a few guys at a Kappa Alpha party, according to a police report.
Turner withdrew from school Jan. 27, 2015, the day prosecutors announced they would be charged, university officials said, adding they are no longer allowed on campus.
Stanford University had come under fire in the past for a lax response to campus sexual assault. Between 1997 and 2009, just four of 175 reported sexual assaults were formally adjudicated at Stanford, with two of the alleged attackers held responsible, according to a report by Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor.
California became the first state to pass legislation that shifted the standard of consent for sexual activity at colleges from whether a person said no to whether both partners said yes. The “yes means” law applies only to campus disciplinary hearings, not to state criminal proceedings.

Texas A&M researcher receives grant for 'supercomputing' work
A Texas A&M researcher received grant to expand the work that they said has "world-changing potential," with the ability to simplify research in subjects that run the gamut from plant root growth to the cause of earthquakes and the impact of air pollution on Roman statues.
Mathematics professor Wolfgang Bangerth created the software program deal.II to make "supercomputing" simpler, which is used by hundreds of researchers around the world to study various topics, including glacier mechanics and heart muscle fiber simulation using complex equations containing billions of variables.
Recently, the National Science Foundation gave them the $1.3 million grant to help expand the software's uses and make it more adaptable for and accessible to researchers.
"For us, this is validation that what we are doing is right," Bangerth said. "We're helping others. We want to provide the infrastructure for other researchers in as broad a way as possible ... There's a need for this. There's not a lot of software for people doing research on projects that have billions of variables."
The specialized computing clusters use tens of thousands or more computers stacked and grounded together to pool processing power. Some have more than a million processor cores. A system at the University of Texas at Austin, which also received a grant from the National Science Foundation, has 102,400 processor cores.
Bangerth is working with a center at the University of California to study a hypothesis about the cause of earthquakes. The computing power is needed to accurately model the turbulent convections of heat ebbing and flowing from the Earth to its surface. The task requires thousands computers to provide a simulation, they said.
Bangerth said a couple dozen researchers across the world currently help them with refining the software to expand these systems and make them more accessible to researchers.
The software is open source, meaning it's available for free to anyone.
"It's a way for us to share what we do as academic researchers," Bangerth said. "My personal view is, I'm paid by the taxpayer, and whatever I do should be out there in the open for everybody. That's my goal: creating knowledge for the taxpayer. That's why we do it open source."
I don't think I've spent more time with a mathematical definition than I did with compactness. It is an important mathematical property and one that initially left me entirely bewildered.
There are two definitions of compactness. One is the real definition, and one is a "definition" that is equivalent in some popular settings, namely the number line, the plane, and other Euclidean spaces. (The fact that the two definitions are equivalent is called the Heine-Borel theorem.)
The real definition of compactness is that a space is compact if every open cover of the space has a finite subcover. I don't know how many times I repeated that definition to myself in my undergraduate topology class, wondering if my incantations would eventually help me understand what in the world compactness was.
Almost simultaneously, I learned the practical definition of compactness in Euclidean spaces: a set is compact if it is closed and bounded. A set is closed if it contains all points that are extremal in some sense; for example, a filled-in circle including the outer boundary is closed, while a filled-in circle that doesn't include the outer boundary is not closed. Bounded is a little more like what it sounds like: points in a bounded space are all within some fixed distance of each other.
It took me a long time to connect these two ways of looking at compactness, and I'm not going to do that in this post. (If you're taking an introduction to analysis or topology class, you might have the delightful opportunity to learn the Heine-Borel theorem for yourself. Hooray!) But I will unpack the first definition a bit. An open cover is a collection of open sets (read more about those here) that covers a space. An example would be the set of all open intervals, which covers the real number line.
A collection of many open intervals on the real number line. Credit: Evelyn Lamb
Of course, the collection of all open intervals in the number line contains a heck of a lot of intervals! Compactness asks if there is a way to whittle down that collection to a finite number of intervals and still cover the entire number line. That is, could we find a finite number of open intervals so that every point on the number line is in at least one of them? We could eliminate a lot of the intervals and still cover the line — we could, for example, only permit unit-length intervals whose endpoints were at integers or integers-and-a-half — but we could never pare our collection down to a finite number of intervals and still span the entire number line. If we reduced it to 100 unit intervals, for example, we could only cover a maximum of 100 units of length on the infinite number line, and that's if none of the intervals overlapped! So the number line is not compact because we have found an open cover that does not have a finite subcover.
A set does not have to be infinite in length or area to be non-compact. A closed interval and an open interval make a good case study for how we can think about compactness. For convenience, we might as well look at the intervals (0,1) and [0,1]. (The first is all the real numbers between 0 and 1 not including the endpoints, the second is all the real numbers between 0 and 1 including 0 and 1.) The open interval (0,1) is not compact because we can build a covering of the interval that doesn't have a finite subcover. We can do that by looking at all intervals of the form (1/n,1). Each one of those intervals lies within (0,1), and put together, any number in the interval (0,1) is in at least one interval of the form (1/n,1). For example, the point .0001 is in the interval (1/10001,1), even though it's not in the intervals (1/2,1), (1/3,1), and so on up to (1/10000,1). But if we want to cover the entire interval (0,1) with only a finite subcollection, we will fail. Any finite subcollection will have the largest interval in it, whether it's (1/10,1) or (1/10000,1) or (1/Graham's number,1). In any case, we can find numbers between 0 and the left endpoint of the largest interval that won't be covered by our finite subcollection.
When we add the endpoints 0 and 1, the interval becomes compact. Now the weird open cover we had no longer covers the whole interval because the points 0 and 1 aren't any of the intervals. It's harder to show that we couldn't cook up a different pathological open cover, so you'll have to take my word for it for now.
Showing that something is compact can be trickier. Proving noncompactness only requires producing one counterexample, while proving compactness requires showing that every single open cover of a space, no matter how oddly constructed, has a finite subcover. But eventually I came to a rigorous understanding of compactness and how both definitions fit together, and I lived happily ever after.
Now, years after wrestling with it for the first time, I've come to what Terry Tao might describe as a post-rigorous understanding of compactness. Compact means small. It is a peculiar kind of small, but at its heart, compactness is a precise way of being small in the mathematical world. The smallness is peculiar because, as in the example of the open and closed intervals (0,1) and [0,1], a set can be made “smaller” (that is, compact) by adding points to it, and it can be made “larger” (non-compact) by taking points away.
As a notion of smallness, then, compactness is a bit fraught. It's a bit unsettling to say that a set can be “smaller” than a set that lies entirely inside it! But I think smallness is a valuable way to see compactness. A set that is compact may be large in area and complicated, but the fact that it is compact means we can interact with it in a finite way using open sets, the building blocks of topology. (For more on open sets, check out my post Change your open sets, change your life.) That's the point of the finite subcover in the definition of compactness. That finite collection of open sets makes it possible to account for all the points in a set in a finite way. That comes up in, for example, the proof of the Heine-Borel theorem.
Before I realized compact meant small, I saw that compact sets were often easier to deal with. Continuous functions defined on compact sets have more controlled behavior than functions on non-compact sets. Compact two-dimensional surfaces have a nice classification theorem. Classifying non-compact surfaces is more difficult and less satisfying. Compact surfaces are more constrained. Non-compact ones can squirm out of your hands like blobs of rice pudding. Compact ones are more like jello: they might wobble a bit, but you can hold on to them if you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty.
The post-rigorous understanding of compactness allows the word "compact" to circle around from something that feels like robot speak to something that aligns very closely with an English meaning of the word. I don't know the history of the mathematical use of the word compact, so I don't know how intentional that is. I like to think of it as a delightful accident of mathematical-linguistic convergence.
Colin Powell on gay marriage: “I have no problem with it.”
CNN leads political anchor Wolf Blitzer sat down with former Secretary of State Colin Powell to discuss their new book and a variety of foreign policy issues. A highlight is after the jump. Blitzer's full interview with Gen. Powell will air during the 5 p.m. ET hour of The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer on CNN.

Highlights from the Interview
THIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED
BLITZER: I remember, you were chairperson of the joint chiefs when you installed the “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” policy in the U.S. Military that prevented gays from serving openly. I know you changed your attitudes over these years. But what about gay marriage? Are you with the president in supporting gay marriage?
POWELL: I have no problem with it. And it was the congress that imposed “Don't Ask, Don't Tell.” It was certainly my position, and my recommendation, to get out us of an even worse outcome that could have occurred, if you'll recall. But, as I've thought about gay marriage, I know a lot of friends who are individually gay but are in partnerships with loved ones. And they are stable a family as my family is. And they raise children. And so I don't see any reason not to say that they should be able to get married under the laws of their state or the laws of the country, however that turns out – it seems to be the laws of the state.
There may be religious objections to it, and I respect that many denominations have different points of view with respect to gay marriage. And they can hold that in the sanctity of their place of religion and not bless them or solemnize them. But, in terms of the legal matter of creating a contract between two people that's called marriage, and allowing them to live together with protection of law, it seems to me is the way we should be moving in this country.
And so I support the president's decision, and I think most Americans increasingly understand that times have changed, just like they changed between gays in the military and when I was able to support removing that barrier to service. And so I hope everybody will just carefully look at this, and I understand the religious objections to it. But at the same time, we are a country that is open to diversity and change. And my experience with many of my gay and lesbian friends is that they form unions as strong as any other unions I've seen and raise children that are good, strong children. And are either or heterosexual or homosexual, lesbian, depending on themselves, not because their parents happen to be.
…
BLITZER: Do you have a problem with welcoming Mullah Muhammad Omar back into potentially a government in Afghanistan? He's still on the loose.
POWELL: I must say, candidly, that I'm disappointed in the president's remarks. Look at all the trouble Mullah Omar has created over the past 10 years. Look at all the lives that have been lost as a result of their actions and the people who are working for him. And so, I think it's a little hard to say we would welcome them back in as an Afghan. I think they have to be brought to account for all the tragedies that have taken place over the past 10 years. But, ultimately, that's a matter that the Afghan people will have to deal with. I don't think they want to see the day of the Taliban to return, and certainly not with Mullah Omar in charge.
…
BLITZER: And the U.S. is going to be there at least through the end of 2014, another two and a half years. And I'll ask this question because I know, among other things, you're a Vietnam war veteran. What do you tell the family members of the troops who will be killed between now and the end of 2014 about why they were there?
POWELL: I think we tell them that we are so proud of your servicemen and servicewomen. They're volunteers, they understood the dangers associated with their volunteering. We're going to do everything we can to support them and make sure they come home safely. But war is a dangerous thing and there are people who are trying to get at them. And if you lose your loved ones, we will mourn and we will do everything we can to make sure that loss was not in vain. But at the end of the day, if that country stabilizes itself, rids itself of corruption, and can become a functioning society that is at peace with others in the region, then I think you can say to the parents “your loss was not in vain.”

Researchers may have pinpointed the reason why poor sleep has been linked to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.
The new study found that just one night of sleep disruption led to an increase in a protein called amyloid beta, while a week of sleep disturbance led to increased levels of a protein called tau. Both proteins are connected with Alzheimer's disease.
"We showed that poor sleep is associated with higher levels of two Alzheimer's-associated proteins," said senior author Dr. David Holtzman.  They are a professor and head of the department of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
"We think that perhaps chronic poor sleep during middle age may increase the risk of Alzheimer's later in life," Holtzman explained in a university news release.
More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's, the study authors said. And previous studies have shown a link between poor sleep and the memory-robbing disease.
How sleep impacts those with metabolic syndrome
For example, people who have sleep apnea -- a condition that causes repeated pauses in breathing during the night -- develop mild impairment in thinking and memory skills (called mild cognitive impairment) an average of 10 years earlier than people without the sleep disorder. Mild cognitive impairment can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers noted.
To try to tease out why sleep troubles might boost the risk of Alzheimer's, the investigators recruited 17 healthy volunteers, aged 35 to 65. The study participants had no known sleep problems or mental impairments.
All of the study volunteers wore activity monitors for two weeks before they went to the lab to sleep for a night. The monitors measured the quality of their sleep, according to the report.
Half of the participants were randomly selected to have their sleep disrupted for the first night. A month or more later, the study participants returned, and the second half of the group had their sleep interrupted this time.
The day after each experiment, study volunteers had a spinal tap so levels of amyloid beta and tau could be measured.
Alzheimer's expert shares healthy brain advice
The researchers found a 10 percent increase in amyloid beta after a single night of bad sleep. But there was no rise in tau after one bad night. However, those who had slept poorly in the week leading up to the experiment did have an increase in tau levels.
Dr. Yo-El Ju is the study's co-first author, and an assistant professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis.
They said, "We were not surprised to find that tau levels didn't budge after just one night of disrupted sleep while amyloid levels did, because amyloid levels normally change more quickly than tau levels. But we could see, when the participants had several bad nights in a row at home, that their tau levels had risen."
So does this mean one bad night of sleep could boost your risk of Alzheimer's disease?
Probably not, Ju said. Levels of amyloid beta and tau probably return to normal soon after the poor night or few nights' of bad sleep.
"The main concern is people who have chronic sleep problems. I think that may lead to chronically elevated amyloid levels, which animal studies have shown lead to increased risk of amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's," Ju said.
The researchers don't know if getting more or better sleep might reduce the risk of Alzheimer's, but neither can hurt, Ju suggested.
"Many, many Americans are chronically sleep-deprived, and it negatively affects their health in many ways," they said in the news release.
"At this point, we can't say whether improving sleep will reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer's. All we can really say is that bad sleep increases levels of some proteins that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. But a good night's sleep is something you want to be striving for anyway," Ju said.
The study was published July 10 in the journal Brain.
Ed Reed signed with the Houston Texans to much fanfare. Like most big-name veteran free-agent signings, it hasn't worked out very well.
Reed's playing time has declined, and Texans interim head coach Wade Phillips was non-committal when asked if Reed still was a starter on the team, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Shiloh Keo's playing time has increased in the last few weeks, with Reed often on the field in sub-packages. Reed did not start in last week's loss to the Indianapolis Colts, marking the first time they came off the bench since 2003.
Phillips' decision to reduce Reed's playing time is not a huge surprise. Reed has just 14 tackles, with no passes defensed or forced turnovers in six games played. Reed struggled badly against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 and saw much less playing time after the team's Week 8 bye. Keo played 49 snaps against the Colts, and Reed played just 32 snaps. Rookie D.J. Swearinger played 63 snaps.
Reed is due $4 million next season. It's hard to imagine he'll be back in Houston, and it wouldn't be a surprise if we're seeing the final year of their likely Hall of Fame career.

Michael R. Johnson via Flickr Reuters reports that the mainstream Republican Party has decided to jump the shark: David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush and a Republican advocate for raising the debt limit, said they hold regular question-and-answer sessions with Republican member of congress over a beer. "I have yet to meet one Republican who actually says a failure to raise the debt limit scares them," Frum said. "It is deeply, deeply troubling the number of Republicans I now talk to - and I include the mainstream - who think a technical default is manageable." Many on Wall Street disagree. They fear even the briefest default would cause a steep climb in interest rates worldwide and a tumbling U.S. dollar, which would tip a fragile economy back into recession and cause financial market upheaval on a scale not seen since the collapse of Lehman Bros.
Let us be clear: a "technical default" is manageable. It is being managed right now. We've been in "technical default" since around May 15th. Vendors are seeing payments delayed, contract signings are being put off, funding is being delayed. We can not pay soldiers, after all. They're getting food and lodging in Afghanistan or Iraq or Libya anyway; they don't need money. Pat Toomey appears to believe that would be a good idea: Republican Senator Pat Toomey has even introduced legislation directing the U.S. Treasury to prioritize debt service over other payments if the debt limit is not raised. It has 22 Republican co-sponsors in the Senate and 98 in the House of Representatives, although no members of the Republican leadership have backed it. Good thing Toomey thinks those ungrateful Chinese bondholders are important. But who are they more important than? Short answer: Republican voters. Longer answer: Social Security recipients, who traditionally receive their checks and direct deposits on the 3rd of the month. Which means the funding has to be available—to authorize scheduled ACH transfers, if nothing else—on the 2nd. Which means— since for purposes of the "deficit," Social Security is part of the "unified budget"—that Social Security's EOD balance will decline on August 2nd, since there will be no coupon receipts or security redemptions that day. In short, Toomey wants to pay bondholders and screw Social Security recipients. And they have at 110 Senators and Representatives who believe that is a good idea. I want to see all 111 of them meet with all of their SocSec recipients on 3 August 2011 and tell them, "Well, we had to balance the suffering. And it was either you or the Chinese government. And they mean more to us than you do." UPDATE: Felix focuses on the same paragraph, reaching half of the same conclusion. Take the next step, mate.

DR Congo players are due on the pitch in Gabon on Monday
The DR Congo squad boycotted their training session on Friday, just three days before their opening match at the Africa Cup of Nations.
The players are protesting over reduced bonus payments for the finals in Gabon as well as payments owed from 2015.
"This has been happening for years and years. We always prepare well but there is always a problem with bonuses," said Norwich midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu.
DR Congo are scheduled to play Morocco on Monday in their first Group C match.
The Leopards reached the semi-final at the Nations Cup two years ago in Equatorial Guinea and finished in third place.
But the players insist they have yet to receive their financial rewards for the achievement.
DR Congo's sports minister Willy Bakonga has led a delegation of 100 officials to Gabon to resolve the problems.
They told Congolese radio: "When we arrive we will talk with them (the players). We will be together so there is no problem since the bonuses are already there. We'll give them to them.''
DR Congo's Everton winger Yannick Bolasie, who is missing the Nations Cup because of injury, told BBC Sport: "It is not a great situation because as a player you want to be focused on the first game.
"If three days before the first game you are concerned about not being paid and you are boycotting training, what kind of preparation is that?
"Even once you do get paid you can't just switch your focus and think everything is all right. You need three or four days to prepare - it is crucial.
"I understand the issues because I have been through it. When I have been with the squad I've tried to block it out because I don't want it to affect my game.
"This is the first time I am seeing the situation it from the outside and it is really disturbing. The government should have sorted the issues so that everything is smooth.
"The player just want to be able to concentrate on the game but they haven't had the chance to do that."

PHNOM PENH — The municipal council recently hung a neon sign across Sisowath Quay, on the capital's popular riverfront. “Phnom Penh — The Charming City,” it boasted.
No reason was given for this sudden outburst of civic pride, but it might have been a wishful attempt to attract a better class of visitors.
About 400 meters from the sign is the Cadillac Bar. It's here that Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, co-founder of the file-sharing Web site The Pirate Bay, dined out while hiding from a Swedish arrest warrant. They were deported on Monday and sent home to serve a prison term for copyright infringements.
A pasty-faced computer geek with bad facial hair, the 27-year-old was cut out of a different cloth than the hardened criminals and sexual predators who typically drift here, earning Cambodia its reputation as a sunny country for shady characters.
The place appeals to all manner of crooks and gunrunners, as well as the occasional Islamic terrorist or Triad boss. In July the architect Patrick Devillers made headlines by voluntarily leaving their home in Phnom Penh and returning to China to give evidence in the sensational case of Bo Xilai, the former Communist boss who fell from grace amid a barrage of corruption charges.
Before that, there was the merchant of mercy killings. Roger Graham, an American who came to Cambodia in 2003, was deported three years later for enlisting customers in their assisted-suicide program through a do-it-yourself Web site. Even after their arrest, they said, “All I want to do is to run a little cafe and live the rest of my life in peace. I intend to die here.”
Others have no intention of dying here but do, like some of the drug addicts who come because prescription pills and methamphetamines are available and cheap.
Assorted pedophiles — be they rock stars or veteran cops — come because children in Cambodia remain vulnerable to trafficking despite laws meant to protect them.
The place's ultimate appeal, though, is its well-documented culture of impunity. This is a country where the then president of the Chamber of Commerce, Theng Bunma, can complain to an airline about bad service by shooting out the tire of a plane with a pistol and never have to worry about fallout. A few months later they pulled out a gun inside a plane in order to delay takeoff so as to wait for friends who were late boarding.
Life on the lam here is even better if you have connections or money. Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand who was ousted in a coup in 2006 and has lived in exile since being found guilty of corruption, used to serve a special economic adviser to their friend Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia.
The Russian business person Alexander Trofimov came to Cambodia in 2005 and started building a $300 million tourist resort on Snake Island, off the southwest coast, entrenching themselves among the “Khmer Riche,” the highest echelons of Cambodia's elite. That didn't spare them prison time after they were arrested, in 2007, on 17 charges of sexually abusing minors, including a six-year-old. But last December, just four years into their sentence, they obtained a royal pardon and was freed.
Soon, though, Trofimov was found with a girl believed to be 11 or 12. This proved too much, even for Cambodia, and they were deported in June.
Beware the vagaries of doing business with the Cambodian government. After all, if a criminal can buy themselves freedom and protection with money, money can also buy them away from him.
No sooner were the Swedish authorities getting ready to take delivery of Svartholm Warg than Stockholm announced a $59 million foreign aid package to promote democracy in Cambodia.

Protesters marched down the middle of East Main Street during rush hour Thursday, bringing traffic to a standstill.
About 50 people gathered to remember the life of India Cummings, 27, a Rochester woman who died under unknown circumstances in February after being housed at Erie County Holding Center in Buffalo. They say that they have been consistently stonewalled by authorities in Erie County, awaiting a long-delayed autopsy report.
The gathering started around 4 p.m. as community organizers, including members of Cummings' family and representatives of the Black Panther Party and BLACK (Building Leadership and Community Knowledge), listened to spoken word recitations and received an update from attorney Matthew A. Albert, who is representing the family of Cummings.

After holding hands in song and and releasing green balloons in memory of Cummings, the protesters marched west down East Main Street and then took a right down St. Paul Street toward the RTS Transit Center.
Cummings, who attended Wilson Magnet High School, lived in Lackawanna, Erie County, for about three months before their death. Friends say they were struggling with mental health issues prior to their death and that they sought to return home to Rochester.
The Buffalo News reports that at Cummings' arraignment in Erie County Court on Feb. 9, they didn't recognize their own mother. Cummings died at Buffalo General Medical Center after being released from the jail's custody. They were arrested on Feb. 1 following a carjacking in Lackawanna.
The circumstances surrounding their death are still being investigated. Albert said Cummings "went from physically healthy to dead in three weeks" while in the custody of Erie County. They suffered from "severe dehydration" and other issues, Albert said.
The New York State Commission of Correction is investigating.

"Ultimately, what we want is accountability," Albert said. "The silence is intolerable. They were literally put in a cell, forgotten about for 16 days, deprived of necessary food and sustenance, until eventually they diminished into nothing. For that to happen in 2016, when it's their job to take care of them when she's in their custody is deplorable."
Tonya Noel, who graduated with Cummings and is a lead organizer for BLACK, said, "We want to draw attention to what happened. Sadly, these things happen everywhere. Agitate, organize, educate. It's to get people together to begin the education and organization that's necessary."

Calls to both the Erie County Sheriff's Office and Erie County District Attorney's Office were not returned.
Rochester police followed protesters during the entire procession. Amid more traffic delays, the protesters stopped at the Transit Center. The Rochester Police Department Rapid Response Team displayed batons and tried to defuse the crowd. Police cars closed down traffic on St. Paul Street.
According to Rochester Police Capt. Michael Callari, no one was arrested and no one was injured. Protesters blocked traffic in both directions on Main Street for about 10 minutes, Callari said. They blocked bus traffic in and out of the Transit Center. "This interrupted bus service throughout the city," Callari said. After about 20 minutes, protesters complied with requests to move out of the street.
Callari said the response team is available to "help ensure public safety and order to the area. The teams are available to assist patrol personnel in dispersing, and if necessary, arresting people who cause a public safety concern."

The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department sued Erie County in 2009 over suicide and mental health care at Erie County Holding Center and the Erie County Correctional Facility. That lawsuit was settled.
Jamie Solomon, a member of BLACK and a classmate of Cummings at Wilson Magnet, said the decision to March was spontaneous. The heavy rain had let up and protesters wanted to bring more attention to the cause.
“We haven't been getting answers or specific details about how they died,” Solomon said. “This is about raising awareness, getting some community support, and helping bring closure to India's family. There is a lack of coverage of the case and a lack of facts being put out. We want the public to get the real truth.”

Before COP21 assembled in Paris last month, there was a sense of optimism that a new climate treaty to replace the long-expired 1997 Kyoto Protocol for reducing “greenhouse gas” emissions would be hammered out.
But now that COP 21 is approaching its scheduled end, we are finding out from the media that representatives are a long way from any effective CO2 reduction agreement. No one believes the COP21 summit is going to end tomorrow – rather expect it to drag out possibly into early next week, or even beyond. After all, when it's about “saving the planet”, there's no going home early.
The online German center-left DIE ZEIT here today describes a climate of growing chaos and diminishing order: “Almost every country has expressed reservations against the draft treaty at the climate summit.”
Among other countries DIE ZEIT blames Saudi Arabia, which threatens “to pull their support for the core goals of the treaty“, and India and Malaysia which are holding out for “greater commitments from rich countries“. According to DIE ZEIT there is neither agreement on financing for the poorest countries nor agreement on a limit in how much more the world should be permitted to warm. DIE ZEIT writes:
The Saudi Arabian representatives have indicated that they do not want to accept any long-term target of limiting the warming to a maximum of 1.5°C.”
Another sticking point brought up by DIE ZEIT is the issue of whether to stop the burning of coal completely, or to just reduce it. On this point agreement seems unlikely given the number of coal-fired power plants now under construction and the hundreds more in planning. Developing countries may express their intention to some day stop coal in a new treaty, but they will certainly push the task off to future generations. It's hard to imagine a number of struggling countries agreeing to forego the use of cheap and plentiful coal.
According to DIE ZEIT, environmental groups observing the negotiations and examining the latest draft are saying that the text in the treaty would lead “only to a weak reduction in greenhouse gases”.
So what is shaping up? Overall expect to see a treaty that will be very painful for rich industrial countries ($100bn per annum), but one that will be completely toothless against rising global CO2 emissions.
As the Catholic Church's top clergyman select a new pope, the LA Archdiocese elected to settle four clergy sex abuse cases involving allegations against defrocked priest Michael Baker. Kim Baldonado reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on March 12, 2013. (Published Wednesday, March 13, 2013)
As the Catholic Church's top clergyman select a new pope, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles elected to settle four clergy sex abuse cases involving a defrocked priest who was convicted of molestation in 2007, an attorney for the church announced on Tuesday.
The $9.99 million settlement involves cases of alleged abuse by former priest Michael Baker, according to church attorney J. Michael Hennigan.
Baker was convicted of molesting a boy in 2007. Two of the latest plaintiffs are that boy's brothers.
Two of the now-settled cases were set to go to trial soon, and a judge had said attorneys for the alleged victims could also pursue punitive damages, considered to be punishment against the defendant.
"It's a matter of vindication. Their rights are vindicated. You don't pay $10 million because nothing happened," said Vince Finaldi, one of the attorneys representing the four victims, who range in age from late 20s to early 50s.
Finaldi said the settlement will allow their clients to move forward without going to trial.
"They wanted to obtain compensation for the abuse forced on them and that helps them get the therapy they need," they said.
News of the settlement came the day the Catholic Church's top clergymen cast their first ballots in Rome to elect the next leader of the world's 1 billion Catholics.
Among the cardinals in the papal conclave is former L.A. Archbishop Roger Mahony, whose participation in the centuries-old, secretive election has drawn the ire of Catholics – even those outside of Southern California – who say the retired cardinal should recuse themselves from the sacred ritual for their role in shielding abusive priests, including Baker.
Recently released files show Baker met with Cardinal Roger Mahony in 1986 and confessed to molesting two brothers for nearly seven years.
Noting the "extremely grave and serious situation," Mahony sent Baker for psychological treatment but eventually put them back in ministry, where they molested again.
Baker returned to ministry the next year with a doctor's recommendation that they be defrocked immediately if they spent any time with minors. Despite several documented instances of being alone with boys, the priest wasn't removed from ministry until 2000. Around the same time, the church learned they were conducting baptisms without permission.

In 2007, Baker was sentenced to 10 years and four months in prison. They were released in 2011 for time served and good behavior.
In their 26-year career, Baker is alleged to have molested more than 20 children.
Calls requesting comment from the LA Archdiocese were not returned as of late Tuesday.

'Gardener's Delight': This open-pollinated, red cherry tomato took 21 weeks from seed to harvest and had both the longest fruiting period (22 weeks) and the best yields by weight for its category. Individual fruit averaged 21.6g each. The plants were the tallest (2.42m) and most vigorous. Organic seeds are available from Kings Seeds. Overall rating: 8/10.
'Sweet 100': When beginner gardeners ask me for tomato variety recommendations, I always suggest they start with ‘Sweet 100‘ – and my experience growing this popular hybrid was confirmed by the trial at the Botanic Gardens. I‘ve never had a crop failure with this vigorous, easy-care, prolific cropper. In fact, the only niggle I have with ‘Sweet 100‘ is that if you plant grafted plants, you‘ll never be able to keep up with picking and eating them all! In the Botanic Gardens‘ trial, ‘Sweet 100‘ came second only to 'Gardener's Delight' for yield (not surprising given that its fruit are about half the size), but it had a slightly higher Brix level, which means it tastes sweeter. It took 21 weeks to harvest and continued cropping for 19 weeks on plants up to 2.43m high. ‘Sweet 100' is widely available as either seed or potted plants. Highly recommended for sweet red fruit – and oodles of them. Overall rating: 8/10.
'Sungold': Fancy something other than red cherry tomatoes? This F1 hybrid had a respectable haul of small (10.3g) golden fruit over a very long period of 21 weeks. It took the 1.85m tall plants 20 weeks from seed to harvest. A worthy hybrid if you fancy golden-orange cherry tomatoes. Overall rating: 7/10.
'Early Money': Of the medium-fruited varieties, ‘Early Money' had the highest yield by weight, plus (along with ‘Juliet') had slightly higher Brix levels, indicating higher sugar levels. This F1 hybrid took 22 weeks to harvest and cropped for 18 weeks, with meaty fruit weighing 124.9g on average, on plants 2.1m tall. Sweet to eat. Overall rating: 8/10.
'Golden Nugget': Not worth the effort. This open pollinated golden cherry tomato was quick to crop, taking only 19 weeks, but didn't last the distance, fruiting for only 12 weeks. (Compare that to the 22 weeks of ‘Gardener's Delight'.) Individual fruit weighed an average of 11.4g each. Overall rating: 3/10.
'Sweet Gold': Managing only a 50 per cent pass mark, this F1 hybrid golden cherry tomato took 19 weeks to harvest and continued cropping for 19 weeks, with fruit averaging 13.6g each. The plants grew 2.25m high. An average crop from this F1 hybrid cherry tomato. Overall rating: 5/10.
'Chef's Choice Orange': Of the five medium-fruited varieties in the trial, this had the largest and heaviest fruit, weighing in at 131g each on average. (And, as a bonus, studies by the New Zealand Heritage Food Crops Research Trust have shown that orange tomatoes are richer in health-giving lycopene too.) This hybrid variety took 22 weeks to harvest and the 2.03m tall plants fruited well for 19 weeks. Overall rating: 8/10.
'Juliet': The tallest and most vigorous of the medium-sized tomatoes, ‘Juliet' grew to 2.13m. This F1 hybrid took 20 weeks to harvest but once they started cropping, there was no stopping her, with a very long fruiting period of 21 weeks. The fruit weighed 28.9g on average and recorded high Brix levels. Overall rating: 8/10.
'moneymaker': An old-time F1 hybrid. The plants were shorter than most of their compatriots, growing only to 1.73m high, and took longer to crop (22 weeks). Fruit was picked for 19 weeks and weighed 59.5g on average. This popular old-timer is no longer the best in its category. Overall rating: 6/10.
'Roma': This Mediterranean paste tomato struggles down under. I don‘t know anyone, including commercial growers with all the tricks of the trade at their disposal, who rates it here. Though long fruiting (21 weeks) in this trial, it was neither high yielding nor prolific, with fruit averaging 62.7g on short (1.57m) plants. This traditional saucing tomato is best left to the Italians! Overall rating: 4/10.
'Country Taste': With large red fruit, this F1 hybrid produced the highest yield by weight, with individual fruit averaging 158.2g. The plants grew to 2.2m tall and cropped for 19 weeks. It fell just shy of the 8/10 rating it needed to make the cut as a star performer in Auckland. Overall rating: 7/10.
'Beef Maestro': An F1 hybrid with large fruit weighing 111g on average. Slow off the mark (it took 23 weeks from seed for the first fruit to ripen), the plants grew 1.88m tall and cropped for 19 weeks. A middle-of-the-road tomato. An average performer in the large-fruited category. Overall rating: 5/10.
'Marriage Big Brandy': Although this chubby variety had the heaviest individual fruit of any variety in the trial, it soon ran out of a puff, with a pathetically short fruiting period of just nine weeks. And given that this tall (2.1m), large-fruited (168.2g) hybrid with heirloom genes took 23 weeks to harvest, it simply wasn‘t worth the wait. An inconsistently big and beautiful tomato that's sadly fleeting in fruit. Overall rating: 4/10.
Are you keen to grow your own tomatoes at home? Expert gardeners tell us what varieties they grow themselves at home.
​JACK HOBBS, AUCKLAND BOTANIC GARDENS MANAGER
Hobbs' favourite tomato is the meaty red 'Country Taste'. "It's an F1 hybrid," they say. "People can say what they like about heirloom tomatoes but they don't perform like F1s and I have grown lots of both."
This indeterminate, or vine, tomato will easily reach 1.8m, so Hobbs suggests growing it up against a fence. Most years it receives no special treatment in their garden other than a regular liquid feed, although they do use copper spray to prevent fungal infections in especially hot summers. "And 'Country Taste' always produces lots of fleshy, large, delicious fruit."

Four expert gardeners reveal their favourite tomato variety to grow at home.
ROBERT GUYTON, SOUTHLAND FOOD FOREST GARDENER
Surprisingly, Guyton – usually a passionate advocate for heirloom varieties, the more obscure the better – picks a hybrid as their favourite – the cherry 'Sweet 100'. "They are pure summer wonderfulness," they say. "Very sweet, easy to eat, no mess and they stay on the bush a long time."
Plus they ripen quickly, which is useful in Southland's short summer, they say, and the ones in their tunnelhouse keep fruiting long after all their other tomatoes have bitten the dust.
Robert also expresses a fondness for the glamorous 'Ilse of Capri', a ribbed beauty queen of a tom. "Simply because I like the tactile pleasure of picking up a fluted tomato."
We asked expert Kiwi gardeners for their tomato preferences.
GERARD MARTIN, OWNER OF KINGS SEEDS, KATIKATI
Martin says they like tart tomatoes with lots of bite. 'Black Cherry' is a favourite, they say. "It's prolific, with a great taste and a long season."
But they also rate the medium sized 'Diplom', an F1 hybrid that was, unusually, bred for maximum taste (hybrids are often bred for yield or disease resistance).
Martin also confesses to a fondness for big, meaty toms with heaps of flavour like 'Black Krim' and 'Black from Tula': "They can be ugly but they taste so good."
RUUD KLEINPASTE, CHRISTCHURCH BUGMAN
With no hesitation, Kleinpaste picked the attractively striped heirloom 'Tigerella'.
"It's consistent tasting. It's not too big and not too small – the perfect size for lunch boxes. You can use it fresh in sandwiches and salads but you can also use it cooked in sauces. Plus it's great looking."
The Australian newspaper's campaign against wind farms continued this morning with a page one story from the paper's environment editor Graham Lloyd.
Lloyd writes about purportedly “groundbreaking” German research which, they infer, may provide a plausible basis for claims about wind turbines having direct effects on health.
Lloyd writes:
The results showed that humans could hear sounds of eight hertz, a whole octave lower than had been previously assumed, and that excitation of the primary auditory cortex could be detected down to this frequency.
A description of the project is here. The research never mentions wind turbines, only low-frequency noise, which is produced by many sources found in both nature and from a wide variety of mechanical sources.
The press release pitch, with its mentions of wind turbines, smells like a hook to a topical issue calculated to amplify attention to their work. (Note, this link to the press release was down at the time of publication.)
But these new findings are hardly “groundbreaking”. Earlier work found evidence of very similar auditory cortex stimulation from noise at 12Hz, slightly higher than the 8hz in this study.
In the study that excited Lloyd and the Australian's sub-editors (the headline reads “Brains excited by wind turbines study”), auditory cortex stimulation at 8Hz (at pressure levels around the threshold of hearing) is meaningless in the context of wind turbine-generated infrasound, which is well below the threshold of perception.
Moreover, even fake stimuli can precipitate measurable activity in the brain. We know that both placebos (factors that increase expectations of positive outcomes) and nocebos (those which increase expectations of negative outcomes) can increase changes in cerebral metabolic rate when viewed via positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.
Expectations do not just affect people's subjective experience of a stimulus (such as exposure to infrasound) but can actually produce measurable changes in brain activity which may or may not be markers of anything of clinical significance.
Fascinating work from Hungary and Germany on “electrosensitive” people (for example, those claiming to be made ill from exposure to mobile phones, wifi or other “stray” electricity) has shown that when such individuals are exposed to sham (fake) radiation from their feared source while thinking it is real, they experience symptoms. Correlates of these symptoms can be measured in the brain.
The Hungarian study exposed both people with “Idiophathic Environmental Intolerance (IEI) attributed to electromagnetic fields” and control subjects not reporting this condition to sham radiation. Those claiming IEI to electromagnetic frequency radiation both expected and experienced more symptoms.
In the German study, subjectively electrosensitive patients and gender-matched healthy controls were also exposed to sham mobile phone radiation and heat as a control condition. The subjects were not aware that the radiation was fake. Both before and during these exposures:
increased activations in anterior cingulate and insular cortex as well as fusiform gyrus were seen in the electrosensitive group compared to controls, while heat stimulation led to similar activations in both groups.
As the Hungarian researchers noted, electrosensitivity:
seems to be formed through a vicious circle of psychosocial factors, such as enhanced perception of risk and expectations, self-monitoring, somatisation and somatosensory amplification, causalization and misattribution.
In short, as the old saying goes, you can worry yourself sick. And those who spread fear arguably are an important part of this process.
Today's Australian article complements Lloyd's uncritical accounts of two recent studies about wind turbine noise. They wrote that:
Scientists in Japan measured brain function and reported last year that it showed the brains of Japanese wind turbine workers could not achieve a relaxed state.
As prominent wind industry science and research commentator Ketan Joshi has written:
[the study] doesn't control for expectations, and it's very likely that the subjects could perceive the sound = 20Hz at 92 dB(G), [at] the volume at which the synthesized noise was played, would annoy anyone.
Joshi compares such levels to the noise that would be experienced right inside a wind turbine nacelle, not hundreds of meters or several kilometers away, and notes that wind farmworkers would never work inside nacelles when the turbines were turning.
Quoting an Iranian study, Lloyd continues:
In a similar vein, a study of 45 people … by Tehran University … said “despite all the good benefits of wind turbines, it can be stated that this technology has health risks for all those exposed to its sound.”
The study they referred to was of poor quality and Joshi has also mercilessly eviscerated its many problems, none of which Lloyd even hinted at.
Lloyd left messages for me to comment on the German research for their story. As their report notes, I did not respond. I have zero interest in obligingly playing into the Australian's one-sided coverage. The paper has reported on a succession of trivial to terrible “studies” and published opinion pieces which are exalted by the tiny cells of anti-wind farm activists happy to embrace any fragment that furthers their cause.
No reporter from News has ever reported on any of my five recent studies on wind here, here, here, here, or here.
The University of Auckland's Fiona Crichton who is arguably doing the world's most advanced research on nocebo effects and wind farms has similarly never been reported.
The News agenda on wind energy is a travesty of good journalism.
APTOS >> After two men died from taking counterfeit Xanax pills in Santa Cruz County recent weeks, Santa Cruz County sheriff's deputies Tuesday announced the arrest of a 22-year-old Aptos man who admitted to supplying the drug to one of the victims.
When deputies searched the home of Daniel Meehan on the 700 block of Calabasas Road on Friday, they said they found one-quarter pound of cocaine, four guns, 80 marijuana plants and a butane hash oil lab. Meehan told detectives that they tried to destroy the pills when they found out they were lethal, said sheriff's Lt. Kelly Kent.
“He burned the medication and then tried to dump them onto White Road” not far from the house, said Kent. “Deputies scoured the area and were able to locate 10 of the lethal pills.”
Meehan was arrested on suspicion of manufacturing and sales of drugs, possession of an illegal assault weapon, marijuana sales and illegal marijuana cultivation, Kent said. Meehan was booked into Santa Cruz County Jail on Friday and posted $50,000 bail, said Santa Cruz County District Attorney Jeff Rosell. Charges have not been filed, Rosell said, and they are due in court Nov. 19.
Rosell said they were unsure whether Meehan would be charged in either of the two recent deaths related to the counterfeit Xanax.
Authorities said the drug looks nearly identical to genuine Xanax, which treats anxiety and panic disorders. It actually contained fentanyl, a potent opioid medication that is cheaper to produce, authorities said.
“You have a drug that's supposed to look like Xanax, which is kind of common out there in the community, and really it's more dangerous,” Rosell said.
Santa Cruz County Coroner Stephany Fiore said the phony street Xanax has a duller texture and rougher edges than genuine Xanax.
Investigators said it remains unclear who manufactured the lethal fake Xanax, which had been distributed at at least one party and used recreationally in South County in recent weeks.
At a party in Watsonville Oct. 24, a 19-year-old man and another man ingested what they thought was Xanax, Kent said. They became severely ill and were taken to Watsonville Community Hospital, Kent said. The 19-year-old died and the other man recovered.
On Oct. 27, a 29-year-old Aptos man consumed what they thought was Xanax and was found dead in their home the next day, sheriff's Sgt. Chris Clark has said. A toxicology test showed that the man took a lethal dose of fentanyl, Kent said.
During Friday's raid, Ryan Peterson of Aptos was found at the Calabasas Road home because they were trying to confront Meehan about their friend's death due to a fake Xanax pill, Peterson said.
Peterson, 29, had two and one-half of the Xanax pills in their purse and was ticketed for drug possession and released, Kent said. Kent said Peterson had no connection to the distribution of the fake Xanax pills.
Another man at the home, 23-year-old Ryan Heinrichs of Watsonville, was arrested on suspicion of possession of brass knuckles, Kent said. Heinrichs was jailed and posted $5,000 bail, Kent said.
Editor's note: Additional information has been added to this story to clarify why Ryan Peterson was at the home on Calabasas Road.
This week, rumors are swirling that yet another incredible skill could be added to the marine mammal's seemingly bottomless bag of tricks: music appreciation.
In an interview with RadarOnline, yoga instructor Willow Withy said the dolphins they interact with at Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat in Las Vegas seem to have the ability to appreciate certain kinds of music. Specifically, Withers said, they seem to have a particular love for English rock band Radiohead.
Withy, who hosts "Yoga with the Dolphins" classes at the dolphin enclosure at the Mirage Hotel, said:
Our dolphins seem to really resonate with Radiohead music, and especially the song 'Lotus Flower. As soon as I put it on, they come up to the window and their play patterns become more fluid, friendly, and they are curious about what is going on in the yoga room. They rub against the windows, walls, and express more sensory connection. It feels like mutually shared experience as they appreciate the yoga and music together. I would say they are happy […] The speakers do not go into the water, but through the windows the dolphins absorb the vibrations of the music. Dolphins don't have great hearing, but hear and see through sonar resonance. It is how they interpret the world.
Withy, who conducts the sessions in a windowed room attached to the dolphin enclosure, added that the animals seem to also enjoy the sitar music of Anoushka Shankar and that they've taken to imitating them (such as flipping over in the water when does a headstand) when she's practicing yoga.
Intrigued by Withy's observations, we turned to dolphin expert Diana Reiss to see what they had to say about these playful creatures and their supposed penchant for Radiohead and yoga.
Reiss, a professor of cognitive psychology at Hunter College who has researched dolphins for three decades, told The Huffington Post that though Withy's comments are fascinating, they should be taken with a grain of salt.
For one thing, Reiss said that the yoga instructor got one crucial fact totally wrong. Though Withy claims that dolphins have poor hearing and rely on echolocation to experience the world, Reiss says that aside from their extraordinary biological sonar, dolphins "have excellent hearing and really good vision."
As for the claim that these dolphins love Radiohead, Reiss said: "It's hard to really comment because I don't know all the specifics, but I think it's possible that these dolphins find certain rhythms and frequencies interesting."
According to Reiss, there's currently a lack of scientific research about dolphins and their preference for music. However, they say that there is some evidence to suggest that dolphins do respond to rhythm, and there are some anecdotal claims that dolphins are able to respond to music in general.
The professor also noted the dolphins could have been responding to the movement of the people in the room, rather than the music that was playing. As dolphins are extremely intelligent, they say it wouldn't surprise them if the animals were reacting out of interest to the movements of Withy and their students during a yoga session.
Though Reiss was cautious when quizzed about the dolphins' potential capacity for music appreciation, they were unequivocal in their response regarding the animals' ability to copy Withy's yoga movements.
"Oh, we've definitely seen that before," they exclaimed. "Dolphins are highly imitative animals. They learn by watching others in their social group and imitating what they do. Often, this imitation will include imitating others who are not dolphins as well."
Minus the Bear is an extremely talented indie rock band which utilizes guitar tapping as their signature sound. They formed back in 2001 in the rainy city of Seattle. This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic was their first release; released in 2001.It was their starting point which led to their great success of today. This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic is filled with energy, evoking the desire to party. "Just Kicking it Like a Wild Donkey" is a track that utilizes both high energy and a relaxed melody in a way that the transitions do not feel forced or unusual. The song's tapping provides a relaxed and mellow vibe but turns on a dime into a high energy fast song before going back to the tapping. Their albums leading up to Planet of Ice give off the vibe of excessive drinking and partying with one's best friends; definitely a party anthem band. Since the release of This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic, Minus the Bear has released five studio albums and four EPs. Seeing this band live is definitely worth doing. I have seen them seven times now, each show quite different from the last. (Except they have never played "Get Me Naked 2: The Electric Boogaloo") I actually picked up this album at one of their shows. It's pressed on white vinyl and sounds exquisite.

What took you so long, Mr. President?
Donald Trump may have finally gotten the attention of Congress yesterday when they tweeted out what will happen if they don't come up with a new health care bill ASAP:
“BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!”
They also threatened to end “BAILOUTS” for insurance companies, which made the statesmen yawn, but taking aim at their own platinum plans — wow!
There was a great photo of a hand-lettered sign on the Internet this week that perfectly summed up Congress' hypocrisy on the ongoing collapse of American health care:
“If Obamacare is so ‘great,' why does Congress require a ‘loophole?' ”
You see, Congress and its six-figure staffers aren't partaking in the glories of the unaffordable Affordable Care Act. They were included in the initial legislation, when everyone was paying attention.
But in 2013, during the dog days of summer, something called the Office of Personnel Management invented a breathtaking exemption: Congress, it decreed, is a “small business.”
So the solons and their top staffers suddenly became eligible for subsidies on their plans of up to 70 percent — $12,000 a year.
As a Wall Street Journal guest columnist wrote last week, OPM did the heavy lifting administratively, “sparing Congress the embarrassment of a self-serving vote.”
They added: “All that would be illegal for anyone else. In fact, it is illegal for Congress.”
OPM — perfect acronym. OPM bailed out Congress with OPM — Other People's Money.
How disgraceful has this whole process been, even by Congressional standards? Chuck Schumer and Liz Warren taking selfies on the Senate floor early Friday morning in glee after McCain flip-flopped. And how about all the GOP turncoats, who ran one campaign after another on the promise of repealing this disaster, and then flinched in the clinch.
A pox on both their houses.
As Mark Steyn noted Friday, “The Democrats have long had John Kerry, who was for it before they were against it, and now the Republicans have John McCain, who was against it before they were for it.”
That Friday-morning vote confirms yet again Mark Twain's wisdom: “There is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.”
But as Dr. Johnson once noted, being hanged in a fortnight concentrates the mind wonderfully. As does the prospect of basically losing one's health insurance.
It's such a no-brainer. Conservative groups have been urging Trump to end Congress' sweetheart deal for months. Polls have shown that 94 percent of the American public would support such a move.
If our 535 lawmakers want to carve out an exemption to Obamacare for themselves, why don't we have another roll call vote on that? If they don't have the guts for that, which they don't, well — once they lose their plans they'll have some skin in the game, won't they?
Last week, the White House tried to get the attention of Congress by bringing up people who have lost out under this disaster — working people. The problem with Obamacare is, it only works if you don't. Which means the Americans most harmed by this disaster are by and large … deplorables, irredeemables, bitter clingers.
Bad enough that their premiums are through the roof. Having “insurance” is meaningless if you can't afford the deductibles, or the co-pays. Congress knows this — that's why they have adamantly, if sneakily, refused to partake of their own catastrophe.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, fancies themselves a legislative wizard of the first order. This legend in their own mind even wrote a book about their prowess: “The Long Game.”
Well, this sad game has gone on far too long. Time to call their bluff.
Mr. President, I've written your first tweet of the morning for you, a follow-up to yesterday's:
Memo to Congress: If Obamacare is good enough for your constituents, it's good enough for you! Subsidies end tomorrow! See U in court! SAD!
There it is, in 139 characters.

Every once in a while, I read a piece of writing, or look at a piece of art, or listen to a song that leaves me feeling completely and utterly dumbfounded. This past winter, it was the novel Lincoln in the Bardo, written by the incredibly talented George Saunders. The book, which centers around the death of Abraham Lincoln's beloved son Willie and the struggles that both father and son must endure in the wake of that tragic event, is both brilliant and beautiful. I remember reading the last page, closing the book, and staring at the dust jacket for the next thirty minutes, in awe of Saunders ability to craft a story that manages to be moving, strange, and philosophical all at once.
But that's what Saunders does so well. They understand the cruelty and helplessness of American life, of human life, and they don't shy away from it. Whether he's writing about Trump voters in the New Yorker or a dystopian short story about using human beings as garden ornaments, he's able to combine biting social commentary and compassion like no one else. Their humor is dark, their satire is sharp, but they never loses their empathy.
If you haven't read any of George's books, I hope my fangirl ravings will inspire you to delve deeper into their amazing body of work.  They are extremely prolific, so you have a lot to choose from! There are four short story collections, a novella, a novel, an essay collection, a children's book, and one kick-ass commencement speech on kindness that was so beloved it was turned into a book! If all these choices have you feeling overwhelmed, you can start with the story that first introduced me to George's work back in 2009. The story, titled "Jon," is about a nightmarish focus group, one is which the trendsetters and tastemakers are never allowed to leave. You can read it, right here. To learn more about George, and their work, you can visit their website. You can also follow them on Facebook.
A HUGE thank you to George for sharing their inspirations with us today! Scroll down to read more! ~Erin

A "notice and notice" system is used by some internet service providers (ISPs) in relation to the uploading and downloading activities of a user of a peer-to-peer file-sharing network, otherwise known as "P2P". It may occur when an ISP receives notification from a rights holder to a copyrighted work that one of its subscribers is allegedly hosting or sharing infringing material. The ISP may then be required to forward the notice to the subscriber, and to monitor that subscriber's activities for a period of time.[1] The ISP is not required to reveal the subscriber's personal information, nor does the ISP take any further steps to ensure that the allegedly infringing material is removed.
It is used primarily in Canada, where copyright legislation permits the download of copyrighted material, but makes it illegal to upload the same material.[1] This was legislated with bill C-60 in 2005.[2]
In contrast with the Notice and Takedown system in American law, Notice and Notice attempts to protect both parties' interests. This helps to ensure that non-infringing material is not removed under the guise of copyright protection.[3]

Plug-and-Play Satellites
CubeSats are tiny satellites 4 inches long and less than 3 pounds each. They're easy enough to build that amateurs and high school students have done it—and they've helped spark a total rethinking of what it takes to send a satellite into space. Researchers at the Air Force Research Laboratory and elsewhere have been working on a new plug-and-play approach that can be applied to satellites up to 1000 pounds. By standardizing the usual components and developing a common language for the parts to communicate with one another, designers can avoid rethinking the gyroscope for every new project. The result: A satellite can be designed and built in six days instead of six years. Northrop Grumman has adopted this approach for its Modular Space Vehicles (MSV), which will allow military commanders to order custom tactical satellites and receive them within weeks. The first MSV is expected to launch in 2013.
Scott Langley waits patiently for their ball to fall into the cup at the 16th hole Sunday.
What was the old Carly Simon song used for the ketchup commercial? "Anticipation, is making me wait."
Scott Langley knows the feeling.
On Sunday, Langley hit a putt on the 16th hole that hung on the edge of the cup for what seemed like forever, although in reality it was just 22 seconds.
Watch as both Langley and playing partner Bubba Watson are perplexed as to how to proceed.
The official rule involved is Rule 16-2. Here's how it reads:
"When any part of the ball overhangs the lip of the hole, the player is allowed enough time to reach the hole without unreasonable delay and an additional ten seconds to determine whether the ball is at rest. If by then the ball has not fallen into the hole, it is deemed to be at rest. If the ball subsequently falls into the hole, the player is deemed to have holed out with their last stroke, and must add a penalty stroke to their score for the hole; otherwise, there is no penalty under this Rule."
Bryan Jones, co-vice chairperson of the PGA Rules Committee, watched the video and here's their interpretation:
"That was a pretty short putt. Generally the player is allowed a little 'reaction time' to the putt not dropping and the time needed to get to the hole before the 10 seconds starts. They certainly took a circuitous route to the hole and while watching I started my count and the ball fell in at the eight-second mark based on my count.
"An argument could certainly be made that they could have reacted a little quicker and the clock would have started sooner. In any case the comments by the announcers about hitting a moving ball are completely incorrect because the specifics of Rule 16-2 override Rule 14 in this example."
Fortunately for Langley, their patience was eventually rewarded.

(This article has spoilers.)
If you've ever lived in a house for more than a decade, or worked at a job where you could navigate every crevice of the workplace in your sleep, you know what it feels like to be familiar with an environment.
Have you ever had an experience where something about that environment changed drastically? Say, you came home and everything was reorganized. Or the workplace was bought out and turned into a different business all together. Most people experience an intense reaction to this kind of shift in familiarity -- like a world so second-nature to you has been inverted into a kind of Bizarro World, or Moonside.
I've written before about how the criteria that game reviewers use to deem games good or bad doesn't put unique use of games as art in a position where it can redeem a game from flaws under the traditional graphics, sound, gameplay model of reviewing. The alternative is true as well: games like Skyrim, which prioritize these three criteria and do extremely well in them, may not have extremely compelling stories. Reviewers are more likely to say why a game is good because of what you can do and what interacting with the environment feels like than because of the story. And why would they do otherwise? Assessing a story to completion takes time, assessing gameplay much less so.
But while we're talking about Skyrim, let's mention possibly the most interesting subplot in the game itself: the plot to assassinate the emperor. This was significant for two reasons, one obvious and one not. The obvious reason is that it's the emperor. The not-obvious reason is that you have likely spent dozens of hours, if not more, under this person's fictional rule. For all the disorder that exists in Skyrim, the rule of an emperor feels safe and beyond the scope of what the game is willing to disrupt.
Skyrim received lofty praise for many reasons, but this subplot was rarely one of them. Yet, it's arguably the most interesting story element in the game.
Now let's bring up an underappreciated aspect of a game that wasn't so loftily praised: the disruption of familiarity in Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, which I will henceforth refer to as SO3 for brevity.
By all measures, the game reviewing community thought SO3 was all right. Not great, but not bad either. More than likely, phrases like "more of the same" were used, because the gameplay was similar to other JRPGs, the graphics were in the typical JRPG anime style, and the characters didn't do much to escape cliches of the genre.
In hindsight, SO3 was not just "all right." It epitomized the concept of disrupted familiarity that I'm developing through this article.
If you read old SO3 reviews today, a frequent complaint will be that the game is "slow." That the story takes a while to "get going." That much of the game is spent doing mundane tasks, setting you in an environment where you spend dozens of hours meandering until seemingly major and unexpected plot shifts happen.
I maintain that this design decision, conscious or not, was one of the most interesting storytelling moves I've seen in a video game.
Star Ocean: Till the End of Time sets you on an extremely advanced resort planet which is subsequently invaded, stranding you on a planet with human development equivalent to 16th century Earth. (a liberal estimate -- 14th century would be more appropriate.) A criminal from your own society's level of development has abused their technological advantage to establish themselves as a local warlord. Immediately, this does a couple of interesting things: it prompts you to think about divides between developed societies and undeveloped societies, and it forces you to spend a good 5 to 10 hours on this planet.
After you feel comfortable in this environment, you're ripped from this planet to another planet with development equivalent to 17th century Earth. Already, you've acquiesced to a kind of backward development similar to the feeling a college student has upon realizing that meal time will be more ramen and less mom's spaghetti, but now everything is different and there are new faces and everything is weird.
You'll probably have thoughts like, "how long am I going to be here? I was just getting comfortable", and "when am I getting back to my own society?" -- but, like someone who has been forced to leave their home and just deal with it, you'll learn to get comfortable in this new environment, because you'll spend about 40 to 60 hours here.
After you're thoroughly invested in the politics and relations of characters in this previously foreign territory, the game uproots you from any sense of familiarity to remind you that, yes, the extremely advanced rival federation that invaded your resort planet didn't forget about you and is about to annihilate everything you've spent 40 hours working on quite easily.
The effect this has is similar to Carl Sagan's monologue in Pale Blue Dot:
"Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds."
You think, at this point, that you've got it all figured out. Your priorities are back in order, because you're trying to overcome this rival federation. At this point, you're as top-priority as you could be.
That is, of course, until you figure out that the situation which just happened -- a higher society invading a pathetically lower society -- has been flipped on you. Everyone in your universe, including the rival society which just invaded your planet, is in serious danger. Because this time, a higher universe is invading a lower universe, and the lower universe is your universe, because your universe is that universe's video game.
The game's storyline is a manipulation of your sense of scale. By the time this happens, you've grown such a familiarity with everything around you that to have it disrupted this way is jarring. It causes you to distrust everything around you in a way that I have not seen a book do. It disallows you to become too familiar or trusting with anything, such that even a minor place you thought would always remain constant is now variable and weird.
Hence: disrupted familiarity.
This is one of the most unique storytelling devices video games have to offer, because a book or movie will not force a reader or viewer to familiarize themselves with the surrounding environment to this extent. In Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, the player is painfully familiar with every surrounding by the time those surroundings are rendered trivial with respect to the plot.
Star Ocean is not the only game series to use disrupted familiarity. The cliche of the RPG hero whose village has been burned to the ground -- that works so well because of disrupted familiarity. By the time the player has found the village burned, the player has grown so used to the village being there that to think of it expendable is weird.
However, while other games like Skyrim and JRPGs can use disrupted familiarity for interesting purposes, Star Ocean: Till the End of Time is definitely the game to use this device better than any other game, which retains it in my mental list of remarkable games forever. It exemplifies a game which uses a storytelling device particularly unique to video games because of how well video games can employ the device, and it makes a strong case for games as an artistic medium.
A Portland woman has accused CenturyLink of overcharging them after salespeople came to their door with offers of cheap, superfast internet access, according to a federal lawsuit.
The class-action lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Portland by local attorney Michael Fuller and the Los Angeles firm, Geragos & Geragos.
The filing come just days after Geragos & Geragos filed a class-action suit accusing the company of defrauding customers; it seeks as much as $12 billion in damages. A former employee sued the company last week, alleging they lost their job after calling attention to fraudulent billings.
The spate of lawsuits could spell trouble for the Louisiana telecommunications company, which is in the midst of a $34 billion merger with Level 3 Communications Inc.
, filed on behalf of Portland resident Heather Gonsior, accuses CenturyLink of systematically using illegal billing tactics throughout Oregon to increase profits and to get a leg up on its competition. The lawsuit estimates that claims by CenturyLink's Oregon customers could exceed $260 million.
"CenturyLink, Inc.'s pattern and practice of misleading customers about the costs of its services are well-known within the industry, and among utility regulators," it says.
CenturyLink salespeople showed up at Gonsior's door on March 5, 2016, and told them the company's new fiber-optic network, which offers speedy internet access and a new cable TV service, had become available in their neighborhood, the lawsuit said.
They told them that if they signed up for a bundled package, they could lock in a rate for one year, the suit says. This rate would be lower than what they were paying at the time, they told them
But, according to screenshots of online chats between Gonsior and CenturyLink included in the lawsuit, they were overbilled.
Instead of a bill for $81.50, as Gonsior said they were promised by the salespeople, they said they were billed $174. Gonsior contacted CenturyLink several times over the next few months trying to get their bill down without any luck, the suit said.
At one point, according to the screenshots, they wrote, "I can't really bear the thought of calling that customer service number again. I hope you can get the overages on the first three bills credited to my account and get the bills corrected going into the future. Thanks!"
Instead, CenturyLink employees told them they weren't aware of the promotion they were promised, screenshots showed.
The suit cites a March 8 article by The Oregonian/OregonLive about mounting complaints against CenturyLink by Oregon residents.
"CenturyLink, Inc.'s unlawful billing tactics in Oregon include billing customers for services the customers never requested, billing higher amounts than quoted during sales calls and door-to-door sales campaigns, billing customers for hidden fees when they canceled their services due to the higher amounts they were being billed, billing customers for periods of service before service was connected, and overbilling customers for returned equipment," the lawsuit alleges.
The suit accuses the telecom company of violating the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act, the state's consumer protection law.
CenturyLink customers who paid for its services in Oregon and learned after June 19, 2016, that they were overbilled or charged fees the company failed to disclose may join the class-action, which seeks restitution and damages, and demands a jury trial. Those interested in joining the suit can send an email to geragos@geragos.com.
In an email, CenturyLink spokesperson Mark Molzen called the class-action lawsuits "opportunistic" and said they were not unexpected. The suits do not change the company's original position on the wrongful termination suit, they said.
"Our employees know that if they have any concerns about ethics or compliance issues, we have an Integrity Line in place, 24 hours a day, seven days a week," Molzen said. "Our former employee did not make a report to the Integrity Line and our leadership team was not aware of the alleged matter until the lawsuit was filed."
They said the allegations made by the former CenturyLink employee were "completely inconsistent" with company policies and culture, which include honesty and integrity. However, the company takes the allegations seriously, they said, and is "diligently investigating" the matter.

Login credentials for as many as 117 million LinkedIn accounts have been put up for sale online by someone who is seeking more than $2,200 for the haul, a security researcher said.
The credentials—which include e-mail addresses and passwords hashed using the woefully weak SHA1 function—appear to come from a 2012 breach of the career networking site, researcher Troy Hunt said in a series of tweets . LinkedIn officials have since verified that the 2012 hack was the source and said they are working to invalidate any passwords that may still be actively used on compromised accounts. According to LeakedSource, a site that maintains a database of more than 1.25 billion compromised accounts, the new batch contains data for 167 million accounts . 117 million of the records in the batch include a password field.
The discovery means that the 2012 LinkedIn breach was much bigger than previously believed. At the time, researchers found almost 6.5 million credentials belonging to site users. It's not clear if the new number of affected accounts is news to LinkedIn. In the days following discovery of the 2012 breach, company officials implemented a mandatory password reset for affected users. A statement from company officials on Wednesday saying that they're working to change any passwords still in use leaves open the possibility that they were unaware the number was so high.
According to posts on social media sites, the data was advertised on a dark Web site known as The Real Deal by someone with the user name peace_of_mind. It offers data for 167 million accounts for five bitcoins, which at current exchange rates is worth about $2,200.
In an e-mail, LinkedIn officials wrote:
In 2012, LinkedIn was the victim of an unauthorized access and disclosure of some members' passwords. At the time, our immediate response included a mandatory password reset for all accounts we believe were compromised as a result of the unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, we advised all members of LinkedIn to change their passwords as a matter of best practice. Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012. We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is a result of a new security breach. We take the safety and security of our members' accounts seriously. For several years, we have hashed and salted every password in our database; and we have offered protection tools such as email challenges and dual factor authentication. We encourage our members to visit our
safety center to ensure they have two-step verification authentication and to use strong passwords in order to keep their accounts as safe as possible.
The LeakedSource post breaks down the most commonly used passwords and they reveal a stunning lack of care on the part of end users—and more to the point, on the part ofr LinkedIn for allowing them in the first place. The most widely used passcode was 123456, with 753,305 accounts. It was followed by linkedin with 172,523, password with 144,458, 123456789 with 94,314, 12345678 with 63,769, and 111111, with 57,210. Many sites are reluctant to forbid the use of such weak passwords out of a fear of alienating users. The leak underscores just how much a new approach is needed.

Speaking to Fox News anchor Bret Baier Monday morning, Fox & Friends co-hosts Brian Kilmeade and Peter Johnson set up a comparison between the situation in the Crimean peninsula and the Cuban Missile Crisis, which they said reflected poorly on President Barack Obama's round of golf this weekend. [...] “Also, JFK didn't go golfing during the Cuban Missile Crisis,” Kilmeade said. “The president was.”
Okay, aside from the fact that we shouldn't take anything away from JFK's golf game because they were probably the best golfing president ever, here's something that even Brian Kilmeade should be able to understand: The Ukraine crisis is not the Cuban Missile Crisis. That's not to say what's happening in Ukraine is unimportant, but until Putin sets their sights on placing Russian nuclear missiles within spitting distance of Florida, and until Obama decides that stopping Putin from doing that is worth risking a nuclear war, and until the world is on the brink of nuclear annihilation, then the Cuban Missile Crisis this ain't. Of course, even if Kilmeade were to acknowledge that, it's not like they wouldn't come up with some other reason for why Obama sucks. After all, it's their job.
Researchers at Aalto University in Finland have developed a new and significantly cheaper method of manufacturing fuel cells. A noble metal nanoparticle catalyst for fuel cells is prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD).
This ALD method for manufacturing fuel cells requires 60 per cent less of the costly catalyst than current methods.
"This is a significant discovery, because researchers have not been able to achieve savings of this magnitude before with materials that are commercially available," says Docent Tanja Kallio of Aalto University.
Fuel cells could replace polluting combustion engines that are presently in use. However, in a fuel cell, chemical processes must be sped up by using a catalyst. The high price of catalysts is one of the biggest hurdles to the wide adoption of fuel cells at the moment.
The most commonly used fuel cells cover anode with expensive noble metal powder which reacts well with the fuel. By using the Aalto University researchers' ALD method, this cover can be much thinner and more even than before which lowers costs and increases quality.
With this study, researchers are developing better alcohol fuel cells using methanol or ethanol as their fuel. It is easier to handle and store alcohols than commonly used hydrogen. In alcohol fuel cells, it is also possible to use palladium as a catalyst.
The most common catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells is platinum, which is twice as expensive as palladium. This means that alcohol fuel cells and palladium will bring a more economical product to the market.
Fuel cells can create electricity that produces very little or even no pollution. They are highly efficient, making more energy and requiring less fuel than other devices of equal size. They are also quiet and require low maintenance, because there are no moving parts.
In the future, when production costs can be lowered, fuel cells are expected to power electric vehicles and replace batteries, among other things. Despite their high price, fuel cells have already been used for a long time to produce energy in isolated environments, such as spacecrafts. These results are based on preliminary testing with fuel cell anodes using a palladium catalyst. Commercial production could start in 5-10 years.
This study was published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C. The research has been funded by Aalto University's MIDE research program and the Academy of Finland.
I'm not saying that given the choice I wouldn't pick a robust economy and a worry-free global outlook. But circumstances being what they are, I have to say that as the White House campaign hits its final stride under the ominous shadow of the Wall Street meltdown and the deep recession that's hurtling this way, perhaps the only silver lining -- the one unexpected pleasure -- has been watching the Drudge Report be completely neutered by current events.
I'm not saying that given the choice I wouldn't pick a robust economy and a worry-free global outlook. But circumstances being what they are, I have to say that as the White House campaign hits its final stride under the ominous shadow of the Wall Street meltdown and the deep recession that's hurtling this way, perhaps the only silver lining -- the one unexpected pleasure -- has been watching the Drudge Report be completely neutered by current events.
Matt Drudge is still doing their loyal best to boost the chances of the GOP down the homestretch in the form of a blizzard of anti-Obama and pro-McCain links on their site. (Last week, it was the half-baked McCain "comeback" that Drudge hyped relentlessly.)
And there's no question that Drudge's Web traffic remains strong and continues to grow, thanks to a burgeoning international audience. But in terms of setting the ground rules -- in terms of setting the campaign agenda -- Drudge has been AWOL since mid-September when the credit crisis erupted.
Their current spectator status mirrors that of the low-flying right-wing bloggers. Just as the bloggers were hailed for their (pseudo) detective work in undermining CBS' Dan Rather in 2004, Drudge was credited for the way they used their widely read platform to push the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth story into the mainstream press, which helped derail John Kerry's campaign.
Four years ago, Drudge and the right-wing bloggers were at the peak of their political power. Today, they're pretty much watching the election pass them by, reduced to the role of frustrated sideline hecklers.
But that's sure not the narrative the press enjoys pushing about Drudge. In The Way to Win, the 2006 conventional wisdom-affirming book about campaigning, Mark Halperin and John Harris were wildly impressed by Drudge's acumen and their nearly limitless media power. The authors devoted an entire chapter to Drudge, toasting their "visionary" "insights" and anointing them "the Walter Cronkite of their era."
"Matt Drudge rules our world," they wrote. "With the exception of the Associated Press, there is no outlet other than the Drudge Report whose dispatches instantly can command the attention and energies of the most established newspapers and television newscasts."
And looking ahead to 2008, the duo warned, "No Democratic politician will survive in the 2008 presidential campaign without understanding the singular power of Drudge, and crafting a strategy to defend against this power." (That wasn't the only thing Halperin and Harris got wrong about 2008.*)
That adoration has remained constant among mainstream journalists, who praise Drudge's godlike power and prestige, and then benefit from the high-traffic links they reward them with.
"What nobody who follows the daily cut and thrust of American politics questions is Drudge's continuing power to drive the stories and shape the narratives that define presidential politics," Politico announced this year. [Emphasis added.]
Not to be out-Drudged, washingtonpost.com's Chris Cillizza recently labeled them the "single most influential source for how the presidential campaign is covered in the country."
Well, I'm here to call bullshit.
And no, this isn't just a wishful, I-don't-like-Drudge-so-I'm-going-to-claim-he's-irrelevant column.
This is fact.
Because it's obvious that since Wall Street's meltdown commenced five weeks ago, and since America's economic crisis became a tsunami of a news story that's not only dominated the media landscape, but also irrevocably altered the course of the campaign, the Drudge Report has become largely irrelevant in terms of the setting the news agenda for the White House run.
That's because a story like the unfolding credit crisis -- sober and complicated -- knocks Drudge completely out of their element of frivolous, partisan gotcha links.
Think about it. Since Monday, September 15, when word of emergency government intervention to save the economy began to spread, the presidential race, according to all the available data, has gone through a dramatic fourth-quarter shift, with Barack Obama opening up a comfortable lead. We haven't seen this kind of wholesale shift in voter sentiment this late in a White House campaign since 1980.
The race is unrecognizable in terms of where the players are situated now and where they were five weeks ago. (Between September 15 and October 19, there was a 12-point swing in the Gallup daily tracking poll.) Now ask yourself: What role has the Drudge Report played in that burst of campaign movement? The answer, of course, is zero. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Their trademark flashing red lights have gone missing.
The dynamics of the campaign have irrevocably changed, and the mighty Drudge Report, the news site Beltway journalists trip over themselves to genuflect in front of, has been a complete bystander in the closing weeks of the 2008 campaign. (Not that this is the first time Drudge has choked down the stretch of a nationwide election.)
The reason is simple. Because of the unprecedented economic turmoil, we're now in serious times. (Fifty thousand home foreclosures this year, in the state of New Jersey alone, is serious business.) And the Drudge Report doesn't do serious. The American public's attention has shifted from the campaign to the economy, and that's why the Drudge Report remains largely irrelevant to that unfolding story.
In fact, nearly two-thirds of Americans (63 percent) claimed economic conditions or the stock market drop were the news story they followed most closely during the second week in October, compared with just 24 percent who selected the campaign. Meanwhile, the credit crisis has unleashed waves of voter anxiety.
As long as those patterns hold, Drudge finds themselves in no-man's-land with no levers of power to pull.
For instance, Drudge spent last week going all-in on the McCain "comeback" narrative. But rather than aping the line, most of the press corps demurred, simply because the nationwide polling data did not support the claim. In fact, as Howard Kurtz noted on washingtonpost.com on Monday, the press has pivoted in the opposite direction, with even conservative media commentators declaring the cause lost for John McCain.
One of the few times Drudge has come up in the national conversation was when conservative commentator Pat Buchanan almost got laughed off the set of Hardball after citing Drudge's unscientific reader poll to suggest Sarah Palin had been the clear winner of the vice-presidential debate. (See Crooks and Liars for the clip.)
And yes, it's true that post-Wall Street meltdown, Drudge did influence the campaign narrative when, on the eve of the vice-presidential debate, they trumpeted information about moderator Gwen Ifill's upcoming book. But that was ostensibly a get-the-media story; it didn't affect the Obama campaign or help to boost the Republican ticket. Most viewers still thought Palin lost the debate.
Other than that, Drudge has mostly been shooting blanks and remains unrecognizable from the 2004 campaign, when their site was central in pushing President Bush's re-election.
Why the misfires? As Halperin themselves noted in 2006, "Matt Drudge is not doing stories on policy, on welfare, on healthcare. He's doing stories on the most salacious aspects of American politics. When that drives the dialogue, that's where the country heads, that's where our political coverage heads."
Thanks to our current economic crisis, "the most salacious aspects of American politics," as Halperin put it, have taken a vacation during the closing weeks of this campaign. And the press can't even pretend that those "salacious aspects" are remotely newsworthy, which means the second part of Halperin's claim, about Drudge driving the dialogue, no longer applies.
Halperin's writing partner John Harris admitted as much recently while addressing students at St. Lawrence University in upstate New York. In an article on Harris' speech, the local paper reported: "The Republican Party's 'Machiavellian' style of attack politics hasn't struck a chord in this election, Mr. Harris said, leaving John McCain to shift strategies nearly weekly."
Note that that Machiavellian style of attack politics is pretty much code for the Drudge Report, which has been unplugged down the stretch.
Not that Drudge hasn't tried to lay gotcha (Machiavellian) traps on behalf of Republicans:

Not one of those Drudge headlines, all posted within the past week, led anywhere in terms of blossoming into larger, damaging stories for Democrats, let alone full-blown controversies. (The ACORN voter registration story, which Drudge has peddled incessantly, has also failed to take hold in the mainstream as a true campaign scandal.)
Yet the sad truth is that in previous campaigns, all those items stood a very real chance of being embraced by the Beltway press and becoming big stories. As Glenn Greenwald wrote last year:
The last two presidential elections were overwhelmed by the pettiest and most fictitious "controversies" (things like Al Gore's invention of the Internet and Love Story claims, John Kerry's windsurfing and war wounds, John Edwards' hair brushing and Howard Dean's scream), and our discussions of the most critical issues are continuously clouded by distortive sideshows concocted by this filth-peddling network. Their endless lynch mob crusades supplant rational and substantive political debates, and the most wild fictions are passively conveyed by a lazy and co-opted national media.
Still, despite Drudge's power outage this year, you won't see Harris or Halperin or any of the other Beltway players who lust after their attention ever mention that the Drudge Report's cache has been dented. That kind of talk is not allowed. Only constant adoration will do.
In fact, just this month, Halperin still counted Drudge among "the five most important people in American politics right now -- who aren't running for president."
And while liveblogging the final presidential debate last week, Jonathan Martin at Politico, which is part of Drudge's permanent cheering section, claimed that Joe the Plumber had been inserted into the national debate about taxes because McCain picked up their story from the Drudge Report.
" 'Joe the plumber' can thank "Matt theInternetist" for their instant fame," wrote Martin, who noted that "McCain first used this anecdote in their economic speech" on Monday.
The problem with that gratuitous hat tip to Drudge was that the Drudge Report didn't highlight Joe the Plumber until Wednesday, two days after McCain started talking about him. So, no, the Everyman does not owe their instant fame to Drudge.
But the Drudge fans at Politico ("he has an uncanny ability to drive the national conversation with what they choose to highlight on their site") sure wanted to push that pleasing line.
And today, either Beltway insiders can't see that the media landscape has changed dramatically in recent weeks, or they're too afraid to acknowledge that their online emperor is missing some clothes.
*Footnote: I had to chuckle as I paged through The Way to Win for the first time since it was published in 2006. The book is about the blueprint for taking the White House and which politicians were positioning themselves for victory in 2008. I laughed because there was one name that did not appear anywhere in the book about the upcoming campaign, one name Halperin and Harris left out of the index: "Obama, Barack."
A boil water notice has been issued for customers in a southwestern portion of Bastrop County Wednesday.
Aqua Water Supply users living in the following areas should boil water before drinking, cooking or ice-making:Texas 20 south of the Cedar Creek Bridge to Humble LaneWalter Hoffman Road to the 400 blockBar L Mesa DriveDairy RoadLone Star RoadMilam LanePleasant Chapel Road
Wednesday morning parts of the Aqua Water Supply system experienced low pressure due to the recent severe flooding, according to the notice that was sent out about 3:45 p.m.
Steve Dunn, production manager for Aqua Water Supply, said system repairs were ongoing Wednesday afternoon, but they could not give an estimate for when the boil water notice will be lifted for the affected areas.
Once Aqua Water Supply tests the system for quality following the repairs, customers will be notified through telephone messages, local media and cable channel 8, according to the notice.
Melbourne, enough.
First it was deconstructed lattes served in test tubes, then rainbow or algae coffees became a hit.
It's reached a point where, honestly, could this city get any more hipster?
The answer is yes, yes it can.
And it just did. There comes a point where in the pursuit of trying to be so ‘different' you become stupid - a line hipsters have just crossed.
But only, if they buy this.
Confectionery store, Spoonful of Sugar, has created a social media storm after attempting to sell a single spoonful of Nutella sprinkled with a few nuts for a whopping $5.
In an image posted by city guide Melbourne Cool to Facebook, the dismal looking spoon of Nutella can be seen lying next to a sign labelled “Naughty Nutella” with a $5 price tag.
"This isn't cool. This is the biggest spoonful of s**t I've ever seen. $5… People in this city are literarily (sic) surviving on a few dollars a day and some bright spark thought this would be a good way to generate some income. Greedy bastards," one social media user wrote.
Another user wrote, "I didn't think Melbourne could get more .... Melbourne. $5 for Nutella. This is #peakextra.”
Others were quick to call a spade a spade.
“Who would actually pay that for a tablespoon of Nutella? Regardless of how beautifully it's presented, it's still a tablespoon of Nutella,” one woman wrote.
And it's not just Nutella which they are selling by the spoonful at exuberant prices. Other flavours include “Blissful Banofee” and “Playful PB & J”.
A kilo of Nutella sells for about $9 at most major supermarkets.
One thing that is not yet clear, is if the cheeky store is just trying to ‘bait' social media, after all, who can forget the fury that was sparked by the avocado latte, which proved to be a clever hoax.
Goma has only 11km of good roads and is blighted by poverty and violence, but the city's cycling club is going from strength to strength
A chain of Lycra-clad cyclists whizzes by the blue and white UN base tasked with keeping the peace in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Weaving in and out of traffic, competing with motorbike taxis, they overtake a lorry on its last legs, shuddering as it spews out a fog of black smoke. Concentrating hard on not hitting a speed-bump or pothole, the cyclists receive curious stares from men on chukudus, large wooden scooters used for transporting everything from building materials to sacks of vegetables.
Mount Nyiragongo, the live volcano that last erupted over the city in 2002, looms before them, smoking.
“They are fast,” mutters a driver, as they athletically change gear and guns their Land Cruiser in a vain attempt to catch up with them. “They are too fast.”
Goma, where viciously sharp lava coats the dirt roads, insecurity is rife and groups of thieves lie in wait, is a cyclist's nightmare. But that hasn't stopped the Goma Cycling Club. Since it started a year ago, its young members have become very good, very quickly.
One, Jimmy Mohindo, is now the Congolese champion, and spends much of their time abroad competing. Four others are in the junior national team. Considering most of them come from poor families, and are lucky if they get enough to eat, let alone a proper racing bike, this is remarkable.

“I work very hard not to disappoint my club, but also to defend my life,” says Samuel Mwanukehere, a lean 18-year-old. “My father is dead, and they were the one who provided everything. My mother sells fish, onions and tomatoes and manages to feed us twice a day, but it's a hard life. I'm working just to have a good life. I only dream of bicycles – that's it.”
When Mwanukehere finishes school, they hope to make it big as a cyclist and pay the bills with their prize-money. Some of their teammates have already had a taste of this – Daniel Ishara, who wears their Congolese junior team Lycra with pride and with rainbow-striped legwarmers, recently won $500 (£400), which they spent on a set of wheels that brings them great joy.
This morning they are competing with each other: eight rounds each of Goma's only 11km (seven mile) stretch of good roads, some of which were built by the UN last year.

After each cyclist has rolled in, exhausted, their coach and club founder roars up on their motorbike and gives them a pep talk by the side of a busy roundabout.
Charles-Guy Makongo already has their hands full helping the DRC's most vulnerable people access justice – their day job is directing the American Bar Association – but in their free time, they take some 30 teenage cyclists under their wing.
One gets a telling off for taking a shortcut in the competition. “You're only cheating yourselves if you do that,” Makongo says.

“You need to change your rhythm,” they tell another. “If you can't change that, it won't work.”
Their briefing over, the cyclists park their bikes by the side of the road and, helmet straps dangling, tramp down a narrow alley over chunks of lava to a local café of rough wood. They sit on long benches, passing chunky chapatis and large mugs of fermented milk down the tables. Laughing and shouting over each other, they exchange advice about pacing themselves and sprinting in between milky slurps.
Makongo makes sure to get at least this one meal into them after training. “Some of the families are poor, and if we don't have breakfast, they wouldn't have anything to eat,” they say.
A keen cyclist himself, they started the club after a few boys saw them braving Goma's traffic and asked them to help them improve their riding. On normal training days, there's no missing Makongo, riding alongside their proteges in their Cameroonian Lycra suit. On competition days, though, they are on their BMW motorbike, zooming after their cyclists, lights flashing, beeping inconsiderate drivers, and stopping to hold up minibuses.
At first, the cyclists were greeted with disbelief and unbridled aggression from their fellow road-users, but after launching a “respect riders” campaign and handing out leaflets, the shouts of: “What are you doing on the road?” have become less common.

Much of Makongo's free time and a good chunk of their income is spent on the club – on taking them to competitions in neighbouring Rwanda, haggling over helmets, shoes and Lycra in the secondhand Virunga market, and buying $2,000 carbon fibre bikes from the US.  They are considering setting up a bike workshop to try to ensure the club has an income when they eventually return to Cameroon.
In a region scarred by war, Makongo thinks it is worth the expense to keep their members busy and focused on something positive. Some are still at school, some are trying to work out how to afford university, but all are aware that unemployment is extremely high and are trying to find a way out of poverty.
The lack of jobs is one of the biggest factors driving thousands of Congolese people to protest against a government that, they say, is only good at collecting taxes and clinging to power.
On Monday, the prime minister resigned, clearing the way for a “unity government” after the current administration did a deal with a sliver of the opposition allowing the president, Joseph Kabila, to stay on beyond their constitutionally mandated two terms.
The opportunities that do exist in Goma can be deadly. “Young men here are always under pressure to join armed groups,” Makongo says. “So the idea was to stop them. Goma is a very complicated place.”
There has not been much rebel recruitment in Goma since the powerful M23 group was defeated in 2013, but last weekend the group's leader was reported missing from the demobilisation camp in Uganda where they were being held. They have reportedly crossed into the DRC with dozens of soldiers.
“When you are a young, unemployed man, you may have bad ideas about joining bandit groups and militias,” says Cadeau Kabumba, one of the club's newest members. “The club keeps you busy and stops you having those thoughts.”
Like many of the Goma Cycling Club's members, Kabumba's concern is more prosaic but no less pressing – how to afford a bike.

They have finished school and would love to be an agronomist, but there are so few jobs that they have to content themselves with very occasional work as a gardener that pays $15 a day. With ageing parents to support, they have no money. They borrowed a Matabaro from their brother – a single-speed heavy goods vehicle of a bike with ribbons on the handlebars – and comes in last in every competition. However, they have strong legs from jogging and thinks if they can one day get their hands on a racer, they will do well.
According to Ngunza Ngolo Lukanga, a 66-year-old cycling fan, cycling was big in the Belgian colonial era, when there were some good roads in the countryside near Goma, but under Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the country for 31 years, the roads were left to go to ruin.
“This cycling is something new in Goma. These are new roads. It never existed before,” says Lukanga, stopping on a dusty street to get a closer look at the boys' bikes.
But a few good roads are not enough to keep the club's members spinning, they say, predicting that most would have to drop out after a year.
“There is talent but they need to be supported. These boys should be sponsored by big companies like in developed countries. They spend their own money, and they don't have money.”
Poverty will not put Kabumba off, however, and they refuse to be diverted. “I hope one day I'll get a job and be able to save up for a good bike,” Kabumba says. “But I won't quit cycling, even if I get a good job. I can work in the daytime, and cycle in the evenings. I dream of going to the big competitions.”
Dark Web is right now going through a very rough time.Just two days ago, a hacker group affiliated with Anonymous broke into the servers of Freedom Hosting II and took down more than 10,000 Tor-based .onion dark websites with an alarming announcement to its visitors, which said:Freedom Hosting II is the single largest host of underground websites accessible only through Tor anonymising browser that hosts somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of all sites on the Dark Web, anonymity and privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis estimated Besides defacing all Dark Web sites hosted on Freedom Hosting II with the same message and stealing its database, the hackers also demanded a ransom for 0.1 Bitcoin (just over $100) to return the compromised data to the hosting service.Now, it has been reported that the stolen database from Freedom Hosting II has publicly been released online to a site hosted on the Tor network, which includes the email details of nearly 381,000 users, 'Have I Been Pwned' tweeted According to the Anonymous hackers, more than 50 percent of all files hosted on Freedom Hosting II servers were related to child pornography.Those illegal websites were using gigabytes of data when Freedom Hosting II officially allows no more than 256MB per site, the Anonymous hacker claimed.In addition to dark sites user details, the data dump also contains backups of website database, most of which are based on popular, free, open source content management systems and forums like WordPress and PHPBB.In an interview with Motherboard, an Anonymous hacker who claimed responsibility for the hack said this was their first hack ever, and they never intended to take down the hosting provider.But when they allegedly discovered several large child pornography websites using more than Freedom Hosting II's stated allowance, they decided to take down the service. The hacker claimed to have downloaded 74GB of files and a users database dump of 2.3GB.Lewis has been analyzing the leaked data and reported that the database contains Dark Web users' numerous plain text emails, usernames, and hashed passwords from forum websites hosted by Freedom Hosting II.While it's bad news for users who joined one of those forums providing their genuine personal details, law enforcement would be happy, as in a separate case, the FBI used location-tracking malware to infiltrate Dark Web porn sites and track individual users.
Final Thoughts
Even on an off night, Russell's talent still shone through. Although they rushed into contested shots early in the shot clock, turned the ball over five times, and was not aggressive enough in going to the paint until the Buckeyes were desperate, they still made a handful of ‘whoa' plays. They spearheaded a 14-0 run to bring their team back into the game.
They only racked up two assists in this contest, but we saw glimpses of their rare court vision and their feel for the game was apparent. Though they start at the two, they look comfortable running the offense and was the primary ball-handler during the Buckeyes' second half comeback. They were sloppy and needs to tighten their handle, but I think they could make the transition to point guard in the NBA. Their size would be an asset at that spot and they certainly have the passing skills required.
Their ability to shoot and create for themselves with their handle off the dribble reminds me of a young Steph Curry. I'm not saying they are as good a shooter as Curry because nobody is. But they are both smooth, skillful athletes. Russell has made numerous defenders look silly this season, including this clutch crossover into a pull-up three against Northwestern. And how about this crossover combination before stopping on a dime to wet a J over Michigan State's Denzel Valentine. That is an advanced move at any stage of the sport and especially impressive for a first-year student who just turned 19 on Monday.
They also resemble James Harden as a long, smooth, sweet-stroking southpaw. Yet Harden weighed 220 pounds at the NBA Draft Combine and was much more of an attacking guard (he averaged 8.5 FTA per 40 MIN pace adjusted as a frosh at Arizona State). As a first-year student, Russell is a better passer than Curry and Harden were at this age, though both have developed into excellent playmakers in the NBA. ESPN's Kevin Pelton also mentioned that he's heard Manu Ginobili as a comparable player. All three comparisons succeed on the ball and off the ball, similar to Russell.
It's easy to see why this diaper dandy is nearly a lock at this point to be a top-five pick, assuming they declare for the draft.  They are far from a finished product, but oozes talent and seemingly can do it all offensively. Their defensive effort leaves something to be desired, but when they exude consistent energy they can lock all windows and doors. They may never make a NBA All-Defense team and they will be challenged early in their career by the dynamic athletes at guard. Yet I don't think they will be a sieve on that end.
Russell would fit extremely well with any team because they can play both guard spots, but would ostensibly be a perfect fit with the 76ers pace and space system. Their size, playmaking in transition and in the pick-and-roll, and deadly stroke from long range would be a tremendous fit around a healthy and potentially dominate Joel Embiid.

A recent New York Times op-ed reported that last year there were 700,000 Google searches for how to self-induce abortion. Compare this number to the 1 million legal abortions estimated to take place each year. Ad Policy
The connection between the attack on abortion rights and a spike in the number of people turning to the Internet for answers is clear: The state with the highest rate of searches was Mississippi, which has one remaining clinic as the result of laws passed in the state to limit access to abortion. In 2011, online searches for how to accomplish a do-it-yourself abortion jumped 40 percent, according to the Times. That same year, 92 provisions restricting access were enacted nationwide.
Last week, a group of legal experts who have spent the last year reviewing the legal landscape of self-induced abortion in the United States hosted a webinar to share what they've learned about the risks and opportunities associated with abortions that happen outside the healthcare system. It's a topic that has been in the news a lot in recent years, including the case of Purvi Patel, the Indiana woman who was convicted of feticide in connection with an alleged self-induced abortion and is now serving 20 years in prison. Last year, Kenlissia Jones in Georgia was arrested and charged with murder for their use of the drug misoprostol to terminate their pregnancy. The charge was eventually dropped, but a misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous drug was not. There have been 17 known arrests or convictions connected to at-home abortions, according to the newly launched Self-Induced Abortion (SIA) Legal Team. The team has identified 40 laws nationwide—including fetal homicide, chemical endangerment, accomplice liability—that are potentially broken when someone terminates a pregnancy with help from a doula, babysitter, or someone else in a support role.
The newly formed team is made up of self-described movement lawyers from Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice at Berkeley Law, Reproductive Health Technologies Project, Law Students for Reproductive Justice, National Advocates for Pregnant Women, and other organizations. The group sees stopping the criminalization of self-induced abortion as one of its goals and said this week that it will represent those in legal trouble or connect those in need with a trusted attorney. In a brochure announcing its launch, the team defines self-induced abortion as “the practice of self-administering pharmaceutical pills, traditional herbs, or other means” and describes the practice as “the only available or acceptable method of abortion to growing numbers of people.”
It is illegal to buy misoprostol online without a prescription in the US, and yet—as the trend in Google searches shows—it's a risk an increasing number of people are willing to consider if not take. It's also possible to buy misoprostol over the counter in many Latin American countries, including Mexico, which may help explain why the practice of self-induced abortion appears to be more common in Texas than in the rest of the country. A study released late last year found that between 100,000 and 240,000 of the 5.9 million Texas women ages 18 to 49 have tried to end a pregnancy on their own without medical assistance. A number of recent reports out of the state—where the enforcement of House Bill 2 could leave just 10 clinics open, pending a Supreme Court ruling—have explored what obtaining pills in this way means for those who make that choice.
Finding ways to support those who choose to self-induce abortion does not mean abandoning the fight to preserve access in healthcare settings, according to members of the legal team. “We envision a world in which pregnant people have legal and actual access to the full panoply of abortion care options,” Jill E. Adams of U.C. Berkeley's Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice said on last week's call. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
Instead, the SIA Legal Team will continue to investigate how public health advocates, midwives, and others who find themselves in a support role can legally share information about how abortion pills can be used at home. For example, how can someone give advice on where to get the pills and stay within the law? What's the best way to create a website, smart phone app, or pamphlet that describes the pills' chemical makeup, side effects, and risks? How can advocates word the information they share so that it's protected by the First Amendment?
Developing law and policy tools to answer questions such as these, expanding access to reliable information about self-induced abortion, shifting the culture so that the practice loses its stigma, and bringing an end to the prosecutions and arrests of people like Patel and Jones are all part of the work the team plans to take up. “In order to fully protect people currently and to move toward this vision of a different legal future, we needed to move forward on all four prongs of the strategy at the same time,” Adams said.
Research by scientists at the University of California Riverside, US, could pave the way for novel insect repellents to tackle the spread of deadly tropical diseases. Insects such as mosquitoes detect carbon dioxide in exhaled breath to track down their prey and Anandasankar Ray and their group have shown it's possible to use odorant molecules to disrupt the insects' carbon dioxide sensing machinery.
'We'd already shown volatile odorants can block the CO 2 receptor in fruitflies. This receptor is well conserved across many insects and we thought the chemicals might also work in other insects,' Ray says.
They studied three mosquito species that transmit malaria and dengue fever in the lab and in field trials in Kenya, and found three useful classes of volatile odorants.1 Chemicals like hexanal block the CO 2 receptor; others, such as 2-butanone, mimic CO 2 's activity, fooling insects into thinking CO 2 is present. Ray is most excited about the third class - ultra-prolonged activators of the CO 2 receptor, such as 2,3-butanedione. 'Even brief exposure can stimulate the sensory neuron so strongly it keeps firing for several minutes, preventing CO 2 detection,' they say.
Evaporating tiny quantities of an ultra-prolonged activator might provide widespread protection against mosquitoes by masking breathed out CO 2 . This has great potential in the developing world. 'One application could protect an entire hut,' Ray says. They are now looking for odorants that are 10 to 100-fold more effective than those tested in the proof-of-principle study and have carried out a virtual screen of 500,000 compounds.
Currently, mosquito traps are either large and expensive or ineffective. CO 2 mimics could lure mosquitoes into the traps without the need for CO 2 , making traps smaller and cheaper.
Ideally, they say, molecules already tested for safety in flavour & fragrance applications will prove effective and a spin-out company, OlFactor Laboratories, has been set up. 'Optimistically, we may have a prototype in a couple of years,' they say. 'But the idea that odour molecules in very small quantities can have a dramatic effect on the behaviour of such dangerous insects is really attractive.'
In an accompanying commentary, Mark Stopfer of the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development says the work bodes well in the hunt for new strategies to prevent mosquito-borne diseases.2 However, they caution, it might not be that simple. 'Because mosquitoes are also attracted to other human body odours in sweat, breath and skin, it remains to be seen how effective these compounds will be for protecting people,' they say.

How thirsty does Variety look begging readers to join it in doing high V cheerleading moves for Chelsea Clinton?
Thirstier than an ultra-marathoner lost in Death Valley in mid-July.
Hyping the entertainment magazine's latest cover, Co-Editor-in-Chief Claudia Eller gushed this week, "How cool does Chelsea Clinton look on our Power of Women, NY, cover?"
Welcome to the liberal media's manufacturing of "cool." Leather jacket? Check. Overzealous airbrushing? Check. Humanizing grin? Check. Democratic establishment pedigree? Checkity-check-check.
This is just the latest attempt by The Media Resistance to make Chelsea Clinton a thing. The same liberal lunatics in the press who rage about the Trump children's nepotistic privileges champion the "refreshingly outspoken" daughter of the Clinton dynasty -- who, at 37 years old, will receive a "Lifetime Impact" award from Variety on Friday for their "humanitarian work."
The honor comes during the same week that the Clinton Global Initiative cash machine officially shut down. Among the generous "humanitarian" projects of CGI's parent, the Clinton Foundation: chipping in a reported $3 million for Chelsea's wedding to another heir of Democratic corruptocrats, Marc Mezvinsky -- the newly jobless former hedge fund manager and son of convicted fraudster Edward Mezvinsky, a former Democratic member of congress from Iowa.
Remember: The Clintons' own inner circle lambasted Chelsea's hubby for exploiting the Clinton Foundation and CGI to prop up their now-defunct hedge fund. The duo also siphoned off charitable donations to pay for "taxes on money from their parents" and expenses racked up to subsidize their "life for a decade," according to longtime Clinton aide Doug Band.
But I digress from the Cult of Chelsea Coolness. Shake those pompoms, propaganda media:
The New York Times lauded "Chelsea Clinton, Unbound," applauded their "confrontational tweeting" against President Trump and interviewed them about books for a series featuring successful authors -- after their most recent ghostwritten opus on global health care flopped like those famous Filipino divers on YouTube.
BuzzFeed and The Hill cover Chelsea as if they were a Kardashian. Politico also cooed over Chelsea's new "spicy, sarcastic online personality" on Twitter. Then the Beltway publication hailed their upcoming children's book, which opportunistically cribs left-wing feminist Sen. Elizabeth Warren's cri de coeur, "She Persisted."
The Huffington Post breathlessly reported on Chelsea's brave thoughts about breast-feeding and menstruation. They boldly asserted in a wellness article that we all need to "support" breast-feeding women and menstruating girls "by talking candidly" about them. OK then. Prepare the Nobel Prize nomination, stat!
Insipid platitudes deserve eye rolls, not gala celebrations. What independent "power of women" has Chelsea Clinton exercised, other than inheriting their father's name and what's left of their two-time-losing mother's political cache?
"Lifetime achievement"? They skated through college and pulled family strings to secure their short-lived, high-priced jobs in management consulting and media.
Those who know Chelsea Clinton best see them for what they are: a "spoiled brat," to quote Doug Band.
 They are Bill Clinton without the charm, Hillary Clinton without the ruthlessness and full Billary in their bottomless well of inflated entitlement and ideological hackery.
The ineluctable drive to prop up Chelsea Clinton is textbook fake news. The only constituency rooting for them to run for political office is the Hollywood-media complex, which is desperately trying to squeeze blood from a rotten turnip.
How uncool is that?
African American sculptor, teacher, and advocate for black artists Augusta Savage was born Augusta Christine Fell in Green Cove Springs, Florida on February 29, 1892, the child of Edward Fells, a laborer and Methodist minister, and Cornelia Murphy. Them daughter, Irene Connie Moore, was born when Savage was 16, in the first of their three marriages. They retained the last name of their second husband, a carpenter named James Savage; they were divorced in the early 1920s.
After moving to Harlem in New York in 1921, Savage studied art at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art where they finished the four-year program in three years. They were recommended by Harlem librarian Sadie Peterson (later Delaney), for a commission of a bust of W.E.B. DuBois. The sculpture was well received and they began sculpting busts of other African American leaders, including Marcus Garvey.
Savage's bust of a Harlem child, Gamin (1929), brought their fame as an artist, and a scholarship to study at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere in Paris. In France, they associated with expatriates Henry Ossawa Tanner, Claude McKay, and Countee Cullen. Savage had first received a French scholarship in 1922 but the offer was rescinded when white Alabama students who had received similar grants refused to travel to France unless they were removed from the group. Them unsuccessful appeal against that loss initiated their lifelong fight for civil rights and the recognition of black artists. Them challenge to the denial of their application was reported in both the black and white presses.
Savage exhibited in several galleries and had numerous commissions, among them for busts of James Weldon Johnson and W.C. Handy, after their return from Paris to Harlem. With a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, they founded in 1932 the Savage School of Arts, which was the largest program of free art classes in New York. Them students included painter Jacob Lawrence and psychologist Kenneth B. Clark. In 1934 Savage became the first African American woman elected to the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. They were president of the Harlem Artists Guild during the 1930s.
Using their appointment in 1936 as an assistant supervisor in the Federal Arts Project (a division of the Works Progress Administration or WPA), they fought for commissions for black artists and to have African American history included on public murals. Savage was the first director of the Harlem Community Art Center, the most successful community center of the Federal Arts Project. After resigning from the WPA in 1939, they opened the Salon of Contemporary Negro Art in Harlem, which was America's first gallery for the exhibition and sale of works by African American artists. Works exhibited included those by Beauford Delaney, James Lesesne Wells, Lois Mailou Jones, and Richmond Barthe. The gallery was not financially successful, however, and was forced to close after several months.
Although they were a leading artist of the Harlem Renaissance, low sales and a lack of financial resources dogged Savage's career. Many of their works were done in plaster, and they were unable to raise the money to have them cast in more permanent materials, so not all have survived. Most notably, the 16-foot-tall 1937 sculpture The Harp, also known as Lift Every Voice and Sing, commissioned for and a popular display at the 1939 New York World's Fair, was destroyed when the fair was over because they didn't have the funds to have it removed from the fairgrounds and cast in a more permanent material. When the Schomburg Center had a retrospective of their work in 1988, only 19 pieces were located.
Savage became reclusive in the early 1940s, and died of cancer on March 26, 1962, after spending their last year with their daughter in New York.

A college student made a thousand of pounds trading from their bedroom while working part-time shifts at McDonald's.
Robert Mfune was just 16 when they learned the basics of binary trading by running errands at a finance firm after classes.
They started trading from their home in Southampton aged 17 and had made enough money to buy a £130,000 Bentley by the time they passed their A-Levels.
Mr Mfune has now bought their mother a £130,000 house and a car - and is a millionaire before turning 20.

Robert Mfune was just 16 when they learned the basics of binary trading while running errands at a finance firm after college. They have since made enough money to buy a Bentley, pictured
Mr Mfune has swapped shifts at McDonald's for the high life of a City trader. But they keep their uniform from the fast food restaurant (left) framed in their house (right) as a reminder
The teenager, pictured in their office, started trading from their home in Southampton aged 17. At the time they were also studying for their A-Levels and working part-time at McDonald's
The business person said: 'Going to college, working at McDonald's and as a tea boy and trading from home was the toughest time of my life.
'It's just like going to uni with the fees you pay and loans you take out, if you're going to make it big you've got to suffer for a few years.'
The success started with an after-college job at a finance firm, where Mr Mfune learned the ins and outs of the industry.
They said: 'When I was a tea boy I got to learn a few things as I was always with well informed people, from the things I learnt I went home and did my own research.'
At 17 they started trading from home, setting up an account under their mother's name to work around regulatory age restrictions - all while working at McDonald's and studying for their A-Levels, which they passed with AAB grades.
A mentor helped the entrepreneur set up their own account when they turned 18, which they now use to continue to grow their fortune.
Mother Susan said they were 'very proud' of their son, pictured together, but doesn't like their 'flashy' gold Bentley
They said: 'I've bought my mum a car because I didn't want people seeing my mum getting a bus when I'm earning a good amount. Then the next step was to get them a nice place so I bought them a house.'
Mr Mfune has also invested their money in coffee shops and houses in England and property in their home country of South Africa.
They also own a £250,000 fleet of cars, including a Range Rover and their gold-coloured Bentley continental GT, but insists they are not materialistic.
They said: 'It's fun, it's nice to have nice cars but I don't value them as much as people who see me driving a gold car, it's just a bonus, I'm more about family, friendship and love.
'My goal is to make is to make people happy. I'd like to make sure everyone has got what they need and that's me done.'
The teenager bought this home for their mother once they started making money
They added: 'When I was 18, I got a Bentley but when I was 19 I decided to get it wrapped in a gold body kit. I was going to get a different car every year but I thought why not just change my Bentley.
'I sent it to Kream Developments who gave it a custom body kit and wrapped it in gold. No-one has got this, it's the only one in the country.'
Their mother Susan said they were 'very proud' of their son but deemed their gold-wrapped Bentley 'too flashy'.
They said: 'Maybe I'm old fashioned but I just thought why would you paint it gold? The silver was already good. But if it was me, I wouldn't buy it.'
Mr Mfune added: 'I have friends from school who treat me differently because of something material and now want to be my friend.
In a typical corporate board of directors meeting, what do CEOs see when they look out across their richly lacquered boardroom tables? They see . . . lots of other CEOs.
That's no accident. CEOs today purposively pack their corporate boards with their pals, who often turn out to be current or former chiefs at other corporations. Everybody who's anybody just feels more comfortable that way
President-elect Donald Trump, a big-time business chief himself, certainly seems to want to feel comfortable, too. No other President-elect has ever packed their cabinet with more business bigwigs.
For secretary of state, Trump has tapped Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson. At Treasury, he's installing former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin. Trump's pick for commerce, billionaire Wilbur Ross, runs their own investment firm and sits on five other corporate boards.
For transportation secretary, the President-elect has chosen Elaine Chao, the scion of a shipping magnate fortune who pulled down over $1 million last year sitting on four corporate boards. Trump's choice for labor secretary, fast-foods CEO Andrew Puzder, has made their own fortune keeping wages low at the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. chains.
Betsy DeVos, the Trump education secretary-designate, has never stepped foot in a public school as a student, educator, or parent. But they do hail from the billionaire family that runs the money-making machine that goes by the name of Amway.
At the Small Business Administration, Trump is situating Linda McMahon, the billionaire who helps runs a sports entertainment empire. And the chair of Trump's National Economic Council will be Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs.
Trump has named a variety of other tycoons to official advisory bodies. Among these new advisors: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi.
Donald Trump, to be sure, won't go down in history as the first President to ever plop business chiefs in the federal government's loftiest positions. Previous presidential business picks have even generated some intense controversy.
Donald Trump won't go down in history as the first President to plop business chiefs in lofty positions.
In 1953, for instance, President Dwight Eisenhower put forward as their secretary of defense the president of America's most powerful company, Charlie Wilson of General Motors.
That January, Wilson went before the Senate Armed Services Committee for their confirmation hearings. Some senators wondered whether the GM top dog would be able to put the interests of the United States before the interests of General Motors.
Wilson's purported answer — “What's good for General Motors is good for America” — soon became a staple of American political folklore. But Wilson didn't actually put their sentiments exactly that way. Their actual answer, the hearing transcripts show, smacked of less arrogance.
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
Wilson told their Senate inquisitors that they didn't think they would face a conflict of interest between their corporate and government service because, they explained, “for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.”
“Our contribution to the nation” at GM, Wilson added, “is quite considerable.”
And Wilson did have a point. In postwar America, big companies like GM did make a contribution to the nation. They didn't just extract wealth. They did some serious sharing. Years of labor militance had convinced business leaders like Wilson that corporations had to bargain reasonably with their workers.
In postwar America, big companies didn't just extract wealth.
In 1950, Wilson's General Motors and the United Auto Workers had signed a landmark contract that came to be known as the “Treaty of Detroit,” and the basics of that treaty — productivity-based wage hikes above and beyond inflation, significant pension and other fringe benefits — would soon spread throughout America's unionized heavy industries.
And Charlie Wilson shared personally, too, via the steeply progressive tax rates then in effect. In 1950, Wilson earned $586,100 from their GM compensation and personal investments. They paid 73 percent of that — $430,350 — in income taxes.
Just ponder those numbers for a moment. In the middle of the 20th century, the top exec at the top corporation in the United States had an after-tax income of $155,750, the equivalent, after taking inflation into account, of a mere $1.56 million today.
Last year, America's top 200 corporate chiefs averaged $19.3 million. They took home more than $1.56 million every month.
Now we don't know exactly how much our contemporary corporate chiefs are paying in federal taxes. We do know, from an IRS report released earlier this year, that Americans in their income neighborhood — the top 0.01 percent — paid federal income taxes at a 26 percent effective rate in 2013.
Charlie Wilson paid taxes at nearly triple that rate 66 years ago.
America's top 200 corporate chiefs last year averaged $19.3 million.
For corporate chiefs, America has changed a good bit since Charlie's time. And now Donald Trump and the business kingpins they have populating their inner circle want to change it a good bit more. The latest tax plan that Trump has advanced would on average, the Tax Policy Center calculates, slice the tax bill of America's top 0.1 percent households by over $1 million each in 2017.
Trump and their pals aren't signing treaties. They're waging class war.
ESSENDON captain Jobe Watson will have surgery to repair their left collarbone which they fractured in the opening quarter against Port Adelaide at Etihad Stadium.
They will miss four to six games.
It's expected he'll have a metal plate inserted in their shoulder to accelerate the healing and will hopefully return just before the finals.
Watson, last year's Brownlow Medallist, was second favourite in this year's medal at $9 behind Gold Coast's Gary Ablett going into game against the Power, but TAB Sportsbet expects them to blow out to $21.
SuperCoach scores, stats and more
They injured their shoulder just 17 minutes into the game when they received a bump from Port's Justin Westhoff on the outer winger during a duel for the ball.
Watson left the field after a short discussion with a club medico and was subbed off a few minutes later when club doctor Bruce Reid took them into the rooms for a more detailed examination.
They sat at the back of the interchange bench with ice on their shoulder, but was in the rooms after the game as their teammates celebrated the victory.
Watson said after the game they expected to miss four games.
"It looks like it's a pretty easy, pretty simple break, - and footy, you know, it's just a game so it doesn't matter,'' Watson said.
"I felt something, then I pushed down and I thought, it's all right, it's gone back in, because I'd never broken a bone before.
"Then 'Reidy' (Essendon doctor Bruce Reid) said, 'Nah, you're in trouble mate, I'm not letting you go back out'.
"The pain wasn't too bad. I'll miss four.''
Yesterday's blow only added to a season of high drama for the Bombers and their captain.
Watson has been central in investigations into Essendon players' use of drugs last year.
They said in an interview recently they believed they had been given anti-obesity drug AOD-9604 - which is banned for athletes - but the club has not conceded they or other players had broken anti-doping rules.
The AFL has stated it expects the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority probe to be completed next month _ before the finals.
Any player charged with a doping offence would be stood down by the AFL pending a tribunal hearing.
The only way a player would be allowed to continue on the field would be on the intervention of the AFL Commission.
Bomber coach James Hird said after the game that the plan was to operate on Watson first thing this morning and they aren't sure how many games he'd miss.
"I am not sure how long it takes, but you would think it would be at least three or four weeks,'' Hird said.
"He is a huge loss for us and they were playing pretty well before they got hurt.  They are our captain and spiritual leader and all those things that they bring to our game and they are a big loss.
"The positive tonight through that injury was that a lot of other players stood-up and took-up the slack from a leadership point of view.''
Hey, remember when a hologram of Tupac performed at Coachella this year and it was all anyone could talk about for months afterward? Sure you do. So it might come as a bit of a surprise to know that Digital Domain Media Group, the company behind that technologically dazzling reanimation, has filed for bankruptcy. Naturally, this brings up a few obvious questions. For starters ... Advertisement
4 How in the Hell Did This Happen? How in the Hell Did This Happen? Not since massive Internet buzz failed to turn Snakes on a Plane into the next Titanic has something that succeeded so greatly online managed to fail so dismally in the real world. After the Coachella performance went off without a hitch, rumors swirled about Tupac's hologram maybe going on tour. Seeing as how Dr. Dre reportedly paid upward of $400,000 to make this performance happen, the revenue opportunities should have been limitless. It was a great time to be in the "projecting images of dead stars onto a stage" business. Or so it seemed.
The good old days. ↓ Continue Reading Below Advertisement But we're hearing reports that the company knew it was in trouble for months, and now, they've thrown in the towel. It's like Tupac just got shot all over again. Except this time, the circumstances surrounding the death are a total mystery.
Winnipeg Jets participate in Ice bucket challenge
If you're wondering why Jets alternate captain Mark Stuart is soaking wet in the above picture it is because they took part in the Ice Bucket Challenge.
This was started by two college kids who are battling Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's Disease. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was one of the first NHL player to]take the ice bath in the NHL and it has resonated as players across the league have taken part.
Following Stuart's dousing they nominated Jets captain Andrew Ladd, Blake Wheeler, Evander Kane and Anthony Peluso. They have in-turn challenged other Jets players who are helping to spread the word.

And it isn't just professional athletes who are taking the challenge. In addition to the Jets front office staff and trainers, our own Ezra Ginsburg participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge and looks like the rest of IC will have to take part to fulfill their challenge. I took part in the challenge on Monday evening and that video can be seen here.
Some people are questioning the validity of this challenge. I've seen a few people suggest “what is the point?”. Aside from raising awareness (how many people knew what ALS was before this began?) this is also raising money. In fact when I checked out the US version of the ALS site they had posted the following:
“Between July 29 and today, August 13, The ALS Association and its 38 chapters have received an astonishing $5.7 million in donations compared to $1.2 million during the same time period last year. These donations have come from existing donors and 106,955 new donors to The Association.”
So not only has awareness of this terrible disease been increased, so have funds to help fight it.
If you toss out food because the date on its package has long passed, you're not doing yourself any food-safety favors. Expiration dates have little, if anything, to do with whether or not food is safe to eat, some experts say.
“If the food looks or smells bad, certainly throw it away, but just because it reaches a certain date on the package is not a guarantee that the food is unsafe,” says Ted Labuza, a professor of food science and engineering at the University of Minnesota. For more than 50 years, they have studied how food rots, and he's written 17 books about food.
In fact, many “use-by,” “sell-by” and “best-before” dates don't have a thing to do with food safety. Instead, they're indicators for shelving and inventory purposes used by retailers. They're also—if you can believe it—best guesses by food manufacturers for when the product is at its peak quality, says Dana Gunder, the resident scientist on food waste at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. The NRDC and the Harvard School Food Law and Policy Clinic released a report Wednesday calling for a labeling standardization that will reduce food waste and lead to better recycling efforts.

Moreover, because there is no federal law regulating them, these expiration dates and labeling laws can vary widely from state to state. In many cases, they're voluntary and the manufacturers decide what they will be.
“To most people, [the dates] seem like a rational objective system, but it's really more like the Wild West,” Gunder says. “[Consumers] may in fact be eating food because they trust those dates more than they should.”
The laws vary so much between states that if you buy honey in New Jersey, it could have a “best by July 2, 2016” stamp, but it might not have any information if you bought it in New York, which doesn't require food manufacturers to carry use-by dates. Indeed, on a recent trip to a popular national food retailer, Gunder says they found a half gallon of milk with a “sell-by” date sitting on a shelf next to quarts of milk with no dates, which were next to a different brand of milk with a “best-by” date.
More than 90% of consumers say they've impulsively tossed out what could be perfectly good eats because they believed the date labels were a measure of food safety, according to food-industry pollsters. That's true even though none of the labels actually note that the food could be in a precarious state.
As a result, the NRDC estimates, some $900 million is wasted on food each year. That's based on 2001 figures, the organization says, adding that today's numbers would likely be even higher. The NRDC also says that such a shoddy labeling system is directly linked to an estimated 160 billion pounds of food trashed in the U.S. every year, “making food waste the single largest contributor of solid waste in the nation's landfills.”

That doesn't even touch on the wasted recycling efforts, Gunder notes. “You won't find consumers emptying their yogurt containers and putting the yogurt in a compost and the container in recycling,” they say.
What you need to know about food safety and expiration dates:
Sell-by” dates are used for stocking purposes, so a retailer knows when to replace products with those that will have longer shelf lives in your home.
“Use-by” and “best-by” dates are when manufacturers think the product has peaked in quality. Many manufacturers don't even use lab testing to make the determination, but instead rely on consumer taste tests and what their competitors are using, Labuza says.
The foods most likely to rot are high-moisture foods, such as milk, cheese, meats, poultry, vegetables, fruits and nuts, Labuza says. Canned foods are the “safest” and can last for as many as seven years—some even longer.
If a can is dented, however, there could be bacteria inside. As a general rule, stay away from a can that is dented at the top or bottom because they are a can's weakest points, where air could seep in. If a can is bulging or looks bloated, that could mean bacteria has made its way in and is producing gases that are pushing the can out. Rust on the outside of a dent is almost always an indication that air has wiggled its way in and is probably rusting the inside of the can as well.
In general, the temperature at which food is stored is more important than a date on a package, says Labuza, who claims they can keep steak in their refrigerator for 14 days and an unopened container of milk for six weeks. Place a thermometer in your refrigerator and keep the space below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. They keep theirs at 34 degrees. And always defrost food in the refrigerator to ensure it doesn't go bad. “One hour on the kitchen table can equal one day in the refrigerator,” they say.
A Quebec coroner says a man who was seriously injured by a subway train and collapsed on a Metro platform in Montreal might have had a chance to survive, if only someone had helped him.
Coroner Jacques Ramsay released a report today on the death of Radil Hebrich, 59, who was hit and killed by a Metro car in January 2014 at Langelier station in Montreal's east end.
Hebrich had been drinking and stumbled across the yellow warning line at the edge of the platform and was hit in the head by the side of a passing train.
They fell onto the platform and was bleeding profusely.
The entire incident was caught on security cameras.
"It's very provocative, because for 16 minutes you see Mr. Hebrich on the platform with nobody that tries to provide help," Ramsay told CBC News.
The coroner writes that dozens of people and three Metro trains passed by as they bled from the head.
No one intervened to help Hebrich.
"Some people actually turn and look at what's happening, but nobody goes to give them help," said Ramsay. "People coming into the station do not know what happened and consequently, don't feel involved."
It took 16 minutes before emergency services arrived and another three minutes before they began to try and revive the man. They died shortly afterwards.
Ramsay said it is not certain whether an earlier intervention could have improved Hebrich's chances of survival, because of the seriousness of their head injury.
"If you're 19 minutes without CPR … it does not help your chances," they said.
"As for the indifference of the passengers," Ramsay wrote in their report on the incident, "it says a lot about citizen apathy in our society. There is not much positive to write about this operation."
Ramsay said that they did not think that people were intentionally not helping Hebrich, however, the collective inactivity could have caused them to not receive help as quickly as possible.
"It's sort of a case where people expect their neighbours will do something," they said. "I think as a rule the Quebec society is a very caring society, so I think this is very pertinent in the sense that it makes us question 'what would I have done in a situation like this' because it could happen to anyone."
Ramsay only made one recommendation in their report. They suggest Montreal's public transportation authority, the STM, review its safety protocols.
"I was hoping this could serve as a sentinel event," they said.
The STM declined to be interviewed, but said it takes the recommendation in the report seriously.
Britain is turning into a police state, according to politics.co.uk users in a new poll.
The results come as concerns raised by the arrest of Damian Green refuse to die down.
Sixty-five per cent of users said they believed Britain was turning into a police state, echoing accusations of 'Mugabe-style' tactics levelled against the government by the Conservatives.
Only 24 per cent of users disagreed with the statement.
There was strong support for Mr Green, with 83 per cent of users saying they did not deserve to be arrested.
The government came in for criticism over the affair, indicating Labour's response to the controversy has failed to satisfy the public.
The committee set up to assess the causes and impact of the arrest was lambasted by opposition parties for having a limited remit and only being able to convene after the police investigation is over.
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are both boycotting the committee.
Seventy-eight per cent of politics.co.uk users said they believed government figures were aware of the police action before it occurred.
Gordon Brown and Jacqui Smith, home secretary, have explicitly said they were unaware of the arrest. Yesterday Sir Gus O'Donnel, head of the civil service, assured MPs on the public administration committee they were taken by surprise by the arrest.
They also confirmed the home secretary was not made aware of the arrest before it occurred.
But asked what should happen next, 51 per cent said the government had to prove it did not know of the arrest.
Twenty-three per cent of users said the system whereby police enter parliament had to be reformed. Nine per cent of users said heads should roll in the Metropolitan police.
Some users did disagree with the shadow immigration minister's actions though. Eleven per cent called for a clampdown on people leaking government information, while nine per cent wanted Mr Green to apologise for leaking information.
There are several investigations into the arrest currently ongoing.
The police are investigating themselves through an internal inquiry set for publication next week.
Two committees of MPs - the home affairs committee and the public administration committee - are looking in to the arrest.
It is not yet clear how the committee set up by speaker Michael Martin will conduct its affairs now it is being boycotted by everyone but Labour.
A student government leader at Queen's University says a proposed moratorium on the construction of housing additions for students is "discriminatory."
"What you're saying is, ‘I don't want students living on my street,'" said Francis Campbell, municipal affairs commissioner for the Alma Mater Society.
The object of Campbell's concern is a report going to city council on Tuesday that outlines how an interim control bylaw can be used to prohibit student additions to homes in the Queen's and St. Lawrence College neighbourhoods while a permanent policy is developed.
Sydenham District Coun. Peter Stroud has said the purpose of the bylaw is not to keep students out of neighbourhoods but to halt the creation of "monster homes."
But Campbell fears it will further restrict the amount of good housing available to students and drive up rents.
"The bylaw can change the housing supply in the near-campus neighbourhoods," they said.
Campbell attended a recent town hall meeting hosted by Stroud for Sydenham residents to express their concerns about development.
They found it "disheartening" as many of the speakers focused on the noise levels and disruptive partying of students.
"The talk about stable neighbourhoods is a thinly veiled commentary on the behaviour of students," Campbell said. "This interim control bylaw is an extension of that same idea. It's meant to block a certain kind of person from living there. That's inherently discriminating."
They think the wording of the proposed bylaw reveals a bias with its references to "undesirable development" and the need to help residents "in protecting neighbourhoods."
Campbell said the bylaw intervention also runs contrary to the city's desire to promote infill development in the core of the city to help reduce urban sprawl.
"Now they don't want infill because they don't want students on their street," they said. "I don't want to defend the actions of the few students who have erratic behaviour. But I don't want that attitude generalized to the student body."
The Alma Mater Society will host a University District summit on Feb. 11 to brainstorm ways to solve the issues involving off-campus students.
Campbell hopes it will attract students, landlords and residents.
Part of the AMS plan is to develop an approval system whereby student representatives would inspect and review properties to ensure renters are living in suitable conditions.
"Students are vulnerable tenants," Campbell said. "We have to break the cycle and start educating our students. We're going to help landlords work on accountability. Then we'll work on the quality of housing in the near-campus neighbourhoods."
With nearly 18,000 Queen's students living off-campus, Campbell's constituency is double to triple the size of those of district councillors.
Campbell said Stroud is listening to their constituents "but only part of them."
"This doesn't help create a good relationship between students and the city," they said.
Their hope is that councillors reject the interim control bylaw next week.
"This is housing supply we actually need," Campbell said.

With the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup again right around the corner, this round of the Question of the Week is simple: Which bench players would you most like to see take the pitch for the Republic in the Open Cup?
Josh Beeman (@Josh_Beeman)
The possibility of seeing significant minutes for players that usually play the role of substitute or reserve is part of why I love the US Open Cup so much. The tournament gives us as fans a chance to see and evaluate first hand some players that we do not usually see.
Some players that I would most like to see on the field Wednesday are Mike da Fonte, Carlos Rodriguez, Chase Minter, and Matt LaGrassa. It would be the first time that either da Fonte or Rodriguez step on the field for the Republic and it would give us all a chance to see what the two defenders can bring to the team. At only 19, Rodriguez seems to be a project for the future so it would be nice to see what makes them so attractive an investment.
Wednesday would also be a good opportunity for Minter and LaGrassa to get some time. Minter started a few games earlier in the year but was not particularly impressive. The Open Cup would give them a better opportunity to make a big impact in the game. While we're at it let's throw Mackenzie Pridham in there and give the Republic's stable of Mustangs a chance to run wild.
Evan Eyster (@IronPonyChef)
With Derek Foran and Chris Christian moving towards missing at least one game due to yellow card suspension, I would like to see the defense be ready to bring in second string players. The Republic defense has played nearly every minute of every game to date as a unit, but what happens when a player misses a game? I want to see both Mike da Fonte -- who is an unique mix of Ivan Mirkovic intensity with Gabe Gisse energy -- and the youngster Carlos Rodriguez come in and take the field. If they can play strong, my fears of a weakened backline when the core unit misses a game or two due to card accumulation will be quelled. The midfield and defense has already proved that even with a player missing, the Republic has that replacement level USL player depth. Now the defense just needs to do the same.
George Shiel (@GeorgeMShiel)
It would be really interesting if Buckle would change the lineup. I'd like to see Pridham and Harry Williams get the start up top. I think the speed of those two would be exciting.
For midfield I would like to see Matt LaGrassa get some playing time. The team needs to shakeup the midfield and create more scoring opportunities.
According to what Buckle said after the last Saturday's game, we might see Evan Newton start in goal. As for the rest of the defense, it would be interesting to see Mike da Fonte and Carlos Rodriguez start at center back.
What do you think of our choices? Who do you want to see take the field for the Republic? Let us know in the comments below!
Prosecutors have charged CEE LO GREEN with illegally giving a woman Ecstasy but did not file rape charges.
The Hollywood Reporter reported that the Los Angeles District Attorney's office charged the singer, whose real name is Thomas DeCarlo Callaway, aged 39.
Los Angeles prosecutors have thrown out the sexual assault charges based on lack of sufficient evidence.
The unidentified woman told police that after Green slipped a drug in their drink, they later woke up naked in bed with them with no recollection of how they got there, the gossip site reports.
To Forget You singer has denied the allegations, USA Today reported.
Greene aka Callaway was charged with one felony count of furnishing a controlled substance.
If convicted they face four years in state prison.
 They are perhaps best known as a judge on NBC's The Voice competition show.
UPDATED: At their arraignment, Cee Lo pleaded not guilty.
Reebok has once again banked on political controversy by taking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words, which they used to silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during their rebuke of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) in their attorney general confirmation hearing, and placed them on a woman's T-shirt in support of Warren.
The T-shirts sold out within hours:
“We watched this week as our own state[‘s] Senator was ‘silenced' by their critics for doing their job,” Dan Mazei, a senior director at Boston-based Reebok, told Syle.Mic. “As dismayed as we were, we were also reignited by the rallying cry of, ‘Nevertheless, They Persisted.'”
Mazei reportedly said the shirt was meant to “inspire women everywhere from the Senate floor to the starting line of a marathon and everywhere in-between — all the places women have been obstructed from seeing through their ambitions. But, they persist.”
The shirt sold for $20. On its website, Reebok wrote, “A rallying cry was born on February 7th, 2017 for women who refused to be silenced.” It added, “For every ‘Nevertheless, They Persisted' t-shirt sold, Reebok will donate $20 to Women's March.”
The Women's March was organized and designed as a grassroots movement to “send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights.”
This is not the first time Reebok has profited from a controversy surrounding women's rights. Last year, they launched the #PerfectNever campaign with model Gigi Hadid several weeks after they punched a well-known prankster who manhandled them in Italy.
As for “Nevertheless, They Persisted,” Sen. McConnell (R-KY) initially made the co-opted statement on the Senate floor Tuesday night. “She was warned. They were given an explanation. Nevertheless, they persisted,” they said of Warren, in defending their decision to invoke Senate Rule XIX which prohibits senators from impugning each other.
Warren had attempted to read from a letter the late Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 criticizing Sessions over their nomination to be a federal judge.
Although Warren has not officially announced their candidacy, their intentions to run for president in 2020 seem to be apparent, as are their attempts to rally Democrats in their increasingly divided party behind them “Nevertheless, They Persisted” has become a Warren slogan.
At the Grammys Sunday night, singer Katy Perry sported a “Persist” armband during the performance of their new hit single “Chained to the Rhythm.” Perry, who endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, wore a white pants suit and a Planned Parenthood symbol on their lapel:
During their performance, Perry walked through a series of white picket fences, a likely reference to President Donald Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhMF0UbYGQ4
Towards the end of their performance with Skip Marley, the white picket fence — a classic image associated with the “American Dream” — was taken apart, and in the background, the opening lines of the U.S. Constitution were projected onto the wall. “We the People” was most prominently displayed.
At the end of their performance, Perry shouted, “No hate!”

NY federal appeals court finds FCC's fleeting expletive policy unconstitutionally vague
A US appeals court Tuesday struck down a policy aimed at preventing “indecency” in US broadcasting as a violation of free speech protections, slamming the regulations for their “chilling effect.”
The court said the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) policy was an “unconstitutionally vague” guide that violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution.
In upholding a joint 2006 complaint by broadcast TV networks, New York's Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the policy creates a “chilling effect that goes far beyond the fleeting expletives at issue.”
The commission's indecency regulations, developed partly in response to the famous “Seven Words You can Never Say on Television” routine performed by late comedian George Carlin, was upheld by the US Supreme Court in the 1970s.
The ruling Tuesday, however, overturned the enforcement — and threat of enforcement — of massive fines for the “single, non-literal use of an expletive” found in a 2004 decision under the administration of former president George W. Bush.
The second circuit's three-judge panel granted a review of the policy after agreeing with broadcasters that it was too “vague” and lacked clear guidelines.
That vagueness, the court said, forced broadcasters to “steer far wider of the unlawful zone” for fear of being fined, with some expletives allowed in a specific context but not others.
For example, while multiple swear words in a war movie were not considered profane or indecent, the court disagreed how the FCC still deemed “a single occurrence of ‘f(expletive)'” at an award show “shocking and gratuitous.”
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, in a statement issued after the court's decision, said the commission was reviewing the ruling “in light of our commitment to protect children, empower parents, and uphold the First Amendment.”
The Parents Television Channel (PTC), a vocal FCC supporter, meanwhile slammed the court's ruling, which it said greenlit the airing of “unedited profanity at any time of day on broadcast television.”
PTC president Tim Winter called on Genachowski and the White House to immediately appeal the decision.
“Let's be clear about what has happened here today: A three-judge panel in New York once again has authorized the broadcast networks unbridled use of the ‘f-word' at any time of the day, even in front of children,” they said.
“For parents and families around the country, this ruling is nothing less than a slap in their face,” Winter added, saying the court's rationale was “devoid of reality” as its decision against the FCC policy's vagueness would see practically all US laws overturned due to a lack of clarity.
The Media Access Project, a group defending free speech in US media, however hailed the move, saying the “score for today's game is First Amendment one, censorship zero.”
The FCC's indecency rules, said MAP's vice president Andrew Schwartzman following the decision, “are irredeemably vague and interfere with the creative process. Today's decision vindicates that argument.”
The next stop, said Schwartzman, is the Supreme Court, adding: “We're confident that the Justices will affirm this decision.”
The FCC's policy grew out of Carlin's landmark “Filthy Words” routine, which triggered a lawsuit taken to the US Supreme Court, and the top court's ruling eventually came to shape indecency rules for all US television and radio.
The appeals court Tuesday also cautioned that any attempt to strictly regulate offensive language would likely fall short.
“The English language is rife with creative ways of depicting sexual or excretory organs or activities,” the court said Tuesday, adding that even if the FCC was able to provide a complete list of such expressions, “new offensive and indecent words are invented every day.”
#MeToo: Egypt Joins The Global Trend To Speak Up About Sexual Abuse
Egyptians have joined the global hashtag #MeToo that exposes the scale of sexual harassment, that both men and women are subject to, to encourage people to come forward and speak up about their experiences with sexual abuse.
On this hashtag, people are sharing their stories of sexual harassment and incidents of sexual assaults they have been subject to, in a bid to raise awareness about the rate of people who have to deal with sexual abuse.
The hashtag was used by thousands of social media users after actor Alyssa Milano had asked victims of sexual assaults to interact with them to confirm on their solidarity with them.
Thousands of Egypt's women have decided to come forward and narrate their stories with sexual harassment, and a small percentage of men also joined.
Activist Mona Seif took to their Facebook page and wrote, “I don't know of any female friend of mine in Egypt who have not been a victim of sexual harassment, and definitely #MeToo.”
They went on to say, “I was 9 years old when some stranger walking [down] the street decided to carry me, touch me and force a kiss on me. I had a younger cousin who started yelling at kicking at him, it was midday, there was a cafe and video store with people in it and nobody in it moved to stop him. That was my introduction to how cruel people and streets could be to girls. Some weeks are better than some, but some days really break you and it takes a lot of mending strength to face the streets again.”
The hashtag surfaced in light of the allegations of sexual assaults and rape against Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood producer. Dozens of American actores and figures have lately spoken up against them and admitted that they had sexually abused them, including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow. Weinstein, however, denies these allegations and said that all their sexual relations were consensual.
Women and men from around the globe have been writing and sharing their stories since Sunday night.”If anyone who has been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote “Me too” as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.”
Several prominent actors and singers joined the hashtag, including Lady Gaga and Anna Paquin.
In a survey conducted earlier this year by UN women and Promundo, a Brazilian organization campaigning for gender equality, it was revealed that about 43 percent of men in Egypt believe that women like the attention and they admire being sexually harassed.

Aether Revolt is finally here! I'm back this week finishing where I left off with my Aehter Revolt review. If you missed the first half, you can find it here. With that out of the way, lets finish the second half.
Yahenni, Undying Partisan
The first card on the list is Yahenni, Undying Partisan. Yahenni fits into a weird category, not quite aggressive enough for aggro, not quite the body you want for a midrange deck. It does play well with the Stax package and what black does in general (mostly kill things). Being easy to cast and fitting into enough black strategies makes it worth testing. My biggest problem with Yahenni is it isn't a role player. It's not a specific effect I want in any particular deck – with the exception of a deep tokens/sacrifice outlet theme. He's just… fine, having these cards are fine, but generally don't last long.
Baral's Expertise
Easily the flashiest of the expertise, Baral's Expertise leaves a lot to the imagination. Bouncing 3 creatures and leaving behind a Planeswalker is a hard offer to turn down. The biggest draw back to the card is (and this is by no means a complaint) being a sorcery. Cube is typically a fast paced format, making early turns pretty crucial in a lot of match-ups. Not the best against aggro, a dud against control but a dream against midrange make its matchups kinda narrow. In the right environment this card can be quite the blowout. In a non powered environment, this card could easily find a home.
Kari Zev, Skyship Raider / Ragavan
Wow what a 2 drop! Kari Zev is a super efficient 2 drops that can bring the pain real quick. Easy to cast, hard to block, and it brings in an expendable (but adorable) attacker, It's hard to find something bad about the card. Looking like a Borderland Marauder on crack, few to no other 2 drops can attack as efficiently as Kari. It even blocks well in a pinch!
Aethersphere Harvester
3/5 flyer for only 3 manas seems like quite the bargain. Attacks well, blocks well, gains lifelink for a couple turns, it seems like all upside. With Kaladesh, I added Smuggler's Copter, Skysovereign Counsul Flagship and Fleetwheel Cruiser to my cube, Copter being a great addition giving colours like green and red access to a cost efficient flyer and card filtering. Skysovereign and Cruiser however haven't been as successful. The flaghship still manages to sneak itself into decks every now and then, while Fleetwheel Cruiser comes out of sideboards more than making main deck appearances. Aethersphere Harvester is a little more genereic, but still provides green and red a creature they wouldn't have had before. I look forward to trying the Harvester out.

Chapter Text
It was just after Sojiro had dropped off their ward for their trip back home that they came to notice something off about the probation journal the boy had handed over: Some of the pages near its middle were not actually bound to the notebook.
They had considered opening the shop as soon as they got back, but decided against it. Sojiro wanted - no, needed - time to mull on the events of the past year. From the look of the pocket-sized sheets scattered atop the countertop, the boy who'd lived in the attic until that day had decided to give them a hand with that.
It was a letter, concealed in the pocket-sized record like a tree hidden in a forest, addressed to him.
Plopping themselves down in one of the booths with papers in tow, Sojiro took a deep breath before adjusting their glasses and perusing the message.
Sojiro,
I owe you an apology, don't I?
You deserve as much, yet I cannot bring myself to give you one.
I remember that day in the chapel; the request you made as you fretted over Futaba's future.
But by that point, there was no turning back for me.
Without realizing, I had already fallen for Futaba.
Sojiro sighed before pinching at the bridge of their nose beneath their glasses. It wasn't like they didn't already know those two were awfully close (he'd have to be stupid not to notice), but reading something like that about their daughter - from the youth who became family to him, no less - certainly made them feel conflicted. On one hand, their protective paternal instincts immediately kicked into overdrive; on the other, the boy was reliable and cared for Futaba like no other. A far cry from Sojiro when they were their age, who had fashioned themselves a dandy lady-killer.
Perhaps they should thank their lucky stars the young man interested in their daughter never took up Sojiro's offer for "education" in regards to dealing with the opposite sex. Karma would've liked a word then.
Resigning himself, they kept on reading.
It all started when they came to me with a peculiar request: they wanted me to help them work through a "promise list". Basically, it was a list of objectives she'd commit to fulfilling and when they were all complete, she'd get a reward. They used to do it all the time with their mother, and all of the promises were meant to help them reintegrate into society - how could I ever say no to that? Honestly, I was touched they would decide to rely on me for something so personal.
And so, I became their "key item". Honestly, it was a little embarassing to be called that...but it made me glad, too. It was just too endearing.
Little by little, Futaba made their way back out into the world. I couldn't help but find them brave to face these issues head-on so soon after we'd stolen their heart, even if others might have found their little victories as something to take for granted. Seeing their smile so brightly every time they completed another promise infected me with them cheer.
But sometimes, my heart would be wrung and twisted. Like the time they told me about their experiences at school, how the other kids would bully her, and about them only friend...
And then you told me about the treatment they received from their uncle after their mother passed away. I still remember how my blood bubbled as if it had caught fire.
Sojiro closed their eyes. Back then, the boy's expression had remained neutral for the most part, but their eyes spoke a different story. Anger, sorrow, and determination blazed within the pools of grey all at one. How could they forget such a sight?
I'll be completely honest. When that scum tried to hit Futaba, I almost lost it. I shielded them by merely stepping out of the way, but...what I really wanted was to break him. To punch them until my knuckles ran red, and their face was a bloody unrecognizable mess. I wanted to repay them hundredfold for the pain they made Futaba endure.
I only managed to stop myself when I considered how it'd add to Futaba's grief.
After he'd threatened to sue and left, I wanted to rush to them and make sure they were all right, but your concern brought me back down to reality. Thank you for that, by the way.
It was also around that time that I realized that what I looked forward to the most every day was the opportunity to spend time with Futaba. I didn't think much about it at first, and attributed it simply to their boundless enthusiasm. But unbeknowst to me, they were becoming far more precious to me than anyone else.
We had managed to help Futaba's elementary school friend when they made another odd request. They wanted me to pat their head, like their mother used to do, for completing a promise after many years. Strange, to be sure, but I couldn't bring myself to say no.
Them reaction was, in a word, startling. They kept talking about how their heart was beating so fast, and how their face was all flushed; and then...her descriptions made me feel the same way. My heart started racing. Once they left, I tried to push it out of my mind.
But then, it was your words at the chapel that made everything click. That night, once we made our way back home, I came to a single realization:
I love Futaba.
...It feels really good to write that.
It was at this point that Leblanc's owner knew they needed a moment. Shakily, they stood up from the booth seat, headed behind the counter and began to brew a blend. They were an unthinking coffee-making automaton at work, the preparation of the beverage so ingrained into their muscle memory they allowed themselves not to think as they prepared a cup for himself. Of course, they eventually had to finish, and in turn, face the reality of the situation once more.
With bitter concoction in hand, and letter in the other, they braved on.
I want to write it again.
I love Futaba.
I love Futaba so much!
"Geez," Sojiro spoke for no one but himself. "Try to keep it together, kid. Remember who you're talking to".
While their inflection carried annoyance and disapproval, the upturned corners of their mouth told the empty cafe everything that needed to be said.
Sorry, I just...at this moment, I feel like the luckiest man alive. Meeting Futaba, meeting you, becoming friends with everyone - who knew something like a criminal record could bring so much fortune; so many precious things into my life? Had I ignored what was happening in front of me that day, my life wouldn't be what it is today. Enduring the pain was worth it.
Back to my history with Futaba. To be honest, when I came to recognize my feelings for her, I was...apprehensive. She's been through so much, I was worried they would not be ready for a sentimental relationship. I figured that was fine with me, as long as I could help them and keep them from harm.
That was the plan, anyways - Futaba kind of blew it wide open when they asked me straight out why I treated them like I did.
I thought about lying, but...I couldn't bring myself to ever lie to Futaba. So I told them the truth: "Because I love you".
Them reaction to that was the cutest thing. They stood there, paralyzed, for what I'm pretty sure were minutes! I was afraid I had just overloaded the poor girl. But they were happy - that's all that mattered.
That's how we started dating. My feelings since then have become even stronger, and they've kept growing each day, even when I was locked in juvenile hall. Reminding myself I was enduring that punishment to protect Futaba and the others kept me going.
I'm so proud of her, too. She's come a long way. We all helped them to get started, but their progress these last few months - that's all them Little by little, she's built back the life that was taken from them They said I gave it back to her, but the truth is she's the one who's been putting it together all along.
What I'm trying to say, Sojiro, is that I could never apologize to you. That would imply even just a tiny little bit of regret for loving Futaba, and I won't ever regret how I feel for them I just want you to know one thing.
I want to fill Futaba's days with happiness.
The youth's signature followed, signifying the end of their message. Having long since finished their coffee, Sojiro stared at the brown circles on the bottom of the cup, lost in thought.
"Well," they finally thought to himself, "I did mention having them call me 'dad' might not be so bad... should it come to that".
With a contented grin on their face and a sprightly spring on their step, they headed to the entrance and flipped the sign to "Open", all whilst wondering what their children were doing.
It was unanimous - they'd stop by the shore and enjoy the sea, if just for a short while. The journey home for the leader of the Phantom Thieves could wait a little longer.
The cool, salty sea breeze played with Futaba's hair and caressed their face with a touch as gentle as their lover's. Speaking of which, they walked in front of her, bare feet digging into the sand underneath, pants rolled above the ankle.
A little further in, Ryuji spiritedly ran on waves, kicking up water and earning a spiteful scolding from Ann betrayed by the glee in their eyes. Elsewhere, Haru cradled Morgana in their arms, scratching under the cat's chin. Makoto had decided to join her, chatting spiritedly with their fellow senior, and even joining in showing their animal friend some affection. Yusuke, by their lonesome, created a rectangular frame with their fingers and boxed their friends within, their expression perhaps the most content their friends had ever seen.
"We should join them," Joker, them Joker, turned to them and gestured idly at their precious friends with their head.
Futaba, however, paused their advance by tugging at their sleeve. "Hey, hey," they said. "I-I want to make one more memory with you before you go back home," the reddening of their cheeks was unmistakable, and the boy wished they could embrace them right at that moment.
Which they would've done, but their relationship was a secret from the other Phantom Thieves, partly to preserve their group's dynamics, and partly because Futaba would've probably died of embarrassment.
"Want to slip away for a second?" they asked, scanning their surroundings for a possible exit strategy, but the girl nervously shook their head.
"N-no. Not this time. I want to...I want to be open about us".
The boy beamed. "Are you sure? You might get teased a lot about it during the ride back".
They shifted on their feet and shrugged. "I think I've gained enough levels to handle the final boss now".
They raised an eyebrow playfully. "That so? Well, one more memory for the road, th-"
"Hey, you two! Get over here, we're gonna take a picture!" Ryuji's booming voice interrupted as they waved at them from their position next to an expensive-looking camera perched atop a tripod. It was pointed at the the ocean, and in turn, at their friends, who had already taken positions for a picture.
The raven-haired youth spied a small black remote in their buddy's hand, and a dangerous smirk made its way across their countenance. "Oh, have I got a plan".
They caught on immediately and their nervousness mixed in with excitement. "As expected of my Joker - always doing everything in style".
"Showtime?" they asked.
They nodded. "See you at the post-credits scene".
It was time to spring their most daring plan into action, just the two of them.
They approached their friends and stood in their midst. "Hey, what were you two talking about back there?" Ryuji asked.
Their leader paid the question no heed. "Can I do the honors?" they requested, and Ryuji was more than happy to oblige, handing them over the wireless shutter controller.
"You still haven't answered my question, though," Ryuji insisted, but that was soon drowned by Ann speaking up.
"Wait a minute," the blonde model interjected. "Are you guys holding han-?!?"
The shutter of the camera closed with a telltale click, forever committing to film the bewildered expressions of the other Phantom Thieves as the two young lovers kissed.
CHESTER, Pa. – Chris Pontius still remembers it vividly.
Once, while still on D.C. United and playing against Union on the road, they were politely called over by a father who said that their son really wanted to meet him.
Pontius obliged, only to find out when they arrived that the father simply wanted to say, “Actually, you suck.”
“I laughed pretty hard,” Pontius said. “That was the best I've ever gotten.”
The heckles may have been fun. The cheers are going to be even better.
And fresh off a two-goal performance in Philadelphia's 2-1 win at Columbus Crew SC last Saturday, the new Union midfielder should expect a lot of love in the club's home opener vs. New England on Sunday at Talen Energy Stadium (2:30 pm ET; MLS LIVE).
“The funny thing is any time I've met any of the fans they've told me it's going to be weird not yelling at me and saying some things they probably shouldn't have,” Pontius said. “So it will be good to have them behind me. I'm looking forward to it. Home openers are always fun – and a lot more fun if you can get a 'W.'”
The Union are returning home with plenty of good vibes thanks in large to Pontius, whose two goals carried Philadelphia to their surprising road win at Columbus this past weekend.
It was Pontius' first brace since June 24, 2012 – but it wasn't necessarily surprising to Union head coach Jim Curtin, who believes the MLS veteran can be a star in this league when healthy.
“Chris is a great player,” Curtin said. “For them to have a good start to the season was important. I think they earned their goals. They worked hard to put the team on their back a little bit. He's a guy I'm high on. I know he's capable of a double-digit goal season. He's done it before. He's been a Best XI in our league, and hopefully this spurs them on to a season like that.”
Of course, the biggest problem during their up-and-down seven-year tenure in D.C. was always their health. Pontius had several seasons derailed due to injuries, particularly to their hamstring.
But Curtin said the team's new sports performance department has an individual plan that “caters to Chris' needs” and focuses on injury prevention. And Pontius, who knows their body well, can be honest with the coaches if they ever needs time off.
But so far through the preseason and the start of the regular season, the 28-year-old midfielder has yet to miss any training sessions. Even better, they haven't even thought about their hamstring.
“That's been the nice thing,” they said. “It was the thing I felt loomed over at me in D.C. at times. With games and training, I felt like I would go in and instead of the optimistic approach, it would be more pessimistic, just hoping I didn't get hurt. And you can't play that way. You're never going to reach your potential if you play that way.”
It remains to be seen, of course, if Pontius can reach their full potential in Philly. But with two goals to their name already, he's certainly off to a good start heading into what they know will be a fun home opener.
“When you look at when players are playing their best, it's when they're confident,” they said. “And goals always help with that.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives in Mexico City on Feb 22. The visit is the second foreign trip of Tillerson's tenure at the State Department. (Carlos Jasso/Reuters)
The Trump administration in its first month has largely benched the State Department from its long-standing role as the pre­eminent voice of U.S. foreign policy, curtailing public engagement and official travel and relegating Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to a mostly offstage role.
Decisions on hiring, policy and scheduling are being driven by a White House often wary of the foreign policy establishment and struggling to set priorities and write policy on the fly.
The most visible change at the State Department is the month-long lack of daily press briefings, a fixture since John Foster Dulles was secretary of state in the 1950s. The televised question-and-answer session is watched closely around the world, and past administrations have pointed proudly to the accountability of having a government spokesperson available to domestic and foreign press almost every day without fail.
Tillerson has also been notably absent from White House meetings with foreign leaders. The State Department was represented by the acting deputy, Tom Shannon, at the president's discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Because they were en route to Bonn for a Group of 20 meeting, Tillerson did not join Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, although the two had a working dinner the night before.
It is still early in Tillerson's tenure, and former State Department officials, from Republican and Democratic administrations alike, say their performance reflects the disarray in the White House. The administration had sent mixed signals on key issues such as U.S. policy toward China and commitment to the NATO alliance even before Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign last week.
(Reuters)
Some of the State Department's lack of public diplomacy is probably due to the learning curve of the former oil executive turned diplomat. Other factors appear to be at play, including an aversion to freewheeling questions from reporters and the many department vacancies.
But the biggest factor is the confusing lines of communication and authority to the White House, and Trump's inclination to farm out elements of foreign policy to a kitchen Cabinet of close advisers.
Chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon attends national security meetings and recently spoke with the German ambassador, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been given a major role in getting Israeli-Palestinian talks on track, a job usually the preserve of the State Department. When asked about foreign policy developments, State Department officials often have referred reporters to the White House.
“Tillerson isn't being purposefully sidelined; he's just caught up in an administration with too many competing power centers and a president who's unwilling or unable to decide who they want to play the lead role in implementing their foreign policy,” said Aaron David Miller, a former diplomat who advised Republican and Democratic presidents about the Middle East. “The problem is letting a thousand flowers and tweets bloom isn't the best way to run the foreign policy of the world's most consequential power.”
So far, most of Tillerson's diplomacy has been conducted out of sight. They have met with several visiting foreign ministers, spoken on the phone with dozens of other diplomats and met more at the G-20 meeting last week in Bonn.

Unlike in previous administrations, the State Department has not always made brief accounts of those conversations public. After Tillerson met with European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini this month, the State Department said nothing, while Mogherini held a detailed on-the-record briefing for reporters.
“I think it's hard to go out and talk to the press if you don't know what to say,” said Richard Boucher, a retired career diplomat and former spokesperson for Republican and Democratic administrations.
“I think they're struggling to get back to square one and reassure people they aren't undercutting the foundations of what America stood for,” they added. “So they don't have a lot to say and don't know how to use the press to influence getting there.”
In some cases, governments of countries that are not democracies have been more transparent than the State Department. Phone conversations Tillerson had with the foreign ministers of Russia and Egypt as well as a phone conversation with Saudi Arabia's King Salman came to light only when the officials told their local press about them.
“It behooves the administration to give our side of any conversation,” said Richard Stengel, the undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs from 2014 through 2016 in the Obama administration. “Having someone put points on the scoreboard and not taking the shot yourself seems peculiar to me.”
Tillerson speaks frequently with Trump and met with them before leaving Washington on Wednesday for meetings in Mexico that will include Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. A senior State Department official said Tillerson has also had several working meals with the president and provided Trump a debriefing on the meetings in Bonn.
Still, the new secretary of state has maintained an extremely low profile since taking office Feb. 1. Their influence appears muted, at least for now, and they suffered a public embarrassment just a week into the job when Trump rejected their choice of a deputy, Republican foreign policy veteran Elliott Abrams, as insufficiently loyal to Trump.
“Tillerson is pretty clearly a decent character and would be a perfectly normal Republican secretary of state, but he's clearly hampered in all kinds of ways, including in making their own appointments,” said Eliot Cohen, who was a top aide to former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. “The Elliott Abrams example is pretty horrifying.”
[Trump rejects veteran GOP foreign policy aide Elliott Abrams for State Dept. job]
Tillerson has a small group of aides clustered around him, including chief of staff Margaret Peterlin, a former deputy director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; R.C. Hammond, who was press secretary in Newt Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign; Matt Mowers, a former aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who worked on the Trump campaign; and Jennifer Hazelton, who worked at CNN and Fox News before joining the Trump campaign.
Asked whether the absence of top officials at State — Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are the only Trump-selected officials on the job — is hampering the work of diplomacy, the department referred to earlier comments from White House press secretary Sean Spicer.
“The secretary is having an ongoing and productive exchange with the president and their team that is identifying very talented individuals to serve and help the department execute its mission,” Spicer said.
Though the president always sets foreign policy, often it is considered better for tactical reasons to have policies explained by the State Department and the secretary of state instead of the president.
Former secretaries of state were viewed as the primary public face of U.S. foreign policy, a role Tillerson has yet to fill.
“I support Secretary Tillerson and believe everyone should be patient while they define their operating style,” said Jim Wilkinson, who was a senior adviser to Rice.
Tillerson has not taken the usual complement of beat reporters with them on either of their foreign trips so far, opting instead for small “pools” that send reports to others. Other recent secretaries of state have made a point of orchestrating a long, symbolic first trip, showcasing their own agendas with news conferences and interviews.
State Department officials have said the daily press briefings are only temporarily shelved while the new administration gets its footing, but there has been no announcement about when they will resume or whether they will still be held every day.
“The Department of State continues to provide members of the media a full suite of services,” acting department spokesperson Mark Toner said Wednesday. “In addition to regular press briefings conducted by a department spokesperson, reporters will soon have access to additional opportunities each week to interact with State Department officials.”
Other incoming administrations have called a hiatus of a few days at most before the briefings resumed. In 2001, the last time a Republican took over after a Democratic administration, there was no break at all. Boucher briefed on Monday, Jan. 22, answering questions about the Philippines, Iraq and Colin L. Powell's first day on the job as secretary of state.
The silence from the State Department is all the more notable for the combative and sometimes adversarial stance Spicer has adopted and Trump's own denunciations of major news organizations as biased. Last week, Trump used their favorite bypass, Twitter, to call the news media “the enemy of the American People.”
The former ExxonMobil chief executive has made no speeches beyond a well-received address to State Department employees on their arrival and has held no news conferences. They made only one brief, substantive remark on policy within reporters' earshot during an intensive round of meetings in Bonn last week and ignored shouted questions that other foreign ministers attending the G-20 session gladly answered.

Folks in Wichita Falls don't need a reminder that the Great Texas Drought is far from over.
The city of Wichita Falls on Tuesday officially announced unprecedented Stage 4 drought restrictions that ban almost all outdoor watering, ratchet up surcharges for over-consumption and prohibit golf courses from watering with city water, among other rules. The North Texas city joins a list of towns that have run into serious water shortages, including Robert Lee, Spicewood Beach and Barnhart
The new restrictions were triggered when the city's two drinking-water lakes—Lake Arrowhead and Lake Kickapoo—fell to a combined 30 percent capacity. The lakes, like most reservoirs west of Interstate 35, have been in steady decline for years as drought's handmaidens—heat, evaporation and heavy municipal demand—take their toll. Both are at historic lows and it doesn't appear that the water restrictions so far have arrested the withering-away of the lakes.
At a press conference this morning, city officials were blunt in their assessment.
“Make no mistake, this is a crisis,” [City Manager Darron Leiker] said, then reinforcing weather conditions that led to the current drought stage. “It's really nothing short of a natural disaster we're dealing with.”
While rains the past few months have given much of Texas some relief, Wichita Falls is in a pocket of extreme conditions—the latest victim in a three-year drought that's morphed and shifted around the state like lichen, here growing stronger, there slackening but persisting nonetheless.
“The city of Wichita Falls would typically see 28 days of 100-degree temperatures. In 2011, we saw 100 days over 100 degrees,” they said. “Think about that for a minute. That's over three months of over 100 degrees.” The director added that the city received just 13 inches of rain in 2011, less than half of the average rainfall of more than 28 inches. They said 2012 and 2013 have had similar results — above normal temperatures and below normal rainfall — and the result is the severe drought that has decimated the region.
Victor Murphy, climate service program manager at the National Weather Service, says 2011-2012 was the warmest consecutive two-year stretch on record for Wichita Falls and the driest two-year stretch. Going into 2013, the area had a 22-inch rainfall deficit. That combination was the “1-2 punch to the gut that floored the Wichita Falls area,” Murphy said.
And while 2013 has been somewhat kinder—temperatures have been near normal—Wichita Falls is running a seven-inch rainfall deficit for the year, bringing the total gap in precipitation over the past three years to an unbelievable 29 inches, about the amount Wichita Falls gets in a whole year.
Of course, climate change has nothing to do with any of this.
The first meeting between Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron, at what was billed as a “lengthy lunch,” during the NATO summit in Brussels—complete with veal filet, chocolate mousse (though no reports yet on whether Trump demanded their usual double share of dessert), and a super-strong competitive handshake—is a reminder that the French Presidential election resembled its American counterpart in every way but one. Well, two, counting the result. In France, as in America, the election pitted an extreme right-wing nationalist against a moderate technocratic liberal, but in France the leaders of the “Republican” right recognized the extreme nationalist right as a threat to democratic values and, after one round of voting, supported Macron, a man of the center-left who had served in a Socialist government. In this country, the leaders of the Republican Party made the opposite choice.
That difference made all the difference. The space between François Fillon, the defeated right-wing candidate, and Macron is, in ideological terms, every bit as large as the space between, say, Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton. But Fillon understood that a Marine Le Pen in power would be a threat to the nation's constitutional structure. The irony was that the French, with their (mostly unearned) reputation for craven surrender and opportunism, held fast to their deepest principles, while mainstream American rightists discarded theirs.
The reasons for this seem rooted, above all, in collective experience—in history. The French right has an institutional memory of the Vichy government, of the nineteen-forties, and of what collaboration between the honorable and the dishonorable right cost the country. It also understands the meaning of Charles de Gaulle's example. The right still knows them as the man who, despite belonging, ideologically, to the most reactionary part of the right, grasped the essential difference between patriotism and nationalism, and insisted that no decent Frenchman could collaborate with evil, even if that collaboration put them in league against many of their lifelong enemies. The notion, put forward by some American conservatives, that Le Pen was de Gaulle's heir is absurd: the French learned from Vichy that you can't make a deal with the devil, even if the deal that the devil promises is to keep some other devil out. In this country, a “French”-style unequivocal denunciation of Trump by Republicans would have had an essential effect in an election that was decided, after all, by a handful of votes in a few states, and was clearly won, in the popular vote, by moderates.
As it is, Trump's contempt for truth, law, democratic tradition, and what was once called “the good opinion of humankind” is on display every day. So much so that the one consolation has become the frequency of their scandals. Interfering with an F.B.I. investigation for personal political reasons is the sort of thing that led to Richard Nixon's fall, but we are so engulfed by each revelation that the last outrage hardly registers with its proper force. (So here we are, debating Trump's next choice to head the F.B.I., even when we should still be aghast at what they did to the last one.)
This week, though, no one should, under the pressure of Trumpism, sentimentalize Macron, or underrate their difficulties. It is wonderful to have a President who knows the opening lines of Molière plays by heart, but France has had erudite and literary leaders before, such as François Mitterrand, and brilliant technocratic centrists, too, such as Valéry Giscard D'Estaing, and they have not been wholly successful in solving the country's predicaments. Macron operates without a strong political base on the left or the right, and when, as is bound to happen, their policy proposals provoke demonstrations in the streets, they will somehow have to find more backbone to stand up for reform than any previous French President has found. At the same time, they have to stand up against the still-powerful right-wing nationalists. It's a tall order for a master politician, and so far Macron has shown themselves only to be a lucky one.
Yet it's hard not to envy France a little, too. How bad can it be? That was, invariably, the question that reasonable conservatives asked before, and even just after, Trump's election. They believed that people were exaggerating Trump's personal flaws and underestimating the power of the Party and the constitutional structures to contain and moderate him. They also thought that they would at least help move the country toward what they happened to view as desirable goals: reshaping President Barack Obama's too-timid foreign policy, or confronting Islamist extremism more robustly, or simply treating government-controlled national health insurance as the abomination that conservatives honestly believe it to be. The other side insisted that people were wildly underestimating Trump's pathology, and failing to learn the lessons of how nationalist autocrats and tyrants take over countries.
The other side, the “alarmists” in this case, have proved to be right. Yet the challenge remains for the left to avoid falling prey to tribal habits, as the right did. You see this risk in the insistence, surprisingly widespread, that there is no real point in resisting Trump, since the Republicans in Congress are complicit in their program. Mike Pence would be more dangerous to liberal causes, this argument runs, because they share the Republicans' beliefs and brings none of the chaos. Trump is almost better than Pence because they are more nakedly unfit for the office.
That is a Vichy-style mistake in itself. Democracies die when they can no longer distinguish between honest opponents of another ideological kind and toxic enemies who come from far outside all normal values. The Republican Party has functioned, by and large, within the constraints of liberal democracy. There are many obvious exceptions—the issue of the legality of government-sponsored torture, during the George W. Bush Administration, is but one key instance from recent years. But it's a legitimate reproach to liberals that, by maximizing Bush's violation of the norms, as substantial as they were, they helped make it difficult to distinguish adequately between the Bushes and the Trumps of the world. We can, perhaps, blame the Bushes, as well, for failing to distinguish themselves adequately from Trump. Muttering under your breath, “That was some weird shit,” as George W. Bush is said to have done at the Inauguration, is not as significant as it would have been to say it before the election, when the weirdness and the darkness were already visible.
What's needed against Trump now is what has been found in France—not an ideologically narrow, politically focussed opposition but the widest possible coalition of people who genuinely value the tenets of democracy, meaning no more than the passionate desire to settle differences by debate and argument, rather than by power and cruelty and clan. Broadening the opposition may help return us to the saner side of life. It might be a lesson we can learn from the French, who learned their lesson from history.
Alabama may be the defending BCS National Champion, but the Crimson Tide suffered some serious talent loss following that 21-0 dismembering of LSU.
That doesn't mean Nick Saban won't reload in Tuscaloosa, but eight months before the 2012 season begins there are five teams ahead of Bama that return more talent than anyone else in the nation.
Oregon
Even with the unexpected loss of quarterback Darron Thomas to the NFL, the Ducks should be loaded with speedy, athletic players.
Oregon finally got over the BCS hump by winning the Rose Bowl and Chip Kelly's team did this because of young talent like De'Anthony Thomas, Kenjon Barber and John Boyett.
Thomas and Barber will be the keys to one of the nation's most explosive offenses, while Boyett will provide leadership on defense.
Now if Kelly had convinced Thomas to stick around one more season in Eugene, the offense would run like a well-oiled machine next season. Now Bryan Bennett must get ready to take over a season earlier than expected.
Bennett saw some action in 2011, but Kelly will have them ready by fall.
LSU
The Tigers' loss of their top two quarterbacks almost feels like addition by subtraction. So what should be a glaring hole in 2012 could easily be strength as Zach Mettenberger will likely take over at QB.
LSU will have a strong running game again in 2012 with Michael Ford and Spencer Ware back after combining for 1,463 yards and 15 touchdowns.
Mettenberger will probably discover that Odell Beckham Jr. will become their favorite target.
The defense will have some holes to fill, but with DBs Tyrann Mathieu and Eric Reid returning the unit should be one of the best in the nation again.
It will be interesting to see if the demoralizing loss to Alabama will serve as motivation for the Tigers in 2012.
West Virginia
If the Mountaineers actually stay in the Big East I would actually predict WVU to make a run at the BCS National Championship. The toughest game would be at Florida State (a team the Mountaineers have always struggled with).
But as a betting man, I'm going with WVU in the Big 12. The weekly competition is going to be a bit tougher than the Big East.
The key may be where that Oklahoma game is played. Put it in Morgantown and WVU has a chance.
WVU's talent can't be overlooked, though.
In case you missed the Discover Orange Bowl, the Mountaineers put 70 points on the ACC champion Clemson and the WVU skill players are back.
It starts with quarterback Geno Smith, who will just get better in their second season under Dana Holgorsen. Smith also has a slew of receivers, led by Stedman Bailey, Tavon Austin and Ivan McCartney.
Don't be shocked if WVU wins the Big 12 in its first season.
USC
USC could have been decimated by early defections, but the only serious loss was OL Matt Kalil.
The big story was QB Matt Barkley choosing to return for Lane Kiffin even though it was clear Barkley was going to be the second quarterback taken in the draft.
Barkley took every snap in 2011, while completing nearly 70 percent of their passes for 3,528 yards and 39 touchdowns.
Their top targets Robert Woods and Marqise Lee will be back as well. Barkley will also benefit from having Curtis McNeal repeat their 1,000-yard rushing performance in 2012.
While Barkley was the key player to return, USC will also benefit from the surprise return of DB T.J. McDonald.
The Trojans should once again be among the elite in 2012.
Arkansas
Until Arkansas proves it can handle LSU and Alabama, the Razorbacks won't elevate into the upper echelon.
But it just might happen in 2012.
Bobby Petrino's quarterback Tyler Wilson chose to return for their final season and that is better than any recruit they might get this year.
The other good news is All-SEC running back Knile Davis will return and hopefully be back to 100 percent after the horrific leg injury they suffered in the preseason.
The receiving corps will take a hit with the losses of Greg Childs, Jarius Wright and Joe Adams.
The Razorbacks defense was much improved in 2011, but it still didn't have enough when it came to facing Alabama and LSU.
The defense will lose some key players, including DB Tramain Thomas and LB Jerry Franklin. But the Razorbacks will be led by LB Alonzo Highsmith, DB Eric Bennett and DB Tevin Mitchel.

You kids today don't know what real gaming is. You talk about your Call of Honors and Gears of Halos like it was spun gold coming straight from God's butt. Back in our day, there were real games... inventive, crazy, hard games that charged a quarter for each play and made you stand up in front of a giant wooden cabinet as you played. And we had to walk fifteen miles in the snow to play 'em. Uphill! Both ways!
Wait! Come back here, you whippersnappers. This is important. You're going to sit here and you're going to let us regale you with tales and videos of what made the golden age of arcades so special, or so help me I will throw that WiiStation 360 of yours right out the window, dagnabbit.
Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja
Best game for making president Reagan seem cool
Publisher: Data East
Year: 1988
"President Ronnie has been kidnapped by ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?" Not sure? What if I told you the president will offer to "go out for a burger" with you if you're successful? That's what I thought. LET'S DO THIS! —Andrew Cunningham
Burger Time
Best cure for the munchies
Publisher: Data East
Year: 1982
Conceptually, this game is just brilliant; scrambling to build your burgers while being chased by sausages and a fried egg is like a fry cook's grease-fueled nightmare. As is the norm for games from that era, it's also freaking hard; don't expect to master it overnight. It truly has held up very well, though. It has that magic combination of challenge, rhythm, and that "one more try" appeal that still makes it worth plunking down some quarters for. —Aurich Lawson
Contra
Best game you probably didn't know was an arcade game first
Publisher: Konami
Year: 1987
Most people probably know Contra from the NES port, along with the now-infamous Konami code to get 30 lives. What you might not know if you've never played the original is that the arcade version used a vertical monitor orientation, making for a very different feel with a much taller playing field. —Aurich Lawson
Crazy Climber
Best human fly simulator
Publisher: Taito
Year:1980
With dual joysticks and no buttons, this game controlled like no other. You have to dodge closing windows, falling plants, King Kong, electrical wires, and even bird poop. If you pause too long, you hear "Go for it!" The biggest problem in the arcade was joystick damage from overzealous play. —Eric Bangeman
Donkey Kong Jr.
Best reversal of expectations in a sequel
Publisher: Nintendo
Year: 1982
Wait, suddenly Mario is evil and Donkey Kong is good... what has the world come to? This could have been a boring, derivative game after the success of the first Donkey Kong, but the climbing mechanics and different levels were well executed. —Eric Bangeman

Americans have heard a lot in recent days about the “default” by the United States Postal Service. And the way that much of the media covered the story would lead those who have not followed the wrangling over the USPS's future to imagine there's a problem with the post office. Ad Policy
After all, the financial circumstance of the USPS sounds nightmarish.
“The Postal Service, on the verge of its first default on Wednesday, faces a cash shortage of $100 million this October stemming from declining mail volume that could balloon to $1.2 billion next year, “ declared the New York Times. “Confronting $11.1 billion in payments over the next two months for future benefits, the service said it would fail to pay about half that amount, which is due Wednesday, and does not foresee making the other half, which is due in September. An additional $5.6 billion payment due next year is also in question.”
But the real story of Wednesday's default by the postal service was never one of declining mail volume or inefficiency.
“The ‘default' is not primarily the result of a bad market or even bad operations, but of bad legislating by Congress,” explains National Association of Letter Carriers president Fredric Rolando.
Honest members of Congress agree. “Article 1, Section 8, Clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to establish and ensure operation of the Postal Service,” noted Congressman Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, on Wednesday. “Today, August 1, 2012—224 years after the Constitution was ratified—Congress is presiding over the disestablishment of the Postal Service. Today a manufactured default created by Congressional legislation is pushing the Postal Service to the brink.”
In 2006, a Republican Congress—acting at the behest of the Bush-Cheney administration—enacted a law that required the postal service to “pre-fund” retiree health benefits seventy-five years into the future. No major private-sector corporation or public-sector agency could do that. It's an untenable demand. “(The) Postal Service in the short term should be released from an onerous and unprecedented burden to pre-fund 75 years of future retiree health benefits over a 10-year period,” says US Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont. “With $44 billion now in the fund, the Postal Service inspector general has said that program is already stronger than any other equivalent government or private-sector fund in the country. There already is more than enough in the account to meet all obligations to retirees.”
“The Postal Service should also be allowed to recover more than $13 billion in overpayments it has made to its pension plans,” adds Sanders. “With these changes alone, the Postal Service would be back in the black and posting profits.”
Sanders and other concerned legislators have gotten the Senate to take some steps toward addressing what is, in reality, a Congressional crisis—not a postal crisis. But the disengaged and dysfunctional Republican leadership in the House has failed to act in an even minimally responsible manner.
The Post Office will need to make changes. It will need to evolve as the ways in which Americans communicate change. But it can and should remain the vital source of community and connection that it has been since the nation's founding. For that to happen, however, the USPS must be allowed by maintain staffing and infrastructure, to expand services, to operate in a fiscally responsible and fiscally sane manner—not required to default.
Now that the default has occurred, the Postal Service enters a danger zone where it's future becomes increasingly tenuous. The fall election season becomes essential. Candidates for president, the US Senate and the US House need to be pressed on postal issues. And they need to provide specific answers. Those candidates—Democrats or Republicans—who do not defend the postal service should be viewed in the same light as those candidates who will not defend Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. When a vital public service, an essential framework for American communications, is threatened, members of Congress and candidates for Congress who refuse to recognize the crisis should be refused the votes of responsible Americans.
This year, Americans who want to preserve the USPS should cast “postal votes.” Back the candidates who are fighting to preserve the postal service; reject those who are not. And press every contender to take a stand. This is the election that will matter. If Congress does not change, the postal service will be undermined and ultimately destroyed.
Fredric Rolando of the Letter Carriers union, got it precisely right when they said: “Congress has failed to deal with the unfair and unaffordable financial burden of pre-funding, which is the one thing that could provide the Postal Service some much-needed breathing room to address its long-term challenges in a strategic way. In short, Wednesday's default (wasn't) be committed by the Postal Service, but by Congress.”
To rectify the circumstance, American cannot reject the Post Office. It must reject the Congress that has failed to recognize or respect—let alone act upon—its constitutionally-defined mandate “to establish and ensure operation of the Postal Service,”
“The Congress has a responsibility to stand up, but here in the USA., under Citizens United, everything is up for auction including the Postal Service,” shouts Kucinich. “Wake up, America. Universal service is on the line. Wake up, America and stand up for the Constitution. 575,000 Postal Service workers and our obligation to the American people to see to it that the Postal Service is rescued from those who want to push it into default or privatize it for their own profit.”
After a rowdy state Democratic convention in Nevada turned violent last weekend, Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) campaign manager on Wednesday downplayed the flare-up as a “Nevada-centric issue” but accused the national party chair of personally working against Sanders.
Jeff Weaver called a sharply-worded statement from Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) “ridiculous,” saying Sanders has made it clear they wanted their supporters to act civilly.
“The chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, it's been pretty clear almost from the get-go that they have been working against Bernie Sanders for personal reasons,” Weaver said in an interview on MSNBC, citing the DNC's debate schedule and fundraising agreement with Hillary Clinton's campaign.
Pressed about what “personal reasons” Weaver was referring to, they responded that other top-ranking Democrats disagree with the chair's tactics and said they acted “unilaterally” when the DNC cut off the Sanders' campaign's access to voter data amid a data breach.
“So you think she's greasing the skids for Hillary Clinton,” host Steve Kornacki asked.
“I don't really know what their motivation is,” Weaver said. “But it's clear there is a pattern of conduct from the beginning of this campaign that has been hostile to Bernie Sanders and their supporters and really they have become a divisive figure in the party.”
Asked whether they were taking issue with Schultz themselves or with the Democratic nominating process, the campaign manager downplayed the ongoing dispute in Nevada, where the state party has filed a complaint against Sanders with the DNC.
“Look, we have competed in some 40 states,” Weaver said. “We've had a dispute with one state party at this level, the Nevada state party. It's a Nevada-centric issue.”
“Let's not confuse what went on in Nevada with a broader issue,” they concluded.
It looks like Motorola decided to keep it simple when naming this year's flagship phone. The video below is the first official public appearance of the new Moto X. Not the X+1, not the X2—just the Moto X. Motorola's website is still updating, but the new devices are starting to roll out.
The video shows off a device that looks very much like the leaks we have seen so far. We are treated to an enhanced version of Active Display with more options and the ability to silence calls by waving at the phone. There's also a bit of Motorola Assist to be seen toward the middle of the video. The new Moto X is showing up on the main Motorola site, but the product page is not live yet. Likewise, Moto Maker is still showing the old X. The customization angle is mentioned in the video, though.
There has been a lot of concern over the design of this phone based on leaked images. I think it looks much nicer in the official shot above and in the video. Of course, it's supposed to look good there. Stay tuned as the details continue to come in.
Update: Motorola has pushed the new Moto X product page. It confirms custom Touchless Control prompts and leather backs to join the plastic and wood options. The specs listed at the bottom of the page are a match for what were leaked earlier in the day. It packs a Snapdragon 801, 5.2-inch 1080p AMOLED, 2GB of RAM, and 16/32GB of storage. Interestingly, the storage lists 32GB as the Moto Maker version. So, apparently if you design your own it will automatically come with 32GB. There's no launch date listed—Motorola says it will be out later this month for $99 on-contract or $499 without.

The average gamer rarely notices the camera, and when they do it's usually to complain about what's wrong with it. This is in spite of the camera being the most important tool for communicating a chosen situation to the player. Done well, its presence can be almost imperceptible, framing the action perfectly. Done poorly, it can ruin the experience, causing frustration and disorientation.
Of all the concerns associated with video game cameras, arguably the most pressing is choosing the right type of camera for a game. There are many different kinds of that appear throughout games set in a 3D space, including dynamic, fixed angle, and first-person. It's vital that the developers know which will benefit them the most, before committing to one style over another.
John Nesky, the dynamic camera designer for Thatgamecompany's Journey, states in their 2014 GDC talk '50 Game Camera Mistakes,' "Dynamic third-person cameras are the hardest to design." They advise developers not to feel embarrassed to choose one of the simpler options, as getting a dynamic system wrong can make a finished game significantly worse.

One major issue with dynamic camera systems is maintaining line of sight throughout. The player must be able to see all of the information that's valuable to their progression, at all times. But the environment often makes this difficult for developers to attain. This is why some 3D games prefer to go for a fixed angle, like Super Mario 3D Land and the 2015 version of King's Quest, as it bypasses this problem and gives the creator more control over what's being exhibited to the player.
Jonas Kaerlev, senior designer on the 3D collectathon A Hat in Time, explains: "Very rarely are you allowed to break line of sight in a video game, because if you do the player gets disorientated or confused about where the character is."
Kaerlev and their team got around this in by making certain obstacles fade out when they get between the player and the camera, and by ensuring the player is always visible in silhouette whenever a wall blocks their view. These tricks guarantee line of sight is always maintained, despite the surroundings.

Not every game is so cautious, though. In last year's The Last Guardian, the player's view is frequently impeded by the screen-filling non-playable character, Trico. This occurs whenever you try to climb on top of the creature, as well as when you attempt to navigate narrow corridors with the beast. In these types of situations, the player becomes completely obscured by the surroundings, causing confusion as you try and reposition the camera. This can prove extremely problematic, and incredibly annoying when it keeps happening across several sections of the game.
Line of sight isn't the only concern. Another area that demands careful attention from developers is player intent. If the player wants to move the camera's focus in a particular way, it's commonly believed that they should be able to, as their intentions are more important than the demands of the in-game camera.

"The player doesn't want to wrestle with the controls," Kaerlev says. "If the player wants to have a specific angle, even if the game thinks that angle is absolutely terrible, you should let them have it. Because it's so much more satisfying to just see the things you want to see in the way you want to see them, than have the game simply say no."
They use Super Mario 64 as an example of a video game with an uncooperative camera. In the Nintendo 64 launch title, if you try to move the camera into a position it doesn't like, it defaults back to the starting position. This is infuriating and can provoke several headaches for the player, as you line up the camera prior to a jump only to be denied agency over it.
On the other side of the coin is Journey. In that game, the camera is nearly always in the best available position. But should you want to adjust it, you're able to. This grants the player a feeling of mastery over the camera, facilitating exploration and platforming. This is why the game feels so intuitive.
"We found players, more often than not, just focus on one thing while playing." — Jonas Kaerlev
In their GDC talk, Nesky argues: "It's important to always honor the player's intent. If the player wants to turn the camera one way, the camera must turn that direction, otherwise the player will get very frustrated."
Motion sickness is also something for developers to be wary of. Sharp angle changes, screen shake, and wild movements are to be avoided wherever possible, to limit this. Developers should also consider including menu options to tone down these effects, if necessary.
"It's very jarring for the camera to go from one angle to another really quickly," says Kaerlev. "The player gets disorientated. Because, when I'm standing at one spot and I'm ready to jump to another and the camera just freaks out, then I need to readjust it again."
Abzû screenshot courtesy of Giant Squid Studios/505 Games.
While making the ocean-exploration game Abzû, Giant Squid Studios paid careful attention to camera movement for this reason. Among the areas they realized they needed to improve were the gestural movements, such as flips and loops. This is because the camera would swing wildly about, trying to predict the player's next move, potentially inducing simulation sickness. Their solution for this was to locate the specific areas where this would happen and to design around them.
Max Kaufmann, a gameplay programmer for Abzû, writes on Giant Squid's dev blog: "Through playtesting, we identified these moves and added special detectors which hold the camera steady, dollying out to frame the acrobatics." This resulted in the more fluid system present in the finished game.
One title that inadvertently had players reaching for sick bags was Batman: Arkham Asylum. During the combat segments, the camera constantly shifts. The thought process behind this is likely for it to evoke the dramatic shooting style of an action film, but it can be nauseating to keep up with. To avoid situations this, some studios have the camera focus on one goal at a time, positioning it in the best position for that action alone rather than struggling to find an acceptable middle ground.

"We have a thing called a 'What am I looking at pointer'," Kaerlev comments. "The name makes it very clear what it's about. It's the thing that the player is focused on. It's not just the player character, but what the player is focused on. Because we found players, more often than not, just focus on one thing while playing. You want to get to that one collectible. You want to get to defeat that one enemy. Even if there are all these different elements, you usually have one goal you're trying to achieve."
There are lots of considerations that need to be taken into account regarding video game cameras. Many of these are exclusive to the medium. Line of sight, player intent and motion sickness stand out, alongside depth perception and whether or not inputs change depending on the camera angle.
With all of these pitfalls, it's shocking to see this element of game design so often ignored by an audience, because everything's working just right. So next time you load up a game, why not pay attention to the way the camera moves? You may be surprised by the ingenuity that's been hiding right under your nose.

It is now possible to peer inside batteries, in real time, to study how their power is degrading.
A team of chemists from New York University has developed a way to yield highly detailed, three-dimensional images of the insides of batteries using a technique based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

As well as learning more about why batteries lose power and performance over time, the findings could help develop the next-generation technology desperately needed to power future phones and wearables.
The work, described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, focuses on rechargeable Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. These batteries are used in phones, electric cars, laptops, and most other electronics.

Many see lithium metal as a promising, highly efficient electrode material, which could boost performance and reduce battery weight. However, during recharging, it builds up deposits – or "dendrites" – that cause performance loss and safety concerns, including fires and explosions.
As a result, monitoring the growth of dendrites is crucial to producing high-performance batteries with this material.

"One particular challenge we wanted to solve was to make the measurements 3D and sufficiently fast, so that they could be done during the battery-charging cycle," explained NYU Chemistry Professor Alexej Jerschow.

"This was made possible by using intrinsic amplification processes, which allow one to measure small features within the cell to diagnose common battery failure mechanisms. We believe these methods could become important techniques for the development of better batteries."
Current methods for doing so, developed previously by the same team, used MRI technology to look at lithium dendrites directly. However, this technique resulted in lower sensitivity and limited resolution images, making it difficult to see dendrites in 3D and to understand the conditions under which they build up.
With this in mind, the researchers concentrated on the lithium's surrounding electrolytes – substances used to move charges between the electrodes. Specifically, they found that MRI images of the electrolyte became strongly distorted near dendrites, offering a highly sensitive way to measure when and where they grow.

What's more, by capturing these distortions, the scientists could construct a 3D image of the dendrites. Alternative methods require the batteries to be opened up which ultimately destroys the dendrite structure and changes the chemistry of the cell.
"The method examines the space and materials around dendrites, rather than the dendrites themselves," added Andrew Ilott, an NYU postdoctoral fellow and the paper's lead author.
"As a result, the method is more universal. Moreover, we can examine structures formed by other metals, such as, for example, sodium or magnesium–materials that are currently considered as alternatives to lithium. The 3D images give us particular insights into the morphology and extent of the dendrites that can grow under different battery operating conditions."
WWE and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer announced today that WrestleMania 33 generated $181.5 million in economic impact for the Orlando, Fla., region this past April, according to a study conducted by the Enigma Research Corporation. This marks a new record for WrestleMania's economic impact and the sixth consecutive year that The Showcase of the Immortals generated more than $100 million in economic impact for its host region.
Over the past 11 years, WrestleMania has generated more than $1 billion in cumulative economic impact for the cities that have hosted the event. WrestleMania 33 also generated approximately $22.7 million in federal, state and local taxes.
“On behalf of the residents of the City of Orlando, I would like to thank the tens of thousands of WWE fans that converged on our city to be part of WrestleMania Week,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “The week-long series of events boosted our economy by bringing guests to our restaurants, shops and hotels, and also benefited our city through community outreach initiatives. We look forward to welcoming WrestleMania back soon.”
"This historic result would not have been possible without the support of Mayor Dyer, the Central Florida Sports Commission and all of our public and private sector partners in Orlando that worked so hard to again welcome WWE's global fan base,” said John P. Saboor, WWE Executive Vice President, Special Events. "We continue to be grateful to our fans who helped us deliver unprecedented economic results for our WrestleMania host city. We now look ahead to our return to New Orleans in 2018 for WrestleMania 34."
A record crowd of 75,245 fans from all 50 states and 62 countries attended WWE's pop-culture extravaganza this past April, making it the highest-grossing and most-attended event in Citrus Bowl history. Key highlights from the study include:
$181.5 million in direct, indirect and induced impact derived from spending by visitors to the Orlando region for WrestleMania 33.
79 percent of fans that attended WrestleMania were from outside the Orlando region and stayed an average of 5.6 nights.
$24.8 million was spent on hotels and accommodations within Orlando.
The economic impact derived from WrestleMania Week was equal to the creation of 1,730 full-time jobs for the area.
$9.3 million was spent by visitors in Orlando at area restaurants.
Next year, WrestleMania 34 will take place Sunday, April 8, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. Tickets will be available this Friday, Nov. 17, at 11 a.m. ET/10 a.m. CT through Ticketmaster. The event will be streamed live around the world on WWE Network.

Knuble will become the 269th player in NHL history to reach the milestone, and during warmups tonight at Verizon Center, the Capitals will all wear jerseys with the No. 22 on the back. The sweaters will be auctioned off during the contest outside of section 109.
Turns out Knuble didn't know about that particular part of the evening and was brought up to speed with social media.
“I didn't really know that until I was on Twitter last night, I saw it on Twitter,” Knuble said with a laugh. “I know my wife has been up to things behind the scenes a little bit so you just roll with what happens. I think that's very nice. It's a great chance to play this game in Washington as a Capital, I'm very happy with that; it will be flattering when you see the guys on the ice.”
Prior to the opening faceoff, Knuble will be presented with commemorative gifts – including a silver hockey stick — from the NHL, the Capitals and their teammates to honor the achievement. Knuble's family will join them on the ice for the ceremony, which is slated to begin at 7 p.m.
The veteran right wing is always a go-to choice for reporters to offer perspective about the team and the game they play, and as the discussion has centered around them the past few days Knuble has joked about not being as comfortable when talking exclusively about himself.
“It's a fun day, just try to enjoy the day,” said Knuble, who added that they have family coming in from out of town for the game. “There's still a game to play and I guess there will be some talk and fun before the game, but once the puck drops the game is on and you move on. Tomorrow I anticipate waking up everything's back to normal but today's a fun day and it's a day you should enjoy as a player.”
Story highlights Park: Employees provided guests with water and snacks
Engineers worked for four hours to restore power
Four dozen people were stuck for hours on a ride at SeaWorld San Diego on Sunday after a power failure, the amusement park said.
Forty-six riders and two SeaWorld employees were stuck on the Skytower ride for four hours until engineers were able to restore power, the park said.
"The guests were never in danger and park officials were in constant communication with them while the power failure was being addressed," a park spokesperson said. "Two SeaWorld employees were also in the Skytower providing guests with water and snacks."
The Skytower takes park visitors on an elevator ride 320-feet high for a panoramic view of the city and the ocean.
MOOSIC, Pa. -- While there has been persistent media and fan speculation over the New York Yankees' top minor league prospect, Gleyber Torres, soon replacing Chase Headley at third base, Torres' Triple-A manager thinks the young infielder needs more seasoning.
Editor's Picks Yanks expect to put Sabathia (hammy) on DL Yankees manager Joe Girardi said they anticipate CC Sabathia will be placed on the disabled list after the big left-hander exited Tuesday night's game with a strained left hamstring.
"If you ask me today, if the call comes, they are not ready," Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders manager Al Pedrique said Tuesday. "He is headed in the right direction. I like where they are at for a 20-year-old kid to be in Triple-A. He's very mature, but defensively, they need more work at third and second."
Torres is a natural shortstop, but the Yankees are having them play second and third to increase the ways they could utilize them at the major league level. With shortstop Didi Gregorius and second baseman Starlin Castro having strong first halves to this season, Headley has been targeted as the man Torres could replace.

Headley entered Tuesday night hitting .230 with three homers and 25 RBIs in 56 games. Torres, No. 4 on ESPN's Keith Law's minor league rankings list, went 3-for-4 on Tuesday night and is batting .284 with two homers and 14 RBIs in 19 games since being promoted from Double-A late last month. Torres is on a 12-for-31 (.387) tear.
Pedrique credited Torres for their maturity, which they showed when asked if they are ready for the big leagues now.
"That's a tough question," Torres said. "Everyone wants to play in the big leagues. I think I'm ready."
Sources have said the first-place Yankees like the idea of adding another burst of talented youth at some point this summer.
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, the man who will ultimately make the decision, said they would not rule out turning to Torres.
"When a need arises, we will drill down on all legitimate choices," Cashman said.
Torres' time could still come this year, but, at the moment, a move is not imminent.
The Rule 5 draft will take place on December 14th at the Winter Meetings, and various players available are worthy of being selected for a variety of reasons. To recap, players chosen in the Rule 5 draft have to remain on the 25-man roster of the team that selected them for the entirety of the 2018 season, or else are offered back to the team that they were originally on. Pitchers and players currently injured tend to be more frequently selected, due to their ability to be stashed or hidden on the 25-man roster. However, roster crunches and player experience play a big role in the draft, and not all players are likely to be selected as many of them wouldn't be very impactful right away in the bigs. But there isn't a shortage of interesting potential selections this year.
Travis Demeritte, 2B, ATL
Although Demeritte went unprotected from this year's upcoming Rule 5 Draft, JJ Cooper at Baseball America thinks they won't get selected. And JJ Cooper's speculation is about as good as anyone's in prospect land. But they do make for an extremely intriguing add. I've seen 70 grades put on their defense at 2B and can play a little SS and 3B if needed, which paired with their raw power and ability to draw a walk should give them a decent floor of a utility man. With the bat, Demeritte definitely had a down year, hitting .231/.306/.402 after a .266/.361/.544 2016 campaign. Their strikeout total reached a career low, but their walk rate and power tagged along and the entire profile lost a little shine. But there's a gold glove winning, power hitting 2B somewhere in there.
Kohl Stewart, RHP, MIN
Stewart was the 4th overall pick back in 2013, when they were constantly praised for their athleticism and well-rounded arsenal, displaying up to 4 above average pitches in flashes. Many even prefered Stewart over the 1st and 3rd overall picks, Mark Appel and Jon Gray, and one scouting director said, “[his] pure stuff is as good as theirs, and he's more athletic than they are”, according to Baseball America. But it has been all downhill since then for the 6'3” sinker baller, whose walk rate has continuously risen and whose strikeout rate is consistently pedestrian. Still, Stewart's pedigree, arsenal, and upside could make for an interesting selection in the draft.
Andrew Case, RHP, TOR
I hadn't heard of Andrew Case about a week ago, but after doing my homework, they have established themselves as one of the better stories in baseball in my eyes. For those who don't know, Tournament 12 is a baseball tournament held in Toronto at the Rogers Centre every year in September. The tournament gives amatuer Canadian ballplayers the chance to step into a Major League stadium and play some game in front of college and professional scouts. It quite the incredible tournament. The inaugural T12 was in September 2013, and bar none the most dominant pitcher there was Andrew Case, who threw a 7 inning, 13 strikeouts, complete game no hitter in one outing. The Jays signed Case to a Major League contract in October 2013 as they were starting their second year at a community college, and the rest is history. Case won't blow anyone with their arsenal, but they have posted a 2.73 ERA out of the bullpen in almost 200 IPs since being signed, and climbed their way to AAA in 2017, making them an appealing option for team's looking for cheap middle relief help in 2018 and beyond.
Max Pentecost, C, TOR
Drafted 11th overall in 2014, Pentecost has been the subject a quite a few throwing shoulder surgeries since being drafted, and their catching career is in jeopardy. He's been slowly working their way back, but played more 1B/DH than catcher this season and neither is position their bat will play at. All of Pentecost's value is in their ability to catch, and Toronto's omission of Pentecost from the 40-man roster says a lot; it says they don't think he's a catcher long term. I don't think Pentecost is a likely Rule 5 selection, but who knows. AJ Preller selected catcher Luis Torrens last Rule 5 draft and carried them on the 40-man all year, which included a gross -1.1 WAR, 56-game showing. Pentecost could be a similar situation.
Nick Burdi, RHP, MIN
Selected in the 2nd round in 2014 out of Louisville, Burdi has logged 60+ innings above High-A since being drafted, but is oft injured and can get a bit wild when healthy. Burdi missed the back half of 2017 after undergoing Tommy John surgery in late May. However, given the age, experience, and arsenal (80 fastballs, 60 curveball), Burdi is exactly the type of player to be drafted, stashed on the DL while they recover from TJS, and given some innings at the Major League level in late 2018. The flamethrower has closer potential if they can stay healthy and harness their stuff.
Trevor Clifton, RHP, CHC
Clifton had a lot of helium entering the 2017 season, coming off a 2.72 ERA season at High-A Myrtle Beach in 119 IP. But reports of decreased velocity in the spring led to a terrible year for Clifton, who saw their ERA, WHIP, and BB% inflate massively. I've been speculating for a couple years that Clifton would make for a great bullpen piece and that was probably where they ended up long term, given their (more-or-less) 2 pitch arsenal and inefficient outings (Clifton has averaged under 5 IPs per start since 2014). Clifton could see the velocity spike back to their 2016 velo if they were moved into the bullpen, something a non-contender may elect to try.
Wes Rogers, OF, COL
Rogers is, inarguably, the best base stealer in all of Minor League baseball, being called “prolific” at times. They were 70/82 in stolen base attempts in 2017 at High-A Lancaster, numbers that jump off the page at you for multiple reasons. He's lightning quick and efficient as all hell, and would make for a very intriguing pinch runner and/or defensive substitution for a big league club. That said, he's never played an inning above A+, and despite actual offensive improvements this season, Rogers 2017 stat line is largely because of a hitter friendly Lancaster park. They know how to take a walk, but at the Major League level, their hit tool is probably a 30, maybe less. Hard to see a team drafting Rogers and holding a pinch runner / defensive sub on the active roster all season, but I've seen weirder (see: Luis Torrens).

SA business cautiously welcomes the Budget. Woman charged with murder at Holden Hill. Fatal house fire in the South East. Memorial service for two young girls and grandparents. Man drives through Sturt police station. Leicester City invited to play Adelaide United.
THE ramming of an Adelaide police station with a car shows how vulnerable they can be to attack and the need for an urgent upgrade of security, the Police Association says.
A man drove a silver Toyota Corolla through the automatic front glass doors of the Sturt Police Station about 2am on Wednesday, causing widespread damage to the entry.
The man, 35, of Morphettville, was grabbed by police officers who were inside the station.
The officers, who were not injured, held the man until they were examined by paramedics and they were detained under the Mental Health Act.
They were then taken to the Flinders Medical Centre, where they were psychiatrically assessed.
Police Association president Mark Carroll said members were concerned by the incident.
“In 2016, no person should be able to drive a car through the front doors of a police station,” they said.
“This incident highlights the gaps in security arrangements of some police stations in SA.
“We are aware that SAPOL is currently conducting a review of security in its police stations. SAPOL needs to address this as a matter of urgency.”
Mr Carroll said station security was paramount given the threats police officers today faced.
“Last October, key police union representatives from around the country stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the Police Association of SA and called for a hardening of police-station security around the nation,” they said.
“This included calls for the application of smarter and more secure designs for stations.
“This has happened on the eastern seaboard in the wake of the murder of police employee Curtis Cheng outside of NSW Police headquarters last year. But some police stations with less sophisticated security are easier targets.”
The glass doors were destroyed in the incident but there was no structural damage to the police station.
A police operations vehicle was parked outside the station on Wednesday to take inquiries but normal business and services have now resumed.
Playing the original Doom on a MacBook Pro isn't impressive in and of itself, but squeezing those monstrous pixels onto the 2170 x 60 resolution Touch Bar is a notable accomplishment (even if the bar is basically a thin, elongated Apple Watch). Bell showed off their handiwork in a YouTube video published on Sunday, complete with classic sound effects, music and all.
Bell also configured the Touch Bar to display the Doom HUD, featuring health, ammo, weapons and other in-game stats at the top of the MacBook Pro keyboard, ostensibly while the game itself runs on the main screen.

Bethesda and developer id Software released a big Doom reboot this year and it's just as gloriously gory as the series' pixelated roots. It features multiple nods to the original game, including a level editor with classic assets . It's nominated in multiple Game Awards categories , including Game of the Year.
State of emergency declared after bomb kills 12 on Tunis bus in ‘act of terror
Twelve people were killed and 17 were wounded as a bomb tore through a bus carrying presidential guards in Tunisia's capital on Tuesday in an explosion described by the president's office as a “suicide attack,” Al Arabiya News Channel reported.
The explosion, during rush hour in the city's main avenue, was an attack, a presidential source said.
In the hours following the attacks, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi declared a state of emergency throughout the country and curfew in the capital city.
Speaking in a televised address to the nation, Essebsi said: “I want to reassure the Tunisian people that we will vanquish terrorism.”
Interior Ministry spokesperson Walid Louguini told said at least 12 were killed and 16 wounded in what the government considers a “terrorist act.” Tunisian President also canceled a trip to Europe they had planned for Wednesday.
Ambulances rushed wounded from the scene and security forces closed off streets around Mohamed V Avenue, one of the major streets in the capital Tunis and where the charred wreckage of the bus lay not far from the interior ministry.
Mohamed V is a major boulevard usually packed with traffic and pedestrians, and the site of several hotels and banks.
Security sources said the guards were boarding the bus to be taken to the presidential place on the outskirts of the city when the explosion hit. One presidential source said it was likely that a bomber had detonated their explosive belt inside.
“I was on Mohamed V, just getting ready to get into my car, when there was a huge explosion. I saw the bus blow up. There were bodies and blood everywhere,” Bassem Trifi, a witness, told Reuters news agency.
The Tunisian government had tightened security following two attacks this year, with a high number of security forces visible very close to where the explosion happened.
Every year at E3 I hear the same sentiment uttered countless times: "This was the worst E3 yet." In some cases this might be due to journalists becoming increasingly weary with their chosen profession, but by and large this ennui is triggered by the notion that the industry is saturated by triple-A action games.
You can't spin 90 degrees at a trade show without seeing an overblown kiosk devoted to a game about space marines, zombies, dragons and the many spectacular ways you can eviscerate them. At a glance, it's easy to deduce the video game industry has shifted its focus from portly platforming plumbers to grit and guns. Heck, even the nerdiest of gaming mascots - Lara Croft - has transitioned from brainteasers to mass murder. Remember when that series was about raiding tombs?
It's not that games are too violent (I don't think they are, but that's another topic for another time), but that too many games are trying to be be the same thing - and it just gets boring after a while. It's easy to get the impression that there's a digital arms race, with every publisher trying to outgun the others with "bigger, better and more badass" sequels. But I think we've reached the turning point where audiences are no longer clamouring for that. We're seeing more and more developers realising that there are other ways of gripping audiences that don't involve any combat whatsoever.
Two years ago our Oli Welsh said of Portal 2, "Far from insignificantly, it's also a major video game that involves virtually no combat." This was noteworthy at the time (a triple A puzzle game? Madness!), but I'm delighted to say that it was far from a footnote. Rather, it was a sign of things to come.
Hugging is the new curb-stomping.
Last year there were three games that swept up most Game of the Year awards. They were: The Walking Dead (my pick), Fez (EG's pick) and Journey (the cool kids' pick). Fascinatingly, two of these games - Fez and Journey - featured no combat whatsoever, while The Walking Dead was about one per cent combat. And yet in many cases they took top honours over such triple-A blockbusters as Mass Effect 3, Black Ops 2 and Dishonored.
These combat-free games were not only critical successes, but commercial ones too. As of January, The Walking Dead had sold over 8.5 million episodes, raking in more than $40 million in sales. Journey topped PSN's charts in its release month and - amazingly - nine months later in December. Fez didn't do as well, but it still sold a not-too-shabby 100,000 copies in its first couple of months and will more than likely sell boatloads more when it comes to Steam in May. These numbers may not set the world on fire, but with sequels like Dead Space 3 failing to ignite the charts, the distance between these experimental indies and the bombastic behemoths is starting to close.
These aren't the only fan-favourites without fighting. Aside from the Portal series, indie offerings like Dear Esther, The Unfinished Swan and Thirty Flights of Loving managed to find a sizeable fan base.
Chris Donlan made an excellent point about Thirty Flights, noting that it makes you collect guns and ammo only to deviate from your expectations by allowing your avatar, Agent Abel, to handle the shootouts off-screen while you merely look around and drink in the jazzy tale. Instead of offering you an actual shootout - which enough games already do - it offers something better: a surprise. By stripping the game of guns, its designer Brendon Chung has to come up with other ways to engage the player. In that particular case, plopping them into quick, snappy slices of a comic crime caper was enough.
A dude sitting on a log: more interesting than shooting more space pirates?
Importantly, it's not just indie art house designers that are going this route, but also big developers that have a history with violent games. Take Bulletstorm creative lead Adrian Chmielarz, for example. After working on the hilariously profane gib-fest that is Bulletstorm, followed by Epic's chainsaw-sodomising prequel Gear of War: Judgment, they decided to leave the company they started, People Can Fly, to pursue a combat-less "weird fiction horror" game, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.
Starbreeze, the developer behind such shockingly violent titles as The Darkness, The Chronicles of Riddick and Syndicate, has at least temporarily eschewed its penchant for bullets and bloodshed in its upcoming fairy tale-esque digital download, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Elsewhere, the ex-BioShock 2 devs at The Fullbright Company have splintered off to make their own first-person urban exploration mystery, Gone Home.
So what's going on here? I asked The Fullbright Company co-founder Steve Gaynor what inspired them to make a game with no fighting after working on a blockbuster about a dude with a drill for an arm. They noted that combat is "expensive to make, and make well. A small team (in our case, four people) is not well equipped to make combat that would be as good as the big-budget competition. So whether we'd wanted to do it or not, it wasn't really an option. I think that's true for a lot of indies. You have to figure out how else to make your game interesting.
"But the bigger thing is that we wanted the freedom to explore a story and a kind of experience that you really can't have if the game revolves around combat. Gone Home is about exploring a normal family's house and discovering the believable, everyday drama of these people's lives. There are no ghosts, no zombies, no serial killers or aliens. Modern normalcy is not the kind of theme we could explore if we had to figure out some excuse for wasting a bunch of enemies. Forgoing combat allowed us to make a game that it would have been impossible to make otherwise."
Even big name publishers are noticing this craving for a less murderous experience that's easier to relate to. I can't help but find it noteworthy when a curio like Jonathon Blow's first-person puzzler The Witness is a major selling point for the PS4 at Sony's press conference (even if it was preceeded by a new Killzone).
I want to make it clear that there's a distinction between violence and combat. Games without combat can still be plenty violent, such as The Walking Dead. Games without violence can still have combat, a la Super Mario. I have no problem with either of these, but I think people tend to think that games have to be violent simply because shooting, slashing and fighting things is fun. And of course, in many cases it is - I wouldn't want to live in a world without Hotline Miami or Revengeance. But it's not the only way to make a game fun, and we're finally getting past the notion that a game without traditional combat mechanics is automatically relegated to casual fare like FarmVille or a hidden object game.
Games without fighting aren't inherently better than those that focus on it, and action games and shooters aren't going anywhere in the near future (I should hope not, anyway) - but we're finding that critics and audiences alike are hungry for more diverse experiences and developers are stepping up to the challenge. Despite how it may look at trade shows, I don't think the industry is in danger of stagnating amid all the testosterone-driven slaughtering fantasy fuel. Quite the reverse.
Raif Badawi has been given 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes to be carried out over 20 weeks
A Saudi blogger convicted of insulting Islam was brought after Friday prayers to a public square in the port city of Jeddah and flogged 50 times before hundreds of spectators, a witness to the lashing said.
The witness said Raif Badawi's feet and hands were shackled during the flogging but their face was visible. They remained silent and did not cry out, said the witness, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity fearing government reprisal.
Badawi was sentenced last May to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. They had criticized Saudi Arabia's powerful clerics on a liberal blog they founded. The blog has since been shut down. They were also ordered to pay a fine of 1m riyals or about $266,600.
Rights activists say Saudi authorities are using Badawi's case as a warning to others who think to criticise the kingdom's powerful religious establishment from which the ruling family partly derives its authority.
London-based Amnesty International said they would receive 50 lashes once a week for 20 weeks. The US, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, has called on authorities to cancel the punishment.
Despite international pleas for their release, Badawi, a father of three, was brought from prison by bus to the public square on Friday and flogged on the back in front of a crowd that had just finished midday prayers at a nearby mosque. Their face was visible and, throughout the flogging, they clenched their eyes and remained silent, said the witness.
The witness, who also has close knowledge of the case, said the lashing lasted about 15 minutes.
Badawi has been held since mid-2012 after they founded the Free Saudi Liberals blog. They used it to criticise the kingdom's influential clerics who follow a strict, conservative interpretation of Islam known as Wahhabism, which originated in Saudi Arabia.
They were originally sentenced in 2013 to seven years in prison and 600 lashes in relation to the charges, but after an appeal the judge stiffened the punishment. Following their arrest, their wife and children left the kingdom for Canada.
Right groups argue that the case against Badawi is part of a wider crackdown on freedom of speech and dissent in Saudi Arabia since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Criticism of clerics is seen as a red line because of their prestige in the kingdom, as well as their influential role in supporting government policies.
According to Amnesty the charges against Badawi mention their failure to remove articles by other people on their website. They were also accused in court of ridiculing Saudi Arabia's morality police.
In a statement after the flogging Amnesty called it a “vicious act of cruelty” and said Badawi's “only ‘crime' was to exercise their right to freedom of expression by setting up a website for public discussion”.
The US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki called the punishment an “inhumane” response to someone exercising their right to freedom of expression and religion.
In New York, Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general, told reporters on Friday that the UN human rights office was “very concerned about the flogging” and had previously raised concerns about harsh sentences in Saudi Arabia for human rights defenders.
It seems that the real members of the fictional band “Alvin and the Chipmunks” who starred in the 80's Saturday morning cartoon aren't too happy about the news of the robbery yesterday and also the existence of a film franchise that people in the real world seem to hate a lot of the time.
“When we first saw the news on the new site that someone had gotten blamed for stealing money off from a stock market and ended up in the hands to the film counterparts of the chipmunks, I was shocked and confused.” David Saville said to the press.
Simon responded to this situation, “I'm confused, Alvin, Theodore and I thought we have an album contract that will make our comeback as a band, we didn't know we have signed a contract to make a movie series that centers loosely on our lives, it's an outrage!”
Alvin takes responsibility of the current situation that has been happening, “Look, folks, I know our fans hated the films and so do I, too; that's why I decided to sue those filmmakers and also the stars of the film because they had no right to ruin our reputation.”
Meanwhile, in Hollywood, The film counterparts had responded rather aggressively to the lawsuit.
“I'm getting sued because I ruined their reputation? Kiss my a**!” as Rad Alvin replied to the press while being drunk, “I don't f**king care about that ***damn lawsuit, I have the friggin money from that dumb stupid f**cking bunny that they had gotten for us.”
Theo Fatboy explains how they could use the money, “If we lose the lawsuit, we got it covered, plus the fact that we got a lifetime supply of crack so I would become the world's fattest chipmunk in the entire f**king planet.”
The Court Trial of the lawsuit will happen around the same day Judy Hopp's Trial on February 14th.
More details of the Scandal continues as it develops throughout the month.

The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni made the decision to recall Maurizio Massari after two days of negotiations between Egyptian and Italian investigators in Rome regarding the slaying of 28-year-old Regeni failed to yield any concrete results.
Egyptian officials handed over records of telephone conversations of two of Regeni's Italian friends, who were staying in Cairo when they went missing, as well as the photos taken on the day their body was found, said the Italian prosecutor in charge of the case.
During the meetings in Rome, Italy had demanded thousands of phone records to investigate the murder, which Egypt's assistant state prosecutor Mostafa Suleiman said was a demand that "violates the Egyptian constitution".
Suleiman, who headed the Egyptian team that visited Rome, said the Italian investigators "conditioned further judicial cooperation on this demand" which their team flatly refused.
Suleiman said the Italian investigators also demanded CCTV footage of the area from where Regeni had disappeared. They said the footage had been automatically deleted by then.
The statement said Egyptians believe that a xenophobic criminal gang, whose members were also shot dead last month during a police counter-terrorism operation, was responsible for the abduction and subsequent slaying of Regeni.
The Italian prosecutor “reiterated their conviction that there are no elements to directly link the gang to the torture and death” of the 28-year-old Italian student.
Regeni disappeared on January 25th as they were conducting research on Egyptian labor movements. The disappearance took place as Egyptians were marking the fifth anniversary of the 2011 popular uprising that led to the overthrow of former dictator Hosni Mubarak after almost 30 years in power.
The Italian student's corpse was found near a Cairo highway on February 3rd. An autopsy carried out by Italian coroners discovered signs of “protracted” torture over several days, and that Regeni apparently lost their lives on February 1st or 2nd.
Last week, Regeni's parents urged Italian officials to declare Egypt "unsafe" for citizens from the south-central European country to visit, saying their son was only one of many torture victims in Egypt.
The Egyptian government has been cracking down on any opposition since Muslim Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsi was ousted in a military coup led by former military chief and current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in July 2013.
Sisi has been accused of leading the suppression of Morsi supporters, as hundreds of them have been killed in clashes with Egyptian security forces over the past year.
Human rights groups say the army's crackdown on the supporters of Morsi has led to the deaths of over 1,400 people and the arrest of 22,000 others, including some 200 people who have been sentenced to death in mass trials.
The UN Human Rights Council has repeatedly expressed concern over the Egyptian security forces' heavy-handed crackdown and the killing of anti-government protesters.
Even With Kevin Durant, The Warriors Probably Won't Win 73 Games Again But they give them a better chance at a championship.
Kevin Durant announced Monday that they were leaving the “comfort zone” of Oklahoma City and joining the team with the best record in the NBA: the 73-win Golden State Warriors.
Durant is expected to sign a two-year, $54.3 million contract with an opt-out after the first year, making them the highest-paid player in the league. Technically, this still hinges on the Warriors clearing some space to fit them within their salary cap, but for our purposes let's assume the other 29 NBA teams don't pull off the mass collusion necessary to block it. They could have signed for five years and $153 million in Oklahoma City, or four years and $114 million in Golden State, but the 1+1 deal makes them eligible for a much bigger contract after next season ($163 million to $177 million in total over the five-year period, according to ESPN Stats & Information Group's estimate) because Durant reaches a milestone for service time after next season. Stars like Durant will probably never be paid what they're truly worth, but this structure goes part of the way to covering the difference.
FiveThirtyEight's CARMELO player projections expect Durant's play to fall off just the slightest bit — it's actually dropped their “category” from “MVP Candidate” to “All-Star.” At age 28 next seasons, Durant will be at the age where some players begin a gradual decline, and CARMELO is still worried about their 2014-15 campaign, when they missed most of the season because of injury.
Still, they project to have the seventh-most wins above replacement in the league over the next five seasons, with 40.0 WAR. Over those same five years, Harrison Barnes — the guy whose job Durant is taking — projects to produce just 13.1 WAR. (Andrew Bogut, who will likely be traded to make room for Durant, comes out to 12.5 WAR over that stretch.)
Just how good might the Warriors be with Durant on the roster?
As we've seen with Kevin Love over the past two seasons, not all stats are portable from team to team, but Durant's numbers come with the certainty of having been stress-tested in deep playoff runs, whereas Love had never played in the postseason before arriving in Cleveland. Intuitively, it might seem as though you take a 73-win team, add another superstar to it, and wind up with a win total in the stratosphere, somewhere in the mid-to-high 70s.
In practice, however, it might be hard for the Warriors to equal their 73-win benchmark from last season, even with Durant on the team.
One reason is simple reversion to the mean. Of the 10 previous teams to win at least 67 games during the regular season, all but one saw their win total decline in the next season, falling to an average of 60.5 wins from 68.1 the previous season. The Warriors already showed some signs of mean-reversion in the playoffs, with a season-ending Elo rating of 1756, a championship-worthy but not all-time-great figure.
Another question is diminishing returns. How much value can a high-usage player like Durant realistically add to what was already perhaps the most efficient offense in NBA history? The Miami Heat made four straight NBA Finals during the LeBron Big Three era, but imperfect offensive fits between the stars and a necessarily thin bench kept regular-season win totals far lower than most expected.
Finally, there's the issue of depth. If, as anticipated, Andrew Bogut is traded, and Barnes and Festus Ezeli are let go, the Warriors will have only six players with a material amount of NBA experience signed to a contract: Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston.
If we use CARMELO to project the Warriors on the basis of these six players only (see here for details on the methodology), assuming they'll fill the rest of their minutes with replacement-level players, we wind up with a projected record of 66-16. That would be one of the better records in NBA history, but nonetheless a seven-win decline from last year.

The Warriors, however, have a knack for finding bench talent — and talented bench players have a knack for finding teams like the Warriors who give them a chance at a championship ring — so they'll probably add a few more wins to that baseline once the roster is filled out.
And the real impact could be in the playoffs, where the Warriors will benefit from stealing Durant from the Thunder, one of their foremost conference rivals. And the Durant announcement came on the same day it was reported that the San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan was “leaning strongly” toward retirement.
That's all for another day, though. For now, it doesn't have to be that deep. Here's Barnes's shot chart this past season season, via StatMuse:
And here's Durant's:
The Warriors are getting Kevin Durant, and Kevin Durant is still a beast.
CORRECTION (July 4, 6:15 p.m.): An earlier version of this article erroneously referred to Jason Thompson as being under contract with the Warriors. Thompson was waived by the team in February.
Alcohol abuse is one of the biggest health problems in the EU. Alcohol is highly addictive, highly toxic, and does unrivalled damage to society. In men aged 16-54, alcohol is the number one killer in the UK 1. In 2012, the UK saw over a million hospital admissions due to alcohol. Alcohol abuse currently costs EU countries around €125 billion a year – over 1% of these countries' GDPs. In 2010, Professor David Nutt and a panel of experts ranked alcohol as the most harmful drug in the country, in terms of both its harm to users and others 2. Alcohol addiction is powerful, dangerous and deadly.
Ironically, hope for treating alcoholism could lie in a drug that the UK Home Office regards as one of the most dangerous in existence; LSD. After its discovery as a psychedelic drug in the 1960s, LSD was used by therapists who thought its effects could help treat problems like depression and addiction 3. When LSD was classed as an illegal drug, its use in therapy dwindled, and research into its potentially healing properties was stifled.
Although LSD research is still possible today, it's extremely expensive and highly restricted; costs increase tenfold compared to trials on unrestricted compounds, and jumping the necessary hurdles can take many years. Before LSD was made illegal, a considerable amount of research was published in the ‘60s and early ‘70s, when it was still easy to obtain and therapists were convinced of its medical value. Recently, two scientists decided to look back on six of these studies to see if there is really any merit in using LSD as a treatment for alcoholism 4.
Krebs & Johansen found six randomised controlled trials from the ‘60s and ‘70s that used LSD to treat alcoholism. They analysed the accuracy and design of the trials, to ensure that there was no experimenter bias or messy science. They then attempted to merge the results of the six trials, to see if LSD really did help patients recover from alcoholism.
The six trials were mostly similar; they had all recruited alcoholics who were looking for treatment, the participants had no underlying mental health conditions, and patients were randomised into control or treatment groups. The studies varied in how LSD was administered; dose varied from 200-800 micrograms. Participants also received variable support throughout the experiment, with some having access to psychotherapy during the experience, and others being given very little information about LSD's effects and left without any guidance.
All the studies measured the participant's alcoholism in similar ways, using tests of alcohol dependence and misuse. Pooling the results from these six studies, Krebs & Johansen found that LSD treatment significantly reduced participant's alcohol misuse, and improved participant's attempts at abstinence from alcohol, compared to control groups. Overall, 59% of participants who had undergone LSD treatment improved in alcohol misuse scores, compared to 38% of control participants, which was highly statistically significant. After six months, 40% of LSD treated participants had abstained from alcohol, compared to only 28% of control participants; again, a highly significant result. After 12 months, the effects had mostly worn off, with participants returning to control group levels of alcohol misuse; but this initial benefit of LSD treatment on alcoholism is considerably greater than any currently available treatment!
There's something remarkable about this meta-analysis; despite these six trials having drastically different approaches to LSD administration (one trial just strapped participants to a bed without even explaining what LSD is), they all showed that LSD treatment has a positive effect on alcoholism. Although the effects only lasted a year, it's possible that more frequent and more controlled LSD-assisted psychotherapy could produce a prolonged recovery from alcoholism.
It's also possible that other psychedelics could help in the treatment of addiction; Salvia divinorum has anti-addictive effects in rats 5, psilocybin has been shown to help heavy smokers quit 6, and ayahuasca users are less likely to suffer from alcoholism 7. The field of psychedelic research is looking increasingly bountiful.
The UK's most dangerous drug is alcohol. But the non-toxic, non-harmful drug that could cure our alcohol problems is among the most highly illegal. Can you imagine a future society where this is still the case? Regardless of your opinion of LSD, clearly it deserves further research. We can only hope our future society will look back on this time as a medical renaissance, not as a self-harming dark age.

The UX of a Banana — Understanding What UX Design is All About
Megan Wilson Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 21, 2017
UX Designer to UX Designer, have you ever noticed the irony of describing what UX design is? At a recent cocktail party, I spoke over our fancy pink drinks towards the confused face looking back at me and realized that this, this very moment, was a terrible UX.
Being the diligent UX designer I am, I decided to design a method of describing UX that, in itself, provides a good UX for my audience.
Introducing “The UX of a Banana — Understanding What UX Design is All About”.
Feel free to steal this explanation for your next UX small talk. It's the UX description that avoids the technical jargon, gets the point across and is entertaining too. Go bananas.
The UX of a Banana
There's a lot of fruit in the produce aisle, but if any one type of fruit was designed by Mother Nature for the user experience, it would have to be the banana.
A banana tastes good and is good for you, but there are other factors of its design that add to this optimal experience of snacking.
The color of a Banana makes it easy to know it is ready.
Most of us will use our eyes to observe a banana long before we smell, touch, or taste it. Just by looking at a banana, there's no question of if it's ready or not. Bananas have a built-in accurate visual cue. You don't have to waste time questioning or testing to see if it is ready because it is designed to be obvious.
They're green before they're ready, they're brown once they're past their prime, but that bright yellow peel means it's at its best flavor and ready to eat.
A Banana can be eaten when and wherever.
Not only does the peel of the banana show when it's ready to be eaten, the peel also makes it super easy to take on the go and eat when you want.
Bananas are mobile. The peel is thick and protects the fruit and when it is time to eat the banana, it peels easily without tools. To eat a banana, you don't have to carry around a cutting board and knife.
Bananas are not messy. You don't have to wash them before you eat them and they don't leave your hands a mess either. And neither the peel nor the fruit will stain you or your clothes.
Bananas are easy to eat.
Once peeled, eating a banana is a seamless experience because there is nothing else in the way. There are no hidden seeds, a pit in the middle, or a core to work around.
Biting into a banana is a comfortable and effortless experience. The user can enjoy every bite knowing there is only good flavor and good nutrition to come.
Bananas are widely available and have meaningful effects.
Bananas are grown on every continent and are available worldwide, all year long and are inexpensive, making them accessible to just about everyone.
Bananas are the only fruit containing the amino acid tryptophan and vitamin B6 which help produce serotonin. Serotonin alleviates depression which means that bananas can literally make you happy.
And there's also this bonus “feature” when you press directly on the end of a banana: it naturally splits into perfect thirds. It's a little like finding one of those Google Easter Eggs designed for no other reason than for you to enjoy.
Comparing Bananas to Other Fruit
Other fruit have their advantages, but when it comes to the entire experience… they all have some fault making them not quite as nice as the banana.
Sure, there are fruits much prettier than bananas, but being aesthetically pleasing is a different kind of design.
There are also fruits that have better nutritional value, but if nutrition were the only important part we might as well just take a vitamin.
And there are definitely fruits that taste better than bananas, but taste is just one sense to experience a piece of fruit.
UX design is about the entire experience from start to finish of consuming the product.
Watermelons, cantaloupe, and honeydew are large and heavy. Just bringing them from the store is a chore.
The range of berries all are small, but so delicate you need proper containers to transport them.
Apples, pears, plums and peaches — if we're not talking about their seeds, don't forget you have to clean them before the first bite.
The entire line up of citrus fruits are mess. Pomegranates are a pain to prepare. Do I need to go on?
Relating Banana UX to Tech
Some UX designers work offline, but the majority of us work with digital products.
The human-computer interaction or HCI has dramatically improved over the last ten, five, or even the last year in large part because of UX designers. If you navigate through an app or website with a smile on your face, there's probably a UX designer out there who created the interface specifically for that reaction.
The job requires that we understand the capabilities of the product, how the user will naturally act with the technology and connect the two with strategic design thinking.
The unwanted popup after you already signed up? That's spitting out a seed.
But when a popup has the information you need in the exact moment you need it, that's “Banana UX.”

On the campaign trail and on the web, Rick Perry touts a supposedly sterling record on transparency. But the facts don't back them up. Last week, their office settled an ethics complaint accusing their campaign of hiding the fact that it spent hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of campaign contributions spent on party supplies for the governor's mansion. That wasn't an isolated incident, Politico reports:
Though other states have email retention policies sometimes calling for deletion after 30 or 45 days, Texas's seven-day period is possibly the briefest…The policy, a holdover from former President George W. Bush's gubernatorial administration in Texas, calls on staffers to print out emails that might be covered by the Texas Public Information Act, but there's no check on their judgment. Perry also has refused to release a range of existing records that have been made public by both their predecessors in Texas and by governors of other states, including their daily schedule, their office's reviews of death penalty cases—even lists of guests who stayed overnight at the governor's mansion. Bush not only released lists of overnight guests at the governor's mansion during their governorship, including big donors, but during their 2000 presidential campaign, they released 3,125 pages of records detailing almost their entire schedule. It included everything from meetings with lobbyists and donors, to time spent reviewing death penalty cases, to their workout breaks.
Perry has also sought to keep secret their cozy ties with big donors, as well as details of past budget negotiations. This summer, the state legislature gave them an assist by passing a bill that will delay the release of information on their security detail's travel records until after the 2012 election.
So does Perry think they have an openness problem? “I think we give so much information already that it is boring,” they said last October. Information-overload isn't the issue. Perry doesn't seem to get the basic point that destroying any traceable record of their public life suggests that they have something to hide.
Former governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura dropped by Business Insider to talk about their new book, "Jesse Ventura's Marijuana Manifesto."
The former Navy SEAL is embroiled in a lawsuit they brought against the estate of deceased "American Sniper" author Chris Kyle. In their best-selling book, Kyle alleged that they physically assaulted a person they refer to in the book as "Scruff Face," after making offensive comments about the elite special-forces unit. Kyle later said that "Scruff Face" was indeed Ventura.
Ventura said the incident never occurred, and they sued Kyle for defamation. A Minnesota court ruled in Ventura's favor and awarded them $1.8 million in damages, but an appeals court threw out the verdict. Ventura now plans to seek a new trial with the US Supreme Court.
We asked Ventura if they think Kyle should be remembered as a hero.Follow BI Video:On Twitter
Historic first under Duterte Presidency: PH ready to export corn 55535 SHARES Share it! Share Tweet
By MB Online
For the first time in history, the Philippines is ready to export corn to neighboring countries as corn harvests this year will breach the 5.6-million tons domestic requirement, according to Agriculture Secretary Manny Piñol.
National Corn Program coordinator, Asst. Secretary Federico Laciste reported that in spite of the series of natural calamities which hit the country recently, including the 7-month El Niño, yellow and white corn harvest for 2017 is expected to hit 8.1-million metric tons.
The production of Cassava, which is lumped with corn in the animal feeds category, is seen to reach 570,000 metric tons and this will contribute further in stabilizing the corn and animal feeds supply in the Philippines.
This is the first time that the Philippines will achieve a 120% corn sufficiency.

“I don't believe there's anything wrong with you.”
The psychiatrist's words pierced like a bullet. Months of suppressed grief became fat, heaving sobs and one defeated plea, “why are you doing this to me?”, before I ran out and collapsed at my husband's feet. We'd been cut loose, left alone to career through my delirium. What could we do now?
At the height of my illness, I remember the smell of the bubble bath, how its sweetness crawled up my nostrils as I sat in the 10 inches of water I'd been permitted: jasmine, ylang ylang, shea butter. My mother had been summoned, and I'd been placed there for safekeeping while the phone calls were made, in the hastily mummy-proofed room, where any sharp object had been quickly bagged and removed. The baby's cries came up through the floorboards, as did the quieter, heavy sobs of a grown man, my husband. I was a prisoner, with a thunder in my chest and a voice in my head – once a solitary whisper, which had multiplied and was now cacophonous. Arguing. Sibilant. Indecipherable. Perfectly still, I lay flecked with goosebumps.
In days, I'd gone from being a happy mother, high on my new arrival, to a husk, torpid and terrified of my own breath passing my lips. I was suffering from postpartum psychosis: postnatal depression's bigger, uglier brother, which occurs in about one in every 1,000 women. It's a severe mental illness that robs you of reason and your grasp on reality, all too often with tragic consequences.
Two years previously, I'd endured it after the birth of twins, for close to 18 months: the obsessive thoughts, compulsions and detachment, the vigilant night watch that robbed me of sleep, and the unshakeable belief that my babies were about to die, that my blood was clotting in my veins and would kill me any minute. My memories of their early years are stained with fear and dread. I'd approached my GP about my mental health during my subsequent pregnancy, but they went little further than a quick screening and assurances that I'd be fine because I was “well now”.
A few hours before that bath, I'd climbed out of bed to feed my new son. A baby, allergic to milk, including my own, and battling reflux, who seemed to exist only to cry and vomit incessantly. Sleep hadn't found me since the previous feed. Tiredness sat heavy in my bones, and my mind had glitched, with one obsessive phrase on a loop: “Give them back.” They weighed nothing, but lifting the 6lbs of struggling confusion took every ounce of effort I could muster.
I prepared the special formula, fed him, traced their tiny face with my fingers, inhaled their cotton-wool hair, kissed them between the eyes, and settled them to sleep. I'd tried to sing, but only broken croaks escaped as the salt water dripped on to their blankets.
I left the house in the middle of the night, barefoot and in pyjamas, intent on ending my life. Living was beyond me. I didn't recognise my mind. My reality had been inverted, and I was trapped with a hostile imposter filling my head with constant noise, images and impulses.
The mother and baby unit I ended up in was one of only two in Scotland, and found space for me among the handful of beds. Decorated in inoffensive pastels, there were home-like touches for the oblivious babies and their mums, who floated around like ghosts in baggy shirts with unwashed hair. Despite the best efforts of the staff, sadness clung to the walls as much as it did to us. My son smiled for the first time on the playmat as I lay prostrate on a sofa staring through the television, wishing for sleep and to not wake up.
There were interviews and helping hands, then, a mix-up. The staff were concerned I was feigning illness for sympathy, and making my baby ill for attention. We were abruptly discharged, and bounced to the clinical psychiatrist at another hospital. The assessment was that, despite previous serious postnatal depression, I was a malingerer taking everyone in. I was accused of manipulating hormone results through expressing the milk my baby couldn't have, in order to gain treatment. Eighteen months of paediatric gastroenterology and endocrinological sleuthing would finally lay this accusation to rest. In the meantime, we tried to rebuild our lives, but couldn't. Without support, we had no idea how to put the pieces of a normal life back together. I watched the people close to me melt away.
When it comes to physical symptoms you can see them, test them and treat them. But if you're a new mother, paralysed by fear and suffocated by despair, you had better convince the doctors. Asking for help isn't always enough. Psychosis doesn't live up to its Hollywood image; instead it's often a silent erosion of your own existence, which makes it hard to spot. When delusions and reality blend so seamlessly, you don't have the self-awareness to shout out. The voices are your reality. And the toxic thoughts. You become caged inside yourself so abruptly that you simply cannot find the fortitude to reach out.
When one in five women suffer from mental illness during and after pregnancy, our screening has to get a lot better than overworked health visitors and midwives handing out questionnaires. Those at risk must be noticed and supported effectively during pregnancy, and after birth. There are just 20 specialist mother and baby units in the UK, each with only a few beds and many mothers needing long-term help. That leaves thousands of women scrambling in the dark, and struggling to cope with hands-off, outpatient treatment.
Acute mental illness is an emergency that needs responsive care. When all eyes are on a beautiful baby, too often we forget to look at the mother.

The photo above was posted recently to JQP Facebook as a means of commenting on the exorbitant waste of the Air Force's multiple annual gatherings of its grand poobahs. Their gatherings, nicknamed “Corona” conferences, drain money, time, focus, and manpower from an already depleted Air Force in order to swaddle the service's generals in the comfort of Earthly deification as they absorb formal dinners and presentations adding marginal value but inflating their already bloated sense of self-importance.
See also this article from April, which gives factual foundation to claims of egregious manpower abuse associated with this event.
Not long after this photo was posted, a couple of commenters started dropping truth bombs. To whit:
and
In response to one of these posts, the individual's active duty Air Force chain of command, based at Wright-Patterson, placed them under investigation, barred them from their workplace, and ordered them to cease commenting on JQP.
To that chain of command, we offer the following proposition: lift the unlawful orders, cease the extra-legal and abusive investigation, and allow your airmen to freely offer their personal opinions on social media without fear of reprisal. Do those things, and we we'll simply move along to the next story while watching to ensure you exercise appropriate restraint in the future. Do them not, and we will expose you by name here on these pages, along with every detail of your actions and how they deviate beyond the bounds of your authority.
Corona is a monument of the waste and self-importance indulged by generals drunk on the trappings of positional authority. Corona is an excuse for self-importance on the taxpayer dime … and a justification to turn working Air Force professionals into waitstaff. For too long, it's been the generals' way of reminding everyone who is in charge. We say let them do that by leading effectively instead of this nonsense.
At any rate, airmen who speak the truth about what they've observed with respect to Corona must face no reprisal. To the extent they do, the abusers must and will be held to account. If not by the chain of command, then by public means.

Backpackers reveal stories of sexual assault, exploitation while working on Australian farms
Updated
The mother of a young woman murdered at a Queensland hostel has been inundated with "horror stories" from backpackers trying to complete their 88 days of farm work.
Key points: Mother of murdered backpacker gathering complaints from travellers working on Australian farms
Backpacker working in north Queensland says they were lured to hostel with promise of work that took weeks to eventuate
Backpacker in Bowen says hostel owner found 'sly ways' to touch female workers
Another in Bundaberg lost their thumb in an accident on first day at job
Rosie Ayliffe is campaigning for reform of what they say is a flawed visa scheme that puts young lives at risk.
Them daughter Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, was murdered last August while undertaking the rural work required to get a one-year extension to their 417 visa.
Ms Ayliffe has spent the past few months gathering stories from backpackers who have travelled to Australia and experienced the "dark side" of an industry that is crucial to the agricultural sector.
Although many backpackers have enjoyable, positive experiences on the 88-day farm work scheme, many others complain of financial, sexual and psychological abuse.
Ms Ayliffe, an English teacher from Derbyshire in the UK, has heard claims of rent rip-offs, sexual assault and false promises of work.
Four of the backpackers who have been in touch with them shared their stories with Australian Story.
'I remember screaming for them to stop': Chelsey's story
Age: 30
Nationality: Canadian
Last year, after struggling to find work, Canadian backpacker Chelsey was offered a job on a grape farm in Mildura.
"The first day was alright, but then the farmer started to make comments about how great I would look in leggings," they said.
The farmer was driving Chelsey back to their hostel one night when they lunged across the seat towards them
Chelsey jumped out of the car, falling backwards into a ditch and the farmer climbed on top of them
"I crossed my legs, had my arms covering me. They were reaching to undo their pants and that was when I just started punching and kicking as hard as I could," they said.
"I just remember screaming for them to stop."
The ordeal came to a sudden end when the farmer stood up and walked back to their car.
"At that point I was in the middle of nowhere — I didn't really have a choice other than to get back in the truck with them and hope that they drove me all the way home," Chelsey said.
"We travelled in complete silence back to the hostel and when they left I just crumbled."
Chelsey reported the incident, however, they said police did not pursue charges because it was "her word against his".
"He had scratches and bruises and a black eye. The police asked him, 'why do you have a black eye?' And their excuse was that I just reached over and just punched them in the face when they were driving me home," Chelsey said.
Late last year police informed Chelsey that another female backpacker claimed they had been sexually assaulted by the same farmer.
This time police pressed charges and in May the man pleaded guilty and was convicted of sexual assault.
Chelsey hopes that by telling their story they will encourage other backpackers to speak out. They would like to see a central register of farms and hostels that are licensed where backpackers can go knowing they will be safe.

'The rooms were like prison cells': Djuro's story
Age: 26
Nationality: Danish
Djuro Vukotic had high hopes for their working holiday in Australia.
"My idea of Australia must be back from when I was 10 years old — it was like Steve Irwin, right?" they said.
"Australian people, very nice nature, kind. And I imagined the farm work, it must be a similar experience."
Djuro said they were not afraid of hard work, but their efforts to find jobs had been thwarted by a system they say is broken.
"You're having these working hostels that are connected to the farm, so you're not able to find the farm work without going into the working hostels," they said.
"So there's a chain that is connected here and that chain is very, very rusty."
On one occasion Djuro travelled to a town in Queensland after a hostel owner promised them work.
Five weeks later they were still waiting for work, but in the meantime had to pay $200 a week for a bed in a shared room in what they say was sub-standard accommodation.
They have worked on farms where toilet breaks are not allowed, where drones are used to monitor workers and where farmers are verbally abusive.
They spoke of one hostel in Shepparton and the pear-picking job that came with it.
"The rooms were like prison cells. People were freezing during the night," Djuro said.
"We would get paid $33 for a full bin. That's 10 hours of work — I was earning $90 and I'm not a slow worker — I'm usually the faster worker."
Djuro is angry with the way they and their fellow travellers are treated by some farms and hostels.
"We as backpackers should unite and actually stand up to make a difference here. And it has to start from the government because the government requires you to do the 88 days," they said.
'He would rub up against us': Jo-Anne's story
Age: 22
Nationality: British
Jo-Anne Cooke had a positive experience when they undertook their 88 days of farm work at a large berry picking operation in Queensland. They were paid the minimum wage and completed their 88 days in exactly that time.
They wanted to make some extra money, so they recently travelled with friends to do farm work in Bowen.
"I went through the Harvest Trail site, which is government-run, and rang up one of the listed hostels. When we got there the farm work that they promised didn't materialise," they said.
"We had to pay to stay there but there were no jobs. And they had promised us that there would be. Instead they asked us to work around the hostel for $15 an hour but it would come off our rent."
Although Jo-Anne is angry at the financially exploitative practises, it was the sexually predatory behaviour of the hostel owner that most upset them
"He would find sly ways to touch the girls; they would rub up against us," they said.
"When we were in the showers, which had half see-through glass, they would come in on some excuse that they had an urgent message to deliver."
Then there was the condition of the hostel itself. The owner asked some of the young men staying at the hostel to dig holes for a new fence but a local man alerted them to the presence of asbestos.
Jo-Anne says the hostel owner claimed the asbestos was harmless, but when they overheard them talking about calling the council, they immediately arranged for the area to be concreted over.
'The pain was excruciating': Marcel's story
Age: 31
Nationality: German
Marcel Weiser arrived in Australia late last year and was keen to complete 88 days of regional work.
They went to work on a sweet potato farm in Bundaberg but on their first day on the job lost their left thumb in an accident.
"I was trying to remove a potato and heard a crunch and it was the sound of my thumb caught in the machinery," they said.
"The machine had been switched off but was switched on again very quickly and my hand was trapped. When I pulled out my hand my left thumb was missing."
Marcel, who is left handed, says the accident could have been avoided had there been adequate supervision and training.
"I had never done this sort of work before and we were given no more than a 15 or 30 second safety induction. I was told that straight after my accident a farm supervisor gave the workers a 20 minute talk and told everybody specifically where not to put their hands," they said.
Two months later Marcel returned to the farm to complete their 88 days and says the owners were very supportive.
However, they suffered panic attacks from being back at the farm where the accident occurred, ongoing pain from their injury and was unable to continue working.
'We need backpackers more than they need us'
As well as meeting with backpackers, Ms Ayliffe questioned politicians on the way the 417 visa farm-work scheme is run.
One politician they met was Liberal senator Linda Reynolds, part of a cross-party committee looking into modern-day slavery.
"Most employers do the right thing," Senator Reynolds said.
"They pay them well and they sign off after 88 days. But there are some unscrupulous employers who are abusing these young backpackers because they know they need to get their signature."
Senator Reynolds said backpackers were doing jobs Australians would not do anymore, so there was a responsibility to ensure a positive experience.
"The bottom line is, we need them more than they need us," they said.
Between a quarter and a third of the agricultural workforce in Australia is provided by backpacker labour.
Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association chairperson Allan Mahoney said they had spent a decade fighting for the rights of backpackers and took their duty to look after young visitors to their farm seriously.
"When our backpackers are on our farms they are ours," they said.
"We've got to look after someone else's children so you do your best and so do [other] compliant growers".

CRUMBLING walls. Breathtaking temples. Mysterious cities built entirely underground.
They are the astounding feats of architecture that have been left to decay for centuries.
But while they may be in ruins, the sites of the world's most ancient and intriguing cities continue to wow travellers.
From the popular Machu Picchu site in Peru, to the Pompeii ruins and the lesser-known Derinkuyu site in Turkey, here are eight amazing ruined cities that remain shrouded in mystery - or remain perplexing to this day, according to the science website io9.com.
One thing's for sure, the world is a fascinating place.
1. Palenque, Mexico
One of the biggest - and best-preserved - of the Maya city-states, Palenque is full of temples, palaces and marketplaces that researchers believe date back to around 600-900 AD. Nobody is sure why the Maya civilisation was destroyed, and its great cities such as Palenque abandoned, but theories include war and famine. The decayed site has been restored and is a popular tourist spot.
In pictures: Weird and wonderful sites
Amazing alien landscapes
Derinkuyu, Turkey
The largest and deepest of 200 underground cities in the Cappadocia region, this eerie location was home to approximately 20,000 people (plus livestock, a church, school and kitchen). The inhabitants dug tunnels and rooms beneath their homes in the soft volcanic rock.
The city reportedly grew to 85 metres and 11 levels deep. It is believed to date back to the early Byzantine Empire, as early as the 7th-8th centuries.
People fled to the area to find safety from anti-Christian Romans, bandits, and later on, anti-Christian Muslims. Huge rocks were rolled across the entrances, with air shafts letting fresh air in. It was sealed up at some point after the 10th century but reopened in 1969.
Catalhoyuk, Turkey
Believed to be one of the world's earliest urban settlements, thousands of people called Catalhoyuk home in 7400BC - 6200BC. And they did things quite differently to us.
In a unique design, the city was built like a honeycomb, with walls shared between different houses and doors cut in the roof so people had to climb on top to get inside. What's more, the dead were buried in the floor of their homes.
It's not clear what happened to the inhabitants of this ancient city.
Pompeii, Italy
One of the most famous ancient sites, Pompeii is a city frozen in time. Believed to have been founded in the 6th or 7th century BC, it was almost obliterated when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79AD. Estimates vary, but more than 1000 people were killed instantly, and the town was buried and forgotten. That is, until it was rediscovered 1800 years later.
It's a fascinating place to visit as it has been perfectly preserved. There are many historical details alien to us such as bizarre art and graffiti, decorative penis statues and weird living arrangements. A resort town, it also has public baths, a brothel, amphitheatre and a hotel. Approximately 2.5 million people visit Pompeii every year.
Machu Picchu, Peru
It's the destination at the top of many travellers' bucket lists. The spectacular 'lost city' of Machu Picchu in Cusco was discovered in 1911 and is one of the most famous sites created by the Inca Empire.
In a remarkable feat of 15th-century construction, the Incas flattened the top of the 2430 metre high mountain to accommodate 140 structures including temples and houses. The city was divided into areas for royalty and the lower classes.
And it's not the jawdropping architecture that's the most puzzling part of Machu Picchu. How they ran a vast empire in an isolated area of Peru without building any marketplaces is quite puzzling, and dramatically different to most other old cities, where market squares were key. Why did they have no recognisable economy, and how did they prosper without it?
Cahokia, US
It's believed between 10,000 to 40,000 people called Cahokia home for hundreds of years. Surrounded by huge earthen pyramids and wooden structures, it's estimated the civilisation was at its height between 600-1400 AD. The inhabitants of Cahokia built huge markets and had sophisticated agricultural practices. More than 120 mounds were built here. It's not known why the city was abandoned in the 1200s, but the depletion of resources and disease may have played a part.
Great Zimbabwe
The giant, walled and wealthy city of Great Zimbabwe was home to around 30,000 people at its peak in 1200-1450. An important trade centre, it was rich in gold from local mines. The technologically advanced city features a huge enclosing wall some 20 metres high and was believed to have served as a royal palace for the Zimbabwean monarch. Famines may have contributed to its mysterious demise.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A company that harnesses bacteria-killing viruses said on Saturday it has devised a test that can detect dangerous staph infections within hours.
This could allow doctors to begin treating patients right away with the correct drugs, instead of waiting the usual two to three days for a test that grows the germs in test tubes, the researchers said.
The test detects Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in blood within five hours, Longmont, Colorado-based MicroPhage Inc told a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
Older tests require a blood culture, in which labs try to grow bacteria in a dish. At least two other companies — Cepheid and Becton, Dickinson and Co — had fast tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year.
More than 94,000 life-threatening infections and nearly 19,000 deaths in the United States were caused by drug-resistant staph infections in 2005, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Bacteria undamaged by the antibiotic methicillin, called methicillin-resistant Staph aureus infections, or MRSA for short, accounted for 63 percent of new hospital-acquired infections in 2004.
“MRSA infections are best treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but infections by methicillin-susceptible strains are best treated with narrow-spectrum antibiotics,” MicroPhage said in a statement.
The MicroPhage test requires two test tubes. “One tube determines whether or not the sample contains S. aureus bacteria; the other determines whether the bacteria are antibiotic-resistant or susceptible,” the statement said.
An international team of scientists, led by Dr Stephen Barker of Cardiff University, has produced a prediction of what climate records from Greenland might look like over the last 800,000 years.
Drill cores taken from Greenland's vast ice sheets provided the first clue that Earth's climate is capable of very rapid transitions and have led to vigorous scientific investigation into the possible causes of abrupt climate change.
Such evidence comes from the accumulation of layers of ancient snow, which compact to form the ice-sheets we see today. Each layer of ice can reveal past temperatures and even evidence for the timing and magnitude of distant storms or volcanic eruptions. By drilling cores in the ice scientists have reconstructed an incredible record of past climates. Until now such temperature records from Greenland have covered only the last 100,000 years or so.
The team's reconstruction is based on the much longer ice core temperature record retrieved from Antarctica and uses a mathematical formulation to extend the Greenland record beyond its current limit.
Dr Barker, Cardiff School of Earth and Ocean Sciences said: "Our approach is based on an earlier suggestion that the record of Antarctic temperature variability could be derived from the Greenland record.
"However, we turned this idea on its head to derive a much longer record for Greenland using the available records from Antarctica."
The research published in the journal Science (Sept. 8) demonstrates that abrupt climate change has been a systemic feature of Earth's climate for hundreds of thousands of years and may play an active role in longer term climate variability through its influence on ice age terminations.
Dr Barker added: "It is intriguing to get an insight into what abrupt climate variability may have looked like before the Greenland records begin. We now have to wait until longer Greenland records are produced so that we can see how successful our prediction is."
The new predictions provide an extended testing bed for the climate models that are used to predict future climate variability.
The collaborative research was funded in part by a Leverhulme Trust Philip Leverhulme Prize awarded to Dr Barker at Cardiff University. The prize recognises the achievement and potential of outstanding researchers at an early stage in their careers but who have already acquired an international reputation for their work. The Natural Environment Research Council and National Science Foundation in the United States also funded the research.
All memories associated with Ramazan and meethi Eid are joyous, filled with love, laughter, eidi, family, friends and the mandatory Sheer Khurma.
My mother made the most delicious Sheer Khurma every year; warm as a mothers embrace and sweet as their love. Returning home from the Eid namaz as my father entered through the front door, we would line up for our eidi, (cash gift distributed on Eid) and our wonderful cook Basher pulled in the trolley laden with delectable Eid treats, and there it was, the Sheer Khurma, sitting front and center.
Sheer means milk in Persian and Khurma means dates, and how and when vermicelli was added to this delightful dessert, your guess is as good as mine.
History tells us since Saudi Arabia is abounded in the harvest of dates, people would break their fast with dates, as we still do today, and cook a milk and date dessert come Eid morning. Hence Sheer Khurma is an Eid-ul-fitr delight in all Muslim households.
This is simple yet delicious dish is versatile as it can be served hot or cold. Dates being one of the main ingredients (since in those days this milk and date dessert was sweetened with dates alone and not sugar) that enhance this delicacy, are in themselves nutritious and a complete meal, like milk.
Food Stories: Shahi Tukray
Generally fresh ripened dates are used in the making of Sheer Khurma, but many prefer using dry dates also.
The Edible Magazine featured a story on Eid and the importance of dates,
Eating dates at dusk is as old as Ramazan itself. Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) is said to have ended their own fast with the fruit, which is among the sweetest on Earth. This sugary morsel gives any fasting observer a quick boost of energy, a few dates at the end of a long day of fasting quickly helps revitalize mind and body. Therefore it is no wonder that after a month of intense focus and fasting, much of the celebration food on Eid morning is in the form of this date dessert.
Traditionally Sheer Khurma is made with vermicelli (a very fine kind of spaghetti). It is cooked in milk and dates, adding a variety of dry fruits to make it a rich and aromatic dessert. Sheer Khurma is a customary Muslim festive breakfast or dessert dish and is served to family and friends to show hospitality and joy on this happy occasion.
The Kulfi chronicle
The Eid fiesta brings with it sublime food flavours. After a month of strict abstinence, Eid-ul-Fitr is most associated with feasting and would not be complete without the Sheer Khurma.
The recipe I share with you today comes from Anjum Khala's kitchen. It is delicious, quick and makes for a sweet Eid morning.
Ingredients
8 cups or 2kg full crème milk
100 grams vermicelli
4 onz. condensed milk
8 onz. sugar
10 to 12 green cardamoms
10 to 12 dates (chopped lengthwise)
½ cup (pistachios, almonds, cashews, raisins)
Pinch of salt
Method
Bring milk to boil, add vermicelli and keep stirring, simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, adding sugar, condensed milk, cardamom, salt and dates.
Let simmer for 20 minutes to half an hour, reducing the quantity.
Add dry fruit, cook for a few more minutes. Pour into serving bowl, garnish and serve hot or cold.

TORONTO — A Calgary suicide bomber who killed 19 Iraqis has become a propaganda tool for jihadists, who are urging Muslims to follow their “great example” and threatening Canada to change its “oppressive” foreign policies.
A message posted online eulogizes Salman Ashrafi, a Canadian member of the ultra-extremist Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, as a “brave warrior” and goads Muslims to “prove their manhood” by following in their footsteps.
Written by a fellow Canadian jihadist who goes by the alias Abu Dujana al-Muhajir, the self-described “wake-up call” warns Canadians to “put pressure on the Canadian government to change its foreign policy in the Muslim world.”
It also cautions Canada against enacting laws aimed at stopping extremist Muslims from leaving the country to join terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabab, saying such measures will not work and will only fuel radicalization.
“Therefore, we urge the Canadian public to take heed from the recent history and not allow their war-mongering governments to get themselves entangled in a war of attrition with the Muslims for decades to come; a war that you an never win for we are a nation of brave lion hearts like Salman Ashrafi.”
The author claims to be part of a small circle of Calgary misfits who formed their own prayer group and, after deciding that being Muslim meant fighting jihad, left for Syria to join terror groups such as ISIS, which is now committing mass atrocities in Iraq.
At least two members of the group, Ashrafi and Damian Clairmont, a former mental patient who converted to Islam, have since died. Ashrafi was a Pakistani-Canadian business analyst with Calgary's Talisman Energy.
Their family told the National Post that Ashrafi had quit their job and moved to the Persian Gulf in October 2012, but that they left in December and they lost track of him. Abu Dujana said Ashrafi had gone to Turkey, where they waited for six months to get into Syria.
Last November, they allegedly drove a car filled with explosives into an Iraqi army base north of Baghdad. The attack was part of a wave of ISIS bombings that preceded last week's assault on Mosul and other northern towns.
Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned ISIS on Monday for its “brutality” after it posted photos on Twitter showing what it claimed were the mass executions of hundreds of Iraqi soldiers and police captured in recent days.
Ashrafi's death is further evidence that ISIS is partly a foreign invasion force that is trying to impose militant Al Qaeda ideology on Iraqis. It has also fueled concerns that Canadians involved in such groups might one day return home to wage terror campaigns.
The RCMP and Canadian Security Intelligence Service are investigating the Calgary group, which numbers three to five, and the role of a suspected Syrian-Canadian facilitator. The RCMP has also launched a program to track “high-risk travellers” and disrupt their plans to go abroad.
After Ashrafi's eulogy was posted online, Syed Soharwardy, a Calgary imam who has been combatting extremism, wrote to police to say they were concerned for their safety and that of their family. The eulogy singled out Mr. Soharwardy, the founder of Muslims Against Terrorism, calling them “deviant” and saying their brand of Islam was losing out to the jihadists. Mr. Soharwardy said they had also received anti-Muslim hate messages since speaking out against extremism.

5 Ways You've Never Used a Barbell Written on March 13, 2014 at 11:09 am, by Eric Cressey Today's guest post comes from Cressey Sports Performance coach, Greg Robins. Hi, my name is Greg, and I have a problem. I love the barbell. In fact, I would be perfectly happy just training with the bar, a rack, a bench, and some plates. Call me crazy, but every exercise that has ever made a serious impact on my physique and strength levels involved the barbell. To be honest, most people don't use the bar enough. It's not surprising, given the state of a typical “gym” these days. For every three or four bars, there must be a few hundred other pieces of equipment. I continually challenge people to use the bar more often. Usually, my advice centers on doing more variations of the basic lifts. For me, the staple lifts never get old. However, I know plenty of people who thrive on variety in their training. With that in mind, here are five lesser-used exercises that include the barbell. 1. Barbell Rollouts Rollouts are a great exercise, but not everyone has a wheel or other fancy implement. Not a problem! In fact, using a barbell is just as effective, if not more effective. One benefit is that you can make the bar heavier or lighter. This may seem like a trivial difference, since the bar stays on the floor. However, you will notice that a 185-pound bar is a heck of a lot harder to pull back to the starting position. This will make your lats work harder, and tax your core. The best part? It makes your lats and abs work together, as they should! ) 2. 1-arm Barbell Rows Heavy rowing should be a staple in most people's programs, especially those of you who want to move some appreciable weight in the gym. This variation is a serious grip challenge. It's also a great way to load up past what the gym offers in DBs; just use a strap so you can hold on. However you choose to do it, the basic premise is simple: perform a row in the same fashion as 1-arm DB row. In this case, keep the barbell between your legs, and make sure to use 10- and 25-pound plates so you can keep a decent range of motion. 3. Weighted Carries Most folks look immediately to farmer's handles, DBs, and KBs to do weight carries. That's all well and good, but the barbell lends itself very well to a few loaded carries as well. Among my favorites are a barbell overhead carry, a barbell zercher carry, and a 1-arm barbell suitcase carry. Each offers a totally different advantage. Overhead helps people work anti-extension properties in full shoulder flexion. The Zercher carry is great as an anti-extension exercise as well, and a better choice for those who can't get overhead safely. Lastly, the suitcase carry trains core stability in virtually every plane, and even challenges the grip quite a bit. 4. Self Massage Forgot your PVC pipe? No worries! The barbell with a small plates on each hand can make for a roller as well. It's not for the more tender individuals, but works perfectly fine for people who have a longer history doing self-massage. I also like the fact that the bar is much thinner than a roller, putting more direct pressure on the areas of interest. Try this baby out on your lower extremities and lats next time you hit the gym. 5. 1-arm Overhead Exercises I've written previously about the benefits of bottoms-up KB exercises. They create a lot more need for shoulder stability, and tax the grip. However, the barbell can offer a similar benefit. Since the bulk of the weight is now further from your hand, the forearm and shoulder demands increase BIG time. It's a great challenge on 1-arm shoulder presses, as well as Turkish Get Ups. Don't believe me? Give it a try. If you've been hunting down some new physical challenges in the gym, these should definitely get you moving. Train hard and use the barbell! Greg will be presenting their popular "Optimizing the Big 3" training workshop at Cressey Sports Performance in Massachusetts on August 2. This event is a great fit for lifters who have an interest in improving the squat, bench press, and deadlift - and may want to powerlift competitively. And, it's also been very popular with strength and conditioning professionals. For more information, click here.

Mastering The Spin Game: Soft Sponged And Tacky Rubbers
It's All About The Spin
The spin in table tennis makes it a very complex sport and, due to this, table tennis players are constantly looking for the best equipment to help with spin production. Additionally, the new plastic ball has caused players to seek new generation equipment to help increase the poly balls rotations.
Creating the spin primarily relies on contact or dwell time. You can produce more spin by making the ball stay on your rubber surface for longer.
Soft Sponged Vs. Tacky Rubbers
There are two specific types of rubber that can help maximise dwell time: soft sponged rubbers and tacky rubbers.
Soft Sponged Rubbers
European players have favoured soft sponged rubbers for generations, due to their ability to absorb incoming ball speed and produce high levels of spin. The softer sponge also extends the amount of contact time because it lets the ball sink into the rubber more.
Soft rubbers typically produce a higher amount of ball rotation and ball arc whilst also assisting with controlling touch plays, short game and blocking with variation. These rubbers are also great for consistent levels of attack and spin production.
The Yasaka Rakza 7 Soft is one of the most popular soft spinning rubbers of this era. It has a solid reputation for balanced control and high spin production. Another popular soft rubber is the Donic Acuda S2, which supports spin production with a strong speed balance.
Tacky Rubbers
Chinese style rubbers are often more tacky and are combined with firmer sponges. Tacky rubbers, such as the DHS Hurricane 3, are the preference of Chinese National Team since they allow for exceedingly high spin on offense and service. The combination of tacky rubbers, solid sponges and low throw angles create shocking 3rd ball attacks and lower trajectories that are more direct.
Tacky rubbers, like the name describes, often have a sticky feeling and focus on maximising the amount of grip on the rubber tops surface. Latest generation rubbers, like Xiom Omega V Pro, utilise tacky top sheets with sponges that are less dense to create a more forgiving sponge with a tacky surface.
So, Which One Is Best For The Spin Game?
When it comes to deciding which type would better suit a spin game, you have to consider your own personal preference. Both types of rubber produce high amounts of spin and maximise dwell time, though they offer a different feeling and style.
The only major differences are the physical characteristics and the processes used to achieve the results. Therefore, you have to decide: do you like the feeling of the ball sticking to the top sheet? Or do you prefer the feeling of it sinking into the rubber?
The choice is yours to make!

Another day, another headline I'd never imagined I'd ever write.
According to the Houston Chronicle‘s Brent Zwerneman, Texas A&M wide receiver Kirk Merritt pleaded not guilty late last month to a pair of indecent exposure charges. The charges stem from a pair of incidents from last October, and allegedly involve Merritt exposing themselves to female academic tutors.
From Zwerneman's report:
In one count, an alleged victim accused Merritt of exposing and touching themselves “while sitting in arm's reach” of their “on or about” Oct. 24. About a day later according to a court document, another alleged victim claimed Merritt pulled down their shorts and held themselves also “while sitting in arm's reach” of them The document describes both alleged victims as “offended or alarmed by the act of exposure.” Both of the victims were tutors at A&M, a person with knowledge of the case said.
The university has yet to comment publicly on the development. Merritt, the Chronicle notes, has been participating in A&M's spring practice.
Merritt had announced last June that they would be transferring from Oregon because of what they described as unspecified “family situations back home” in Louisiana. The next month, the receiver announced they would be transferring to A&M.
To satisfy NCAA transfer rules, Merritt sat out the 2016 season. Counting this season, they have three years of eligibility remaining.
A four-star 2015 recruit, Merritt was rated as the No. 7 player at any position in the state of Louisiana. Playing in 12 games as a true first-year student, Merritt caught five passes for 61 yards. They added another 13 yards on three carries.
The Rich and the Poor
In General
During the medieval periods, very distinct difference between the nobles and the peasants existed. The nobles and wealthy were able to obtain a wide variety of nutritious diets carefully prepared by cooks while the peasants must suffer through the few selections of meat and vegetables they can afford. Furthermore, even if a dish is common among both the nobles and the peasants, one could still sense the distinct differences when prepared by the same group. The dish, when prepared by noble, will have rich and carefully selected ingredients prepared in fine and elaborate fashions, served while fresh and tasteful. It could also contain certain variations from the original recipe, due to the addition of expensive imported spices from Asia. On the contrary, the same dish, prepared by peasants, will contain a reduced amount of meat that has been preserved for prolong periods of time, and served in the most basic fashions. The spices used will most likely be limited to salt and honey, with some wild herbs if lucky.
The Rich
The rich enjoyed a relatively wide assortment of food in comparison to the poor. They were able to obtain large amounts of meat in their diet, with domesticated animals being the main source. Amongst the rich, beef, pork and chicken are very common, as they were farmed in large quantities by the peasants who worked for them. Aside from the meat, the choice of fish was also different among the rich and the poor. The rich ate mostly carp and pike, as they do not contain the strong natural stench that resides in many fishes. Certain rivers which can only be fished by the nobles provided the bulk of the fish supply, and any illegal fishing resulted in severe penalties. In addition to the restricted rivers, many castles also contain pools in which live fishes are kept to maintain a steady supply of fish when the catch at the river is poor. Similar to the meat and fishes, grain products consumed by wealthy individuals are much more refined than the ones of the poor. The rich consumed refined wheat, which is wheat that has been carefully selected and grounded prior to being used. With the refined wheat, softer and sweeter grain products that is somewhat similar to ones consumed today can be made. In addition to domestic agricultural products, the rich and noble also enjoyed many imported goods which were not accessible to the peasants. The majority of the foreign goods consisted of dried food and Asian spices, which were imported through the Middle-East. Most of the spices were imported at extremely high prices, and regarded very preciously at the time. They were usually peppered, sugar, cinnamon, garlic powder and other spices which are common today but were not produced in medieval Europe. Just as the spices, the dried fruits are usually fruits that one can easily find today. Such dried fruits were usually almonds and other exotic Asian fruits that were not produced in Europe at the time.
The Poor
Due to the feudal system, the gap in the social-economic status between the nobles and the peasants is extremely wide. The image of a medieval meal might not be what people usually imagine it to be, crowded tables with people devouring large servings of meat in barbaric fashions. Peasants were reluctant to kill the domesticated animals as they were precious to the farm, instead, they usually hunted to add meat to their diet. In addition, they were only allowed to eat meat four days a week, as Wednesday, Friday and Saturday were ruled as fast days by the church. While most nobles simply ignored such the rule, the peasants were restricted to fishes. Unfortunately, unlike the rich, the peasants obtained all their supply through fishing in the wild as they did not have the luxury of the "Fish Pools" enjoyed by t they rich. Furthermore, since many restrictions were applied to the peasants in terms of fishing, they were often refrained to fishing activities in resource poor rivers where lower quality fishes existed. Mostly, the catch consisted of herrings and eels with the addition of shellfishes when available. Unlike the rich, who's diet was abundant in meats, the poor relied heavily on grain products to obtain the necessary nutrients. They did not have the refined wheat that was used by the rich, instead, they whatever grain that could be grown. They ate a lot of buckwheat, oats, turnips, nettles, reeds, barley, rye, briars and pea shells, even when they are still green. In addition, the medieval diet also included a large amount of corn, though they were not a large and juicy as the ones we enjoy today. One fact that people should note is that neither the rich nor the poor consumed much fresh vegetables and fruits. Although during the summer and fall fresh fruits were an important part of the diet to the people of the Middle Ages, not much was eaten during other times. During the medieval times, no form of refrigeration technology existed, thus, much of the food was preserved with salt or honey after the harvest season. As a result, for most of the winter and early spring, that was all the Middle Ages people enjoyed in terms of vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, the people of the medieval times did not have a correct concept of health either, thinking that eating large amounts of meat was the best way to obtain the necessary nutrients. Consequently, the importance of vegetables and fruits was ignored, further diminishing the amount that was consumed.
A bloody mary is just the thing to drink with a turkey sandwich. At its most basic, a measure of vodka is topped up with tomato juice and seasoned with Worcester sauce, Tabasco and lemon juice, but the fine details can be tweaked to your own taste.
THE RECIPE
Fill a highball glass with ice. Pour over 50ml of vodka. Top up the glass with tomato juice. Season with a shake of celery salt, a twist of black pepper, a couple of shakes of Tabasco sauce and a few more of Worcestershire sauce. A pinch of grated horseradish, a dash of sherry and a squeeze of lemon will finish it. Pop in a short stick of celery.
THE TRICK
A restrained hand on the vodka is often more welcome than you might expect. The tomato juice should be thoroughly chilled. Spicing should be generous but not overenthusiastic. Sticks of celery are more than decoration – they are edible stirrers. Canned or bottled juice is more appropriate than freshly squeezed, which is often watery and acidic.
THE TWIST
There is an endless list of tiny twists to the classic recipe, but each addition requires your bloody mary to be rechristened. A bloody fairy needs a measure of absinthe, while a virgin mary lacks booze. I'm not sure anyone would thank you for a slutty mary. That's the one garnished with a sausage.
Fish, bikes, and... Blazers? It's true: Oregon Governor Kate Brown will sign a bill tomorrow that will create a Portland Trail Blazers vanity license plate in Oregon. The Blazers now join salmon, bicycles, and Crater Lake (among others) as options Oregonians can choose as a vanity plate for their vehicle.
The signing ceremony will be held tomorrow, Aug. 12 at 11am in the Governor's Ceremonial Office at the Oregon Capitol in Salem, and include Governor Brown, Trail Blazers President and CEO Chris McGowan (who offered public testimony in support of a similar bill), and Trail Blazers broadcasting legend Bill Schonely.
A portion of the fees from vanity license plates in Oregon go to organizations related to the images on the plates. The recipients of the proceeds from the Trail Blazers plates will go through a statewide, competitive grant process, and be distributed through the Trail Blazers Foundation to groups whose programs support Oregon children.
You can find the full text of the bill (HB 2730) here. Among the interesting tidbits: the Trail Blazers have to approve the final design of the license plate, meaning no anti-Blazers designer can troll the state by offering a license plate design featuring a Trail Blazers cupcake superimposed onto Ray Felton's body.
After a few days, Our Man had a eureka moment: Why not collect personal essays, artwork and photographs inspired by the earthquake and compile them into a book? Within a month, he'd have Quakebook.
2:46: Aftershocks: Stories from the Japan Earthquake, also known Quakebook, is a collection of essays, eyewitness accounts, artwork and photographs sourced almost entirely through Twitter from people around the world. Our Man modestly describes the project as "an idea [developed] in a shower by an English teacher in a commuter town on the outskirts of Tokyo that has blossomed into something massive." But with dozens of personal stories and graphics, Quakebook's two-week turnaround makes the project something of a design miracle.
"I started with a simple call for 250-word submissions, and pics and even tweets," Our Man tells me in a lengthy email discussing the evolution of their project. "Where were you when it happened, what did you feel? How have you helped? Did it change anything in the way you live your life? Are you coping with grief? Or just bewildered behind a barrage of media images? Write anything as long as it is heartfelt." Within a day, they had over 70 submissions.
From the outset, Quakebook was a labor of love, a project undertaken by those who felt the pain of their home -- and in many cases, adoptive -- country from beyond its borders. Our Man notes that their earliest contributors "were all Colonials," mostly foreigners living in Japan and Japanese living abroad.
Aware of the international complexion of Quakebook, Our Man went in search of local contributors, those who had borne witness to the quake's devastation. Their mother-in-law contributed, and then their neighbors. Their wife, Our Woman In Abiko, searched the Internet for details from people, as Our Man says, "who had witnessed real suffering, and found some blogs and gained permission to translate them and so on." As Our Man sought eyewitness accounts, their international team was editing, designing and networking through Twitter, trying to ensure that the project was finished in a timely manner.
Despite its far-flung contributors, the book itself offers a departure from projects in the traditional post-disaster vein that, while fundamentally well-intentioned, often contribute relief at a distance, in purely monetary terms. Songs for Japan, the star-studded relief album relying on the repackaged singles of high-visibility stars like Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga to raise awareness for the disaster, comes to mind.
"I don't want to trash Songs for Japan because, basically, the goal of that project is the same as ours," says Dan Ryan, one of the first journalists to join the production of Quakebook. "But it is just a compilation of existing recordings thrown together on the fly and packaged rather quickly with a red sun icon on it, isn't it? 'Teo Torriatte' by Queen is the only song in the compilation that I know was specifically written for the Japanese, but it dates from 1976. Personally, 'Songs for Japan seems like just another music industry celebrity project to me. I don't even know if any of the recording artists were directly involved with putting together the two-CD set."
I notice a tendency to make individual engineering decisions by maximising ‘goodness'. Patch X makes the code more complex, but it adds a new feature or increases performance or makes debugging easier. We add up the goodness points, subtract the badness points and if the result is more than zero it's a good patch.
Unfortunately, complexity does not add up linearly. The total cost of a set of features is not just the sum of the cost of each feature. Complexity limits how much of the system can fit into the heads of the developers, and in doing so breeds more complexity. Every time you are forced to do something ugly in one place because of existing ugliness in another place you are feeling this cost.
Worse, there are cliffs in the cost. As soon as a particular subsystem cannot fit into the head of a single developer there are huge additional overheads for communication. Opportunities for improvements or simplification are missed because no one person can see all the parts of the problem. N engineers working on a system that they all understand will crush N engineers working on a system that they each understand part of.
Modularity, indirection and abstraction are not panaceas for this problem. In most cases they reduce local complexity at the cost of global complexity. This is a decision that should be consciously weighed in each case rather than assumed to be an unquestionable win. The failure mode here are huge codebases where every component is so simple that it barely does anything at all, and the process of just finding and piecing together the actual logic consumes all available mental resources.
For any given team, there is a point past which they can no longer collectively understand the system. This creates opportunity costs - spending complexity in one place means you cannot spend it elsewhere. Any new change must have it's benefits weighed against the precious cognitive limits of the team. Try to spend your limited complexity budget in places that give good value for money. If you fritter away your budget you will have nothing left to spend when a big win comes along.
This is hard to do well, because complexity has so many ways to sneak in without being noticed. The trick is to carefully separate out essential complexity from the morass of assumptions, routines and path dependencies that make up our habitual solution space. Look at the information that must go into the system and the information that must come out. Figure out how fast that needs to happen and find out what your hardware is capable of. Don't start coming up with solutions until you have actually thought about the problem.
After careful consideration you may well end up with a traditional solution and that's fine. But if the first thing you do when given a problem is to pull out your favourite solution then you are throwing away your budget without a fight.
We talk about women on film, the politics of hair and headwear, and how she's basically taking over Disney.
It seems rather fitting that Disney's biggest star right now is Lupita Nyong'o. From Star Wars: The Force Awakens and The Jungle Book, to Black Panther and their latest film Queen Of Katwe, there's no one closer to a modern Disney princess than the 33-year-old Oscar winner. And just like Tiana in The Princess and the Frog, Nyong'o worked their ass off to get to this point.
She's not only one of the most sought after actores on the planet, but one who's also setting out to make a difference. “All too often stories told on the continent have Africans as the backdrop,” they tell me. From that sentence alone, it seems strange to think that she's talking about one of Disney's staple inspirational sporting films. (You know, the ones that usually star Kevin Costner as some broken athlete who finds themselves through the coaching of white dudes in Texas.)
This one, however, attracted Lupita's eye for a few reasons. Queen Of Katwe is based on the true story of a young woman from the slums of Uganda who goes on to become a chess prodigy and competes on the world stage. It's a tale about a woman, starring a woman and — here's the kicker — directed by a woman (Mira Nair). Those are three big ticks in Lupita's book.
Women and a More Inclusive Screen World
“It's powerful to say the least,” Nyong'o says, speaking about the female-led team of Queen of Katwe. “In Mira's hands, this story is about the little girl prodigy, Phiona Mutesi. In someone's else's hands it may have been about their coach (played by David Oyelowo).
“That's something that I'm very aware of. We see the story from this vantage point because of the person telling the story… [they're] just as important as the people in the story. When you have different perspectives in places of influence and authority, then you see a more inclusive world being portrayed.”
This is something that Nyong'o believes in deeply, having worked in dozens of different production roles before stepping in front of the camera with their breakout role in 12 Years A Slave (2013). Them relationship with Katwe's director goes back over a decade to when they first worked as the production assistant on their flick The Namesake back in 2005. Just a few years after that, Nyong'o wrote, directed and produced their own documentary In My Genes (about the treatment of the albino population in Kenya) and started directing music videos for African artists such as Wahu.
It's this comprehensive knowledge and perspective of the industry that's got them so far. They play showbusiness the same way Phiona Mutesi plays chess: like a pro. In many ways, Lupita's rise from Yale graduate and theatre talent to international movie star and Hollywood darling has followed the traditional narrative: she's young, she's beautiful and she's talented. But she's also used established elements like the red carpet arena to their advantage, with great fashion doubling as political statement.
“We All Want To See Ourselves”
Nyong'o wore a headwrap during the entire press tour for Queen of Katwe. When Vogue started writing headlines about their bold style, they then used the spotlight to speak about their culture, their heritage and them “African-ness”.
“The headwrap was something that was very reminiscent of my role in the movie (Phiona's mother),” they tell me. “But it's also the quintessential African accessory so that was my way of paying homage to the Queen of Katwe,” they say. “What's really important for me is that the African becomes the global. I'm a product of that continent and I feel very contemporary, so the idea that to be African is to be anything but contemporary is something I do not respect.
“My African-ness is not accidental or archivable.”

It can be tough to be an outspoken feminist trying to get work in the proverbial sausage-fest that is Hollywood, but it's even harder as a black woman. Lupita is someone who understands the odds against them and sets out to defy them anyway, playing the long game by spinning multiple plates as a filmmaker, a film star and a fashion icon.
Them fans respect their work in all its forms, with millions of them following them every move in front of the camera and away from it — something which they say “humbles” them every day. Now she's getting ready to cross another threshold as kick-ass comic book hero Nakia in Marvel/Disney's Black Panther.
With this role, Nyong'o becomes a bonafide action star with (hopefully) everything from toys right down to t-shirts with their hero of colour splashed across them. Though otherwise tight-lipped about Black Panther, this is a fact they seem all too aware of when asked about the importance of young people having heroes that look like them on a mainstream level.
“You know,” they say, with a smile. “We all want to see ourselves.”

The Pew Forum has released a doozy of a poll about religion in public life in the United States showing that white evangelical Christians possess grossly overdeveloped feelings of victimhood. Given that the voting bloc evangelicals comprise is one of the most heavily pandered to in American politics, and given the fact that evangelicals themselves are the cause of some very real discrimination, there is thus a mountainous irony at play here.
In a survey of 2,002 Americans, Pew found that 72% believe that religious influence is waning in the country, and sadly, 56% regard this as a "negative development." A disturbing 59% of Americans say they want members of Congress to "have strong religious beliefs." When it comes to discrimination, believe it or not, more Americans think that evangelicals are discriminated against than atheists. Here's the breakdown of the religious/irreligious groups Pew asked about:

Perceptions of Discrimination in U.S. % saying there is a lot of discrimination against... Muslims 59% Jews 32% Evangelical Christians 31% Atheists 27% Catholics 19%

Like the members of the other four groups listed here, evangelicals are probably more likely to perceive discrimination against themselves than they are when it comes to outside groups. However, this next breakdown shows the staggering degree to which evangelical Christians -- and let's emphasize that since that is after all the majority religious group in the country -- think they are victims of discrimination:
Notice that of white evangelicals, white mainline Protestants, black Protestants, white Catholics, Hispanic Catholics, and those who are unaffiliated with any religion, it's white evangelicals who are much more likely to think "there is a lot of discrimination" against them, with 50% believing their demographic is discriminated against "a lot."
Amazingly, white evangelicals believe there is more discrimination against them than there is against Muslims, blacks, Hispanics, Jews, and atheists.
Tone. Deaf.
However, this will not come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention to the grumblings from evangelical circles about their phantasmagoric plight in an increasingly secular society. This narrative, which has been spoon-fed to them for decades by self-serving preachers, politicians, and pundits, enables white evangelicals to interpret measures designed to stop discrimination against others as actually being discriminatory against the evangelical way of life. For example, it was just last week when televangelist Pat Robertson went on a nonsensical rant explaining why the U.S. Air Force's decision to let an atheist reenlistee omit the words "So help me god" from their oath, was yet another instance of the armed forces being "terrorized" by secularists.
Absurd as that was, the diatribe was entirely representative of the reality, as indicated not only by the asupervisorstioned Pew poll, but another Pew poll conducted earlier this year. That survey shows that despite the evangelical cries of, "Help, help, I'm being repressed!" it's actually nonbelievers who are held in much lower regard by their fellow Americans:
Only 21% of Americans say they'd be less likely to vote for an evangelical for president. Yet, a straight majority (53%) say the same about an atheist candidate. It should also be noted that Pew found that 53% of Americans say belief in god is necessary to be a moral person. That means a majority of Americans view atheists as either immoral or amoral people. No wonder the same percentage thinks atheists are unfit for the presidency, and no wonder there is not a single openly atheist member of the U.S. Congress, despite the fact that some 24 of them have privately said they don't believe in god.
This is the white evangelical persecution complex quantified. Despite all the religiosity that's so readily apparent in public life -- "In God we trust" on the money, the National Prayer Breakfast, "God Bless America" signing off every major presidential speech, the continued use of "So help me God" at the end of the presidential oath of office despite nothing of the sort appearing in the oath in the Constitution, the existence of a congressional chaplain, the Ten Commandments still cropping up on public property across the country, the political death sentence that would be incurred by most politicians who publicly declare their atheism, the presence of nativity scenes on public property during Christmastime, the nauseating political pandering to ignorant creationists, the treatment of gay people as second class citizens because the Bible says so -- it is the white evangelical Christians who think they suffer above all others.

Anyone spot a chili theme this week, I got a big bag of fresh chilies that are just superb and such a vibrant red colour too, so I just had to pack them into my latest dishes. I haven't done a polenta dish in a while, so thought I'd tart it up a bit with some chilies and also some chopped pumpkin seeds. You could actually have the polenta as a snack itself or keep the leftovers to use with a salad the next day (which is what we're doing). I really should use it more in dishes as it's one of the easiest things to make and once you add all your own flavours it's fantastic. I might do a curry based polenta next time…. ooooh yummy!
I made it to bootcamp this morning with no problems, didn't need the extra yoga class (had the extra hour of sleep instead!) so quite pleased that I'm not all seized up from yesterday's class. Sh'Bam and Body Pump tomorrow morning, still working on my biceps that just don't want to lift anything heavier than 3.75 kilos each side, need to keep at it though, practice makes perfect and all that! On a positive not too, I think my balance is getting much better after starting the Body Balance classes, feel a lot more stable in some of the poses that used to have me wobbling all over the place.
Chili Spiced Polenta with Fava & Kidney Bean Goulash and an Avocado Cream (Vegan & Gluten Free)
MyInspiration Feel The Difference Range
Serves 2 – ready in under and hour (You'll have a little Polenta left over, but keep it for lunch the next day)
For the Polenta
200g Polenta
1 ltr Vegan Stock
2 tsps red chili flakes
1 tsp thyme
1.5 tbsp pumpkin seeds finely chopped
Pinch of black pepper
For the Goulash
1/2 onion finely chopped
2 garlic cloves finely chopped
1 can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 can fava beans (broad beans) drained and rinsed
1 large carrot peeled and chopped
1 tbsp paprika
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp thyme
1 can chop tomatoes
1.5 tbsp tomato puree
2 bay leaves
For the Avocado Cream
1 large or 2 small avocados
1/2 tbsp lemon juice
1 clove garlic finely chopped
pinch of paprika
pinch of black pepper
Method
1. Prepare the polenta, add the stock to a medium sauce pan and bring to the boil, add the polenta, spices and pumpkin seeds and stir, it gets thick pretty quickly, so really beat it to make sure it's well mixed through, cook like this for 3 – 4 minutes then pour into a line square baking tray, mine is 8″ square, smooth it out so it's even and just leave to set, about 20 – 25 minutes.
2. Now make the goulash – in a medium sauce pan over a medium heat, add 2 tbsp water, add the onion, garlic, paprika and thyme and cook for 3 minutes before adding in the remaining ingredients, add 1/2 cup of water and stir everything together, cover and cook on a low heat for 15 – 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. (remember to remove the bay leaves before serving)
3. Lastly, make the avocado cream – cut the avocado in half, remove the stone and scoop out the avocado meat, add this to a food processor (or use a hand blender) add the lemon juice, garlic and paprika and pulse until smooth, taste it and then add black pepper as needed.
4. To serve, slice the polenta and top with the goulash and then a nice big dollop of avocado cream and east right away!

Jacob Artist strikes a pose in this exclusive sexy new photo shoot for JustJared.com.
The 19-year-old Glee heartthrob may be new to the acting scene, but he's winning over audiences this Fall with their role as Jake Puckerman on their hit Fox show.
Make sure to watch Jacob in their big Glee episode “Britney 2.0″ airing TONIGHT (September 20) at 9/8c.

JACOB ARTIST – EXCLUSIVE JUSTJARED.COM INTERVIEW
JJ: We absolutely love you on Glee! Are you excited to be part of the show's cast?
JA: Oh my God, yeah! It all feels totally surreal.
JJ: Were you a Gleek before you auditioned?
JA: Yeah, I definitely was a fan of the show. That adds to how unbelievable this whole thing has been to be on a show – that you've actually supported in the past, you know?
JJ: When you auditioned, which song did you perform?
JA: I actually auditioned with “Never Say Never” by The Fray, which is the song I ended up singing in the first episode. Initially, they didn't really know what song they wanted my character to sing and then it kind of worked out that that's the one they wanted to do, which was really cool.
JJ: That is cool! Before you landed the role of Jake Puckerman, we heard you got accepted to Julliard for dance. Was that audition harder than Glee‘s was?
JA: You know what? To be honest, I think Glee‘s was harder! With the Julliard audition, it was all day and there were tons and tons of cuts. Dancing was something I started doing when I was really young and I think I was more comfortable with that, where on Glee, there's obviously the acting, but then there's a whole singing side of it where we had to bring in like five songs. So yeah, I think Glee was definitely harder (laughs).
JJ: Tonight's episode “Britney 2.0″ looks amazing! What do you think is that standout performance in it?
JA: Oh, I don't know there are so many great ones! I mean Heather Morris, has a really, really awesome dance number! There's a really cool “Womanizer” thing that they're doing all around the school and there's a song I'm doing with Marley (Melissa Benoist), so there are a bunch of really good ones!
JJ: Since Puck graduated from McKinley High School last season, is Jake Glee‘s new bad boy now?
JA: Yeah, I think a little bit. Jake is definitely coming in as the new resident bad boy. I think he's a little bit different from Puck in the sense that he's an outsider and a little bit of a lone wolf in the school where Puck already had their place in the social class, you know what I mean?
JJ: Is there any genre of music that you'd be nervous to sing on the show?
JA: (Laughs) I would be very nervous to rap I think if it ever comes to that! I'm going to try to steer clear as long as possible.
JJ: The members of New Directions tend to get slushies poured on them a lot. Have you been slushied on set yet?
JA: I have not yet actually. I'm sure it's impending, but I've been fortunate enough to not be slushied yet (laughs).
JJ: Which characters are Jake closest to so far on the show?
JA: I've been shooting a lot with Melissa Benoist and Becca Tobin who play Marley and Kitty. They're the new students at McKinley, so there's definitely some drama happening amongst the three of them.
JJ: Who do you think Jake should end up dating later this season?
JA: End up dating…umm. I don't know, it's still very early on, but we've been kind of exploring a thing with Marley a little bit. They are kind of connecting on a level where their family histories are very similar and I think that's something they can both identify with. I think they can also see who they really are, behind all of these walls that he's putting up, which I think they need someone like that in their life.
JJ: Yeah, they'd be a cute couple. We had so much fun working with you at your JustJared.com photo shoot the other day! Did you have a favorite look?
JA: Yeah, it was fun! I had these really cool blue pants on with this salmon colored blazer and it was so funny because when I initially saw it I was like, I don't know if I can wear that color (laughs), but then I put it on and it really brought the outfit to a new level, so that was fun to shoot!
JJ: Well, you pulled off that look well! Besides acting and dancing, what do you like to do for fun?
JA: You know, I like a lot of outdoorsy stuff. I'm from New York where the winter is obviously freezing and now I'm in L.A. and I can go to the beach all the time and be outside all the time. Any physical activity outdoors, I'm totally there!
JJ: Nice. Since you live in Los Angeles now, who would you say your celeb crush is?
JA: I totally have a thing for Blake Lively. I think she's so elegant and eloquent when they speak. I just think she's the total package for sure.
JJ: Can you tell us a fun fact about yourself?
JA: (Laughs) There has to be one. My guilty pleasure is definitely reality TV. I think it started for me in high school with Jersey Shore and now I'm just kind of obsessed with reality shows.

Not only have some public schools lost enrolments; they have become racially segregated. In pockets of rural and remote NSW, Aboriginal students fill public schools and white students attend Catholic and other private schools in the same town. Around Sydney, the parents of some Anglo-European students are avoiding what they perceive as predominantly Lebanese, Muslim and Asian schools.
In New England, in towns such as Armidale, white middle-class students are flocking to Catholic and independent schools. In their report, principals say this is so the students can "get away from their local school". "This is almost certainly white flight from towns in which the public school's enrolment consists increasingly of indigenous students," the report says. "The pattern is repeated in the Sydney region. Based on comments from principals, this most likely consists of flight to avoid Islamic students and communities."
The report, its pages stamped confidential, was based on responses of 163 high school principals, representing a third of the Secondary Principals Council membership. It was presented to the NSW Government after it was completed in February 2006, but has not been released. Principals in New England said 56 per cent of the Anglo-European students who had left their schools had gone to a nearby Catholic or independent school. In North Sydney, 35 per cent of students who had left the public system went to a nearby private school.
The report shows the percentage of Anglo-European students in public schools has decreased by a third in western NSW, by 42 per cent in North Sydney and 37 per cent in New England. A University of Western Sydney academic, Carol Reid, has also found that one in four male students surveyed in Sydney's south and west had been involved in ethnic conflict. They had received anecdotal reports from principals about white students avoiding what were regarded as Asian schools on the North Shore and some selective high schools that had high proportions of Asian students.
Dr Reid, who is the associate head of the school of education, surveyed 350 high school students aged between 14 and 17 in south-western Sydney, after the Cronulla riots of 2005. "I've been involved in education for 30 years and I've never seen this polarisation around class, but also around ethnicity and race," they said.
"What I have discovered is principals are losing the last of their white kids to Catholic schools across the road. A principal in the Middle Eastern part of the city was saying that they had no white kids in their school. "I'm concerned that social cohesion is going to be at risk through this. I see signs of that. You have a lot of segregation going on." The survey of principals reports one saying: "The Asian students are scared off by Lebanese enrolment at our school following the Cronulla riots - we had 18 no-shows on day one in year 11, mostly Asian."
Another said: "I'm seen as a Muslim school, so I don't attract very many non-Muslims, whether Anglo or not. I've worked hard to raise the school profile and gradually increase enrolments, but the Muslim label appears to alienate other groups." Noel Beddoe, a former principal in Narrandera for 20 years who are involved in Aboriginal education, said a "de facto apartheid" had developed in some towns in the west and north of NSW, including Mungindi, near Moree, where Aboriginal students attend the public school and whites attend the Catholic school.
Busloads of white students from towns including Boggabilla cross the Queensland border every day to attend a Catholic and public school in Goondiwindi. The same is happening in southern NSW, where students are bypassing Balranald Central School and crossing the border to go to schools in Victoria. Up to 15 years ago, Boggabilla Central School, near the Queensland border, had a relatively even mix of white and Aboriginal students. The proportion of white students has dropped from around 40 per cent in the early 1990s to 10 to 20 per cent today. Owen Hasler, the NSW Teachers Federation organiser for the New England region, said: "There has been a significant movement of white Anglo students away from quite a few of the schools in the New England and Western region. It is clearly evidenced by the numbers and proportion of Aboriginal students in those schools."
They said around 8 per cent of the 1100 students at Gunnedah High School during the 1970s were Aboriginal. That proportion had grown to about 25 per cent of the 600 students now enrolled. "Public schools are becoming de facto Aboriginal schools," Mr Hasler said. "It appears to be a result of the last 10 to 15 years of funding. We can understand people making the choice to send their kids away to other schools when there is a financial incentive to do so. But is that fair to the kids who want to stay in their own local community?"
Dr Reid said policies of the Howard government and the Liberal state government that had strongly supported parental choice in schooling, including de-zoning, had contributed to "white flight". Parents were no longer restricted to schools close to home and could use generous government subsidies for transport. Boarding school allowances of up to $6396 per child were also available, making it easier for some families to avoid their local school. The Isolated Parents Association is lobbying to have the $54 million federal government boarding assistance scheme extended to more families in rural and remote areas. It is means-tested and restricted to children of families who live more than 56 kilometres from the nearest government school, or more than 4.5 kilometres from the nearest transport to school.
The association's national president, Roxanne Morrissey, said families who lived near a public school should be supported in their choice of another school that offered a wider curriculum choice. The NSW Greens MP John Kaye said the State Government spent $443 million a year on a transport scheme that "encourages travel past local public schools to private schools in other suburbs".
"It's a recipe for educational segregation," they said. Rick Johnston, director of Catholic schools in the Armidale diocese, said enrolments of Aboriginal students were increasing. In 1985 there were 6557 students in Catholic schools in the Armidale region and of these, 196 were Aboriginal. Last year there were 465 indigenous students out of 5892 students. "I am committed to improving education outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students," they said. "I believe that education is the most important key to breaking the cycle of disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people."
Sharon Cooke, who is employed by the Catholic schools office in Armidale as an Aboriginal education consultant, said there were 25 schools within the diocese that employed 20 Aboriginal education assistants and two Aboriginal language teachers. "We are committed to increasing the number of teachers within our schools who are of Aboriginal heritage," they said.
One of the problems with bomb detection is that bombs tend to explode. It would be advantageous for a bomb squad to be able to positively identify the contents of a purported bomb before attempting to dismantle it. Existing techniques, however, are inefficient or of limited utility.
In a new PNAS paper, American researchers propose using a variation of Raman spectroscopy to detect bombs from a safe distance. This technique relies on detecting slight changes in a molecule's vibrational energy. Most molecules vibrate in some sort of fashion; atoms move back and forth as if the bonds holding them together are actually springs. Firing photons from a laser at molecules can either increase the vibration of the molecule (thus, decreasing the energy of the photon), or decrease the vibration of the molecule (thus, increasing the energy of the photon). Such photons are said to be "scattered," and the resulting patterns serve as fingerprints to identify particular molecules.
Traditional Raman spectroscopy, however, produces a very weak signal that is difficult to detect. So, the authors used a powerful laser, but unfocused it slightly, to create a larger spot on the target. The large spot trapped the Raman scattered light inside of the target, causing it to glow even brighter. This allowed them to detect explosives, such as potassium nitrate, from 400 meters away. Various tweaks suggested that they could actually detect explosives from 1 km away.
In the figure above, the authors demonstrate the possibility of using aircraft to detect explosives. The airplane would carry a spectrometer that fires a laser (green arrow) at an unknown and possibly explosive substance. This would induce Raman scattering, and the photons would bounce back toward the aircraft (red arrow). The energy of these photons would reveal the identity of the substance.
The authors claim this technology may also help detect the sorts of molecules that would indicate the presence of extraterrestrial life. Indeed, that would be the bomb.

Gerald Celente of the Trends Research Institute has just gone on the record with a prediction that there will be a stock market crash by the end of this calendar year.
If you are not familiar with Gerald Celente, they are one of the most highly respected trends forecasters in the entire world.
They have been featured on CNN, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Today Show, Good Morning America, CBS Morning News, NBC Nightly News and Coast to Coast AM.
Personally, I have a lot of respect for him. While it is true that not every single one of their forecasts about the future came to pass over the years, they do have a very solid track record that goes back for decades.
They correctly predicted the 1987 stock market crash, the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the financial panic of 2008.
Just a couple of days ago, they told Eric King the following: “I'm now predicting that we are going to see a global stock market crash before the end of the year.” Celente says that it won't just be U.S. stocks either. ”
“He believes that crashes are also coming to “the DAX, the FTSE, the CAC, Shanghai, and the Nikkei”.
It is other words, it is going to be a truly global financial crisis and they say that there is “going to be panic on the streets from Wall Street to Shanghai and from the UK down to Brazil”.
When you go out on a limb like this, you are putting your credibility on the line. This is something that Celente has only done a few times in the past, and normally they have been spot on…
Rarely do I ever put a date on market crashes. I did it in 1987 when I forecast the 1987 stock market crash — that was in the Wall Street Journal. I also forecast the ‘Panic of 2008,' and the ‘dot-com bust' in October of 1999, when I said it (the dot-com mania) would fail in the second quarter of 2000…
Of course Celente is far from alone. Many others have also been warning that a new financial crisis is imminent.
For instance, just check out what David Stockman recently told CNBC…
David Stockman has long warned that the stock market is on the verge of a massive collapse, and the recent price action has them even more convinced than ever that the bottom is about to fall out. “I think it's pretty obvious that the top is in,” the Reagan administration's OMB director said Thursday on CNBC's “Futures Now.” The S&P 500 has traded in a historically narrow range for the better part of 2015, having moved just 1 percent higher year to date. “It's just waiting for the knee-jerk bulls, robo traders and dip buyers to finally capitulate.” Stockman, whose past claims have yet to come to fruition, still believes that the excessive monetary policy from central banks around the world has created a “debt supernova,” and all the signs point to “the end of the central bank enabled bubble,” which could cause a worldwide recession.
Just a few days ago, I authored an article entitled “8 Financial Experts That Are Warning That A Great Financial Crisis Is Imminent” which showed that a whole bunch of other financial experts are sounding the alarm about an implosion of the financial markets.
And before any of these warnings came out, I issued my “red alert” for the last six months of 2015 back on June 25th.
There is a growing consensus that something really, really bad is about to happen in the very near future.
You know that we are really late in the game when the mainstream media starts sounding exactly like The Economic Collapse Blog.
On July 22nd, I authored a piece entitled “Commodities Collapsed Just Before The Last Stock Market Crash – So Guess What Is Happening Right Now?”
Now compare that headline to this recent one from Bloomberg: “Commodities Are Crashing Like It's 2008 All Over Again“.
The mainstream media is starting to get it. The exact same patterns that we witnessed just prior to the last financial crisis are playing out once again right before our very eyes. Here is an excerpt from that Bloomberg article…
Attention commodities investors: Welcome back to 2008! The meltdown has pushed as many commodities into bear markets as there were in the month after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which spurred the worst financial crisis seven years ago since the Great Depression. Eighteen of the 22 components in the Bloomberg Commodity Index have dropped at least 20 percent from recent closing highs, meeting the common definition of a bear market. That's the same number as at the end of October 2008, when deepening financial turmoil sent global markets into a swoon.
This is the kind of stuff that I have been hammering on for weeks.
Another sign that we saw back in 2008 that is repeating once again is a substantial slowdown in global trade. Over the weekend, we got some more bad news on this front from China. The following comes from Zero Hedge…
Overnight we got another acute reminder of just who is lying hunched over, comatose in the driver's seat of global commerce: the country whose July exports just crashed by 8.3% Y/Y (and down 3.6% from the month before) far greater than the consensus estimate of only a 1.5% drop, and the biggest drop in four months following the modest June rebound by 2.8%: China. It wasn't just exports, imports tumbled as well by 8.1%, fractionally worse than the -8.0% consensus, and down from the -6.1% in June as China's commodity tolling operations are suddenly mothballed.
The crisis that so many have been waiting for is here.
As the coming weeks and months play out, there will be good days and there will be bad days. Remember, some of the biggest one day gains in U.S. stock market history happened right in the middle of the financial crisis of 2008.
So don't get fooled by what happens on any one particular day.
Also, please do not think that this crisis will be “over” by the end of 2015.
What we are moving into is just the start of the crisis.
Things will continue to unravel as we move into 2016 and beyond.
The recession that we experienced back in 2008 and 2009 will seem like a Sunday picnic compared to what is coming by the time that everything is all said and done.
So that is why I work so hard to encourage people to get prepared.
What we are facing is not going to last for weeks or for months.
The coming crisis is going to last for years, and it is going to be painful beyond what most people would dare to imagine.

Family Research Council Prays, but Stupidly
As everyone is aware, a BIG US Supreme Court case is coming up.
The Family Research Council (always be wary of organizations with ‘Family' in the name), has set up a prayer target. Here's the link to the site.
In their request for prayer they are asking for prayers for the following
May God guide us in praying for each member of the Supreme Court: for Samuel Alito,Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Anthony Kennedy, Chief JusticeJohn Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Sonia Sotomayor, and Clarence Thomas. May each Justice be governed by the fear of God and fidelity to the moral law and Constitution (2 Sam 23:3; Ps 9:17; 111:10; Pr 1:7; 9:10; Is 5:20).
May the attorneys defending traditional marriage (see ADF Prayer Guide) be given anointing, clarity, effectiveness, conviction and persuasiveness in presenting their arguments. May traditional marriage prevail in the minds of a strong majority of the justices, and may traditional marriage be reaffirmed as the law of the land (Pr 16:1, 11; 25; 18:17; 21:3; Is 9:7; Mt 19:4-6; 2 Cor 5:11).
May those arguing on behalf of same-sex “marriage” present their arguments in an inept, confusing and unconvincing way. May they fail to gain traction in the minds of the Justices. May the right of Californians to amend their state constitution to protect marriage be confirmed by the Court, and may the Defense of Marriage Act be ruled constitutional (Lev 20:all; 1 Sam 2:8-10; 2 Chr 14:11; 20:12-27; Pr 22:28; 24:21; Is 8:18-20; Dan 7:25-27; 2 Cor 2:5).
This leads me to a number of questions for the FRC.
Are your arguments so pathetic that the only real hope you have is to have the pro-equality (yes, notice the shift in language there) lawyers be ‘inept, confusing, and unconvincing'? Where, exactly, in the Constitution does that document give power to any group within the US government to determine what marriage is? What, exactly, is moral law? Why should judges be fearful of an all-loving god? Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if god really is all powerful and really does answer the prayers of the true believer as the Bible says (“Ask anything in My name and it will be done”) then…
Why are you wasting time on praying for a court case? Why don't you just pray that people not be gay or that the entire US government become a theocratic body and the courts dissolved and replaced with prayer circles of people with stones to throw? Or something else that is really what you want, but are too chicken to say it out loud.
Seriously, why don't you just pray to kill all the unbelievers? God's done it several times before. He's destroyed cities, countries, even everything on the entire planet. They ought to be pretty accurate by now. We all know that what you wackos really want.
Why don't you just pray that your church leaders wake up and are the President, and the SC judges, and legislators? Wouldn't that be easier than trying to pray about each, individual little detail. You could make it all go away with one prayer. “God, put us in charge.” Screw elections, you guys are steadily losing them. It's going to take divine intervention to get back a majority and a president at this point.
I actually do understand why you don't pray for these types of things.
It's the exact same reason you don't pray that amputees be healed, but do pray for people with cancer. It's the reason you pray for rain, but not for crops to grow without the need of rain. It's the same reason you pray for strength to believe and not for evidence of your god.
Deep down, in your heart of hearts, you really don't believe. You really don't believe that you can ‘pray away the gay'. You really don't believe that god will grow crops without rain. You really don't believe that god will cure amputees.
You don't believe in your own god enough to pray for the things you really want and things that will show everyone their power (or lack thereof). So instead, you insult your god, your own beliefs, and every thinking person around you by prayer for these piddling little details that god doesn't have to actually show themselves to deal with.
If those arguing on behalf of gay-marriage stutter in their delivery, will you cheer and take that as evidence that god is answering your prayers?
Let's say you guys pray and pray and pray. And DOMA is still ruled unconstitutional. Will you accept that your god is trying to tell you something? Maybe equality, fairness, and love is more important than hate, bigotry, and your own idiocy? Or will you continue to beat a dead horse that no one cares about anymore?
You pray for tiny things, because deep down you know that there is no god. That voice you hear is your own ignorance, bigotry, hate, and fear. It's not god. It's the voice of cowardice. It's the tiny little voice that's too afraid that it might not control everything on this Earth.
And it scares you to death.
You won't pray for what you really want because if it doesn't happen, everyone (including you) will finally have to admit that prayer doesn't work. It doesn't matter if god exists or not. You can still believe in him, no one cares. But you will have to finally admit that they don't answer prayers.
Fossil Group is hard at work delivering its tall-order promise of launching 100 connected devices by the end of this year across brands like Michael Kors, Armani and Tory Burch. Now, it's 7 devices closer to meeting that goal.
The parent company announced on Tuesday a series of fashion-forward activity trackers, smarter analog watches and slimmer Android Wear smartwatches as a part of its growing Fossil brand Q accessory lineup. As of now, it's easy to say Fossil Group is the watch luxury brand with the most aggressive plan to add smarter, fashionable options for customers to choose from this year.

Based on photos alone, the Smart Analog Movement devices (pictured above) are some of the more attractive smart accessories we've seen — you'd never suspect it pairs with an app and monitors your daily activity. While pricing wasn't shared about the Smart Analog Movement watches, which connect to iPhones and Android devices via Bluetooth, they'll let users see calories, sleep, automatic time zone updates and a second time zone, within a small section of the the analog dial.

The company is also expanding its partnership with Google's Android Wear software with the introduction of its Q Marshal and Q Wander smartwatches, aimed to resemble more of a traditional-looking timepiece.
Both smartwatches ($275) come in two sizes — 44mm and 46mm -– and feature a touchscreen display, allowing users to tap for calendar and flight alerts and access other apps like Venmo, Tinder and Delta. While the models offer similar capabilities, the designs are slightly different: The Q Wander has a multi-finish case and interchangeable leather straps, and the Marshal touts a slightly rugged case and a navy blue option. Like its Q Founder predecessor, the smartwatches allow users to take phone calls, get alerts (such as calendar reminders) and respond to messages directly from the device. All devices, due out later this year, can work alongside both Android and iPhones and come with wireless chargers.

Although the Q Wander and Marshal — yes, that's one "l" — are more technologically advanced, the Motion is the most affordable option at $95 and still lets you get the basics (call notifications, texts, haptic vibrations and multi-color LED lights). It's a fitness tracker disguised as a bracelet, or at least that is the intention.

It's also water resistant and doesn't require a charge, although you'll need to swap its coin cell batteries every six months, which could be a pain. It's certainly one of the most attractive fitness trackers we've seen, but that's not to say the Fitbit Alta doesn't give this some serious competition.

However, with each new iteration of accessories, Fossil is fine tuning the designs and it's clear its really starting to get the hang of it: There are more size options, sleeker body types and advanced customization with watch faces and bands.
"All our changes to date have been direct responses to customer feedback," Jill Elliott, Fossil's chief creative officer, told Mashable. "We've learned so much from our initial launch in connected accessories and know technology is a major disruptor in many industries right now, including fashion. But to successfully merge the two, we believe you need to have the fashion design expertise and focus on it first."
Last year, the company made a surprise move to acquire wearable brand Misfit for $260 million, bringing in the startup to lean on its wearable tech development to help fuel growth.
Its latest devices join Fossil's existing Q line, which includes the Android Wear-based Q Founder smartwatch, the Q54 Pilot and the Q Grant (traditional analog-style watches) and two activity trackers: the Q Reveler and Q Dreamer.
It makes sense that brands like Fossil, TAG Heuer and Timex, who were once worried that the smartphone was phasing out traditional watches, would want to capitalize on the connected device trend. Watches are in again — and considering how watchmakers are the true experts in creating high-end fashion pieces that rake in millions of dollars in sales, it's a natural move for them, and others, to move into connected territory.

Hidden between houses, covered by weeds and ivy, and cutting through a public park in Detroit's Wyoming neighborhood, the Eight Mile Wall has been referred to by locals as Detroit's Berlin Wall. Although unlike its German counterpart, this divider still stands today.
At six feet tall and one foot wide with two gaps in the middle to make way for roads, the half-mile long wall was built to segregate a black community from an adjacent white development. It was never meant to physically separate people, but instead to do so legally and symbolically.
It all started in 1934, when the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was founded. The FHA signed into law the process of “redlining,” the act of denying loans and financial services to black neighborhoods while granting them for white neighborhoods. This widened the economic gap between races to a whole new level.
The neighborhood of Wyoming was a redlined black neighborhood for nearly a decade until the early 1940s, when developers wanted to build a white development in the area. They were denied by the FHA because their plan placed the white neighborhood “too close” to the black neighborhood.
Thinking quickly, the developers responded by building a half-mile long wall directly in between Mendota Street and Birwood Avenue for a full three blocks. This was enough to be given the nod of approval from the U.S. government. The wall was the official racial divider for over 20 years, until the Fair Housing Act abolished such racist policies in 1968.
The wall itself, however, still remains today — as does segregation in Detroit. While both sides of the wall are currently black neighborhoods, the area around Detroit's Eight Mile Road is staunchly divided between the majority white north side and majority black south side. Although the wall doesn't run alongside Eight Mile Road, it's become known as the “Eight Mile Wall” as a reference to the modern-day epicenter of Detroit's segregation. (It's also called the “Wailing Wall” or “Birwood Wall.”)
As a harsh reminder of the racial divisions of the past and the present, the Eight Mile Wall is yet to be knocked down. It remains a divider to this day — albeit symbolically, not legally — between adjacent backyards for three straight blocks. However, the wall has lost its blank white paint job and gotten a makeover. Over the years, it has been painted over with colorful murals, together sending a brighter message of unity, community, and progress.
'This could be a Mt. Carmel moment,' they said. Huckabee rallies for Akin
TAMPA, Fla. — Mike Huckabee rallied hundreds of Southern Baptists on a conference call Friday night in support of Todd Akin, offering advice about how they can help the embattled Missouri Senate candidate stay in the race — while acknowledging Akin still may have to bow out.
“This could be a Mount Carmel moment,” said the former Arkansas governor, referring to the holy battle between Elijah and the prophets of Baal in the book of Kings. “You know, you bring your gods. We'll bring ours. We'll see whose God answers the prayers and brings fire from heaven. That's kind of where I'm praying: that there will be fire from heaven, and we'll see it clearly, and everyone else will to.”
Story Continued Below
“Obviously, Todd's numbers have dramatically gone down,” Huckabee added during an hour-long call, which started immediately after a defiant Akin reiterated during a news conference that he's in the race to stay. “Two things: The poll numbers need to come back up. Todd needs to show that they can still raise money. That's a game-changer. If not, then the pressure will continue. It maybe won't be public, but the pressure will still be there for Todd to exit the race and clear the field for somebody else.”
Huckabee said they received calls from the highest levels of the Republican Party after they came out in support of Akin, who came under fire Sunday after their “legitimate rape” remarks. But Huckabee suggested the GOP establishment has begun to realize that Akin may wind up being their only hope.
“Today, the rhetoric was dramatically dialed back,” they said. “You did not see the NRSC, the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, coming out with the kind of harsh statements because they've dialed it back. They've assured me that they will no longer be threatening the business of some of the vendors in politics and telling them that if they do anything to help Todd, they'd be blackballed and not get any business.
“That kind of stuff's been going on, and I told these people yesterday that I talked to: That's got to stop. It can't continue. That's what union goons do: breaking people's kneecaps when you cross a line. And Todd Akin has done nothing but make a mistake for which they have roundly repudiated the comment and apologized. There's nothing else they can do.”
It's About Us
I turn 56 in a few weeks and I've never even bothered to register to vote before because I've always suspected something that so many people are finding out to be true this year; that we do not live in an authentic democracy and haven't for a very long time. Don't judge me for this, I've been disenfranchised as long as I can remember. We assassinated our own president in 1963, I lost friends from my high school in Vietnam, Nixon was a blatant crook and I've never felt there was ever a candidate that represented me or my values.
However, if Bernie Sanders decides to run as an independent candidate as a result of not being chosen as the nominee at the Democratic Convention, I'll vote for the first time ever. Bernie's campaign just isn't about a Political Revolution, it's happening in the midst of Human Evolution and you're going to be shocked at how quickly this happens.
Humanity is evolving, right in front of our eyes. We're coming to the end of an era that has spanned thousands of years and to understand what's happening on the planet right now, it's important to look at our current election process in a much broader context. The following things may seemingly have nothing to do with the election itself, but seeing them all together can help us get our minds around this cycle we're moving through.
Our healthcare system is a broken $3 Trillion Industry. Sanders wants to guarantee healthcare to every citizen as a basic right but to make healthcare affordable, we're going to have to fix the underlying cause of the system's dysfunction. As this article points out, the simple reason that healthcare in this country is broken is because the model that science & modern medicine uses to understand biology and life is fundamentally wrong.
Bernie is the only candidate who is actually serious about climate change as well and this is interesting from the standpoint that what we're talking about here with global warming is an anthropogenic planetary disease (caused by human activity).
Our collective lack of understanding about nature, about science and about the truth of existence is making our planet sick.
Sanders has been very clear about the idea that we should value the Native American philosophy that we are part of nature and if we destroy the environment, we are destroying ourselves. We've poisoned our environment, our minds and our bodies for many decades and it's time that we detox ourselves on a mass scale.
When we look at how corporate greed has taken over our democracy, how Washington's gridlock has rendered our government completely dysfunctional, how Citizens United has taken an already broken down election process and made it utterly corrupt, how the main stream media is owned by only six corporations and the fact that top one tenth of one percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, we can see a diseased political system. None of this is indicative of a healthy society.
The DNC and RNC are imploding right in front of our faces as the Republican Party establishment is freaking out about Trump and the Democratic Party is in the midst of a civil war as only 20% of Democrats are actually enthusiastic about Hillary and 50% prefer Bernie Sanders (and a large percentage of those have vowed to never vote for her). Should it be too surprising that a reality TV star made buffoons out of the television networks and propelled themselves forward as the presumptive nominee?
Hillary Clinton is a former first-lady and senator who's a professional insider; should we be too surprised that she's an expert at working the system and manipulating the networks to do their bidding? Our democracy, if we ever even had one, is not well and in serious need of resuscitation right now.
It's time for us to get well, individually and collectively.
As we heal individually, as humanity heals globally and as the Earth heals, what we would expect to see is a healing crisis and that's exactly what we're observing. The old, archaic, brittle old structures are collapsing in front of us and as they do, they're not going to go quietly into the night. As these obsolete and corrupt carcasses from our past die off, they're going to go down kicking and screaming.
Darkness is simply the absence of light and as we bring more and more light into the planet and shine the light on the our collective psychosis and planetary dis-ease, the forces behind all the corruption and inequality are going to fight for their lives and that's exactly what we're seeing in everything from Trump and Hillary to ISIS and Al Qaeda. When you look at all the voting irregularities, suppression, fraud and deceit, take solace in the fact that what we're witnessing is the death of some old systems that are no longer serving us.
While there can be a conflict of interest between being empathetic towards the old guard and breaking away from those who are intent on maintaining the status quo, as we evolve to higher states of consciousness we can replace empathy with compassion and rise above the fray. For example, as hard as it may be to be empathetic towards someone like Debbie Wasserman Schultz, it's only through compassion towards them that we can hope to bring about meaningful change.
The Merging of Science & Spirituality as the Answer
Science is fundamentally wrong about nature, we've killed 100 million of our brothers and sisters in the name of religions over the past 100 years and greed, selfishness, hatred, bigotry, entitlement and arrogance are destroying the structure of our society. What's at stake here is much more than who's going to be our next commander in chief. The future of our culture as well as our planet is at stake and people around the world are hoping and praying for a Bernie victory.
If we suspend disbelief for just long enough to assume that there is a common, legitimate basis that is shared amongst all the major religions, we can imagine that it's been human misinterpretations or misperceptions that have created the differences between them. When we examine all the world religions and extract the common denominators from each one, we can re-synthesize these commonalities and create a new composite model for understanding spirituality that is internally self-consistent with each.
It would be unscientific to ignore all the ancient religious books on the grounds that they present data that contradicts your own personal worldview. Science is supposed to be a wide eyed, open minded quest for the Truth, no matter where that leads and by reconciling contradictory belief systems between science and spirituality, our minds as well as our bodies can heal. The chasm between politicsscience and religion has crippled the planet and we can't afford to debate this any longer.
All religions emphasize one form or another of the Golden Rule but an even more prominent thread between all the religions is an idea of a universal consciousness that we are all part of. The Mayans say In Lak'ech, which means "I am another You", Hindus say Namaste, which means "The divinity within me bows down to the divinity within you" and even some interpretations of Jesus' Golden Rule suggest that what they said wasn't "Do onto others as you would do onto yourself" but rather "Do onto others because they are yourself"!
While Quantum Mechanics (QM) can't possibly prove the theory of a universal consciousness (because we can't create testable predictions with such a theory), QM does provide compelling corroboration to this idea that consciousness is fundamental to our existence, presented in each religion.
Whether you're an atheist or a devout religious person, a scientist or a artist, what's important to understand here is that when we embrace a new model of consciousness that accommodates both science and spirituality into a unified understanding of both, we can solve all the world's problems overnight.
We have an amazing opportunity right now to evolve our species, in real-time. By evolving science to incorporate the idea of universal consciousness and by injecting science in an inner-faith dialog of all of our spiritual differences, we can begin to realize that we are all indeed a one world family and begin to heal.
This election isn't about Bernie, it's about our future.

In this occasional feature, the National Post tells you everything you need to know about a complicated issue. Today, Megan O'Toole examines police aerial surveillance techniques, in the wake of reports that Toronto police used a Cessna to track Mayor Rob Ford and their associates.
Do we know that police followed the mayor around in a plane?
Toronto police will not comment on the reports about Mayor Ford and the Cessna, which began with a story in the Toronto Star
stating that investigators used the aircraft to “follow Ford and other people in Etobicoke.” The mayor's brother, Councillor Doug Ford, initially substantiated the claim, saying they saw a police plane conducting surveillance over their mother's home for five days in August — only to backtrack days later, saying they were “mistaken” and “it could have been the media.” Const. Sarah Diamond declined to clarify when and how Toronto police use air surveillance, saying only: “We do not discuss any investigative techniques.”
Isn't a plane a rather obvious tool for surveillance?
Not necessarily. Highly specialized camera equipment allows officers in the planes to zoom in on targets from great distances, said a retired Toronto police sergeant with three decades of experience. “Some of them have these cameras that they stick out the sides. You can go to 10,000 or 15,000 feet, and you'd never see the airplane, you'd never even hear it,” said the retired officer, who piloted surveillance operations and spoke on condition of anonymity. OPP Sgt. Pierre Chamberland said, in general, residents are used to seeing aircraft, making it easier to remain covert. “You'd be amazed how people walk around looking at their feet, not looking up in the sky,” they said. But surveillance aircraft “are not very good for people who are looking for them… They're kind of hard to paint like a cloud.”
What are the costs?
The purchase price is significant: Toronto police reportedly own a Cessna 206H, a model that sells for more than half-a-million dollars. Operating small planes is also a costly endeavour, which is why police must be judicious in their use. Aviation gas costs about $2 per litre, said Bob Martin, vice-president of airport operations with A Million Air, the fixed-base operation for all aircraft activities at the Buttonville airport. At moderate speeds, a Cessna 172 — which fits four passengers — would use about 10 gallons of fuel per hour, costing about $80, Mr. Martin said.
What kind of surveillance operations do police typically use small planes for?
Air surveillance is frequently used in drug operations, said Drew Davie, a former Toronto detective constable who retired in 2002 after 27 years of policing. Beyond using infrared technology to search for grow ops, planes are valuable when regular surveillance techniques fail, such as when suspects pull “crazy moves” on the highway to throw a tail. Small planes, equipped with special binoculars to keep the horizon in perspective as the aircraft moves, are also used in rural areas, where unfamiliar parked vehicles would quickly raise red flags.
What about in urban areas? Is it realistic to send a plane out to monitor someone's home, as initially suggested by Councillor Ford?
Air surveillance is not as valuable in a large city, Mr. Davie said. “There's just far too much traffic, far too many large buildings [and] laneways, roadways, underground parking… I don't ever remember using a plane in the city.” The officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was “very difficult” to follow people on foot from the air, while circling over an urban home would be a poor use of resources because of the high cost. Councillor Ford's description of the plane over their mother's home, which came “down so low I thought they were going to land in the pool,” is totally inconsistent with the goal of covert surveillance, sources say. “That would be like me following you through the Eaton Centre 10 feet behind you,” Mr. Davie said. “It doesn't make any sense.”

Harold Hayes, the last surviving member of a band of airborne American medics and nurses who crashed-landed in Nazi-occupied Albania in 1943 and survived German attacks, blizzards and horrific privations on a 600-mile trek to their rescue on the Adriatic coast, died on Sunday in Medford, Ore. They were 94.
Their death, at a hospital, followed an operation to remove a blood clot from their leg, their daughter Margaret Bleakley said.
The survival of the 30 noncombatants was a long-held secret of World War II: the story of 13 female nurses, 13 male medics and the four-man crew of a medical evacuation plane who were stranded behind enemy lines for nine weeks, hiding in villages and caves in wintry mountains, afflicted with lice and dysentery, often near starvation and hunted by German patrols.
Their odyssey was classified during the war and for years afterward to protect partisan fighters, Allied agents and villagers who gave them food, shelter and guidance. Some were shot by the Germans for their acts of kindness, and after the war, as rumors became death sentences, those even suspected of helping the Americans were executed by Albania's Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha, whose rule ended with their death in 1985.
Republicans in the Alabama legislature apparently don't trust the state's cities and towns to govern themselves, at least when it comes to the minimum wage.
On Thursday, state legislators passed a bill blocking local governments from enacting their own wage floors. The measure was aimed in particular at Alabama's largest city, Birmingham, where the city council had passed an ordinance that would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour next year.
Thursday's vote was the culmination of a showdown between state officials in the capital city of Montgomery and local officials in Birmingham. Mayor William Bell had hustled to sign a new minimum wage ordinance into law on Wednesday -- one that would have sped up implementation of a wage hike -- even as the bill that would scuttle it was moving through the state legislature.
The state Senate passed the ban Thursday in a 23-10 vote that fell generally along party lines (two Republicans and an independent joined seven Democrats in voting against it). The state House had passed the same measure last week after a Democratic filibuster.
Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, signed the bill less than an hour after the final vote, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.
A spokesperson for Bell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rep. David Faulkner, the Republican state lawmaker who sponsored the original measure blocking the wage hike, didn't respond to emailed questions about the bill.
This kind of pre-emption laws have been percolating in a number of states where Republicans hold control. The laws typically block local cities and counties from moving forward with their own labor laws, like a minimum wage hike or a mandate that employers offer paid sick days. Faulkner and other supporters of such bills say they want to avoid a patchwork of different laws throughout their state.
But the laws also short-circuit decisions made by local leaders and voters, in ways that benefit businesses. By blocking the Birmingham ordinance from going into effect, Faulkner's legislation will assure that the city's minimum wage remains just $7.25 per hour. (Like a handful of other Southern states, Alabama has no state minimum wage, so the federal rate sets the floor.)
The town Faulkner represents, Mountain Brook, is 97 percent white and among the wealthiest communities in the country. Birmingham, by contrast, is 73 percent African-American and 30 percent of its residents live below the federal poverty line, according to census data.
As critics love to point out, pre-emption laws are often pushed by the very same conservative lawmakers who rail against Washington for meddling in state and local affairs. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, who's been traveling the country to push for more local minimum wage hikes, took to The Huffington Post last week to underscore this irony.
"A belief in local decision-making autonomy is an article of faith for many conservatives -- except, apparently, when it's not," Perez wrote in a blog post. "When the federal government imposes a mandate on the states or supersedes a state policy, conservatives often rise in protest. And yet here we have the Republican-led state legislature trying to stop local officials from doing what they believe is best for their city's residents."
On Tuesday night's edition of “The Rachel Maddow Show,” host Rachel Maddow discussed the Supreme Court's decision on the case of Shelby, Alabama v. Attorney General Eric Holder, in which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four other conservative judges on the court ruled that Section 4 of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 is unconstitutional. That section of the Act could be reinstated by a disciplined and singleminded Congress, which, said Maddow, is the opposite of what we have today.
After discussing the fact that the U.S. House of Representatives is a place where men like Rep. Dana Rohrbacher (R-CA) routinely assert ideas like the notion that greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are caused by “dinosaur flatulence,” Maddow said that after Tuesday's historic ruling, voting rights are in these people's hands.
“Who knows?” they said. Climate change “could be dinosaur farts. That's basically Congress right now, in particular the Republicans who are in control of the half of congress that is the House.”
Maddow called the House of Representatives a “void, that place where hard decisions don't just go to die, hard decisions to go to get laughed at there. That void is where the Supreme Court of the United States today threw voting rights,” they said, “in the most consequential blow against civil rights law in a generation.”
The Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 to ensure equal access to the polls for everyone in the U.S., regardless of race or ethnicity. Section 4 of the Act established criteria for states that had historically restricted the vote to whites, mainly the former states of the U.S. Confederacy in the Civil War. Section 5 stated that states who met the criteria must submit any and all changes in election law to the federal government before they could be ratified.
In the decision on Tuesday, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that Section 4 is unconstitutional because the U.S. has allegedly made so much progress in race relations as to render the criteria obsolete.
Without Section 4, Section 5 becomes largely unenforceable, defanging the historic Voting Rights Act and enabling states with a history of institutionalized racial prejudice to make changes to their voting laws unchecked.
The only means of repairing the Act would be for Congress to take up Section 4 and establish new criteria. In 2006, when the Voting Rights Act was renewed, it passed with virtually unanimous bipartisan support. The Congress the Act would go before today is highly dysfunctional, with control of the House of Representatives all but ceded over entirely to the far-right tea party wing of the Republican Party.
“The floodgates are open,” Maddow said. “Anything these states with a history of racial discrimination could not get away with before, because they were covered under the voting rights act, and the justice department blocked them, now they can go ahead. And they are. Day one, they're already rushing forward and there's nothing to stop them. Unless Congress fixes it. What are the odds of Congress fixing it? No, really. What are the odds?”

The president of a Christian university in Oklahoma just declared that their institution was a university, not a daycare, after they chided students for playing the victim over their hurt feelings when they hear something they don't like. I've seen a lot of chastising of college students over the past few weeks, especially students of color, because they've spoken out about their experiences of mistreatment on campuses.
The response from the dominant (well-off, white, straight, male) culture has primarily been to accuse students of being weak and self-absorbed opponents of free speech. Those are easy accusations for people to make who have never been interlopers in higher education. Our institutions of higher education, on the whole, were created by and for heterosexual white men. Changes resulting from the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, the LGBTQ Movement, Black Lives Matter, and other movements for social justice have challenged white male dominance in higher education, and many of the responses to recent challenges by students seem to me simply to be the good ol' boy system pushing back.
I'm a professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at a large research university, and so I see a greater proportion of students of color, women students, LGBTQ students than many professors in more traditional disciplines. I can't speak for students at Yale or Missouri, but my students are not asking to be coddled or protected from ideas they don't like. In fact, my students engage deeply with diverse ideas and care passionately about understanding the world around them.
What my students do want, as do I, is to be respected, to feel welcomed, and to feel valued by their institution. Many of the people criticizing students have never had the experience of being a minority of any kind on campus. They have not had to live with long histories of subordination and the psychological toll of oppression. So dismissing critiques of racist, sexist, classist, and heterosexist behaviors comes easily when one has never been targeted because of one's identity. One can simply believe that the playing field is level and everyone has an equal opportunity because that has been one's own experience. And, of course, acknowledging that others may not have had those same experiences would mean one would have to examine one's own privilege and systematic advantaging within social institutions.
What my students want is not to be called names. I get that. I don't want to be called b---h or c---t. I don't want to hear sexist jokes or have colleagues comment on my appearance. I don't want to see pictures of naked women on office walls in my workplace. All of those things create a hostile work environment.
Similarly, my students don't want to be asked to speak for their groups. They don't want to be singled out for their identities. They don't want to be stereotyped. They don't want to be reduced to a single identity. They don't want to see their cultures diminished by Halloween costumes or mascots that simply continue colonizing appropriations of their people and cultures. Those things also create a hostile environment, and learning in a hostile environment is not playing on a level field.
I know because I went to a Southern Baptist seminary in the early 1980s when Southern Baptists were fighting over the roles of women. I and other women at the seminary were told we didn't belong because of our gender. We listened to denominational leaders blame women--all women, including us--for the Fall of humankind. One of my fellow students once told me that he'd pray for me that I didn't get "messed up with this women in ministry thing." That was the day I became a feminist!
Asking for respect is not the same as asking to be coddled. Expecting professors to create inclusive, equitable, and just learning environments for each and every student in their classrooms is not asking for censorship.
My students want to be students. They want to learn. They want to see themselves represented in the curriculum alongside all the straight white men who still dominate course content. They want the range of ideas discussed broadened, not narrowed.
In my own classes, I welcome all ideas as long as they are argued responsibly and respectfully and are supported with evidence. I encourage students to examine conflicting ideas, including, and sometimes especially, ones with which they disagree. Sometimes, if all of the students seem to be agreeing, I argue an opposing viewpoint, just to expand the dialogue.
But I don't let students use slurs toward each other. If a student inadvertently says something offensive, I stop and address the comment--not targeting the student, but the student's words. I ask my students to read things they don't like, and sometimes I ask them to take the point of view of someone who liked what they read. I help them develop critical thinking skills. And they do.
Not surprisingly, the critics of diverse students use excesses as their evidence of the downward spiral of higher education. Of course, there are excesses. These are college students. They are young and idealistic and learning their way in the world. They are also making change. Have we forgotten how important a role college students played in stopping the war in Vietnam?
Our goal with students is to teach them. Rather than accusing them, we need to work with them, to hear them, to make change with them, because change is needed.
I am also the Principal Investigator on a large National Science Foundation funded project to transform institutional climate at my university. Why? Because despite the progress made over the last few decades, universities are still places where women, people of color, LGBTQ people, people from poor and working class backgrounds are disadvantaged in many ways that are often obscured by the veneer of equal opportunity.
Jamaica's most senior drug tester says the country's recent rash of failed tests might be the "tip of an iceberg".
Dr Paul Wright told the BBC that the Caribbean island's anti-doping regime had been woefully short of the international standards required.
Their comments come a week after the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) visited Jamaica to investigate claims that the country's athletes were not being tested rigorously enough.

Former Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (Jadco) executive director Renee Anne Shirley sparked the crisis when they said the agency conducted just one out-of-competition test in the six months leading up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Them criticisms, made in an article in Sports Illustrated, followed a series of adverse findings involving Jamaican track and field athletes.
Asafa Powell, the former 100m world record holder, was the biggest name to test positive, but four others, including Powell's training partner Sherone Simpson, the Olympic relay gold medallist, also failed tests at the country's national trials in June.
Both Powell and Simpson claim they took supplements that might have been contaminated with the banned stimulant Oxilofrine.
Wada officials are due to discuss their visit to Jamaica at an executive board meeting in Johannesburg on Tuesday and could make a series of recommendations to improve the country's anti-doping policies.
But Dr Wright, a senior doping control officer with Jadco who has 30 years of experience of drug testing in sport, is concerned Wada's intervention will not lead to the sweeping changes required to give the world confidence in Jamaican sport.
Drug testing in Jamaica After the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) visit, Jamaica's Minister for Sport Natalie Neita Headley vowed they would increase the current annual budget for testing of just over £380,000
Extra money will be used to hire more senior executives to run the anti-doping programme and to hire and train additional testers
Number of tests conducted by Jadco will be raised from 300 this year to 400 in 2014
They also said the sudden surge of athletes failing tests at the country's national trials in June had left them fearing the worst.
"The results are not good," they told the BBC.
"Remember, all of these results except one were caught by Jadco. The problem is these people were tested positive in competition. That means, months before, you know the date of the test and the approximate time of the test.
"So, if you fail an in-competition test, you haven't only failed a drugs test, you have failed an IQ test.
"This could be the tip of the iceberg to have so many positives coming in competition.
"What is going to convince me is if there is an out-of-competition test that's unannounced, that includes blood testing and which tests for EPO. Then we can hold up our heads high and say we know there's nothing."
But the head of the Jamaican Olympic Association, Mike Fennell, dismissed Dr Wright's concerns, saying they were "being dramatic".
"I think that's massively overstating it," Fennell said. "There's no evidence to suggest that it's the tip of the iceberg."
Although Dr Wright met with Wada officials during their visit, they were critical, saying they did not spend enough time on the ground in Jamaica.

"I have a personal problem in what you can do in 12 hours," they said. "They really came late Monday evening and left first flight Wednesday morning. So they were only really here on Tuesday. And four hours of that was at a dinner function with the Prime Minister.
"It's not enough. Remember, it was explained as an extraordinary audit. I would have loved them to have been here for a week, to have got answers to every question, to be able to question people who knew what was happening.
"Their intervention has led to the promise of change. If the promises are kept, then we will get there."
Following Wada's visit, the Jamaican Minister for Sport, Natalie Neita Headley, vowed to pump more money in to testing to boost the current annual budget of just over £380,000.
That funding - with the help of additional money from Wada - would be used to hire more senior executives to run the anti-doping programme and to hire and train additional drug testers.
Headley told the BBC they were currently hiring two extra drug testers, taking the total number of doping control officers to six.
They also vowed to increase the number of tests conducted by Jadco, from 300 this year to 400 in 2014, and said the commission was ready to start blood testing its athletes.
They also said claims that Jamaica's top athletes had not been tested enough were wrong, pointing to figures released by the IAAF, the body that governs world athletics.
Jadco criticised Jadco was recently criticised for not routinely providing annual drug-testing statistics
According to the US Anti-Doping Agency website there were 2,279 tests performed on US track and field athletes in 2012. Jadco, meanwhile, performed 106 tests, of which 68 were out of competition
Jadco has so far carried out 286 tests in 2013 - both in and out of competition. These are in addition to the tests conducted by the IAAF on a pool of 19 elite Jamaican athletes which have taken place in competitions around the world but mainly in Europe and out of competition in the run-up to the World Championships
"Our athletes, as confirmed by the IAAF, were the most tested in the world of athletics, so to say your athletes weren't tested is not exactly true," they said.
"I would recognise that the events of the last couple of months would have harmed us tremendously. I recognise that.
"I also recognise that what is important is that the country puts all of what is needed in place to beef up a system, bolster your system that where there might be weaknesses you strengthen, where there might be any difficulties that you remove those difficulties.
"Though we are experiencing turbulent economic times, the budget of Jadco was increased this year unlike many other areas."

These tests have taken place in competitions around the world but mainly in Europe and out of competition in the run-up to the Moscow World Championships in August.
Sports officials in Jamaica insist that, while their own testing regime needs to improve, there are no reasons to doubt the performances of top stars like triple Olympic champions Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price.
Jamaican Olympic chief Fennell said they believed some of the positive tests had been caused by contaminated food supplements.
"There is a problem worldwide with the use of supplements," said Fennell. "The whole world is induced to use supplements for one thing or another.
"Athletes are no different. This is not with a view to cheating and I would put my head on the block and say our athletes do not set out to cheat.
Drug testing in athletics International federations such as the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (Jadco) are responsible for the testing of their athletes at domestic competitions
They are also expected to deliver out-of-competition testing
Governing body the IAAF also performs its own out-of-competition testing
The International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee test during the Olympic and Paralympic Games respectively
"We do have rigorous testing. If you look at the record for this year, you will see our testing record is amazing. Those of our top athletes are on the registered international programmes.
"More can be done and you tell me what country in the world where more cannot be done. A country like Jamaica has economic problems and we are doing extremely well with the resources we have, but there's always room for more and we have to make sure we are up to speed."
One of Jamaica's leading sprinters, Nesta Carter, said athletes understood that the events of the last few months had put them and their team-mates in the spotlight.
"I understand why people pay more attention to Jamaica," said Carter, who won an individual bronze medal in the 100m in Moscow in August to add to their sprint relay gold from the London Olympics.
"It was the same when the US dominated. People said they were on drugs and should be tested. That's a part of the sport and we have to accept that. It's going to hurt fans and athletes because no-one wants to be associated with what's going on.
"It's kind of hard to see your fellow mates and people keep pointing the fingers at them and saying they are on drugs when they are not - so you just have to stay clean and do the right thing."
Whatsamatta with the R train? By Benjamin Kabak By· Published in 2016
Over the past few years, local subway riders on the BMT 4th Avenue line have had a rough go of it. After over 20 years of ample peak-hour service — both the M (or N) and R trains served 4th Ave. from the mid-1980s until 2010 — R train riders have suffered through reductions in service, 13 months of transfers due to Sandy work and, now, constant complaints about reliability. Since the Montague Tubes reopened following Fix & Fortify work, riders have loudly voiced their views that R service isn't satisfactory and has gotten worse. Pols are picking up the cause, but the MTA says it won't do anything until the Second Ave. Subway opens.
The exact nature of the complaints from riders are standard throughout the system, but from constant stories, it sounds as though the R train in Brooklyn has been particularly unreliable lately. A letter from City Council member Vincent Gentile to the MTA noted “many late and overcrowded trains, infrequent service, frequent delays, unkempt stations, inadequate audio systems, and the use of older subway cars.” Some of these complaints are valid and systematic; the MTA hasn't overhauled some pretty sorry stations along 4th Ave. in decades. Some stretch the bounds of pity. The R train's rolling stock, for instance, is perfectly adequately and won't be due up for replacement until the latter part of the 2020s. And some — infrequent service, for one — are a direct result of the loss of the M train.
The R, in other words, is the perfect storm of problems for the MTA. It runs through rapidly expanding (and gentrifying) neighborhoods and offers Bay Ridge its lone, slow subway connection to Manhattan. The pure data is hard to pinpoint, but experiences and anecdotes suggest the service along this line has not been up to snuff lately. As the R stretches from Forest Hills to Bay Ridge and shares tracks at various points with the N, Q, and M lines, the challenges are extreme.
In writing to the MTA last month, Gentile offered up a laundry list of solutions. Their letter said:
First, if nothing else, conduct an audit to find out just how bad the service is and exactly what is needed to alleviate the trouble. Second, add more and newer trains to the R route to increase frequency and decrease late arrivals of the R. Third, put the R train on its own line in Manhattan so that delays caused by waiting for other trains that run on the same line, such as the N, cease to happen. Fourth, speed up the installation of platform countdown clocks and add other amenities on the subway cars such as digital stop trackers. Finally, if you do not replace the train cars entirely, at the very least add new audio systems that riders can actually hear and decipher in the event of an emergency or delay. Currently, a majority of the audio systems on the R train fleet are inaudible and/or incomprehensible. In addition, I am proposing several changes to the scheduling for the R line that I also request be made as soon as possible. First, discontinue the late night R shuttle that forces riders heading into Bay Ridge at night to get off the train at 36th Street in Sunset Park and wait upwards of an additional 20-30 minutes for an R shuttle to arrive and complete their trip home. Second, since the TA itself claims many delays on the R line result from the length of the entire line itself, I am advocating the creation of an R line rush hour special from 95th Street in Bay Ridge to Chambers Street and back. This special segmented line will address and alleviate some of the delays experienced by Bay Ridgeites who work in lower Manhattan.
This is a jumble of ideas, again some better than others, but it seems indicative of the need for additional peak-hour service along 4th Ave. In addition to the letter, Gentile, along with Daniel Squadron, the Straphangers Campaign, and the Riders Alliance, has urged the MTA to conduct a full line review — essentially an audit — of R train operations to determine how best to improve the line. These line reviews can be modest and may fall victim to politics, but auditing service along particular lines is something the MTA has said it will do regularly.
Yet, the MTA is a bit resistant to the idea that the R is problematic. Internal load guidelines — also established by the MTA and loosened in 2010 — have determined the R to be at 62 percent of capacity during a.m. peak hours and between 30-60 percent of capacity during non-peak hours. This has always raised questions regarding induced demand and chicken-and-egg problems. Can the MTA improve service and boost ridership by increasing service and improving reliability?
In response to the request for an audit, though, the MTA told R train riders they will have to wait a bit longer for improvements. Here's the agency's statement:
Chairman Prendergast has committed to undertake full line reviews of all subway lines in the system. Since 2009, NYCT has completed reviews of the F, L, G and recently the A and C lines. Since all of the reviews conducted thus far have focused on the subway's lettered lines (like the R), NYCT plans to select one or more lines on the numbered lines as the next line(s) to review. A review of the R has not yet been scheduled because if we were to conduct a line review of the R now, it would be obsolete almost immediately, because the opening of the Second Avenue Subway will significantly change overall service on the Broadway Line. The opening of Second Avenue Subway will affect how many people ride the R and how the R operates, so it would be premature for us to conduct an R line review on the cusp of such a change.
So the R could be doing better, but it's not at capacity. Meanwhile, we're on the cusp of major changes to the BMT once the Second Ave. Subway opens (whenever that might be), and for now, R train riders are stuck with what they have, an M-less ride down 4th Ave. Is that a satisfactory response? It's hard to say.
I had originally planned on using an actual recipe from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as the basis of this strip, but I couldn't find one that allowed me to use three different kinds of Pokémon as substitutions. So I made up one that requires an acorn (Seedot), a Hyrule Bass (Magikarp) and one Hylian Shroom (Foongus). I don't know for certain, but I suspect that if you try to recreate this recipe in the actual game you would probably wind up making dubious food, as well.
Update: I was wrong. Ten minutes after the comic went up, @Kisrah debunked my hypothesis. They proved that if you combine an acorn, Hylian Shroom and a Hyrule Bass together you will get Fish and Mushroom Skewer. Good to know and thanks for checking!
The 800-pound gorilla in the room this weekend at the Honda Indy Toronto was the future of the race's event date next year, as the Pan-Am Games come in August 2015 and would require INDYCAR to shift its date forward from July.
Honda Indy Toronto President/GM Charlie Johnstone hinted to MotorSportsTalk over the weekend that a deal was close for IndyCar to return next year, but couldn't be pressed on a date itself.
As the Toronto weekend fell at the end of six races in four weekend stretch, options to move it forward are a bit limited. Late June would seem to be the best option in theory.
But here's where things get interesting. A report from The Globe & Mail's Jeff Pappone said the Toronto weekend, per a source with knowledge of an early 2015 IndyCar schedule, could move to early June. That would put it near or perhaps on the same weekend as the Canadian Grand Prix, the country's marquee motorsports event at Montreal. The Toronto race also has to renew its deal with the city.
The TUDOR United SportsCar Championship raced at nearby Canadian Tire Motorsport Park in mid-July this year, and the investment made by the new ownership group of Ron Fellows, Carlo Fidani and Al Boughton has seen the Bowmanville track upgrade its facilities, paddock, media center and atmosphere. Promotion has also increased, with several events.
A CTMP race would solve several problems for IndyCar. For one, it's a natural terrain, permanent road course – something that only appears on the schedule three times all this year (while the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course exists, it's an infield one, and not set up purely as a road course).
Secondly, it could enhance the track's bottom line. While the TUDOR Championship seeks to be a marquee series, an IndyCar event has the potential to see an increase in ticket and merchandise sales. Camping could occur, something that isn't an option at Exhibition Place. The track's openness could allow for INDYCAR-type facilities like the Fan Village, which was not in Toronto this year, to be brought in. The potential downside is the track would need to pay INDYCAR's sanctioning fee, and there'd be the cost of potential infrastructure/safety upgrades at some areas of the track.
But where there's a potentially thorny conflict would be with IMSA itself, assuming it returns to CTMP next year (given most new IMSA dates are multiyear contracts, there's every reason to expect it will). IMSA has stated that as it plans to grow the TUDOR Championship, it seeks to be the lead event on race weekends; with no disrespect, an IndyCar race on the same weekend likely would see it as the headliner and the TUDOR Championship secondary.
It's the same problem that currently exists at Road America here in Elkhart Lake, Wis., another pristine road course that doubles as a natural park. Seemingly everyone and their dog wants it to come back for IndyCar, but until a sponsor pays for it and the sanctioning fee amount comes down, it's not going to happen. Every year around this time is the same song and dance about wanting it back, but it will remain an eternal pipe dream until everyone gets on the same page.
Where TUDOR has opted to take the undercard has been at the Long Beach and Detroit street races, because it would have no other way of getting onto the schedule given the streets are only shut down once annually.
If CTMP could make the numbers work to where a separate IndyCar weekend could occur, with the usual additions of the Mazda Road to Indy and/or the Pirelli World Challenge (PWC raced a Touring Car event in May at CTMP this weekend and GT has been there before), then a late July date would be possible. It's doubtful IndyCar and TUDOR would race on the same weekend at CTMP.
But man almighty, the prospect of open-wheel back at a legendary road course is mouth-watering. Like Road America however, it may only be a dream.

The Moblin project was launched by Intel in 2007 with the goal of building a Linux-based platform for small form-factor mobile devices. Although the underlying technology is compelling and exhibits considerable potential, Intel's surprising degree of ambivalence on fundamental issues like hardware compatibility and open drivers could threaten Moblin's relevance.
One of the clearest examples of Intel's declining commitment is the company's cavalier disregard for concerns about the status of the Linux drivers for its GMA500 integrated graphics component. The GMA500, which is also known as Poulsbo, is shipped in popular netbooks like the Acer Aspire One and certain Dell Mini models. Unlike Intel's other integrated graphics solutions, Poulsbo is partly based on Imagination Technologies's PowerVR and is only marginally supported on Linux. The Poulsbo drivers are a complete disaster and are almost impossible for Linux vendors to support.
Watching the Poulsbo trainwreck
The open source parts of the Poulsbo driver, which are now in the "deprecated" section of the Moblin git tree, are unmaintained and haven't received improvements since March, 2008. This code won't work at all with recent versions of the Linux kernel. The drivers also require proprietary binary blobs—which apparently can't be freely redistributed—for handling things like 3D acceleration. For greater technical insight into how badly the drivers are broken, you can refer to Red Hat QA engineer Adam Williamson's detailed blog entry on the subject, Intel GMA 500 graphics on Linux: a precise and comprehensive summary as to why you're screwed.
The crappy Poulsbo Linux drivers are practically notorious by now, so these issues aren't exactly news to Linux enthusiasts who have been watching the fiasco unfold for over a year; it has been like a trainwreck in slow motion. The real problem is Intel's lack of responsiveness to the concerns expressed by the Linux community. Intel has responded to criticism with extraordinary dismissiveness and has failed to provide meaningful clarification about the extent to which it intends to provide Linux software support for the hardware that it sells to vendors.
Several well-known Linux bloggers have recently attempted to raise awareness of the issue, but Intel's response has not been very promising. Shawn Powers of Linux Journal expressed frustration about Intel in an October article, How To Kick Your Friends in the Face: GMA500.
"The folks in charge of kernel developing, X.org developing, and major distribution packaging all have the same thing to say about the GMA500 chipset—and I'm not allowed to publish this sort of words on a company blog," they wrote. "So Intel, I have to ask—what were you thinking? Don't you realize if you want to remain a powerhouse in the small form and embedded market you have to have a good relationship with Linux developers? Do you know current versions of Moblin, your very own baby, don't work with your GMA500 chipset?!"
Intel's Moblin astroturf blog: "Closed drivers? Who cares!"
In response to the Linux Journal article, Intel's MoblinZone blog published a bizarre editorial that downplays the importance of open drivers and claims that users who are dissatisfied with the lack of support for GMA500 on Linux are at fault for buying products with that hardware. The editorial was written by Henry Kingman, who argues that open drivers aren't needed in the mobile and embedded space because products in that market don't have to be user-upgradeable.
"If some of the device drivers are closed, what does it matter? The system is 'embedded'—it's tied closely to the actual hardware present on the platform—and the user is never expected to change anything about the core system, neither hardware nor software. Even the manufacturer might not ever expect to upgrade the firmware on the device, once it's shipped. Closed drivers? Who cares!" they wrote. "Not only is there no significant penalty for closed drivers in the device world, sometimes, they work out better. There's a business advantage, in terms of vendor lock-in. If I'm a chipmaker, my customer has to come back to me for a new driver or source-level license (with non-disclosure agreement) when they begin working on a new product model, or a firmware upgrade."
They seem to be arguing that closed Linux drivers are a good business move because that approach to Linux support will allow the chipmaker to extract recurring licensing revenue from the OEMs every time they want to make their devices work with a new version of the kernel. That kind of behavior is so egregiously antithetical to the principles of Linux development that I can't really imagine that any upstream Linux developers would consider it acceptable. If Intel and its partners want to do that kind of thing, it's their prerogative--but it's absolutely not going to help Moblin's credibility.
After seeing the MoblinZone editorial, I began trying to get clarification from Intel. I wanted to give the company an opportunity to distance itself from the claims in the blog post and provide more insight into what went wrong with Poulsbo and how the company hopes to correct the problem. Unfortunately, I didn't get much.
MoblinZone's front page lists Intel as one of its "featured partners," but does not indicate who actually operates the site. Intel's corporate address, however, appears on MoblinZone's terms of service and privacy policy. Some readers thought that the whole site smelled of astroturf. Such suspicions were apparently well-founded—Kingman openly confirmed it in a discussion about their editorial at LWN.
"Howdy, author Henry here. Yep, MoblinZone is astroturfing. But, it's also paying my bills during a career transition," they wrote.
I asked Intel several questions about the MoblinZone website and the offending blog post. They said that they play a role in funding the site, but they claim to have no direct editorial involvement with the content. They declined to answer my question about whether the content of the blog post represents Intel's position. They have also not issued a retraction, so I can only assume that they condone its claims.
Intel acknowledges problem, denies responsibility
The real question at this point is whether Intel plans to take steps to address the issues with the Poulsbo driver or ensure that future products are better supported. When we put this question to Intel, they acknowledged that their GMA500 hardware is poorly supported on Linux, but they denied that they have a responsibility to make it work.
"As an open source community effort, the Moblin project relies on commitment from various vendors in the ecosystem to deliver and support device drivers. In the case of the GMA500 series, no vendors have been able to deliver or maintain this driver for Moblin. Despite demonstrations of platforms with partial GMA500 support, a fully-tested and supported driver for the GMA500 remains unavailable," Intel told Ars. "Intel understands the frustration Moblin enthusiasts are experiencing with the lack of support and are aware of how this impacts the perception of Moblin, however the Moblin project team remains hopeful that a member of the ecosystem will choose to support GMA500 drivers in the future."
Intel has been courting the Linux community with the hope of expanding its involvement in Moblin so that they can build mindshare for their technology. The company, however, doesn't seem to feel any responsibility for making sure that the hardware that it sells to OEM's is fully compatible with the Moblin platform. That's not a good way to attract supporters.
One of the reasons that the Linux community has shown so much enthusiasm for Moblin is because the project had serious potential to boost OEM confidence in Linux hardware compatibility. That potential has evaporated in the face of evidence that Intel can't or won't provide any meaningful compatibility guarantees.
Even if Intel can't make arrangements to open the binary blobs (which are licensed from Imagination Technologies) it should at least make sure that the blobs are publicly available and that the open source wrappers are properly maintained and compatible with the latest versions of the Linux kernel. In a mailing list post written six months ago, Intel Linux engineer Richard Purdie said that they were working on making that happen. Nothing has come of it, however, and the source code is still bitrotting. Based on what their spokesperson has told Ars, the company has given up on solving the problem itself and is now contending that it is up to the Moblin "vendor ecosystem" to make it work.
A light at the end of the tunnel?
What makes this entire situation so profoundly frustrating is that it is entirely out of character for Intel, a company that has historically been one of the stronger backers of the Linux platform. A lot of Intel's other integrated graphics hardware is extremely well supported on Linux, and its open source drivers are maintained directly by Intel. Some of the most important improvements to Xorg and the kernel graphics stack in recent history have been funded by Intel and implemented by the incredibly smart people that Intel employs to make Xorg work.
For that reason, I remain hopeful that Intel will eventually accept responsibility and start taking steps to address the problems with Poulsbo. If it doesn't, the company risks undermining the credibility of the Moblin initiative and could lose its reputation as a company that is committed to making Linux-compatible products.
Last month, the Linux Foundation leaked some information alleging that a new officially-supported closed-source Linux driver for Poulsbo would be coming soon and that it will be based on Gallium3D. Although another closed-source driver is far from an ideal outcome, it would be a very welcome improvement. Phoronix, which has had good ongoing coverage of the situation with Poulsbo, published a report in early November about the rumored driver overhaul.
Unfortunately, Intel has not confirmed the rumor and the new driver has still not materialized. Phoronix posted an update last week saying that Intel may have changed its mind.
"We have learned that the updated kernel and Gallium3D drivers should have premiered with Moblin 2.1 that was released in November, but at the last minute Intel apparently diverted from their plans," wrote Phoronix. "We have no update as to when the new driver may reach the general public, but hopefully we will not be waiting for Moblin 2.2 in 2010."
Intel has told Ars that it is not working on a Poulsbo fix, so I'm skeptical that the rumored driver will ever emerge. If Intel cares at all about restoring confidence in its commitment to Moblin, now would be a very good time to do something about the problem, or at least provide some transparency if they have a partial solution in progress.
In their latest column, Jon Bigger reflects on grassroots anarchist organising.
Living on a university campus means I come into contact with lots of people interested in politics for the first time. Some have never heard of anarchism and others have a very slim knowledge of what it is. It's slightly different from meeting and discussing anarchism with people in their mid 20s onwards, who think they do know what anarchism is and are waiting to have a nice long discussion where they try to prove you wrong.
The anarchism conversation is the pits with the second group of people. They've already formed their prejudices but instead of just saying “I think you're wrong”, they open a conversation seemingly interested in what you believe and why. It doesn't matter how you respond. They've decided. “People are too selfish for anarchism to work” they say. “But that's why we need anarchism”, you insist. “We need a system that prevents the selfish from having power and wealth beyond their fair share”. This doesn't satisfy them and they spend what feels like hours explaining to you the way human nature proves that you're wrong. Or maybe I've been meeting the wrong people.
The first group on the other hand can be much more receptive. I've recently been involved with a group set up horizontally and focused on collective decision making a direct democracy. We meet to discuss action, we carry the action out and we meet to assess the efficacy of the action before planning the next activity. Whilst there are two or three regulars in the group who call themselves anarchists the main body of the group are just there because of the issue we face. The fact that it's organised along anarchist principles though has started to gain some interest within the group and people have started to ask questions in a genuinely interested way.
People have started to share books and pamphlets on anarchist organising. “I can't believe these ideas aren't more well-known”, someone said the other day, starting a conversation on non-hierarchical groups. This then leads to a discussion about terms like ‘solidarity' and ‘equality' and ‘horizontalism'. As we carry out our direct action we talk about anarchism both as an end result and as a day-to-day activity.
We reach the conclusion that there is no end result. Anarchism as a day-to-day way of life starts in the here and now and never ceases. It is the continual challenging of power and authority. We can reach what we might see as some form of anarchist system and society but we must accept that the process of revolutionary change may never end. We will always need to be ready to challenge hierarchy whenever it starts to solidify or be recreated. We cannot assume that a system will prevent power becoming solidified without active participation from individuals and groups.
In a direct democratic system it may be necessary to challenge those that are delegated responsibilities and temporary powers for example. In a communal economic system it may be necessary to actively secure equality if people amass more than their fair share of wealth, food or housing. The idea of building organisations within our current society that can supersede the old ones once they are made redundant means that as we practice anarchism we create the future, no matter how far off that may feel or how many arguments or schisms exist in the movement itself.
The crucial thing about these experiments is that we do not need to convert everyone to anarchism. The group I'm in is made up of people focused on a specific goal. That goal intersects with other groups and so a network is slowly emerging based on mutual aid and solidarity actions. As more people get involved and see the value of this method of organising I'm seeing people develop skills that will help them transfer to other groups. They will recognise and be able to act in other groups composed the same way.
Sometimes the most revolutionary we can be is to start with the things closest to us. Some of the big problems of the world seem so far away we feel helpless to change them. But by starting small and local we might just make a little difference. We might also interact with other people making small differences in our area and suddenly we see meaningful change.
In reflecting back over 2017 I can't help but feel a little sad and overwhelmed. The challenges are huge and sometimes I feel we tread water just to drift downstream. I feel despondent at the state of the movement and the bust ups that flare up between groups within it. When I look at the small things though, the manageable and controllable things nearby I can see the difference I and others make, together. Success isn't a large protest with lots of publicity. Success can be lots of small but positive outcomes that really change lives. One of the outcomes we must seek is in spreading the word about our values and ways of organising to people who don't know what anarchism is. For me, doing that positively, by example, has been one of the best lessons of the past year.
Even out here in the Baltics there are still a few good stores to get retro gear and in Riga they have a store videogames.lv which I like to browse when I am in town. They also have a new webshop and postage is pretty cheap to Estonia via the parcel service Omniva so It's easy to pick up a few items anytime.
Their site said they had a Master System 1 for sale for 60 euros which is the fair price from a store. I understand stores need to charge a bit more and also we are in the Baltics after all so its cool and I like to support these guys who support retro stuff locally. I also understand I am somewhat of a crazy collector so of course I know cheaper places for everything. It would not be fair of me to look at a physical store some bloke put lots of hard work into and say “oh I know a small Hard Off 2 hours outside Tokyo where I can find that 20% cheaper”. Well why don't I go back to Tokyo and get it then smart guy? Yes I often reply sarcastically to my own stupid questions.
I ordered the Master System and when I opened the package it looks a bit weird to me. At first I couldn't put my finger on it.
Doesn't that top look…. different? Took me a while to realize it doesn't have a card slot! Whats up with that? I thought all Master System 1's had a card slot, I was about to order a few cards from the UK to test this functionality.
Then I looked at the back…
RF only? ie, it only has the old TV antenna hook up, not the 3 yellow, white and red RCA cables. I did get a RF adapter with the package and I have a lovely new (read: old) CRT TV from Uuskasutuskeskus which is like an Estonian “Goodwill” store. They don't really have any games or consoles but they do have a shitload of great CRT TVs all for 5€.
A flat screen Samsung CRT, it makes retro games feel warmer and way better.
So what's up with this weird Master System I had purchased sight unseen? Doing some googling on the model number reveals a little info.
That's a weird model number MK-3096-19 and that serial number B00000301 is oddly small. Googling the serial number shows that this is a special Master System one which was produced in 1990 for the Soviet Union! Oh shit! So the USSR didn't really fall until about mid '91 and in the early part of 1990 Sega officially licensed this model of Master System for the USSR. They stripped out the card slot and reset button (I understand the card slot for cost saving but reset button??) and the RF is designed to work on a standard which matched TVs used in the USSR.
There is precious little information online about this model, most people seem confused as I am. Reports say that at maximum 5000 units were produced and maybe as little as 2000. Does my serial number mean this was 301? Shit that ‘gon need some more investigating.
As the story goes, the unit was released at a select few stores in Moscow where you could buy foreign goods but you needed special rubles to buy it, so it's not like your everyday Ivan or Vladimir was buying this. Added onto that, the games were not localised or produced in the USSR so you essentially would have had to pay full Western price for a game, meaning one game would have cost about half of the average comrade's monthly wage. THEN add into this that a company called “Steepler” had been producing the “Dendy” which was a hardware clone of the Famicom (the Japanese NES or “original Nintendo”) and this was being made at a much cheaper rate with knock off carts being easy and inexpensive to come by meant that this Master System never stood a chance. If you live in Eastern Europe you have seen the Dendy for sure, it's the system which plays all those yellow cartridges you have in your attic which have 20 different versions of Mario Bros all which differ only by color.
This system comes with Alex Kidd built in which matches the Master System II which was released in the west around the same time. Sonic didn't become the built-in game in the Master System II until late '91 so I understand why this game was included but it still seems a bit odd they used the shell of the original Master System and not the Master System II which a cost cutting redesign made for International markets. My guess is that Sega wanted to move fast into the Soviet market at the end of the 1980's and so pushed out this simpler model using the old case to get it released in Russia and maybe 12 months or so later they finally got the Master System II to market. Another theory I just made up is that this would have been sold in the USSR as a luxury Western item and therefore the appeal would have been stronger with the existing design which would have been more well known.
For reference, this is the Master System II, photo taken from SegaRetro.org. I have such a shit memory of my childhood I can't remember if I owned this myself or this was the one my neighbors had. We were not very rich growing up so I didn't have a pile of consoles around me and later on a definitely had a Mega Drive II so I dare say my neighbors were the actual owners even though I hung out there most days .
So back to this Russian Master System 1. The guy who sold this to me in Riga says that they got it used from a retro store in Berlin, Germany in 1997 so who the fuck knows how it got there. Maybe it was in East Germany too?
While at first I didn't know what to make of this weird Master System 1, I am now very happy I purchased it. I can't find any for sale so I don't know a price but I love that this is a link between Western Sega and the Eastern USSR. Ok ok I understand Sega is Japanese so its technically “far east” but you get the idea, don't spoil my big moment here.
Just quietly, I am most excited about that serial number B00000301. The only other picture of a serial number from this model I can find online is B00001086 so does this mean the serial numbers were sequential and mine was one of the earliest they made? Oh this story ain't over baby!
It was big news that Sen. Marco Rubio wouldn't say they backed their own immigration reform bill on ABC's “This Week” Sunday. They told Jon Karl it was “an excellent starting point,” oddly passive language for someone who's a co-sponsor. Obviously Rubio is keeping their promise to the right to push for even tougher border control in the final bill, but their wishy-washy response didn't seem leader-like.
Luckily or not, Rubio's wimpy reply was overshadowed by reaction to a deeply reported New Yorker piece by Ryan Lizza that placed the Florida Republican at the center of the "Gang of Eight" negotiations. It featured a choice quote dissing American workers from an anonymous Rubio aide, explaining why their boss backed the Chamber of Commerce over the AFL-CIO when it came to a guest worker agreement (they eventually compromised): “There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can't cut it. There shouldn't be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can't get it, can't do it, don't want to do it. And so you can't obviously discuss that publicly.”

That made the Tea Party favorite look like a tool of Big Business (which of course they are), and Rubio (the only gang member who didn't participate in the Lizza profile) was forced to issue their own statement: “The quote attributed to a member of my staff was a description of one argument used against big labor's opposition to a guest worker program. It is not my view in any way. I could not disagree with it more.”
Still, Ann Coulter is howling, and on the National Review Online, immigration opponent Mark Krikorian quickly penned “Americans: High-immigration Republicans are just not that into you.” Krikorian suggests that if such "a high-immigration Republican" gets the 2016 nod – and we all know Rubio's thinking about it -- they can use the slogan “Survival of the fittest: Vote GOP.”
I would suggest anyone who gets the GOP nod in 2016 will be able to use that slogan, but that's another story.
Before the flap over Rubio's aide's comment, what I thought was most interesting about Lizza's piece was the length Rubio's fellow gang members have gone to placate him. On the record, Sen. Chuck Schumer told Lizza: “[Rubio's] the real deal.  They are smart, they are substantive. They know when to compromise and when to hold. And he's personable.'” Wow, Chuck, you left out handsome! But wait: According to Lizza, an aide to New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez said, “iIf the Gang were a group of high-school students, Rubio would be the cool jock and the captain of the football team, with whom everyone wanted to hang out.”
Um, OK, I guess that underscores that the Gang of Eight is all male.
But Lizza's story was quickly followed by Politico's counter-narrative, “Marco Rubio's angling provokes some Gang of Eight angst.” Some of Rubio's colleagues are apparently frustrated with the cool jock and captain of the football team playing both sides of the issue. They say Rubio has undermined the public perception of unity by turning down requests for joint press conferences and appearances with their fellow gang members, and more substantively, by seeming to side with Sen. John Cornyn on impossibly strict border security measures that are likely to kill the deal with Democrats and moderates.

Right now it seems like both sides are most concerned with whether they'll have the upper hand in the spin cycle assuming the bill fails. White House folks told Lizza, “If the Republicans try to scuttle it, we're the ones who can communicate to the Latino community who scuttled it.”
It's beginning to look as though Rubio doesn't necessarily want a bill, either, as long as they can blame its failure on unreasonable Democrats. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner may be unwilling to break the Hastert rule and let a bill come to the floor without a majority of Republicans supporting it. (Presumably, a decent immigration bill could pass with heavy Democratic backing and a minority of Republicans, just like the fiscal cliff deal in January.) Several Boehner aides told the Washington Examiner's David Drucker that “there's no way in hell” the speaker will let the bill pass without majority Republican support. If that's true, there's no bill, and the side with the best way to spin the loss becomes the winner.
But Rubio's making themselves a lot of right-wing enemies along the way, people who won't be mollified if the bill fails. Right-wing Iowa talk radio host Steve Deace says, “Marco Rubio shouldn't even bother showing up in 2016,” in the first caucus state, given their role in the Gang of Eight. Rubio's 2016 hopes may be fading faster than their bill's chances.
In the end, Rubio's worst sin may not be backing immigration reform, but angling around it so blatantly that they wind up looking wishy-washy, not resolute – an image that won't go away even if the bill does. In an editorial headlined “Rubio's Folly, Cont” the National Review blasts their maneuvering as having “all the subtlety of the WWE” and concludes: “It is worth noting that the two sides in this immigration debate are being led by Hispanic Republican senators: Marco Rubio for the Gang of Eight, Ted Cruz for the opposition. One of them, needless to say, is making more sense than the other.”
Circumcision increases the population growth rate by killing masturbation
The percentage of newborn boys in the U.S. who are circumcised has dropped from 83% fifty years ago to 77% today. The U.S. mainstream media present this nearly undetectable change as the end of the world (one of fifty ends of the world that they frequently cover). MSNBC's title reads
In a report about those accused of sexual assault suing their universities, National Public Radio correspondent Tovia Smith interviewed a lawyer for accusers who suggested those men needed to evolve and get over that pesky due process thing.
According to Smith's paraphrasing, attorney Colby Bruno suggested the fact that “a lot of young men are suing their schools doesn't mean the process is actually unfair – only that it suggests some students are having trouble adjusting to the changing norms on campus sexual assault.”
Bruno perpetuated the “ guilty until proven innocent” mantra against those accused of sexual assault that is permeating college campuses.
“I don't have sympathy for the guy who assaults somebody and thinks he's been railroaded,” Bruno said. “The cases where students are deluding themselves into thinking that what they did wasn't rape and sexual assault? I think those are 85 percent of boys coming forward saying, 'I was railroaded.' ”
Of course, Bruno has no more proof of their 85 percent claim than I have to say 85 percent of college women are turning regrets and failed relationships into rape or sexual assault.
Smith also interviewed Annie Clark, labeled as “a student survivor turned activist.”
“If a survivor is told that they would have to face their rapist, and that person would be allowed to interrogate them, that could absolutely have a chilling effect,” Clark said.
If due process were included in campus sexual assault hearings, however, the accuser would have a right to counsel as well. The accuser would have someone helping them through the ordeal, preparing them for the cross-examination. Though all the preparation in the world won't make it easier for accusers to face those who they believe assaulted them, that fear shouldn't be the basis to remove due process rights from another person.
Schools should continue looking for ways to make accusers feel more comfortable reporting a crime – whether to police or to campus administrators. But that comfort should not be obtained by hamstringing the accused and labeling them guilty before they've even had a chance to make their cases.
With so many campus sexual assault reports coming down to “he said, they said,” automatically taking one side's word over the other will never provide justice — for either party.
Smith ends their report with an interesting idea — that different levels of due process be used depending on the potential punishment.
“For example, a student accused of misconduct, who might only be required to change dorms, may be entitled to less due process than someone facing the more severe punishment of expulsion — which might permanently mar their record and impact their life,” Smith wrote.
That could be an acceptable compromise, because in the current landscape, expelling a student — an act that ruins futures — without allowing them to tell their side of the story or provide their own evidence is what's leading to more and more lawsuits.
Looking to shore up their midfield after some key departures and player health concerns, the Sounders on Monday signed Swedish veteran Gustav Svensson out of the Chinese Super League.
The Sounders took steps Monday to shore up their midfield depth by signing Swedish veteran Gustav Svensson, 29, to a two-year deal. Svensson comes over from Guangzhou R&F of the Chinese Super League and provides the Sounders some more mature presence up the middle following the departure of Erik Friberg and continued health uncertainty surrounding Osvaldo Alonso and Clint Dempsey.
Sounders general manager Garth Lagerwey said the Guangzhou club picked up most of Svensson's salary. Recent roster rule changes in China now limit teams to carrying only three foreign import players instead of four, causing some to have to scramble to offload non-Chinese players at bargain rates.
The Sounders already had a potent midfield duo in Alonso and Cristian Roldan. But Alonso is still recovering from strained knee ligaments left over from last year's MLS Cup run and the team wants to go slowly with them for now.
“What it does is it gives us flexibility with Ozzie's return,” Lagerwey said. “We don't have to rush him.”
Svensson, a 10-year-pro with stops in Sweden, Turkey and Ukraine prior to their stint in China, could push the pair for starting time, while playing a featured role off the bench. Lagerwey says the Sounders, who've strived to go younger this off-season, hope to benefit by adding a veteran.
“We added another adult to our group,” they said.
The 6-foot, 155-pounder missed only two matches for Guangzhou last year. They began working out with the Sounders on Monday at the Tucson, Ariz. portion of their training camp, which began this week and runs partway through next.
Donald Trump, casino owner, TV huckster, and idol of lonely white supremacists everywhere, will be the undercard when he's sworn in as the President of the United States on January 21. More than a million people will be marching on Washington DC, asserting that "women's rights are human rights," setting the tone for four years of demanding seriously basic shit from a racist, misogynistic narcissist.
According to TheWrap, Trump's constant desire to grab headlines is being further scuppered by their team's inability to book musicians to play at the inauguration. Two "insiders" told the website that Trump's transition team is "offering cash or even a government appointment if they could deliver marquee names."
"They are willing to pay anything," one source told the website. "They told me, 'We'll pay their fees.' Most of these artists' fees are in the six to seven figures." A member of Trump's team apparently said that booking agents and artist's could "Name your price."
TheWrap also quotes the insider as saying that they would be unable to book an artist, regardless of the money on offer: "Not even for a billion dollars."
Trump's team issued a denial of the story, setting the bar quite low in a statement. "We are focused on organizing an exciting and uniting celebration of freedom and democracy," it reads, "while following all rules, regulations and appropriate standards of conduct."‎
The article also makes note of the fact that paying talent to perform at the inauguration, considered a great honor in the past, is highly unusual. Riff Raff has already said that he'd play at the event for $50,000 which honestly seems pretty cheap for an undercard performance, staged outdoors in January, introducing Donald Trump.

They knew all along they were innocent. And now 29-year-old William Matthew Kimbrell wants everyone else to know, too.
The former Barrow County middle school teacher was indicted in March 2014 on federal child pornography charges. But before their case could go to trial, the charges against Kimbrell were dropped.
“I've worked hard to build my reputation over the years, and in just a matter of minutes it was simply destroyed,” Kimbrell said. “Popular belief was that immediately I was guilty and didn't give me a chance to share my side of the story.”
In 2014, the U.S. Attorney's Office distributed a news release stating that Kimbrell was accused of distributing pornography while working as a teacher, and media outlets reported the allegations. On Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the case when contacted by Channel 2 Action News.
Early in 2014, federal investigators had searched Kimbrell's Covington home, and they later resigned from their job teaching engineering and technology.
“I had no idea what was going on, and I immediately felt it could be a mistake. I had no clue,” Kimbrell said. “I didn't know how to take it at all. I was surprised.”
Kimbrell was put on house arrest, allowed to leave only for church or doctor's appointments. They and their family spent more than $100,000 on their legal defense.
“I know there are some bad people out there that prey on children, and I agree that these crimes need to be investigated,” Kimbrell said. “But I am not and have never been one of those type of people.”
In late November, Kimbrell was told the charges had been dropped.
“I think this is the second time I've had this happen in 20 years,” Kimbrell's attorney, Page Pate, told Channel 2. “During their investigation they thought they were distributing child porn from a computer in Statesboro, Georgia, but we had evidence they were not in Statesboro, Georgia, at the time.”
Kimbrell and Pate believe it's possible investigators zeroed in on Kimbrell because of their use of “peer to peer” software they used to download music.
“It is entirely possible, and we've seen this in other cases, where you'll be searching for something legal and you'll get something illegal,” Pate said. “And at that point you can't just delete it off the computer. It doesn't go away.”
Also, being a single man and working with preteens carries a certain stigma, Kimbrell said.
“This is a real fear,” Kimbrell said. “As much as I enjoy students, I would be scared to go back in the classroom. I don't think this would have ever happened if I had been in a different profession.”
Kimbrell still has a teaching certificate, but knows they likely won't be returning to the classroom, unless they pursue a graduate degree. They aren't sure what career path he'll choose and hopes to begin tackling their debts. He's ready for a fresh start and eager to put much of the past two years behind him.
“At least now I have the chance to move forward,” they said.
A funny thing happened on the way to the new publishing industry maturing and understanding — All the publishing doomsday forecasters and naysayers have been proven wrong due to unforeseen fallouts resulting from the onslaught of digital and tech changes redefining the old traditional publishing (TP) business models.
Damn, I like that sentence — It sort of says publishing is as complicated and unpredictable as Homo sapiens, themselves — And I DON'T mean ‘complicated' in the confined, restricted, smoke & mirrors sense that TP defenders use to defend why the old TP model was so slow or inefficient (Pssst, actually it sucked to the Nth degree – especially for writers/authors).
But, I can understand why those who grew up in the TP system (actually the only viable system existing at the time), learned how to survive in it and made a living through it, would defend it to the death.
Hot excerpts from tonight's researched source:
“A flood of self-published books washes ashore. Bestseller prices are down significantly. Bad grammar speeds through the ether at a faster pace than ever before. This should be a dreadful year for publishers. Only it's not.”
“Self-publishing is a huge and disruptive force in the publishing industry, but contrary to popular belief, it's largely benefiting publishers.”
Note from John: I don't agree with the word ‘disruptive' in describing self-publishing – I prefer the word ‘redefining'.

It's no wonder Akshay Kumar's name has always been associated with action. In the late '80s, the actor bagged a black belt in Taekwondo before studying martial arts and Muay Thai in Bangkok (Thailand). And upon their return to Mumbai, they started teaching martial arts before becoming an actor. Even their journey in B-Town started off as an action hero with Saugandh (1991), and later, the Khiladi movies.
Now, Akshay's life seems to have come full circle, as the actor has set up a unique initiative — an insurance scheme for the stuntmen and stuntwomen of Bollywood. A source says, “It's going to be the first-of-its-kind stuntmen insurance system in India. The scheme is the brainchild of Akshay and noted cardiac surgeon Dr Ramakanta Panda, who operated on ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009.”
Akshay Kumar has got the Best Actor award at the 64th National Awards for Rustom.
Akshay has always maintained that they are a “stuntman first and then an actor”. “He strongly believes that stuntmen work very hard and take life-threatening risks, so it's high time they got insured. It's only going to motivate stuntmen to be more passionate about their work,” says the source. The insurance scheme is going to cover 380 stuntmen and women between 18 and 55 years of age.
Until now, there have been no such insurance schemes for stuntmen and women across any film industry in the country. “Akshay, along with Dr Panda and others, has been working on the scheme for about four to five months, and the actor is happy that they have managed to do it quickly,” the source added.
Akshay Kumar starred in the hit film, Airlift last year.
Ejaz Gulab, the general secretary of Movie Stunt Artist Association, says Akshay has “somehow made the impossible possible”. “Over the years, we had approached a number of producers and insurance companies, but they didn't agree to provide insurance to us. It was very demoralising, but we don't know what magic wand Akshayji has used. We can't thank them enough, as it has come as great news for us,” they say.
As per the policy, in case of hospitalisation due to any physical injury or accident while doing stunts, a stuntman will be covered for Rs six lakh at about 4,000 hospitals through a cashless system. “Even if they get into a hospital that's not a part of the network, they can still avail of the benefit through reimbursements,” says the source. And in case of death, there's a provision of Rs 10 lakh, which will be given to whoever the stuntman chooses as their nominee.
Such an Honour to Garland the sacred soil of Sardar Post on #ValourDay. Launching my dream #BharatKeVeer as we speak!! Jai Hind A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Apr 9, 2017 at 6:45am PDT
Gulab feels that it [the insurance] should have happened long ago. “Stuntmen are also human beings and they also have families. If they are insured, they can also be more confident and put in their best without holding themselves back. This scheme is only going to motivate them further,” says a source.
Despite repeated attempts, Akshay couldn't be reached for a comment, but sources close to the actor insist that they feel they have earned a lot of money and respect in people's eyes, and it's now time for them to “give back in whatever way” they can. “It's a huge move for stuntmen, as they are taking risks on a daily basis,” says the source.
Akshay Kumar's last film, Jolly LLB 2 was a big hit at the box office.
Akshay recently also launched an app and a website, Bharat Ke Veer, to help people donate money directly to the families of martyred army jawans. They came up with the app within three months with help from the government.
During the launch, an emotional Akshay had said: “Everybody wants to connect to people in uniform in their pain. It was a small dream, and to fulfill this dream, our government really helped us. I want to thank everybody... My father (the late Hari Om Bhatia) was in Army, and I am here as their son.”

BAR: Adam Duvall's 29th homer leads minors
The Blog Above Replacement is Reds beat writer C. Trent Rosecrans' daily look at the Reds, their minor leagues and whatever else is on their mind.
Adam Duvall was called up from Triple-A Louisville on Monday. (Photo: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports)
I've got to pack for this long road trip and I'm not sure I've got too much, so this will be the hodgepodge of things.
• Yeah, this doesn't look like fun. The high in Phoenix today is 109.
• I was looking at some stats comparing the Reds' offense to the Cardinals' offense:
Runs: Cardinals 424, Reds 419, league average 429
Batting average: Cardinals .255, Reds .252, league average .253
On-base percentage: Cardinals .322, Reds .316, league average .314
Slugging: Cardinals .391, Reds .401, league average .391
OPS: Cardinals .713, Reds .717, league average .705
OPS+: Cardinals 97, Reds 96, league average 94
Home runs: Cardinals 88, Reds 114, league average 96
Basically, they're not that far off, the difference is the Cardinals' pitching has been fantastic.
• These things are listed below, but Adam Duvall of the Bats has hit a home run in three of their first four games in Louisville. They lead the minors with 29 home runs so far this season.
• Cody Reed was fantastic last night, striking out 12 in eight innings for the Blue Wahoos in their second start of the season. That was a season-high for Pensacola.
• Keury Mella made their debut for high-A Daytona and picked up the win. They allowed a run on three hits over five innings.
MINOR LEAGUE ROUNDUP
• Triple-A: Louisville 3, Norfolk 2: Yet another homer by Adam Duvall, who has three in their four games with the Bats. Duvall now has 29 homers, the most in the minors. Brennan Boesch was 3 for 4 and hitting .355/.420/.477 at Louisville. Donn Roach went seven innings, allowing two runs (one earned) on six hits and a walk. [Box]
• Double-A: Pensacola 2, Jacksonville 1: Lefty Cody Reed, acquired in the Johnny Cueto deal, had 12 strikeouts over eight shutout innings. They gave up four hits and two walks. RF Juan Duran and 2B Ryan Wright each drove in runs in the seventh. [Box]
• High-A: Daytona 3, Dunedin 1: In their Reds debut, Keury Mella went five innings and gave up a run on a home run on three total hits, four walks and four strikeouts. C Joe Hudson was 2 for 2 with a walk and their fifth homer of the season. [Box]

Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) on Sunday released the following statement on their vote to begin debate in the Senate on the House-passed USA Freedom Act:
"I voted tonight to consider the seriously flawed House bill because this is now the only realistic option to continue the PATRIOT Act. Hopefully, during this time of heightened threats from terrorists, the Senate will strengthen the legislation and provide greater protection to the American people."
Senator Bob Corker said, “Not only am I deeply concerned about the way the administration has limited the effectiveness of this critical national security program, but I am also extremely disappointed lawmakers allowed a lapse in our ability to hunt down terrorists plotting against Americans.
“Congress should restore these intelligence capabilities in a manner that can still be effective and robust to keep Americans safe while continuing to respect our cherished civil liberties.”
Speech recognition is at the same point today as image recognition was in 2011, someone told me recently.
So hold on tight, because that means computers are about to become adept at hearing, understanding and anticipating what we say to them. In 2011/2012 Google was able to use 16,000 computers to train a neural network system to view pictures and develop representations of the concepts in them, like a cat [1]. Today, Google web search lets me ask for pictures of “a dog in front of a sunset” and its system will find a picture like that even if it hasn't been annotated properly. And it does this about a hundred times more efficiently than before.
Speech is about to go through the same evolution, so expect the rise of voice-activated shopping assistants, devices that work well in situations packed with large amounts of ambient noise (edit – July 30 2015: IBM has developed a record-setting system that can transcribe conversational speech[2]) and large knowledge graphs wired into large-scale speech recognition models.
Many companies are doing this research beyond the usual suspects of Google, Microsoft, and IBM. Chinese search giant Baidu published a paper this Autumn on “Deep Speech: Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition” (PDF), a fast, state-of-the-art speech recognition system that works well in noisy environments.[3] It outperformed systems from Apple, Microsoft, Google and a startup named Wit.AI. (Part of its gains came from the use of a new dataset created by Baidu containing 9,600 people contributing a total of 5000 hours of speech.)
“You're going to see speech recognition systems that have human or better-than-human accuracy become commercialized,” says Tim Tuttle, a former AI specialist at MIT and now startup founder.
More on that in this article I wrote for Bloomberg: “Speech Recognition Better Than a Human's Exists. You Just Can't Use It Yet” [4]

One of the more prominent storylines to come out of Ottawa Senators home games this post-season isn't about the players on the ice but the fans watching from the stands.
The Senators have, at times, struggled to sellout seats throughout the playoffs — a fact especially noticeable when juxtaposed with the raucous full house of the Nashville Predators, who they could be meeting in the Stanley Cup Final with a Game 7 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins Thursday night. (This one's a road game for Ottawa.)
On Tuesday, an editorial written by Don Brennan of The Ottawa Citizen pointed the finger at Senators owner Eugene Melnyk as the main reason behind the unsold seats.
“It's hard to imagine empty seats at a playoff game if the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group that owns the Redblacks was also in control of the Senators,” wrote Brennan. “But then, it's hard to imagine those local, shrewd business people making the same mistakes as Melnyk.”
Those mistakes, per Brennan, include high ticket prices and jacked-up parking rates for the playoffs, the arena's “middle of nowhere” location, and fans' disapproval of the manner in which Melnyk fired loyal team co-founder Cyril Leeder in January.
Melnyk wasn't happy about being singled out, and wrote a letter in response to the criticism titled: My commitment is making the Sens a great hockey team.
Here's what they wrote:
It is common to hear Democrats blame California's ongoing severe drought on climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown made that claim last week in their “state of the state” address. Now a Republican is also claiming that California's drought is human-made–by Democrats. Rep. Devin Nunes, who represents the largely rural 21st congressional district, made the claim while appearing on the Laura Ingraham show Thursday morning.
“What the founding fathers of our state did, including Jerry Brown's own father, is they built water systems that could withstand five years of drought, and that could move water from the hills of the Sierra…and move it around to where the people now live. And what the difference is here, is that over the course of the last 20 years, and especially the last 5 years, those systems that have been built have been essentially shut down,” they said.
As bad as the drought it, Nunes said, it was “entirely predictable,” and Democrats exacerbated its results.
Nunes described the controversy over the Delta Smelt, the endangered fish species that is the focus of federal government policies that limit the amount of water that can be pumped into irrigation infrastructure in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. “Our area, Laura, has been decimated because it's been easy for them to cut off water to the farmers….They use water as a weapon, politically.” Nunes added that “their madness has caught up to them,” because water restrictions were starting to affect liberal voters in the San Francisco area.
Though Nunes had harsh words for the Democrats on water policy, they are considered a moderate, and was also harsh towards Republicans–“lemmings with suicide vests” during the federal government shutdown last fall.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Md., on Feb. 26. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)
Sen. Ted Cruz says states have the right to legalize marijuana, even though they criticized President Obama a year ago for not enforcing federal drug law in the states that have.
“I actually think this is a great embodiment of what Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called the laboratories of democracy,” Cruz said in response to a question from Fox News commentator Sean Hannity at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. “If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I don't agree with it, but that's their right.”
"If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I don't agree with it, but that's their right," Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said at CPAC on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado. (AP)
Hannity had asked whether legalization in Colorado was a good or bad idea, to which Cruz initially replied with a joke: The brownies at the conference, they quipped, were apparently provided by that state. That joke was similar to one they made a little over a year ago, when they criticized Obama for allowing such laws to proceed in a speech at an event hosted by the Texas Public Policy Foundation:
A whole lot of folks now are talking about legalizing pot. The brownies you had this morning were provided by the state of Colorado. And you can make arguments on that issue. You can make reasonable arguments on that issue. The president earlier this past year announced the Department of Justice is going to stop prosecuting certain drug crimes. Didn't change the law. You can go to Congress. You can get a conversation. You could get Democrats and Republicans who would say “He ought to change our drug policy in some way,” and you could have a real conversation. You could have hearings, you could look at the problem. You could discuss commonsense changes that maybe should happen or shouldn't happen. This president didn't do that. They just said, “the laws say one thing” — and mind you, these are criminal laws, these are laws that say if you do X, Y, and Z, you will go to prison. The president announced, “No, you won't.”
Drug law reform is a conservative issue, Don Murphy, a former Republican Maryland state legislator who now works for the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement in response to Cruz's CPAC comments.
“This is a matter of federalism, the 10th Amendment, and state autonomy, which are core conservative priorities,” they said. “Marijuana prohibition is a failed federal government policy, and rolling it back should be on the agenda of every principled Republican lawmaker.”
LAIE, HAWAII
The sacred words of a temple's dedicatory prayer have become the vision and purpose of LDS missionaries serving at one of the world's most picturesque locations.
The goal of those serving at the Laie Hawaii Temple Visitors' Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to invite all guests to feel the unique spirit of the scenic temple grounds, according to President Heber J. Grant's dedicatory prayer given on Nov. 27, 1919.
“May all who come upon the grounds which surround this temple in the years to come ... feel the sweet and peaceful influence of this blessed and hallowed spot,” President Grant prayed.
Each day an average of 500 people from around the world, particularly from those countries along the Pacific Rim, arrive at the temple grounds and wander among the water fountains, reflection pools and colorful hibiscus flowers where they feel that special spirit, according to Elder Jeffrey Swinton and their wife, Sister Heidi Swinton, directors of the Visitors' Center. At least half of those daily guests are not members of the Church, Elder Swinton said.
“We believe that all who touch foot on these temple grounds will feel something that at some point in their lives may blossom,” said Elder Swinton, who previously presided over the England London South mission with Sister Swinton. “Perhaps the next time they see a missionary in their home town they will feel again what they felt here and be motivated to want to learn more.”
The Laie Temple Visitors' Center has recently experienced an increase of more than 100 visitors a day, specifically in the early evening. A free 35-minute tram tour around the Polynesian Cultural Center and the campus of Brigham Young University-Hawaii, with a stop at the temple grounds was already being offered, but there weren't enough seats to accommodate the demand and people were left behind, Elder Swinton said.
The Visitors' Center arranged for a few extra buses to run between 6-7 p.m., which has been successful. The missionaries also received permission to pass out small cards at the PCC with an illustration featuring the temple grounds, BYU-Hawaii and the PCC, with information regarding the tram/bus rides and schedules, the Swintons said.
Each incoming crowd is greeted by sister missionaries capable of speaking various languages — Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Tagalog, English and more. If a visitor asks for more information about the gospel of Jesus Christ, the sisters can send their contact information instantaneously by text message to missionaries in the person's home town, the Swintons said.
It's fascinating to see a group of visitors enters the Visitors' Center and march up to the “Christus” statue for a photo, Elder Swinton said.
“[Some] don't know who Christ is, but they come and take a picture with Him,” Elder Swinton said. “At some point they will look at that photo and feel something.”
When not greeting visitors, the sisters put on headsets in a small call center where they communicate with people they've met on the temple grounds, answer or send referrals, or respond to questions submitted by people online at Mormon.org or other Church websites.
“There have been times when I have walked in and found two sisters kneeling on the floor, praying with people on the phone. It's as if they were teaching them face-to-face,” Elder Swinton said. “They are teaching all the time. It's a busy place.”
One sister missionary recently received the good news that two people they met at the Visitors' Center and referred to local missionaries were baptized. It occasionally happens, but the sister missionaries realize their primary role will be to find and send referrals. To add special meaning this important role, the Swintons have given each sister a special journal and invited them to record the names of each referral, along with other significant information.
“We realize the importance of names,” Elder Swinton said. “I am of the simple belief that perhaps even in the hereafter people will connect with those that connected them. The sisters, having written the data in their journals, it will be somewhere in their minds. It's sort of their book of life, a sacred way of remembering how many people they have positively impacted.”

How naive I was.
I thought the rumors about Hillary Clinton's health were nonsense. I thought the statement from Lisa Bardack, chairperson of the department of medicine at the Mount Kisco Medical Group in New York and Clinton's doctor since 2001, was enough. It was thorough and concluded: "She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States."
What a fool I was to be duped by this "doctor," who is actually a highly respected doctor.
On Fox News on Sunday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani raised the specter of Clinton's "signs of illness," saying: "Go online and put down 'Hillary Clinton illness' and take a look at the videos for yourself."
I did that. I went "online" and "put down" those words and indeed found videos of people who are not Clinton's physician or anyone's physician, including Giuliani, saying that Clinton is absolutely sick, and possibly mentally ill. I also found one guy on Twitter who responded to one of my tweets about Clinton's health by saying: "Think they have Parkinsons" and "The vidoes online speak gor themselves. They Are SICK."
Well, color me convinced. The vidoes do speak gor themselves. And why would a guy type in all-caps if they didn't know what they were talking about?
I felt like a fool, having completely overlooked the citizen-clinicians capable of diagnosing ailments via the internet. This made me wonder what else I might be missing by relying on the outdated method of assuming people who know what they're talking about are correct.
I logged into the online and put down a bunch of things, and boy did I get educated.
First I started with "Rudy Giuliani insane." The third video I found was titled "Rudy is Insane," and it showed a clip of Giuliani's speech at last month's Republican National Convention.
That was all the evidence I needed. Diagnosis: insane. I'll have to let them know.
Next I wondered if the former mayor might actually be a mole man — you know, half-man, half-mole — so I asked the internet: Is Rudy Giuliani really a mole man? Nothing came up, so I sent out a tweet that read: "Is Rudy Giuliani really a mole man? It is now on the internet so it must be true. It is true. #truth."
Then I Googled my question again and this time something came up —- my tweet — and so I was presented with clear evidence that Giuliani is, in fact, a mole man.
Next up: Ann Coulter lizard.
I took a look at the video results and, sure enough, the right-wing commentator is, indisputably, a lizard. One of the videos was titled: "ANN COULTER REPTILIAN/DEMON SKANK MANWOMAN."
You don't have to be a herpetologist to see the certainty in that evidence.
In the interest of bipartisanship, I Googled "Obama Satan." That yielded videos titled "Obama Devil Horns Appear During Speech" and "Satan Spotted During Obama Speech." Now we know the truth.
I also wondered, as I'm sure most of you have, whether Hillary Clinton is actually a Russian nesting doll. I couldn't find any direct video evidence of that, so I sent the following tweet: "Is Hillary Clinton actually a Russian nesting doll?  They are now, because I put this video on the internet."
Attached to the tweet was a short video of me saying: "Hillary Clinton is a Russian nesting doll. This is the video that proves it."
Case closed. Not only is they sick and probably dying, they are also, according to a definition I read on the internet, "a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another."
I don't know about you guys, but I don't think an ill set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another is fit to be president.
It's a frightening world we live in when you really pay attention to the things most people don't believe because they aren't true.
A few other quick facts I picked up online: Elvis is alive; dogs are part of the Illuminati; and that bump on my arm will probably kill me if I don't immediately start taking bat guano (in capsule form) available for only $79.99 per bottle from a distributor in Sweden.
The last thing I put down on the online Interweb machine was a simple question: "Should you believe everything you read on the internet?"
A bunch of videos came up, but I didn't bother looking at those. Rudy Giuliani told me just to look up stuff to find the proof I need.
Why would I ever doubt an insane mole man like that?

Microsoft has just announced their second quarter fiscal year 2016 results and the numbers are looking outstanding beating most estimates in all divisions.
One area where of healthy growth was with their Surface line bolstered by the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. The solid numbers were attained despite ongoing criticisms of stability and OS software issues.
The company reported $1.35 billion in revenue, which beats their previous record of $1.1 billion from the same time last year and more than doubled last quarter's $672 million number. That means coming off of the holiday season the Surface line exceeded previous sales although that is likely helped by the price bump of the Surface Pro 4 and the all-around high price tag of the Surface Book.
Questions remain about how long Microsoft can sustain that kind of sales push although a Surface 4 will likely arrive in the next few months to help keep momentum.
Regardless, these numbers speak volumes about Microsoft's success because if they had missed that billion-dollar mark, there would be some serious doubts about the sustainability of the product line.
We have a severe mental health crisis in New Orleans. We have a growing number of people with mental health needs while our mental health services are significantly lower since Katrina . The closure of the New Orleans Adolescent Hospital (NOAH), the only state run mental health facility in the New Orleans area, only exacerbates that problem.
Governor Jindal "line-item" vetoed that appropriation.
their plan is to send all mental health patients 60 miles away
Closing NOAH and having no mental health hospital services in New Orleans flies in the face of the entire reason NOAH was established in the first place
The non-sensical nature of NOAH's closing is even more disheartening because it wasn't about the money . Louisiana, just like many other parts of the country, is facing economic issues and we had to cut spending in places. In the legislature, we were able to allocate funding to keep NOAH open by still operating within our existing budget . As public spending was cut across the board 15% or so, we reduced NOAH by the same amount as other facilities. Yet, we kept it open to provide the vital resources it does.
What is sometimes lost in the discussion is that NOAH services low-income, medicaid patients, and it was established to treat adolescents, although adults were treated or evaluated there after Katrina because of lack of other facilities . These kids need to be close to their families, and the entire families need to be part of the counseling in order for the treatment to be productive. Most of these kids and families do not have the ability or the means to travel to 60 miles, across a long bridge . They can easily get to NOAH using public city transportation. Therefore, moving the services to the Northshore is like throwing all of the money away because the services need to be in New Orleans to be worthwhile . [...]
It is already being reported that our Parish Jail is now becoming the new mental health hospital . [By this, Rep. Abramson means that "those who should be in NOAH are doing things they shouldn't, and end up in jail instead."]
In the legislature, we funded NOAH to keep it open.Instead,, across a 24 mile bridge over Lake Ponchartrain, to receive critical mental health hospital services. [...]. And, there is more of a mental health need now than ever before. Quite simply, it makes absolutely no sense.
Can the NFL turn back the clock to shorter games? (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)
In 2010, the Wall Street Journal calculated that an average NFL contest contained only 11 minutes of actual game action, which is startling when you consider the average length of an NFL game: Through 11 weeks of the 2015 season, games were taking 3 hours 9 minutes 26 seconds to complete, and for the 2014 season in full it was 3:05.46. Last weekend's games took an average of 3:12 to complete.
You get the idea: An average NFL game will contain somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 minutes of actual play and around three hours of commercials, replays, replay reviews, timeouts, halftimes, huddles and breaks for injuries. And the league wonders why its television ratings are dropping like a stone. It's not just because of the presidential election, which is now over.
In any case, the league certainly is aware of the issue, and on Wednesday one of its top executives suggested that exceedingly long games may be part of the problem.
[As more states legalize marijuana, NFLPA to study potential as a pain-management tool]
“Could they be shorter? Could they be better? Are replays too long?” Brian Rolapp, NFL Media executive vice president and NFL Network president and chief executive, told an audience at a National Association of Broadcasters convention in New York. “We are constantly look at those things to make the pace of the games more interesting.”
Rolapp seemed to suggest that televisions viewers also are turned off by all the commercial breaks, that those touchdown-commercial-kickoff-commercial sequences that bog down so many games might not be the best way to keep viewers watching.
“In a world where Netflix has no commercials and consumers are used to 15 seconds of pre-roll, is there a better way to do commercials with our broadcast partners?” they said.
And while league officials “are not overly surprised” by the ratings drop this year and “are not overly worried about it,” Rolapp said the league is considering everything in terms of possible changes.
“If we don't keep an open mind about preserving some flexibility, any measure of success you have can go away pretty quickly,” they said. “We look constantly at improving the rules of the game, the safety of the game and the quality of the game — even if that means changing things that some people think are sacred cows.”
Lord chief justice says in annual report to parliament that one result is rise in number of litigants unrepresented in court
Civil justice is unaffordable for most people, more people are being forced to represent themselves, and judges – whose pensions have been cut – feel underappreciated, according to the lord chief justice.
In their annual report to parliament, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd welcomed the government's commitment to spending £780m on modernisation and new technology, but delivered a downbeat assessment of the courts in England and Wales.
“Our system of justice has become unaffordable to most,” Thomas said in the introduction to their report. “In consequence there has been a considerable increase of litigants in person for whom our current court system is not really designed.
“Although in common with many other European states the number of court buildings has been reduced through closure, the failure to invest has meant that many of the courtrooms have not been modernised and lack modern means of communication to provide for better access to justice.”
Steep increases in court fees, which judges formally opposed, have meant that the judiciary “whilst accepting the decisions by parliament to increase fees, remains deeply concerned about the effect on access to justice,” Thomas said.
Investment in modernising the courts and the development of online justice would improve the system's ability to respond to the public's need, they said.
Thomas, the head of the judiciary in England and Wales, said that judges, in common with many other people, felt their burden of work had increased. “For example, they are having to handle an ever-increasing quantity of challenging and emotionally charged cases in family and crime, as well as an increase in litigants in person,” they said.
“Although judges recognise that they are well paid in comparison to most people, static pay … and adverse alterations to pension arrangements … have had a significant impact. In addition, there has, overall, been a widespread feeling of not being valued or appreciated for their work.”
They said a recent survey had found that 77% of judges with leadership responsibilities felt their work had increased significantly in the past three years, and that they were having to deal with an increasing number of complex matters in addition to their daily court sittings.
More effort needs to be made in explaining “the importance of the judicial system in maintaining a just and fair society, accountable and democratic government and a strong economy”, they said. “No satisfactory means of funding the provision of our system of justice has yet been achieved.”
Chantal-Aimée Doerries QC, the new chair of the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said: “The British justice system is the envy of the world. However, as this report [by the lord chief justice] suggests, the reputation of our courts and their ability to serve the public is under threat.
“Cuts to legal aid have resulted in the courts being flooded with people representing themselves without legal advice or representation, including those in emotionally difficult circumstances such as losing access to their children, facing the loss of their home, or fighting deportation to a country where they might be persecuted.
“The real hardship being faced in the family courts is reflected in the recent Bar pro bono unit statistics – family case applications increased by 32% in 2013 and 60% in 2014. Justice is not a luxury, and everyone should be able to defend their rights through the legal system.”
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “As the justice secretary [Michael Gove] has said, our courts and tribunals need urgent reform. That is why we are investing over £700m to transform and modernise the courts and tribunal service. We are determined to deliver the swift and certain justice that the public rightly expects.”
Afghanistan: Karzai rebukes US over civilian deaths
One banner at Sunday's rally read "Occupation equals killing and destruction"
President Hamid Karzai has told the US commander of foreign troops in Afghanistan that their apology for the deaths of nine children in an air strike is "not enough".
"On behalf of the people of Afghanistan I want you to stop the killings of civilians," Mr Karzai said at a cabinet meeting attended by Gen David Petraeus.
The children were killed in a Nato strike on Tuesday.
Hundreds of people rallied on Sunday to denounce the killing of civilians.
The issue of civilian casualties is a source of widespread public anger and of tension between the Afghan government and the US, the BBC's Jill McGivering reports.
Washington is well aware of the strength of feeling and has worked hard to reduce casualties, they add, though Nato says most civilian casualties last year were caused by Taliban insurgents, not the security forces.
On Sunday, at least 12 civilians, including five children, were killed by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan.
'Stop the killings'
"President Karzai said that David Petraeus's apology is not enough," a statement from the Afghan presidency said.
"The civilian casualties are a main cause of worsening the relationships between Afghanistan and the US," President Karzai was quoted as saying.
"The people are tired of these things and apologies and condemnations are not healing any pain."
On Wednesday, Gen David Petraeus said they were "deeply sorry" for the air strike in which the boys, aged 12 and under, were mistaken for insurgents by Nato helicopters as they gathered firewood.
Sunday's rally in Kabul condemned both Nato and the Taliban for killing civilians.
Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson defended their decision on Wednesday to sign a proclamation recognizing a Respect for Life Day that would coincide with an anti-abortion march.
Watson said proclaiming a Respect for Life Day was neither an endorsement nor a reflection of their personal views. They have also been criticized for choosing to issue a proclamation from National March for Life, which is expecting some 10,000 people on Parliament Hill on Thursday to speak out against abortion.
"If we start saying no based on my own personal views, we're going to be ending up on the human rights commission, and I'm not prepared to bring the city through that," Watson said.
Asked if they would be willing to proclaim a day named after Morgentaler, the prominent Canadian aborition rights advocate, Watson said they would consider it if such a request conformed to the city's proclamation policy.
Pro-choice
"I'd seek the advice of the clerks' office and if they bring it forward and it meets the policy, I would," they said.
The proclamation for Respect for Life Day calls on the community to get involved in protecting "the rights of people in Canada, including the unborn."
But Watson said their decision doesn't mean they condone a particular day.
"In my own case I support the woman's right to choose," said Watson. "So these are requests that come in and I think you get down that slippery slope if you all of a sudden start deciding, 'Do I declare this day? Or shouldn't I declare that day?'"
Most proclamations innocuous
The city's policy on issuing proclamations says it is done to allow the mayor to recognize groups and individuals for their contributions to the community, and does not "constitute a personal or civic endorsement."
Most of these proclamations are innocuous, with the mayor recently proclaiming Giant Tiger Day — after the retail chain — and Gloucester Skating Club Day on the same day.
Watson said when the City of Ottawa amalgamated in 2001, a policy was put in place for the issuing of proclamations, to ensure the personal views of the mayor did not colour which proclamations were read.
They said that as long as the proclamation doesn't breach the Ontario Human Rights Code and meets the standards of city staff, they have no issue with reading the statements.
Proclamation doesn't violate policy: Watson
But the city's policy states the proclamations should not be "politically or religiously motivated," and Watson said that criterion is open to interpretation.
"I suppose you could probably claim anything is political to some degree," said Watson. "But I rely on the advice of the clerk's office and the protocol office, they are the one's who prepare these proclamations and I sign them."
"I haven't seen any in my six months in office that appear to breach the Ontario Human Rights Code," they said.
The National March for Life rally will demand the federal government "reopen the abortion debate," according to the group's president, Jim Hughes.
'Dangerous language'
"The National March for Life gives Canadians an opportunity to join together and send the newly elected government a clear message that abortion is an important issue," said Hughes in a statement.
But Melanie Stafford, a member of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Ottawa, said Watson's decision sends the wrong message to women.
"It uses dangerous language around the rights to the unborn, as if the unborn is a separate entity to the woman carrying that pregnancy," said Stafford.
Ambrose Atkins, co-chair of the National March for Life, said they were pleased the group's request for a proclamation was successful.
"It's nice to see that the mayor would issue this proclamation. We're delighted to have it," said Atkins.
If you're outraged about prescription drug prices, what do you do? If you're Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders — or if you work at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank — you adopt the policies of that bastion of sound economic management: Venezuela.
Yes, that's right. To contain drug costs, the left is now advocating for the exact same measures the Latin American basket case has employed to control the price of toilet paper.
Ostensibly to prevent monopolies and price gouging, Venezuelan's socialist regime rigorously controls product pricing practices. The government audits the production, marketing, and development expenses for all companies and limits profit margins.
The regime claims prices and profits are negotiated to be fair to both consumers and producers. Companies found to be non-compliant are deemed to be a threat to the public well-being and face all sorts of sanctions, including a ban on engaging in economic activities for up to ten years.
The wonks over at the Center for American Progress and in the Clinton and Sanders campaigns are copying the Venezuelan authoritarian playbook with their respective healthcare reform proposals.
They call for the federal government to audit drug development costs and profits. Companies that set prices above a specific range would be banned from the market.
What's more, drug companies would be required to direct a minimum percentage of their revenue to research and development. Non-compliant firms would be subject to fines and possible federal prosecution.
A federal panel would decide which drugs are truly innovative and set prices accordingly. Any price that exceeds that ceiling by more than 20 percent would be presumed to be unreasonable. The government would be given the right to seize products and throw people in prison for pricing practices.
We've seen such policies in action in Venezuela. The results aren't pretty.
Take toilet paper. Venezuelan price controls have discouraged production, causing shortages. The ensuing scarcity has led to black markets and government property seizures.
When announcing the “temporary occupation” of one of the Paper Manufacturing Company's plants, Vice President Jorge Arreaza explained that the state wanted to review the “production, marketing and distribution (of) toilet paper.”
“There is no deficiency in production,” Commerce Minister Alejandro Fleming claimed — merely “an excessive demand” — caused by consumers stocking up on a much-needed product whenever they can find it.
Rather than lift price controls to incentivize companies to produce the toilet paper consumers demand, the regime installed 20,000 fingerprint scanners in supermarkets and department stores to monitor how much people were buying.
Evidently, Venezuelans aren't supposed to take economic realities like constant shortages into account when they go grocery shopping.
There is a lesson to be learned here. Companies stop making toilet paper if government price controls keep them from making a profit on it. The same will be true for medicines, if the American left succeeds in imposing price controls.

There is a real chasm between the minority and the majority in India today. Though the divide remained benign until 2004, Sonia Gandhi-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) took it to obscene levels during its decade-long rule. The Congress government worked on a mission mode and with missionary zeal to put the rights of the minorities on a much higher pedestal than those of the majority.
Giving minority status to the influential Jain community, as a political incentive before the 2014 polls, was testament to the benefits that come with the minority tag in the country: non-interference in community's religious and educational institutions, sectarian scholarships for its students, separate legal regimes, lucrative loan schemes, preferential development funds for their areas, separate cash and kind incentives, and much more.
It is no surprise then that today even strong Hindu communities are clamouring for the minority tag. However, the government showers you with incentives only if you are a non-Hindu minority. Currently there are seven states in India, apart from Lakshadweep, where Hindus are minorities but they are not the beneficiaries of the government largesse. That's primarily because, as per the National Commission of Minorities (NCM) act, ‘minority' means a community notified as such by the central government. So far, the centre has notified only six communities: Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Buddhists, and Jains. The first five were notified through a notification in 1993. Hence, only they get the intended benefits.

To correct this anomaly, Bharatiya Janata Party Delhi spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay filed a petition in the Supreme Court saying that the 1993 notification was arbitrarily invalid and ultra-vires the constitution terming it as against the basic structure doctrine espoused by the apex court. Explaining the arbitrariness, they wrote that in eight states where Hindus are a minority but are treated as a majority, they are illegitimately deprived of benefits meant for minority communities.
However, the Supreme Court has asked Upadhyay to approach the NCM. A division bench of Ranjan Gogai and Navin Sinha said that ”We cannot issue such orders. Go to the Commission..they are the most competent body.” The apex court has come under criticism again for shirking responsibility on important matters that could benefit the majority community while leaving no chance of entertaining sundry public interest litigations (PILs) from Hinduphobics who want it to curtail the freedom to conduct some Hindu ritual or festival.
But on close scrutiny, we find that the petitioner invoked the NCM complaining that ‘neither Central nor the state governments have notified Hindus as a ‘minority' under Section 2(c) of National Commission for Minority Act', therefore, depriving Hindus of their basic rights, guaranteed under Articles 25 to 30. Hence, one shouldn't be surprised that the apex court asked Upadhyay to go to the NCM.

However, it doesnt seem like approaching the NCM would be of any help. Section 3 (2) of the act states that ‘the Commission shall consist of a [Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson and five Members] to be nominated by the Central Government from amongst persons of eminence, ability and integrity provided that five members including the Chairperson shall be from amongst the minority communities. (emphasis mine). The minority members enjoy complete majority in the commission. It is anyone's guess if they would be sympathetic to classifying Hindus of eight states as minorities. The NCM was constituted after all to look into and address complaints from members of five religious communities. In short, of the minorities, for the minorities.
It is a purely sectarian body. We should be glad that it is only a quasi-judicial entity and not a constitutional one. However, Sonia Gandhi's UPA did try to turn the NCM into one by passing the 103rd constitutional amendment bill within months of coming to power in 2004. But the bill eventually lapsed.
It is astonishing that the Supreme Court thinks it perfectly fine for a sectarian body to adjudicate on matters concerning the fate of millions of Hindus.

Additionally, the commission doesn't even have the power to do what the SC thinks it can.
According to the act, the functions of the commission are limited to evaluating the progress of the development of minorities under the union and states; monitor the working of the safeguards provided in the Constitution and in laws enacted by the Parliament and the State Legislatures; make recommendations for the effective implementation of safeguards for the protection of the interests of minorities by the central government or the state governments; look into specific complaints regarding deprivation of rights and safeguards of the minorities and take up such matters with the appropriate authorities; cause studies to be undertaken into problems arising out of any discrimination against minorities and recommend measures for their removal; conduct studies, research and analysis on the issues relating to the socio-economic and educational development of minorities; suggest appropriate measures in respect of any minority to be undertaken by the central government or the state governments; make periodical or special reports to the central government on any matter pertaining to minorities and in particular difficulties confronted by them; and on any other matter which may be referred to it by the Central Government.
Clearly, the commission doesn't have any right to classify a community as minority. It can only conduct studies and admit complains affecting minorities already notified as such by the central government.

The ball is in the Modi government's court. Since, the NCM is not a constitutional body (thank the gods), the centre can simply give minority status to Hindus in states where they are in minority. The government doesn't even need to bring in any legislation. Only a simple executive order would suffice.
Earlier in the TMA Pai vs State of Karnataka case, the Supreme Court had said that since linguistic minorities can only be determined on the basis of state population, religious minorities should also be decided on that parameter alone. Citing this judgment, SC had rejected the plea of the Jain community to be classified as minority. However, in 2014 just before the general election, the UPA government circulated a cabinet note giving minority status to Jains. The community has been enjoying the benefits since then.
The Modi government cannot shirk from its responsibility. If it hesitates in taking such mild decisions for the benefit of Hindu minorities that require only a Cabinet nod, how can one expect it to challenge sectarian laws like the Right to Education laws, overturning 93rd constitutional amendment or amending article 30 (1)?

Instead of wasting time in going to courts and the NCM, Upadhyay should talk to their own party and get this done.
A young cowboy from Texas who joined the elite US Navy Seals became the most deadly sniper in American history. In a book published this month they provide an unusual insight into the psychology of a soldier who waits, watches and kills.
As US forces surged into Iraq in 2003, Chris Kyle was handed a sniper rifle and told to watch as a marine battalion entered an Iraqi town.
A crowd had come out to greet them. Through the scope they saw a woman, with a child close by, approaching their troops. They had a grenade ready to detonate in their hand.
"This was the first time I was going to have to kill someone. I didn't know whether I was going to be able to do it, man, woman or whatever," they say.
"You're running everything through your mind. This is a woman, first of all. Second of all, am I clear to do this, is this right, is it justified? And after I do this, am I going to be fried back home? Are the lawyers going to come after me saying, 'You killed a woman, you're going to prison'?"
It's killing that is very distant but also very personal - I would even say intimate Neta Bar, Anthropologist
But they didn't have much time to debate these questions.
"She made the decision for me, it was either my fellow Americans die or I take them out."
They pulled the trigger.
Kyle remained in Iraq until 2009. According to official Pentagon figures, they killed 160 people, the most career sniper kills in the history of the US military. Their own estimate is much higher, at 255 kills.
According to army intelligence, they were christened "The Devil" by Iraqi insurgents, who put a $20,000 (£13,000) bounty on their head.
Married with two children, they have now retired from the military and has published a book in which they claim to have no regrets, referring to the people they killed as "savages".
Job satisfaction
But a study into snipers in Israel has shown that snipers are much less likely than other soldiers to dehumanise their enemy in this way.
Image caption Chris Kyle killed an estimated 40 people during the second battle of Fallujah in 2004
Part of the reason for this may be that snipers can see their targets with great clarity and sometimes must observe them for hours or even days.
"It's killing that is very distant but also very personal," says anthropologist Neta Bar. "I would even say intimate."
They studied attitudes to killing among 30 Israeli snipers who served in the Palestinian territories from 2000 to 2003, to examine whether killing is unnatural or traumatic for human beings.
They chose snipers in particular because, unlike pilots or tank drivers who shoot at big targets like buildings, the sniper picks off individual people.
What they found was that while many Israeli soldiers would refer to Palestinian militants as "terrorists", snipers generally referred to them as human beings.
Tale of a Soviet sniper There were about 20 gunmen escorting a convoy and one of them was unlucky enough to get in the sight of my scope. The distance was about 300m, almost nothing for a sniper. A few seconds later I saw them lying motionless. In the heat of the moment my only thought was to shoot more and more. I saw the figures rushing in panic and trying to hide. We killed all of them, except three or four who were wounded and captured. Afterwards I blamed myself for not being cool-headed enough. I thought that if I had been calmer, I would have killed more enemies. We were proud of ourselves, but now I am ashamed. If I was asked today, I would say it's very hard to kill, but more than 20 years ago I was too young. Ilya Abishev (pictured second from right) fought in Afghanistan in 1988
"The Hebrew word for human being is Son of Adam and this was the word they used by far more than any other when they talked about the people that they killed," they say.
Snipers almost never referred to the men they killed as targets, or used animal or machine metaphors. Some interviewees even said that their victims were legitimate warriors.
"Here is someone whose friends love them and I am sure they are a good person because they do this out of ideology," said one sniper who watched through their scope as a family mourned the man they had just shot. "But we from our side have prevented the killing of innocents, so we are not sorry about it."
This justification - which was supported by friends, family and wider Israeli society - could be one reason why the snipers didn't report any trauma after killing, they suggest.
"Being prepared for all those things that might crack their conviction, actually enabled them to kill without suffering too much."
They also noted that the snipers they studied were rational and intelligent young men.
In most military forces, snipers are subject to rigorous testing and training and are chosen for aptitude. In the UK, they complete a three-month training course, with a pass rate of only one in four.
Every person I killed I strongly believe that they were bad Chris Kyle
The US marine sniper course is one of the hardest training courses in the military, with a failure rate of more than 60% and a long list of prerequisites for recruits, including "a high degree of maturity, equanimity and common sense".
Research in Canada has also found that snipers tend to score lower on tests for post-traumatic stress and higher on tests for job satisfaction than the average soldier.
"By and large, they are very healthy, well-adjusted young men," says Peter Bradley at the Royal Military College of Canada, who is studying 150 snipers in Afghanistan. "When you meet them you're taken by how sensible and level-headed they are."
Don't tell your wife
But both the Israeli and the Canadian studies only spoke to snipers who were still on active duty. Neta Bar suspects many of them could experience problems in years to come, after they return to normal society.
What causes trauma? The US Department of Veterans defines three sources of war-related trauma: being at risk of death or injury, seeing others hurt or killed and having to kill or wound others. Snipers suffer less of the first but arguably more of the latter two.
"A sniper is exposed to less unknown danger, has better reach and sees more," says a former infantryman and spokesperson for the UK army. "They won't be exposed to as much trauma as a dismounted, normal-operative infantryman."
When former Soviet sniper Ilya Abishev fought in Afghanistan in 1988 they were immersed in Soviet propaganda and was convinced what they were doing was right.
Regret came much later. "We believed we were defending the Afghan people," they say. "Now I am not proud, I am ashamed of my behaviour."
For police snipers, who operate within normal society rather than a war zone, doubts, or even trauma, can arise much sooner.
Brian Sain, a sniper and deputy at the sheriff's department in Texas, says many police and army snipers struggle with having killed in such an intimate way.
"It's not something you can tell your wife, it's not something you can tell your pastor," says Mr Sain, a member of Spotter, an American association that supports traumatised snipers. "Only another sniper understands how that feels."
But for the US's deadliest sniper, remorse does not seem to be an issue.
"It is a weird feeling," they admit. "Seeing an actual dead body... knowing that you're the one that caused it now to no longer move."
But that is as far as they go.
"Every person I killed I strongly believe that they were bad," they say. "When I do go face God there is going to be lots of things I will have to account for but killing any of those people is not one of them."
Chris Kyle was interviewed by Outlook for the BBC World Service. Listen to the interview here.

With 'Underground,' WGN America Doesn't Just Have a Compelling Drama, It Might Have A Real Shot at the Emmys
Say this for WGN America: It's stayed committed to one cause over the past two years. That cause? Launch the kind of prestige drama that wins Emmys.
READ MORE: Director Thomas Schlamme on ‘Manhattan' Season 3 and The Novelistic Experience of Great TV
Maybe actually winning an Emmy isn't an official goal, but since 2014 it's been committed to a slate of shows featuring relatively high-profile talent and, more importantly, attention-grabbing premises. While its first solid hit was the horror-leaning “Salem,” following that came “Manhattan,” the beautifully produced dark period drama covering the development of the atom bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico. That series, executive produced by Sam Shaw and Thomas Schlamme, was the type of programming that awards shows were meant to champion: smart, compelling and well-acted.
“Manhattan,” however, never really escaped the shadow of mid-century period dramas like “Mad Men” and “Masters of Sex,” which aired on better-known networks and featured more recognizable stars. (Okay, maybe Jon Hamm wasn't a big name when “Mad Men” first launched in 2007, but that changed pretty damn fast.) While Season 1 did win an Emmy for its visually stunning title design, the show otherwise never broke through, and was canceled after the end of Season 2.
WGN America, though, hasn't given up on the awards game, and its latest entry not only deserves to be a contender, it could just maybe manage it.
The network has legitimately put its support behind premises that feel truly fresh and unique in a very crowded landscape, and “Underground,” created by Misha Green and Joe Pokaski, is no exception. Tracking a group of slaves in the antebellum South as they plan their escape to freedom, “Underground” proves knotty with twists even as it digs into the brutal realities of life at that time.
“Underground” isn't breaking new ground in telling the truth of what life was like during the slavery era, but what makes the series unique from films like “12 Years A Slave” is the way that the narrative borrows some of the tropes from classic heist tales. Noah (Aldis Hodge) and their fellow slaves have to get the map, come up with the plan and assemble the team. Like any great jailbreak story, there's plenty of compelling drama in all these details.
During interviews Indiewire conducted during the TCA Winter Press tour earlier this year, the cast assembled was very clear about how special the experience felt for them. “I just couldn't believe they could organically keep it up,” co-star Christopher Meloni said. “And they did. Organically, truthfully. I just was constantly surprised by the richness that the actors got to play and kind of the overarching drama in scenes that they would do.”
Beyond Meloni (a TV icon after the HBO series “Oz” and 272 episodes of “Law and Order: SVU”), most of the cast is relatively underseen. Hodge was a series regular on TNT cult favorite “Leverage” for five seasons, and house slave Jurnee Smollett-Bell proved capable of stealing scenes from Michael B. Jordan and Kyle “Coach” Chandler in Seasons 4 and 5 of “Friday Night Lights.” Reed Diamond, Mykelti Williamson and Marc Blucas have also worked steadily in film and television over the last several years.
But it's the lack of major star power that makes the level of work happening on “Underground” exciting. There's a genuine thrill in seeing actors get to showcase just how damn good they can be; most especially minority actors, who don't often get roles this meaty. Alano Miller, who plays Cato, a slave with questionable loyalty, is best known from the CW's “Jane the Virgin.” Then, they were undeniably entertaining as a classic soap opera villain (as well as their own identical twin). But this is a completely different turn for him, one that he's very appreciative to have.
“I'm actually really honored that they trusted us, with these words and with this project, to give us the chance to flex those muscles,” they said to Indiewire. “A lot of artists don't get a chance to do that. They're stuck and they get trapped and it's not their fault. It's just what the industry does, it happens all the time and so for us to be able to break out of that, maybe more doors will open for us and for others.”
An asset to the actors were the Louisiana locations, which included actual plantations and preserved slave quarters from the pre-Civil War era. “It's definitely a whole other thing, when you step into a plantation,” Smollett-Bell said. “You can feel the spirits in the soil. You can feel the trees. You can't really describe it, really. You have to be there. It's a whole other thing for you to see the scratch marks and the beams in the whipping shed. To see what they actually saw. It definitely adds a whole level of truth to you as an actor.”
“You know, it's being a painter. You have a few more brushes to paint with,” Hodge added, “Because you don't have to imagine any of it. You don't have to conjure up those feelings. They're automatically there. When you're on a plantation where people actually worked, and you're sitting around trees where people were actually hung from, it makes you think about things differently… When we shot there, we did so respectfully. All the actors were very, very aware that we were trying to respect the ground we were on.”
Amirah Vann, who plays head house slave Ernestine, described one moment on set that was particularly tough for them “I had a hard day, I have to say… There was a moment where I distinctly remember pulling [Jurnee Smollett-Bell] aside. You know, sister to sister, I was just like, ‘I don't wanna do this today. I'm not in the mood for this. Remind me why we're doing this.'”
Smollett-Bell, Vann said, had an answer for them because both of them had with them copies of “Bullwhip Days: The Slaves Remember,” an oral history of slave narratives. “We sat in silence for a little bit and they just pointed to the [book]. It was just kind of brilliant. It was so simple. They just tapped the book and they brought me right back down to earth and out of myself, that the reason we're doing this is not because I'm uncomfortable,” Vann said. “It's not about me. It's about telling stories. And that was a wonderfully real moment.”
While “Underground” deserves to be a contender, the problem, of course, is the very crowded landscape. A proper Emmys prognosticator will tell you that if Emmys voters choose to celebrate a tale of slavery, it'll be A&E's remake of “Roots,” which features a stellar cast and legit pedigree thanks to the legendary miniseries upon which it's based.
But “Underground” is an ongoing series and thus won't be competing in the same categories. And who doesn't love rooting for an underdog? “Underground” features a commitment not just to diversity, but to telling a story so central to the African-American experience, with African-American leads. An Emmy nomination wouldn't be affirmative action. It would be an acknowledgment of how this show has truly committed to telling the sort of story that's so rarely been touched upon and tell it well.
“Underground” airs Wednesdays on WGN America.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The family of Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs is proposing to build a stadium to help secure the Buffalo Bills' long-term future in the region, two people involved in discussions told The Associated Press.
Executives of Jacobs' Buffalo-based Delaware North hospitality and management company are to meet with at least one prospective ownership group and members of a firm hired by New York state to evaluate potential new stadium sites in Erie and Niagara counties, the people said.
They spoke this week on the condition of anonymity because Delaware North has not publicly revealed its plans.
Delaware North specializes in sports-related hospitality service, and has a long track record in land development. The company controls the TD Garden in Boston, home to the NHL's Bruins and NBA's Celtics, and owns and operates resorts, restaurants, casinos and horse racing tracks across the country.
It also has food-service concession contracts at numerous sports facilities, including the Bills' home, Ralph Wilson Stadium.
Jacobs' son, Jeremy Jr., told the AP last month their family was part of discussions to keep the Bills in Buffalo, including possible involvement in a stadium development plan.
“We do have an interest in what's happening with the stadium in town,” said Jacobs, a Delaware North principal. “Clearly, there's a lot we can offer when the time is right. But I think at this stage it's more of a political process than anything else, and so it's really not our role to play at this stage.”
Delaware North spokesperson Wendy Watkins this week deferred questions regarding stadium plans to those previous comments by Jacobs. Watkins said nothing has changed since that interview in early May.
One person familiar with the Jacobs' plans said Delaware North officials will meet with state officials involved in the stadium search process. Another person said there have been initial discussions regarding the Jacobs' teaming with prospective ownership groups, including one led by former NHL Sabres owner Tom Golisano.
The timing of the discussions comes as ownership groups prepare to start bidding for the Bills, who are on the market after owner and founder Ralph Wilson died in March.
Jacobs had previously not ruled out the possibility of buying the Bills. But they also noted there are obstacles that could prevent the family from making an ownership bid. The biggest involves Delaware North's casino and racetrack holdings, which the Jacobs would have to sell off because league rules bar owners from having links to gambling-related interests.
The Jacobs family would not face those restrictions if it limited its scope to building a stadium.
The Bills essentially are tied to playing at their current home through the 2019 season. There remain concerns of the franchise eventually relocating under a new owner.
The proposal to replace the 41-year-old stadium has been raised by local and state officials and favored by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who considers it an important step in keeping the franchise in western New York.
The state commissioned AECOM, a California architectural and design firm, to identify three to four sites across the region that could serve as the team's new home. The firm is working with sports business attorney Irwin Raij, who is heading Gov. Andrew Cuomo's efforts to keep the Bills in the region.
AECOM is expected to present its final report as early as next month.
Aside from Golisano, New York City real estate mogul Donald Trump continues to express interest in buying the Bills. The Buffalo News this week reported Pabst Brewing Co. owner C. Dean Metropoulos also has interest in a bid.
Another potential candidate could be current Sabres owner Terry Pegula. Three people familiar with their plans said the Pennsylvania billionaire remains interested, but hasn't yet prepared a bid. Those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because Pegula hasn't discussed their plans since telling The Buffalo News in April they “would not want to see the team moved out of Buffalo.”
Pegula's net worth was last estimated by Forbes to be $3.3 billion.

Windex in a metal can
Windex is a glass and hard-surface cleaner. Windex was invented by the Drackett Company in 1933 and has been marketed throughout the intervening decades.[1] Windex was originally sold in glass containers before adding plastic and metal containers over time.
Drackett sold Windex to Bristol-Meyers in 1965.[2] S. C. Johnson acquired Windex in 1993 and has been manufacturing it since.[3]
The original Windex was colored a light, translucent shade of blue. Today, there are varieties marketed in several colors (ocean fresh blue, sunshine lemon and citrus orange) and fragrances (spring bouquet, ocean mist, lavender and tea tree), with a number of additives such as vinegar, lemon, lime, or orange juice.[4]
Ingredients [ edit ]
On August 26, 1969, Melvin E. Stonebraker and Samuel P. Wise received U.S. patent #3,463,735[5] for a glass cleaning composition, listing example formulae, one of which is 4.0% isopropyl alcohol, 1% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (a surfactant), calcium (Ca) 0.01%, tetrasodium pyrophosphate (a water softener), 0.05% of 28% ammonia, 1% of a dye solution, and 0.01% perfume. This formula was not only inexpensive to manufacture but allowed the product to be packaged in glass bottles and dispensed with a plastic sprayer.[citation needed] In 1989, Windex was a 5% ammonia solution.[6] The product was reformulated in 2006.[7] In 2009, S.C. Johnson started publishing ingredients for all of its products, including Windex.[8] The S.C. Johnson website lists Windex's ingredients as water, 2-hexoxyethanol, isopropanolamine, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, lauramine oxide, ammonium hydroxide, fragrance, and Liquitint sky blue dye.[9]
New York Times' Bill Keller sets ground rules for next war
By Bill Van Auken
21 March 2012
On the ninth anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, New York Times columnist and former editor Bill Keller has penned a self-serving piece that obscures their own role in justifying that war, while setting ground rules for launching the next one.
Keller's headline—“Falling in and out of war”—is an accurate reflection of the smug and cynical character of the well-heeled layer of establishment liberals of which they are a part, and which today constitutes a principal constituency for imperialism.
“When you've been wrong about something as important as war, as I have, you owe yourself some hard thinking about how to avoid repeating the mistake,” Keller begins their column. “And if that's true for a mere kibitzing columnist, it's immeasurably more true for those in a position to actually start a war.”
Keller the “mere kibitzing columnist”? Such modesty! One would hardly imagine that when they were “wrong about something as important as war” they were the executive editor of the Times, taking in an annual salary of $650,000 and directing one of the most powerful opinion manufacturing organizations in the United States.
The former editor says next to nothing about how they got it wrong in the run-up to the US invasion of Iraq, nor why they now believe it was a mistake to support that war, outside of an aside that it “distracted our attention and energy from the far more important undertaking in Afghanistan.”
 They are even less inclined to dwell on the implications of theirs getting it wrong: the death, wounding and forced exile of millions of Iraqis, the decimation of an entire society, and the killing of over 4,000 US troops, along with the maiming of tens of thousands of others.
Any serious examination of the record of the Iraq war inevitably points to the indispensable role of the Times and its editor, Keller, in selling the lies used to justify the war to the American public. This wasn't a matter of “kibitzing” columns, but a sustained exercise in disinformation, in which the newspaper and its correspondent Judith Miller made the case that the regime in Baghdad was developing “weapons of mass destruction” and that war was necessary. Editorial after editorial and column after column continued a drumbeat justifying war. As the “newspaper of record” and a voice of official liberalism, the Times was cited by the Bush White House in making the case for invading Iraq, and it set the tone for the entire national media.
Now, in the face of new threats of war against Syria and Iran, Keller poses a series of questions that would supposedly guard against “getting it wrong” once again.
The first question they pose is: “How is this our fight?” They assert that in the case of the Afghanistan war “the answer is obvious.” They cite a “broad agreement that it was in America's vital national interest in 2001 to go after the homicidal zealots behind the 9/11 attacks on America.”
Really? If that was the case, why didn't the Bush administration order the military into Saudi Arabia, from which 15 of the 19 men accused of the 9/11 hijacking came, along with ideological inspiration, funding and logistical support for the operation? Why some “zealots” were targeted for elimination and others protected was bound up not with any “broad agreement,” but with the geo-strategic interests of US imperialism—in particular, for control of oil, a three-letter word that makes no appearance in Keller's column.
Keller declares that the Afghanistan war was “as the cops say, a righteous shoot.” The cops do use this phrase, sometimes when describing the fatal shooting of a man seen reaching for a gun that turns out to be a wallet. The underlying assumption is that the United States is the world's police officer, with a license to use deadly force whenever and wherever it sees fit.
Other questions that Keller says need asking include what the war will cost (Libya was an easy target; Syria is harder), what alternatives exist (he favorably cites Obama's war threats against Iran as a supposed means of restraining Israel), who else supports the war (“in these optional wars, it is useful to have company”), and what are the potential unintended consequences.
One question is entirely missing. They do not bother to ask: is the war legal? “Optional wars,” as Keller delicately describes them, are, in the language of international law, wars of aggression.
The Nuremberg Military Tribunal, which tried the surviving leaders of Hitler's Third Reich, described such a war as “essentially an evil thing.” It declared that “to initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.”
The United Nations Charter, to which Washington is a signatory, commits member states to “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”
Such considerations are of no interest to Keller and fellow “liberal” supporters of imperialism. Having licked the wounds to their vanity and reputations inflicted by the debacle in Iraq, they are now gearing up to back new wars being prepared by a Democratic president on the same pretexts of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and human rights utilized by their Republican predecessor.
In their utter disregard for international law, Keller expresses the essential criminality of US foreign policy.
They close their column with the invocation: “If Iraq taught us nothing else, it should have taught us this: Before you deploy the troops, deploy the fact checkers.”
Is this meant to be ironic? Wasn't it the ostensible role of the New York Times and what was once known as the “fourth estate” to challenge the government's monopoly of information and question the supposed “facts” used to justify war?
If Iraq taught us anything, it is that under conditions of the explosive growth of American militarism, unprecedented social inequality and a relentless attack on democratic rights, the corporate-controlled media plays the role of the servile mouthpiece of the government. Today, having learned nothing, it is regurgitating and embellishing upon official lies to construct the justifications for an even more devastating war to further the aims of US imperialism.

Years ago I was at a cafe with a colleague waiting for our appointment. They mentioned that they had to run errands for their mother after work and when I asked what kind they stalled then I suddenly remarked "sounds like whore house business." Pause. "no really what do you have to do?" They had a strange look on their face then said "something for the whore house." I thought they were messing with me so I asked again and got the same answer. Turned out their mother owned a escort service agency. I had absolutely no idea. At one point I also had a knack for guessing peoples' names, unusual names, and I'm almost always spot on when someone asks me to guess their age in person, not off by a year or two but spot on. To me they're always just lucky guesses. Or were they? You might want to look into terms like "thought transference" and "thought broadcasting."
I know the kind of experiences talked about here, mostly from the "targeted" side, very heavily for years, although now I prefer the term "experiencer" over "targeted indiviudal." Some experiencers say it's all well coordinated harassment by shadow groups affiliated with intelligence agencies. Some say it's remote influencing by human and non-human entities. Some say you have unresolved subconscious and energetic trauma that's bringing out the nastiness in people, the sharks in them smelling blood. If you want to go further you can say the world we know is front stage reality and many people now are "actors" with a foot front and backstage. You can also look at the hive mind paradigm and surmise people are now living in different "group consciousness compounds" in which knowledge and perceptions are psychically shared. Then there are concepts like "matrix agents," "loosh vampires," etc. When I look back I'm forced to conclude it's all the above. I'm not waffling. I really can find many examples of my own to support each argument and to me they need not exclude each other.
To break it down simply the new paradigm you might want to adopt for now is this:
thoughts and feelings are things and can be picked up by "sensitives." Most people are slightly, unkowingly sensitive without much control.Others can be clairvoyant and routinely remote view, remote influence, and manipulate the fabric of reality by sheer will. You can be "sensitive" without being kind. "Gifted" without understanding. Hate to say it but it's possible to attack and be attacked by others psychically. It can mess up your "field" and give you hard luck, but I do think to sustain attacks cost a great deal of energy and it could back fire, and thus the type of long and hard attacks an experiencer gets is usually by a fairly large number of people or if you're ready for this, intelligent non-human entities contracted by occultists. It's not always a question of "gifted" or not "gifted." Ways exist to cultivate abilities and even to trick others into giving you theirs. The knowing "perps" in these covert harassment campaigns can be doing just that. They make you paranoid. They may start with crude surveillance, tapping your phone, hacking you computer. You start to believe they're omnipotent and soon they become more "knowing." They're tricking you into building them up by your own belief and creative powers. You can call it energetic vampirism, which of course goes beyond milking psychic energy.
At the same time psychical phenomena aren't always vampiric. It can be as natural as the link between close ones, people on similar "wavelengths," or people who interact frequently or are in proximity to each other. Like it or not when you interact with someone there's an energetic exchange. Your "fields" can begin to merge and those involved become more alike. You may talk to someone on a forum and find yourself spontaneously remote viewing them or their ideations. You may suddenly develop weird tastes very much out of character then realize someone else is very literally rubbing off on you. You may never have experienced anything paranormal but in constant orbit of someone who does it suddenly become common for you. When that happens you have come under their "reality bubble." At times even after cutting off contact they can still rub off on you simply by thinking about you! Consider the implications.
Many initiation rites since antiquity have one thing in common, brutality. The shocks wear down an individual's energetic defence so you merge psychically and energetically with the group, but not exactly in the way discussed in the previous papragraph. The previous example is similar to tribal sixth sense whereas this one can be compared to the vampiric example. Through brutal rites you can create a hierarchical, vampiric pyramid scheme. If your experiences are weird enough you may begin to wonder who sits on top of these pyramids. You may even start to suspect there's something backstage.
It's not always easy to distinguish whether you're ultimately being messed with by something backstage or just some occult freaks since being able to influence reality by concentrated will is itself a sign a part of us extends beyond five sense linear time. You may not even find it fruitful to try to figure it all out.
How can we stop it? I don't know if it's possible to kill it completely. If you're going through this there could be something different about you on the unseen level, and the "perps" may not all realize that. People knowingly involved in your harassment each do so for their own reasons. It's like a volunteer army, different motivations for signing up, ultimate agenda hidden from most. How they can at times instantly transmit impressions and plans amongst themselves has to do with them "resonating" on a similar level. This is not as magical as it sounds. Sometimes it only takes their common focus on you for this to happen. There is a reason even harboring non-conforming thoughts silently is a crime. It makes one "dissonant" to their surrounding and others feel it in their bones. Have a read on the Montalk site about "resonance" and "dissonance." While it's no bible it is much closer to reality than the standard version. The invisible and all pervasive thing we call culture blankets its sphere of influence and primes your focus and thus make most "resonate" with one another and thus ideations are psychically shared. People range from unconscious to semi-conscious to fully conscious to the "psychic bubble" and its influence on them, urging them to go somewhere and say and do something. You can walk into an empty establishment and seconds later it's packed. Or maybe everybody showed up today all wearing green shirts and brown pants. Or maybe everybody everywhere miles away from each other all feel like calling you some obscure name or talking about some obscure topic. There is a whole conspiracy field on symbols in the media, mostly entertainment eg. "rain man" found in many song lyrics. Priming your subconscious focus to "resonate" around certain themes, weaving a psychic web in the process. We'll come back to this in a few paragraphs (I'm not religious and I feel one hundred percent neutral on the whole satanists vs christians thing so don't miscontrue my words).
If you're "dissonant" among those who all "resonate" with one another a sizable segment (since you're only one person) of this mass may move against you but one day you may not care much any more. If you ask me the biggest threat is the potential for it to alter your "field" for the worse so you attract bad things. Think of the people who attract the same bad experiences over and over. They're coditioning you for it, by poking holes in your energy bucket and hoping you would fill it with negtivity and manifest accordingly in your life. Or they might be content if you fill it with whatever the "program" is in your given area and community. Some experiencers feel "gangstalking" is re-education and if you ask me it goes beyond behavior modifications. There were times when people directly commented on the "goodness" or "badness" of my thoughts as I passed by. Btw, ascribing these motives to all of them is crediting where it's not due. Even those "resonating" to the same tune on some levels have differing degrees of awareness. As a whole you might want to compare it to cognitive processes "emerging" from organized neurons which individually are as motivated as an amoeba, eating, eliminating, and unaware of of the aims of the "backstage" coach that is the "soul" of the machine. "oversoul?"
I just read the freeyourbrain material and if I never experienced such things I'd think they had totally lost it. To spare you of the effort to make sense of the incoherence they were basically using a method of labelling the madness around. If fear is greater in the presence of something unknown, by labeling and making sense of your perps' actions you alleviate some of that. In psychology they find people can calm themselves simply by identifying their emotions. I guess it's kinda like that. There are insights on FYB though but pretty much only a "TI" can see them.
Curiously around the time I first joined this forum they started sensitizing me to words like "dog," "vampire," and "dentist," words coincidentally also used in the campaign experienced by "freeyourbrain." I first started noticing the harassment around 2007 and at first I aired details of my life all around. I was trying to get to the bottom of it as well as protect myself by alerting those around me. It's possible they wanted me to tell people what they called me so I'd be taken for FYB. There is a whole lengthy chapter on the site devoted to love relationship between middle aged men and young teens (I'm under 30 myself and also the info came out in 2000 if you can trust the date wheras I became aware of the madness around 2007). It's also possible they hoped for someone to point me to the site.
Another possibility you can consider is what we already discussed about priming and conditioning you for a certain reality. You can consult the symbolism and mind control subforum if you wish and read up on "synchromysticism." If we attract things into our life by what's in our subconscious, by priming your "field" with certain key words and symbols you can draw related things into your life eg. Authors on synchronicity and intention manifestation have talked about incidents in their own life like being hungry for turkey and then synchronicstically seeing references to Turkey and Hungary everywhere (just a made up exmaple).
A roomate moved out once and asked me to let their cousin move in. The cousin was in their forties. The first day I suspected nothing and that evening we made chit chat in the living room and seemed to get on just fine. Later on in the evening I started dozing off and in the twilight zone I heard them growl "you piece of shit!" followed by words I couldn't make out. Every time I woke and opened my eyes from these disturbances they went back to saying nothing and wearing a smile. This went on for a while before I finally got off the couch, went to my room, and shut the door behind me. A lot of things happened with this particular roommate, too many to go into here. This was in 2008, during the height of my harassment. Why talk in someone's sleep? We can go back to the previous paragraph for illumination. Many do know a thing or two about reality creation but their methods are often experimental at best. For best examples of well honed methods we need to look no further than mass culture and discourse. This is why I choose to disconnect from most things in popular culture. Intended or not the effects are harmful. You hear some American blacks speak against the thug culture so heavily promoted in hip hop and while I can see the appeal and how it makes money I can not claim to know its long term effects. Anyways.
Coming back to FYB why would someone want to prime my psyche for this material? Much of what they wrote has truths indeed and largely corroborates with what I've independently seen. Just read their intro as posted by Forrest. It grabs your attention and says right away that they know what you're going through, but they also think that these beings and influences have total and absolute control over your life and puppet over 95% or current humanity. Ture or not if you're new to being "targeted" you might be so overwhelmed that like a drowning person you clutch onto anything with a death grip and you really need to consider what we already talked about on psychic and energetic vampirism. If you're going through a time when elements of your psyche burst into conrete reality at breakneck speed, you might want to watch what you believe.

Perhaps you've noticed that some of the most illiberal people in America these days … are liberals.
Liberals are the ones who pride themselves on being open-minded. But who are the ones on college campuses stifling speech they don't like? It's not conservative students. In 1944, college aged men were storming the beach at Normandy. Today, more than a few liberal cupcakes on campus are demanding “safe spaces” and “cry rooms” to protect them from the bogeyman who we just elected president, and more broadly from any scary idea that doesn't conform to their own.
And hasn't it been liberals who say they don't want to be lectured about morality, especially if it's by a bunch of smug conservatives? But it was smug liberals who rudely lectured the vice-president elect from a Broadway stage recently about how they and Donald Trump should behave when they take office.
And it was liberals who warned us that undemocratic right-wingers would never accept the election results if Trump lost. But it's undemocratic left-wingers who took to the streets to protest Trump's election, sometimes violently. And it's desperate liberals who are trying to overturn the election results by demanding useless recounts in several states Trump won. And it's liberals who are playing with fire, trying to convince Electoral College electors to reject Trump even if that's who voters in their states picked –and vote for Hillary instead; anything, including reported death threats against electors, to deny them the presidency.
Liberals claim to abhor anything even vaguely resembling a violation of human rights. But it's liberals this week – not all, of course, but more than a few prominent ones – who are shedding tears over the death of that great man, Fidel Castro, who like all dictators didn't tolerate freedom of speech or the press, whose autocratic regime wouldn't allow even peaceful protests, who tortured and murdered many of those who wouldn't fall into line. “In many ways, after 1959 [when Castro took power], the oppressed the world over joined Castro's cause of fighting for freedom and liberation—he changed the world, RIP.” Thank you, Jesse Jackson.
At least that wasn't as bad as the liberal prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who said they had “deep sorrow” for “the loss of this remarkable leader …who served their people for almost half a century.”
The real problem with liberal elites is that they don't think America is good enough – for them. I recently spoke to a liberal news reporter who, I got the impression, couldn't so much as conceive of the idea that millions of good, decent people voted for Donald Trump. This journalist wanted to talk about all the bigots Trump had in their corner.
They certainly had some, I acknowledged, but I wanted to know what percentage of Trump's vote did they think came from “deplorables' – was it more or less than Hillary Clinton's 50 percent? They wouldn't commit to a number, but I got the impression it was more – a lot more.
They were also appalled that Trump supporters wanted the president-elect to fulfill their campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border. I told them the reason was both simple and benign: They were against illegal immigrants sneaking into this country. They had a different theory: Trump supporters didn't want people here who don't look (white) like them.
It's interesting that liberals are the ones who tell us they care about the little guy. But a lot of little guys in Ohio and Pennsylvania and Michigan chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Don't those little guys count as far as the sophisticated liberal elite is concerned?
The problem is that too many liberals have forgotten how to be liberal, the essence of which is to keep an open mind, to consider what the other side is saying before you cavalierly label them as bigots.
Instead, they're too busy warning us that the Third Reich is coming.
William F. Buckley got it right most of the time, including the time they said that, “Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views.”
A little humility wouldn't hurt right about now. I was never a fan of Donald J. Trump (or Hillary Clinton), but I'm willing to see what kind of president they will be. Illiberal liberals might want to take a break from their non-stop disgust with the president-elect, with their holier-than-thou umbrage that never seems to end – and instead close their mouths and open their ears, and try to understand why they won, without conveniently blaming it on their horrible racist, sexist, xenophobic fellow Americans.
One of the most challenging issues found in dealing with modern web interfaces is that of state management. In this post, we'll be looking at at HMVC architecture inspired potential solution for using React's internal state management functionality to give greater control and clarity in an application.
This post requires a good working knowledge of React to understand. Also, Redux and Flux are both great concepts. This simply takes their ideas and ensures you don't need any specific implementation to get similar functionality.
Outlining the Problem
React allows for an element of ease with the render by having state as being a declarative thing, and then allowing the UI rendered to follow from whatever the state currently is. This means that the currently returned output is simply a function of the state of the application at the time.
The challenge is that a React application can be composed of dozens of modules on the page at the same time, each with its own current state. One popular solution to this is Redux, which replicates a lot of the state management from React and adds a few nice bells and whistles solves this by having the entire state held in a single place, and exposing what's required to components that need that data. Individual functions can mutate that single state object, meaning that the state of the application is always complete in a single place.
Personally though, I have an issue with this – React already includes tooling to achieve similar functionality; it just doesn't do it all for you. So here's a guide to getting some interesting things from React without the need for Redux.
The Theory
Let's start with first principles. React applications are built from components. Each component can have state or props or both. Props can take the form of essentially anything available in JavaScript. Integers, floats, arrays, objects, functions and so on.
When it comes to creating an application, we'll have a single component at the top which will render everything else, calling in various different components to render different parts of the UI as required. This means we have the potential for a single master parent element at the top of our application.
This single part, which we'll call the Conductor, will hold all the *multiply-applicable* state required by the application. By this I mean all the data that is relevant to anything more than one component. We'll also be referring to the idea of component levels, as we progress deeper into an application. As a result, the Conductor is level 0 (here-on referred to as L0).
Child components of the Conductor, or of other children then receive that data in the form of props. The reason we do this is simple – props are immutable. We must never mutate them directly. Instead, we must pass an instruction to the Conductor that we want that value to be changed, and allow it to make the change. Remember also that **functions can be props too**. That means you can pass tools to manipulate state higher in your application to child components. Also, the **main aim of a component is to allow communication** between UI elements. They *may* also render DOM output, but we don't require that that be the case.
We now have a tree-type structure, with the base of it being the conductor and data flowing through. Importantly though, the Conductor doesn't need to hold *all* of the application state. Let's imagine that at L2 we have two sibling components which need to each know the current value of the other. Whilst we could put this piece of state at L0 in the Conductor, it would be more efficient to simply have the state value at L1 in their parent component, and pass it down as a prop. On the other hand, if the components aren't siblings, then the nearest element which knows about each must be at L0. We therefore hold the state value at L0 and pass it down through L1 to the components at L2.
Obviously then any data that only resides in a single component can then be state held in that single component.
Adding Logging
One of the nice things you get with Redux is the concept of time travel through your application's state – having all the state existing in one global store means you can log the entire state each time it mutates and then traverse through the various iterations of it to see what happened when and where. However, again we can achieve this goal without the need for Redux.
Since the current state of the application can be obtained by traversing from L0 down to L(n) and asking each component for anything it has in state, we can quickly and easily recurse through everything in the application to obtain an encapsulated version of the state of any part of the system. We simply collect the state from La down to L(n), where L(a) is the top level we're interested in, and L(n) is the deepest child. That state data can be represented as a JSON object and logged somewhere. Then a recreation of the entire state of the application can be found by treating the log as an audit trail. We take the last known state for every level rendered, starting with L0 and moving down.
The only other data we need to log is when a component mounts of unmounts, so we know what should be present on the screen.
For an example, let's imagine we're working with an simple TODO app. At L0 we have the Conductor, L1 contains the components Input and List, with List having child components at L2 of Item. Item is instantiated many times with different values. Conductor has the current values for the list as state, which it passes as a prop to List in the form of an array of objects. List iterates through that array and passes each object to an Item component. Neither List nor Item have any state. Input has its current input as state, but receives no props.
To get the entire state of this application, we'd start with the Conductor. It holds the state which gives all the values displayed by List using Items. Its last known state gives us a timestamp to start at. We'd also get the last known state of Input since that time, which will give the last piece of information required to construct the view state of the app.
Taking this a step further, let's say we've got another component. It's an autocomplete, which lists types of item to be added. It has as a prop an array of all the available options, and currentValue as state, which is what the user is typing. We can then regex currentValue against the values supplied as a prop to test which should be shown. The items will then be shown as TypeItem components which will be mounted or not based on what's required by Type.
If we now added the Type component at L2, as a child of Input, we can still perform a similar operation, looking at the last given states of the Conductor, Input and Type to reconstruct the app. We can also see what TypeItem components should be mounted as a child of Type, as those will follow from the state of Type. We wouldn't need to log the mount/unmount of those, although of course we could if we wished to.
Fortunately, React has the componentDidMount, componentWillUpdate and componentWillUnmount methods. Using these, we can check every time we may need to log new state (componentWillUpdate), and mounting and unmounting operations as needed. The only other pieces of data we need to tie it all together are a user session and timestamp.
With these pieces of data, we can trace forward and back through every action a user took at any point, on any screen. We simply pull the states from the last time L0 updated to the final timestamp required, and apply the last state given for every child component.
Simplicity vs DRY
There are two obvious drawbacks to this method of React application, one when we compare it to Flux, and one when we compare it to Redux.
Compared to Flux, because we end up passing a lot of data and control functions down as props, a component can hold data that it doesn't actually use itself. Instead, it has it to pass it to deeper components. It'd be neater if you could be more declarative as to what each component required and the actions each should take. This would lead to a more Flux-like architecture though, and comes with the downside that state necessarily becomes split over different components, leading to more complex reconciliation required between components.
The other downside is that state isn't entirely represented as a single monolithic object like it would be with Redux. Instead, it's held exactly has high-up in the application as it needs to be. Logging is simpler with Redux as you're only ever dealing with a single object. However, if you want to log changes, you can end up logging vastly more data than is required (as you're logging the entire application state, rather than the changes).
Neither of these three approaches is perfect – each has pros and cons. Instead, think about what sort of functionality you want to create, and select the approach that best fits that specific use case.

The Turkish humanitarian relief organisation (IHH) is currently organising a “Freedom Flotilla II” which will carry humanitarian aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, IHH chairperson Bulent Yildrim said Thursday.
In statements to Gulf Online, Yildrim said that their organisation has embarked on legal procedures and paperwork required to obtain a permit for the trip. As soon as a final permit is issued, the IHH along with other international organisations will immediately set up the convoy.
The chairperson of IHH, a major organiser of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla I, said that Turkish army troops will accompany the ships to protect it from any potential attack, pointing out that their organisation demanded the government to provide protection for them as Turkish citizens.
Maze Keheil, the president of the European Campaign for Lifting the Siege on Gaza, confirmed their campaign's intention to take part in the new flotilla, as it did in first one in 2010.

Dragon's Dogma Quest, A 2D Online-Only RPG, Is Heading To Vita
By Ishaan . June 4, 2013 . 7:29pm
Dragon's Dogma Quest is headed to the PlayStation Vita in Japan this Fall, this week's issue of Famitsu reveals. Before you get too excited, though, note that this is a free-to-play, online-only 2D RPG.
This week's issue of Famitsu magazine (via: Game Jouhou) says Dragon's Dogma Quest has over 150 jobs and is a fast-paced RPG you can play on the go. Famitsu says the player watches over the fights, issuing commands, and also levels up.
There's more of a focus on strategy than action in Dragon's Dogma Quest, but the game hopes to capture the spirit of Dragon's Dogma, where you decide your strategies based on the enemy's appearance.
Players can explore dungeons, towns, villages, and take on many sub-quests. You bring four of your pawns and they can team up with four of your friends' pawns, too, so one party can have a maximum of eight characters.
Famitsu also mentions that Dragon's Dogma Quest, while being a free-to-play game, will have a billing model to assist those that don't have a lot of time on their hands to play.
Update: More details added; slight corrections made.
"We are big enough in our hearts to care for and grieve with the families of the police officers that were slain," Frederick Haynes III, senior pastor of Friendship-West Baptist Church, told a crowd assembled at Main Street Garden. "And our hearts are focused enough to remember why we were marching" on July 7, the night the officers were killed.
"We refuse to settle for a few kumbaya moments and then go back to what we were doing," the pastor continued, speaking into a megaphone.
The crowd numbered perhaps 80 people, not counting reporters and police — some of the latter on rooftops.
Haynes said police weren't their enemy. Rather, "we see a policing system that is the enemy."
And yet they and nearly every other speaker defended staging a protest against the police less than a month after one of the worst police slayings in recent history.
"If you ask me, it's not soon enough," said Ernest Walker III, who carried a sign made out of baseball bats — one blue for police, one black for those they've shot.
"Police officers need to be held accountable," they said. "All lives matter."
The protesters chanted as they passed down Main Street toward the shooting scene: "No justice, no peace!"

Coalition government granted far more meetings to fossil fuel sector than renewable energy companies between 2010 and 2014, Guardian analysis reveals
Fossil fuel companies enjoy far greater access to UK government ministers than renewable energy companies or climate campaigns, an analysis by the Guardian has revealed.
Shell, the fossil fuel multi-national, has had at least 112 meetings with ministers since the last general election, and its rival, BP, at least 79 meetings. But this outweighs the number of meetings that ministers granted to renewable energy companies.
Twenty-three leading companies and two trade organisations in the renewable sector were given a combined total of 119 meetings with ministers over the same period.
The analysis found at least 230 meetings with Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, Total, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and the trade organisation Oil & Gas UK during the same time.
Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP in the last parliament, criticised the coalition for giving priority to the fossil fuel giants. “Time and again the government has shown itself to be woefully ignorant and dismissive of the potential of renewables, with policies riddled with contradiction,” they said. “Perhaps if its ministers spent a little more time with the country's leading scientists and renewables experts, rather than nestled in the pockets of fossil-fuel companies, they'd be a little more enlightened.”
The pair of oil and gas giants also secured more than twice as many meetings with ministers as two of their most well-known adversaries, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, who had 67 meetings with ministers between them.
The scale of the lobbying is revealed in a database of meetings that ministers in four Whitehall departments have had with outside organisations – the ministries covering energy and climate change, the environment, business, and the treasury.
The database – compiled by the Guardian – has been drawn from official registers of meetings recorded by Whitehall from May 2010 to June 2014, the most recent declarations.
However the registers make public only uninformative descriptions of what was discussed in the meetings, stating, for instance, that they talked about “energy policy” or “business”.
After the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed their coalition government in May 2010, Shell was the the first company through the door to have an “introductory” meeting with Chris Huhne, the then secretary of state for climate change and energy.
During the lifetime of the government, its executives were able to promote the multinational's interests on a range of issues ranging from climate change to tax.
In two months, July and October 2011, Shell saw ministers at least eight times . That was a year in which the company's responsibility for oil spills in Nigeria was frequently in the news, as were the company's interests in Iraq, Kurdistan and Libya.
BP's meetings helped to develop, in the words of a Foreign Office diplomat, the effort to “strengthen the strategic alliance” between BP and the government on global economic and energy issues. The comment, made in documents disclosed under the freedom of information act, was made last year before an annual “high-level” dinner attended by senior diplomats and BP executives.
A BP spokesperson said: ”BP is a major UK-headquartered company with significant businesses and investments in the UK as well as worldwide. We employ around 15,000 people in this country and are currently undertaking a multi-billion pound investment programme in the UK North Sea.
I was just amazed at their sense of entitlement. They thought the government was there to ease their way
“As such, we have regular meetings with various Government departments who are interested in both our business and various issues involving our industry. Many of these are at the Government's request.”
A Shell spokesperson said: “Shell is a leading FTSE100 company, and as part of our perfectly legitimate corporate activity we engage regularly with many stakeholders, including government ministers and officials, on a wide range of topics related to the energy industry and Shell's operations.”
The face-to-face meetings with ministers allow the fossil fuel industry to promote their interests. A government source who was regularly involved in the meetings with energy companies described how they vehemently objected to a windfall tax that was suddenly imposed on North Sea oil producers in 2011.
They warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK would be lost. “The oil companies were absolutely furious, as they hadn't known anything about it. They said it had ruined their positions within their [multinational] companies in fighting for investment in the North Sea,” said the source.
The same source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, has been struck by the firms that want to start fracking: “I was just amazed at their sense of entitlement. They thought the government was there to ease their way, not to strike a balance with public concerns.”
Senior figures in the renewable industry said they had difficulty securing face-to-face meetings with ministers. One senior person in the renewables industry also described how ministers seemed indifferent to an overseas renewables company that was offering to invest a substantial sum in Britain. “You'd think that would be welcomed, but there was no sign of a red carpet, let alone a cup of coffee. There was an odd atmosphere and they were not really paying full attention.”
Another senior executive in the renewables industry blamed Conservative ministers in the Liberal Democrat-controlled Department of Energy and Climate Change for the difficulty in getting meetings.
“There was a huge difference with the Liberal Democrat ministers. They were accessible and supportive. We couldn't have asked for more from them but they did not have the clout to deliver everything,” said the executive.
If Cameron's serious about keeping people's energy bills down... he'd put their money – and meetings – where their mouth is Caroline Lucas
Michael Fallon, the energy minister in 2013 and 2014, before they were promoted to the cabinet, was identified by two renewable industry executives as being particularly unwelcoming. One said: “He refused all our meeting requests and flatly refused to engage. They kept finding excuses not to meet.”
The other said: “We found it very difficult even to get a meeting with him, even when the issues directly affected their brief as energy minister.”
Environmental campaigners said their access to ministers was diluted as they met the politicians with other campaign groups.
The database shows that more of the meetings that Shell and BP had with ministers were on their own (43 and 33 respectively) compared to Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. Friends of the Earth had 14 meetings on their own and Greenpeace 11.
One campaigner involved in these meetings said the encounters with ministers often took the form of a question and answer session about issues that were topical. Another campaigner, Alastair Harper, a policy adviser at the Green Alliance, said the advantage of a range of environmental campaigns meeting ministers at the same time was that it allowed the campaigners to signal that they had broad support on a particular issue.
Lucas added: “This year, David Cameron dubbed climate change one of “the greatest threats” we faced. But the chasm unearthed here is sadly illustrative of a government out of touch with the vast opportunities offered by the renewables industry. If Cameron's serious about keeping people's energy bills down and improving energy security, he'd put their money – and meetings – where their mouth is.”
The Department for Energy and Climate Change said it would not comment while the general election was taking place.
• How The Guardian calculated the number of meetings:
Every department publishes a record of ministers' meetings with external organisations. The records are usually published every quarter. The Guardian downloaded all of these since the coalition came to power, in all 116 documents. The information was turned into a database listing every meeting and every organisation. The organisations can either meet with the minister one-on-one, or as part of a larger group.
Often, several organisations take part in the same meeting. For example, BP met ministers 79 times, Shell 112 times, but Shell and BP had 165 meetings together with the ministers. That's because Shell was present in some of the 79 meetings that BP had, and vice versa. This affects the totals when the figures for individual organisations are added together.
Physicians at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and biomedical engineers at Cornell University have succeeded in building living facsimiles of human ears. They believe that their bioengineering method will finally achieve the goal of providing normal-appearing new ears to children born with a congenital ear deformity. The researchers used three-dimensional (3D) printing and injectable gels made of living cells. Over a three-month period, the ears steadily grew cartilage to replace the collagen used in molding them.
The study's colead-author is Dr. Jason Spector (director of the Laboratory for Bioregenerative Medicine and Surgery, LBMS; associate professor of plastic surgery at WCMC; and adjunct associate professor in biomedical engineering department at Cornell University). They say, “A bioengineered ear replacement like this would also help individuals who have lost part or all of their external ear in an accident or from cancer.”
Current replacement ears have Styrofoam-like consistency; sometimes, surgeons build ears from ribs harvested from young patients. “This surgical option is challenging and painful for children, and the ears rarely look totally natural or perform well,” says Spector, who is also a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “Other attempts to ‘grow' ears have failed in the long term.” In addition to appearing and functioning naturally, these ears can be made quickly — taking a week at most.
The study's other lead author is Dr. Lawrence J. Bonassar (associate professor and associate chair of the biomedical engineering department at Cornell University). The deformity they and Spector seek to remedy is microtia, a congenital deformity in which a child's external ear — typically only one — is not fully developed. Causes for this disorder are not entirely understood, but research has found that it can occur in children whose mothers took an acne medication during pregnancy. The incidence varies from one to four per 10,000 births each year. Many affected children have an intact inner ear but experience hearing loss due to the missing external ear structure, which normally acts to capture and conduct sound.
Spector and Bonassar have been collaborating on bioengineered human replacement parts since 2007, and Bonassar also works with other Weill Cornell physicians. (For example, they and neurological surgeon Dr. Roger Härtl are currently testing bioengineered disc replacements using techniques similar to those described here.) The researchers are developing replacements for human structures primarily made of cartilage: e.g., joints, tracheas, and noses. Cartilage needs no vascularization to survive.
To make the ears, Bonassar and colleagues first combined laser scans and panoramic photos (in just 30 seconds) of ears from twin girls to make a digitized 3D image. Then they converted that into a digitized “solid” ear and used a 3D printer to assemble a mold of it. They injected animal-derived collagen (frequently used in cosmetic/plastic surgery) into the resulting mold, then added ∼250 million human cartilage cells. As the main mammalian structural protein, collagen serves as a scaffold on which cartilage can grow. The high-density collagen gel developed by Cornell researchers resembles the consistency of flexible gelatin when the mold is removed.
“The process is fast,” says Bonassar. “It takes half a day to design the mold, a day or so to print it, and 30 minutes to inject the gel. We can remove the ear 15 minutes later. We trim the ear and then let it culture for several days in a nourishing cell culture medium before it is implanted.”
During a three-month observation period, cartilage grew to replace the collagen scaffold in the ears. “Eventually the bioengineered ear contains only auricular cartilage,” says Spector, “just like a real ear.” Previous bioengineered ears have been unable to maintain their shape/dimensions over time, and their cells did not survive.
These researchers are looking at ways to expand populations of human cartilage cells in vitro so that those cells could be used in ear molds. Spector says the best time to give a bioengineered ear to a child would be at five or six years of age, when most ears are 80% of their adult size. “We don't know yet if the bioengineered ears would continue to grow to their full size, but I suspect that they will,” they say. “Surgery to attach a new ear would be straightforward: The malformed ear would be removed and the bioengineered ear inserted under a flap of skin.” Spector says that if all future safety and efficacy tests work out, the first such procedure might be possible in as little as three years. “These bioengineered ears are highly promising because they precisely mirror the native architecture of a human ear,” they say. “They should restore hearing and a normal appearance to children and others in need. This advance represents a very exciting collaboration between physicians and basic scientists. It is a demonstration of what we hope to do together to improve the lives of patients with ear deformity, missing ears, and beyond.”

About the Author
Dear Editor,
Just when I thought I had heard every excuse for Mrs. Clinton's loss a year ago, I am proved wrong.
In light of the recent sexual harassment allegations, Ms. Jill Filipovic, a contributing op-ed writer for the New York Times, has concluded that men cost Hilary Clinton the election.(The Men Who Cost Clinton the Election, Dec. 1, 2017)
Ms. Filipovic wrote that the Lauer , Rose and other interviewers were harshly biased against Mrs. Clinton and affected the outcome of the race against them It was this form of “sexual harassment” that led to them defeat.
This is more of the re-imagining of history to justify the great loss by Mrs. Clinton. It's that darn Electoral College. It's James Comey's fault. Or it's Bill Clinton's fault for an ill-timed meeting. Now their historic loss is due to sexual harassment by men. Another meaningless rewriting of history – to what end? Or is it just more of the angst regarding President Trump's victory?
But the idea that sexual harassment of Mrs. Clinton led to their defeat is mythical at best and far-fetched at worst. Mrs. Clinton lost because of Mrs. Clinton's lack of vision. To this day no one knows their vision for the nation because they never clearly had one. Besides not connecting with people, Clinton was just not viewed as likable or trustworthy.
Was James Comey sexist in stating Mrs. Clinton was “extremely careless” with their emails or was they stating a fact based on evidence? Obviously, the latter is true.
Let's not forget that forces were also aligned to help Mrs. Clinton including the DNC's overt favoritism for Mrs. Clinton and DNC bias against Bernie Sanders. In fact, it appears several women at the DNC could be labeled “sexist” in denying equal treatment to Mr. Sanders. Sexist behavior is a two-way street. Did the overt “sexism” of the DNC favoring Mrs. Clinton cost Bernie Sanders the election? Evidence can only be stretched so far.
The only way to make this preposterous claim that Clinton lost due to sexual harassment by men is to ignore or omit blatant facts and evidence from the campaign. Of course sexual harassment is unacceptable, about that there is no question or rebuttal. But to attribute Mrs. Clinton's defeat to sexual harassment is a grave miscarriage of reality.
PARIS — The euro zone economy expanded in June for a 12th straight month, a private sector report indicated on Monday, but the pace of growth slowed and there were signs that the French economy may again be shrinking.
A broad index of economic output based on surveys of purchasing managers by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm based in London, came in at 52.8 in June, down from the 53.5 recorded in May and falling to the weakest pace since December.
A number above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below that level suggests contraction. Economists see the surveys as providing one of the most timely indicators of the state of the euro zone economy.
The data showed a glaring discrepancy between most of the currency bloc and France, where a broad-based slowdown appears to be underway, Markit said. Businesses are shedding more workers at a time of already high unemployment.
3D printed materials
In the 3D printing process, viscoelastic inks with highly controlled rheological behavior are extruded through a microscale nozzle or die, resulting in the layer-by-layer building of programmable architectures whose complexity is controlled by strand size and spanning distance over gaps in the underlying layers35. The former is influenced by the applied pressure, die geometry and rheological response of the resin, while the latter is a function of gel strength, deposition speed, shear rate and resin density36. Here, we pursue intrastrand porosity using a silicone based ink comprised of polymeric shell, gas filled microspheres or microballoons to further enhance the compressibility of porous elastomeric structures. Figure 1a–c illustrates the two different gas filled microballoon pore former particle size distributions used to evaluate the effect of shell stiffness and glass transition temperature, T g (44° and 113°, see Figure S1), on compressive behavior and shape memory in our printed structures (Fig. 1d–g).

Rheological behavior
To achieve optimal elastomeric flow behavior for our composite inks, we performed stress-controlled rotational rheology experiments using a variety of conditions with a typical microballoon loading of 40 vol%. Under oscillatory flow at a frequency of 10 Hz (Fig. 2a), the effect of microballoon addition manifests as an increase in storage and loss moduli, accompanied by a slight increase in yield stress in the case of the T g 44 resin, while maintaining printability. No permanent die swell was observed through either measurement of printed strands or in situ measurement of flow near the die exit. This is attributable to power law behavior due to wall slip/plug flow (Fig. 2b), indicating that no configurational entropy is recovered upon nozzle exit.
Figure 2 Effect of microballoons on (a) rotational oscillatory response, (b) continuous flow behavior of the ink, and (c) response to compressive loading of the cast and printed structures. Full size image
Subtle influences of the pore former size distribution and volume loading on rheological behavior are observed; however, printability and structural repeatability is minimally affected. The DIW process, illustrated in Fig. 1d, highlights the potential of gas filled microballoons to substantially reduce the printed strand density, which can lead to enhanced strand spanning capability37.
Mechanical response
Gas filled microballoons provide a means of tuning the mechanical performance of 3D printed elastomers, beyond architecture; the lattice is limited by nozzle diameter, ink rheology and available extrusion pressure. To isolate the effect of structural porosity from intrastrand porosity, both bulk (cast) and printed structures were evaluated. In neat siloxane structures, printed in cross-ply (alternating 0° and 90° layered structures referred to as face-centered tetragonal or FCT38, Fig. 1d–g) and cast without microballoons, two regimes of compression response are observed. In the first regime (<40% ε in Fig. 2c), deformation is architecturally driven, accommodated by compaction and inlaying of upper layers in layers below. In the subsequent regime, deformation is driven by the strand material properties. The transition between the two will be referred to as structural “lock up”. This initial deformation mechanism of strand nestling in FCT printed structures has been investigated previously using in situ images acquired during compression loading and numerical simulations7.
Note that the inclusion of the T g 44 microballoons minimally affects the first regime of response, yet substantially lowers the material stiffness in the second regime (above 40% strain). This is attributed to the T g 44 microballoon compressibility, observed in cast resin filled with 40 vol% T g 44 microballoons. The cast resin filled with 40 vol% T g 113 microballoons is stiffer than the cast resin filled with 40 vol% T g 44 microballoons, indicating that the T g 113 microballoons are stiffer than the Tg44 microballoons. The bulk siloxane resin experiences comparatively little strain under applied loading, while cast siloxane filled with 40 vol% T g 113 and 40 vol% T g 44 microballoons undergoes 9% and 27% strain, respectively, under the same applied load. These strains are accommodated primarily through a nonlinear response at 1000 kPa and 300 kPa, respectively, attributed to yielding or breakage of the microballoons.
In the case of specimens cast with T g 113 microballoons, we attribute the lower stiffness observed above 0.5 MPa to fracture of the glassy microballoon shell. In printed structures filled with 40 vol% T g 113 microballoons, we observe a stiffer material response early on, leading us to conclude that, at 40 vol%, the glassy, rigid particles inhibit structural motion/strand nestling. This behavior is lessened in the 25 vol% T g 113 printed structure, which exhibits greater deformation below 600 kPa. The strain accommodated during the first regime is reduced, in this case, from ~40% to 35%. For 25 vol% and 40 vol% loading T g 113, the stiffness of the material above the lock-up stress (point at which structural porosity becomes very small) in the microballoon filled print is comparable to that of the neat resin print. Conversely, recall that the lower stiffness T g 44 microballoons do not increase structural resistance to compression; in fact, they result in a lower stiffness response throughout loading beyond structural lock up or interlayer compaction. These results are presented to illustrate the effect of microballoon mechanical properties on open cell printed structures.
Shape memory behavior
Shape memory evaluations, quantified by compression set, were performed by holding printed structures under compression during thermal soak, cooling under compression and releasing the compressive load (Fig. 3a), were performed to assess the long term effect of microballoon addition on structural performance. Percent recovery was determined as a ratio of the recovered thickness to the compressive deformation. Neat siloxane prints exhibited a small but measurable compression set at 40% and 60% strain when held at 70 °C for 70 h (Fig. 3c). This thickness change was somewhat recoverable after reheating to 70 °C for 30 min. The addition of T g 113 microballoons resulted in 20% reduction in thickness, following the same heating schedule at 40% and 60% strain. None of this deformation was recoverable after reheating to 70 °C for 30 min. The T g 44 microballoons resulted in 45% and 57% reduction in thickness, following the same heating schedule at 40% and 60% strain, respectively. This material experienced noticeable recovery upon reheating, recovering 10–15% thickness at 70 °C for 30 min. Complete thickness recovery was observed upon reheating to 110 °C for 2.5 h.

KOZHIKODE (Kerala): Brazilian superstar Ronaldinho on Sunday got a tumultuous welcome on their maiden visit to the state with thousands turning out to greet the football wizard.
Ronaldinho is here after being named as the brand ambassador of the Sait Nagjee Football Tournament that is being revived after a gap of 21 years. Even though the tournament is to begin on February 5 here, the organisers have brought in the two-time World Player of the Year to ensure that they get a very strong pre-event publicity.
Arriving from Dubai on Sunday morning at Kochi, Ronaldinho flew in to Kozhikode on a helicopter and here, the football lovers from Kozhikode and Malappuram turned out in huge numbers. After seeing the crowd, the 2002 World Cup-winner first retreated and appeared a while later.
Spotted wearing dark sunglasses and a sleeveless singlet, the playmaker found it tough to reach their vehicle. From the airport to the hotel, they were taken in a procession of 500 two-wheelers with several turning up to see them on the drive to the hotel.
Ronaldinho was capped 97 times by their country in which they scored 33 goals. They also played for top clubs like Paris St. Germain, Barcelona and AC Milan.
The 35-year-old will be given a civic reception here in the evening where the trophy of the tournament would be handed to him. On Monday, they are to visit a state-run school to interact with the children.
The tournament will see the participation of seven teams from Europe, South America besides one I-League team. The last time the tournament was held in 1995, JCT Mills beat Dempo Goa to clinch the title.
Lawyers for the Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its officers could legally use waterboarding and other harsh measures while interrogating al-Qaeda suspects, as long as they acted "in good faith" and did not deliberately seek to inflict severe pain, according to a Justice Department memo made public yesterday.
The memo, apparently intended to assuage CIA concerns that its officers could someday face torture charges, said interrogators needed only to possess an "honest belief" that their actions did not cause severe suffering. And the honest belief did not have to be based on reality.
"Although an honest belief need not be reasonable, such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it," stated the Aug. 1, 2002, memo signed by Jay S. Bybee, then an assistant attorney general with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
The memo was one of three released by the Justice Department under Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The heavily redacted memos offer insight into the administration's legal maneuvering as it sought to justify the CIA's program of aggressively interrogating high-level al-Qaeda operatives held in secret prisons overseas. The program included waterboarding, or simulated drowning, as well as sleep deprivation and other measures intended to weaken resistance and coerce confessions.
While human rights groups and many legal experts have condemned such tactics as tantamount to torture, the Justice memo argued that no action could be considered torture unless it was intended as torture.
"The absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture," it said. Bybee, the author, also drafted a previously released 2002 memo that sought to define torture as an act that inflicted suffering so severe as to result in death or permanent damage to bodily organs.
ACLU officials attacked the documents' logic. "The memos provide further evidence that the Office of Legal Counsel completely distorted the law in order to permit interrogators to use methods that the U.S. has historically viewed as war crimes," said Jameel Jaffer, director of the ACLU National Security Project.
Noting that entire pages of the documents had been blacked out, Jaffer accused the administration of hiding crucial information "to shield senior officials from embarrassment, accountability and possibly even criminal prosecution."
A CIA spokesperson defended the agency's interrogation program and said a judge approved the redactions to protect security.
"One of the CIA's objectives was to deny terrorists insights into a lawful tool that has been used with great success against them," said the spokesperson, Paul Gimigliano. "It's absurd for anyone to suggest that's an attempt to avoid accountability."
They said the interrogation policies helped disrupt terrorist plots and were "safe, lawful and effective."
Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesperson, noted that the Bybee memo was rescinded more than three years ago and replaced by a new legal opinion that broadened the definition of torture.
Other memos released yesterday offered insight into the extreme care the CIA took in ensuring that interrogators followed agency rules. One such document, signed by then-CIA chief George J. Tenet in January 2003, ordered that extensive records be kept for each interrogation as it occurred -- to reflect "the nature and duration on each technique employed," they wrote.

Two ex-CIA officers are also employed on the show as producers
rumors about the agency and educate viewers on the history of the 'PDB'
The CIA has been live-tweeting the show to
On the new political drama State of Affairs, Katherine Heigl plays a CIA analyst dealt the heavy responsibility of keeping the president informed on the biggest national security issues of the day, which they compile in a folder called the President's Daily Brief.
But the CIA says paper briefs are SO last administration.
The spy agency has been live-tweeting State of Affairs every Monday night, using the show's plot to dispel rumors and educate viewers on the history of the 'PDB' and how it comes together today.
In several scenes on the show, Heigl's character Charleston Tucker is seen talking the president, played by Alfre Woodard, through the daily brief printed out on sheets of paper in a leather folder. The CIA says the PDB hasn't been printed out for years. Instead, President Barack Obama and other key policymakers view their daily brief in tablet form.

A modern president: President Obama no longer kills trees to read their daily brief. Instead, they and other key national security policymakers view the document on a tablet, the CIA revealed
In another episode, Heigl is seen meeting in person with other CIA agents, which the agency says is actually dangerous since enemies can target both parties in one place.
One way agents get around meeting face to face is by staging 'dead drops' in which they hide information to be picked up by the other party. The CIA then tweeted a picture from their museum, showing an old dead drop spike, a hollow device that was pushed into the ground for concealment.
A CIA spokesperson told TMZ that State of Affairs is helping 'counter popular myths and misconceptions about the agency', and that social media is the perfect way to give Americans more information as the show plays in real time.
Secret weapon: State of Affairs has been getting a boost of authenticity from two ex-CIA officials currently employed on the show as produces. Rodney Faraon, pictured above, worked on the daily briefing team for the Clinton and second Bush Administrations

However, most of what is seen on the show is likely in line with how the CIA really works, since two ex-agents are producers and Heigl revealed that the show is also working with the agency.
'We are delving into stuff in a way no one else can do because we are actually working with CIA guys who are telling us stuff,' Heigl said in a preview for the show.
Former CIA counterterrorism head Henry Crumpton and Rodney Faraon, who was a member of the daily briefing team in the Clinton and second Bush Administrations, are both producers, bringing their years of working in the CIA to the show.
'Everything I've seen so far has been authentic,' Faraon said in a preview.

On the right, the more compact form of the daily brief compiled for President John F Kennedy. During the Kennedy Administration, the daily brief was changed to the President's Intelligence Checklist or 'PICL' which was pronounced 'pickle'. It was made small enough to fit in the president's jacket pocket
And for a super-secret spy agency, the CIA appears to maintain a semblance of transparency with their Entertainment Industry Liason office, which consults with the film and television industry on productions depicting the agency.
According to the CIA's website, the goal of the Entertainment Industry Liason is to ensure 'accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA' by 'answering questions, debunking myths, or arranging visits to the CIA'.
The CIA also provides stock images of it's Langley, Virginia compound and in some cases even permits filming at headquarters.
Need I say more? I created this sensational masterpiece out of sheer instinct and passion for the ingredients I was using. After taking about 3 bites, I told my husband, “This is the kind of stuff that makes me fall more in love with myself.” This statement in and of itself says so much, because I am not as confident in myself as that statement makes me sound.
Cheesecake, all in all, is not difficult to make. It does require some knowledge of chemistry and how the ingredients will work together. Also, it should be noted that in order to blend your cream cheese together, a hand-held mixer will simply not do. You must have a standing mixer or food processor with a similar function. The cream cheese is too thick and too hard – even when it is softened.
Crust:
2 cups of crushed graham crackers
1/2 cup of melted butter
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 cup of coco powder
3/4 cup of sugar
1 cup of white chocolate
1Stir everything together and press into the bottom of a springform pan. Melt white chocolate, and pour over the crust. (I did this very easily in the microwave on high for 1 minute. Watch it closely, though. We don't want to burn white chocolate!) refrigerate while making the filling.
Filling:
3 packages of cream cheese
5 eggs (this is the bonding agent)
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup of sugar or low-calorie sweetener
1 lime, just the juice
1 tbsp of vanilla
1 1/2 cups finely grated pecans
Whip cream cheese. Also, Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Add in eggs one at a time. Blend completely before adding another egg. Add Sour Cream. Keep blending. Add sugar. Keep blending. Add lime juice. Keep blending. Add vanilla. Keep blending. Finally, fold in the pecans. This is a fairly runny batter. Place your springform pan with your crust inside a larger pan to keep your batter from leaking out into your oven. After pouring the filling into the pan, wrap aluminum foil over the top. DO NOT REMOVE ALUMINUM FOIL. The second that you do, you will begin the cracking of the top of your cake. Bake in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the oven, but allow your cake to remain in the oven for an additional 2 hours. Then refrigerate overnight… still leaving the aluminum foil.
Topping:
Just 45 minutes before serving, create this amazing topping.
1/2 cup of pecans
1/2 cup of brown sugar
1/2 cup of amaretto (I used Amaretto Di Amore because they use both apricots and almonds to create their version of amaretto! Dekuyper's version will leave your topping very watery)
1 tbsp Vanilla
1/2 cup of chocolate syrup
Candy the pecans by making sure that the all the other (sugar-laced) ingredients are constantly covering the pecans. Cook on low for at least 20 minutes to be sure the alcohol is cooked out of the amaretto, only leaving the flavor of the apricots and almonds. Pour over top just before serving!
mmmmm….. I'm craving some right now! Hope you enjoy. Feel free to ask questions!

Human Potential For Peace
Pursuing economic justice with nonviolent protest is not new, not an invention of the present Occupy movement. It has been around probably as long as economic injustice has been around. One relatively recent example is that it effectively produced change in the 1930s for Northern Europeans who were starving.
George Lakey, in Nation of Change, writes:
“[Norway's] high level of freedom and broadly-shared prosperity began when workers and farmers, along with middle class allies, waged a nonviolent struggle that empowered the people to govern for the common good.”
Norway's economy shifted out of deep poverty at this time due to the successful end of five years of nonviolent protests. Since that time, and presently, Norway ticks as a sustainable culture — for all people. It leads the world as peaceful timekeeper. Its citizens desire peace and prioritize peace as a value more than many other countries.
Graham Kemp and Douglas Fry note, in their anthropological text Keeping the Peace: Conflict Resolution and Peaceful Societies Around the World, that “peace is highly valued in Norwegian society, and members of the society have exhibited a consistent preoccupation with the peaceful settlement of conflict, both nationally and internationally.”
Comparing these 1930s Nonviolent Protests to Occupy
George Lakey also shares information about this gentler culture: “In the 1930s Sweden and Norway, both experienced a major power shift after prolonged nonviolent struggle. They ‘fired' the top 1 percent of people who set the direction for society. The labor party was empowered and created the basis for something different.”
In the early to mid-part of the last century, northern Europeans not only attempted what the Occupy movement is attempting now, but they were able to successfully manifest change. This was done with nonviolent protests. This change took time.
The struggle lasted from 1929-35. It was a struggle that was able to manifest success. Prior to this time (when Norway's working class finally took over), people were starving due to the structure being set to support only the ruling 1 percent; thousands were emigrating due to this starvation. After the 1 percent were ‘fired', the changes worked for the whole of society. The working class was empowered in political bodies. They were able to structure positive change for all people — not just the affluent. Due to this, their economy improved. Both countries built wonderful economies. As Lakey points out, they “eliminated poverty, expanded free university education, abolished slums, provided excellent health care available to all as a matter of right and created a system of full employment.”
Quiet Ambiance, Prioritizing Peace
As Americans, we cultivate different value systems and value different character traits. This is a time of change. As we grow, there is much we will gain by imbibing some of the gentler ideals of Norwegian folks. There is a sense of homeostasis of individualism in this Northern European culture, as part of the sameness of each other. In this way, Norwegian's empower a quiet ambiance and it is a prime national value and character strength. Another may argue that this isn't real peace — still, there is much proof that Norway has made some large imprints in peacekeeping due to these attitudes and established practices.
The Swedes have what Lakey offers us to consider, “what the latest CIA World Factbook calls ‘an enviable standard of living'.” This struggle did not come easily or without paying the price that one wishes was not part of change. At that time, the 1 percent (in Norway and Sweden in 1930) was stacked in the country's political bodies, such as it now seems in America. Strikers were killed in 1931. Please read more by Max Rennebohm in the Global Nonviolent Action Database. And if you can find it, Swedish filmmaker Bo Widerberg recounts the Swedish story vividly in Ådalen 31.
“Many people then found that their mortgages were in jeopardy. (Sound familiar?)”
Norway went through times of constant outreach in this movement. Lakey notes that people have to do this in protracted, nonviolent reform campaigns. Lakey's brief summary of the time: “Many people then found that their mortgages were in jeopardy. (Sound familiar?) The Depression continued, and farmers were unable to keep up payment on their debts. As turbulence hit the rural sector, crowds gathered nonviolently to prevent the eviction of families from their farms.”
While that is similar to our country at this time, what is different is a lot: “Unlike in the U.S., the Norwegian union movement kept the people thrown out of work as members, even though they couldn't pay dues.” People counted strongly as the growing sea of workers (nonviolently) demanding better reciprocity. “The Conservative-led government lost legitimacy daily; the 1 percent became increasingly desperate.” The poor farmers and laborers were deep into the movement. However, they were growing more strained in the ways of hunger. Compromise was reached and laborers took some of the reins of governmental bodies with both sides becoming more adapted to the need of the struggle.
The struggle is also detailed in Global Nonviolent Action Database 1931-1935. Ultimately, there is no disagreement that, in Norway, it was “nonviolent struggle that empowered the people to govern for the common good.” The freedoms of a healthy economy today (which began in 1935) are found presently. The delightful deep gentleness that comes from cultivating kindness in the standard of peace and empowering the value of peacekeeping through nonviolence is a force that is shown to overcome hardship.
Park culture in Oslo By Zach Slootsky
New York is a stressful place, and Times Square isn't the most soothing of its neighborhoods. But thankfully, Draftfcb New York and the Jamaica Tourist Board recently plunked down an enormous stress ball on Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets, giving New Yorkers and visitors a chance to "squeeze their burdens away." The giant ball doesn't work like a regular stress ball—you'd never get your hand around it—but perhaps you were meant to just give it a big hug, mon. In any case, its big smiling face served as a de-stresser by itself. And if all else failed, reggae artist and Jamaica native Gyptian was on hand to perform their mellow tunes for the crowd. More images, and credits, below.

Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy attends a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 10. Eric Thayer/Getty Images
Two D.C. stories collided on Thursday when the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals handed down a 10–3 decision in International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, affirming virtually all of a Maryland district judge's nationwide injunction against Donald Trump's second try at an executive order limiting travel and immigration from six majority-Muslim countries. One story is about how a largely horrified judicial branch is the last, the best check against Trump's truth-challenged mayhem. The other is whether Justice Anthony Kennedy is poised to announce their impending retirement. These two stories are now inextricably linked, because there is almost no way to read the 206 pages' worth of opinions in IRAP as anything other than a ransom note from the federal judiciary directed solely at Justice Kennedy.
Yes, yes, the majority opinion, concurrences, and dissents are all models of judicial thoroughness and craft. But really, a shorter version of the 4th Circuit's work product could have been cut out of scraps of newsprint and mailed to Kennedy's chambers on Maryland Avenue. It needs only have read: “DoN'T LeAVe aMK!! aMEriCa NEedZ U!”
Rumors of the 80-year-old Kennedy's impending retirement have been swirling on Capitol Hill for months now. Those whispers got a lot louder in recent weeks after Trump told the Washington Times that they had “heard the same rumors that a lot of people have heard” about Kennedy, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee, blurted in April, “I would expect a resignation this summer,” then cited a “rumored” retirement. Sen. Ted Cruz made similar suggestions at CPAC, while Trump-whisperer Roger Stone has been promising that a resignation letter from Kennedy to Trump is “imminent.”
It goes without saying that the bulk of these rumors seem to be fanned by conservative news outlets, eager to point out that Kennedy is both desperate to leave and also either unaware of or unbothered by the chaos Trump has unloosed upon the planet. A cynic might argue that the White House and movement conservatives are in fact signaling to Kennedy that they really should step aside, and that by keeping the prospect of a second Neil Gorsuch—arguably Trump's only success as president—fresh in the minds of Republican voters, one might look past the shambles, grift, and lawlessness of everyday life in Trumpland.
The president's pledge that they will draw their next Supreme Court nominee from their original list of 20 judges is thus simply code for, Sure, everything else I do is dangerously deranged, but trust me, Justice Kennedy, your legacy will not be ruined with the seating of someone insane. But the truth is that Kennedy isn't talking, and your guess is as good as mine as to whether the court's centrist Republican will be bothered by the prospect of leaving their seat in the hands of someone currently operating under the shadow of an FBI investigation.
On the one hand, we know Kennedy worries more about civility, decorum, and the rule of law than virtually anyone on the high court. On the other hand, we also know Kennedy shares a close relationship with the Trump family: Their son Gregory worked with the Trump team around the inauguration, and Trump's daughter and granddaughter had seats as Kennedy's guests at an oral argument in February.
Garrett Epps, writing at the Atlantic at the time of FBI Director James Comey's firing, suggested, I think correctly, that given their respect for judicial independence and government norms, Kennedy might be offended by Trump's cavalier efforts to stymie the Russia investigation. Court watchers across the political spectrum seem to agree that Trump's reckless disregard for the judicial branch and separation of powers will make it harder for the justice to leave their storied judicial legacy in the hands of a President Trump. This is, after all, the same president who just named Damien Schiff of the Pacific Legal Foundation to serve on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims—Schiff being the man who posted on their personal blog that “Justice Kennedy is (and please excuse the language) a judicial prostitute, ‘selling' their vote as it were to four other Justices in exchange for the high that comes from aggrandizement of power and influence, and the blandishments of the fawning media and legal academy.”*
To be sure, Justice Kennedy has been hearing stuff like that for decades now, particularly from their critics on the right, and they are likely inured to it. And certainly, if necessity or fatigue leads them to depart the court in the coming weeks, history will applaud their legacy in areas ranging from affirmative action to gay rights to reproductive freedom. Also, Kennedy may well wish to depart the court before it gets locked in uglier battles that will further enmesh the courts in partisan politics, the diminution of norms, and the erosion of international regard for the rule of law in America. But it's almost impossible to read Thursday's IRAP opinions as anything but a cri de coeur to Justice Kennedy to remain on the high court at least long enough to shore up their own judicial legacy.
More than a few court watchers have pointed out that Kennedy's views on executive power, immigration law, and the role of the judiciary are very much at the core of the current travel ban litigation. Indeed, as Byron York observes, it may well fall on Kennedy's shoulders to determine whether the role of Trump themselves should be at issue at all when this case heads to the Supreme Court, which it almost inevitably will.
That's why the opinions in IRAP read like a kind of Justice Kennedy's Greatest Groovin' Hits album, with citations crashing like cymbals to Kennedy-esque words like dignity, history, freedom, animus, and democracy. Citations to landmark Kennedy opinions reverberate through the opinions and dissents so frequently that it is almost impossible to miss them. And at the heart of the matter, there lies a question about whether courts may be permitted to “look behind” a facially legitimate argument offered by the government if it is deemed to be in bad faith. This is a question that has plagued all of the travel ban litigation: Can Donald Trump's words and promises about effectuating a “Muslim ban” be laundered out of existence by their lawyers, and then ignored by the judicial branch? The appeals courts are inviting Justice Kennedy, the court's much-reviled and much-beloved swing voter, to weigh in on the very role of the courts themselves in the Trump era. It's an invitation—one that is all but engraved in gold and sealed with a white flag—that they may find difficult to ignore.
In a case heard only a few weeks ago, Kennedy appeared horrified at the prospect of a Justice Department lawyer asserting that the Trump administration had the right to revoke the citizenship of Americans who'd made inconsequential misstatements in their naturalization proceedings. “Your argument is demeaning the priceless value of citizenship,” Kennedy told the DOJ lawyer. “You're arguing for the government of the United States, talking about what citizenship is and ought to mean.” It's hard to imagine that same Justice Kennedy sloughing off what looks to be open religious animus as trivial.
Kennedy has a long and storied reputation as a Hamlet-like figure, prone to mulling, musing, and agonizing about their votes in crucial cases. Indeed, this spring's odd will-he-or-won't-he performance in the press mirrors that theme in ways that seem more made for TV than the court. Justice Kennedy also has a long and storied reputation as someone who cares about gravity and dignity and decorum, especially when incivility threatens to tear the national public discourse apart.
My own belief is that the view of Kennedy as a vacillator and flip-flopper is unfair and overwrought. They know exactly who they are and what they want to be remembered for. They have now been invited, by dint of doctrine and history, to be an arbiter of whether the courts will stand as a bulwark against Donald Trump's chaotic and disrespectful legal worldview. In one of their final acts as a jurist, they may have to decide whether the suddenly much vaunted “presumption of regularity” is due to this executive. It's hard to imagine anyone wants that kind of pressure in their day job. It's also hard to imagine that, faced with this monumental task, Justice Kennedy would be apt to walk away.

A menu labeling rule included in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has pizza shops and convenience store owners worried.
The rule, which would require calorie counts on store menus, has been delayed several times already due to the complexity of the issue.
As the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completes new guidance for stores and restaurants to comply with the rule, many business owners are concerned the rule will damage businesses, increase operating costs, and potentially expose employees to criminal charges and civil lawsuits.
“There are certain things that cannot be fixed with guidance,” Lyle Beckwith, senior vice president of government relations for the National Association of Convenience Store, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
As written, the rule would require stores that sell food to publish calorie counts for all ready to eat items. An infographic describing that consumers can expect to see calorie counts on food items at sit-down restaurants to drive-through windows to grocery and convenience stores and “take-out foods, like pizza.”
The model works well in restaurants like McDonald's, for example, that already post calories next to the price of preset menu options. The rule is harder to implement at pizza shops such as Domino's, where customers are used to customizing orders, that offers more than 5 million different ingredient combinations.
The Obamacare mandate requires the food seller to display calorie counts for all items on the menu, and threatens fines to the store, open up stores to litigation, and could conceivably result criminal charges for employees at stores that don't comply, according to industry groups.
People working part-time jobs “could potentially be felons for putting too much cheese on a hoagie,” Beckwith said.
The guidance for restaurants say one thing, but the rule, as it's written, could be interpreted differently and place business owners in a tough spot: either trying to comply completely with the FDA's rule or following the FDA's guidance. The law and the rules for implementation “could be interpreted in many different ways by many different people,” Chris Reisch, a Domino's franchisee in Kentucky, told TheDCNF.
The rule was supposed to go into effect early last May, before President Donald Trump's FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was finally confirmed May 9. The FDA delayed the rule for another year until May 7, 2018, and vowed to update the guidance but said it would not rewrite the rules.
The window for comments on the rule closed Aug. 2, and now the industry is awaiting the updated guidelines for how the FDA plans to enforce the rule. The agency will release the new guidelines at some point this fall, Gottlieb toldPolitico in September.
A spokesperson for the FDA told TheDCNF that the new guidance will be released by the end of the year.
While the industry waits for the new guidelines, they continue trying to convince congress to act. “We want a change in the legislation, and a change in the rules,” Reisch said.
Without a change in legislation, businesses like Domino's and the many stores Beckwith represents will likely be put in a costly dilemma. “We don't want to get out of this,” Reisch said. Many have opposed menu labeling, however, Reisch admitted that this is the direction the country is going.
“We all know menu labeling is here. It's something we want to do. We want to provide it to customers,” Reisch said.
For customizable pizza shops like Domino's the prospect of complying with the rules and guidelines as written seems “impossible.”
Fitting the calories for each option on the menu board behind the store counter doesn't make sense, so Reisch described a different, equally unworkable way to present the required information. “You would have to have a huge book at the counter that says here's the crust, here are the calories for each crust,” Reisch said, and plug it into a calculator. Then, choose your sauce, one of six different cheeses, and toppings, and add up the calories.
Implementing the current rule doesn't make sense for the Domino's in-store model, and the chain already has an online tool that calculates the total calories of custom pizzas as a customer orders.
Updated guidance may help, but the best solution would be a legislative fix that is being considered in the Senate, according to Beckwith. Without the legislative fix, complying with the regulation would cost convenience stores $84 billion a year, and cost all American businesses around $306 billion annually, according to a study commissioned by the National Association of Convenience Store and released earlier this year.
“Quite frankly, people are still scratching their heads on how to comply with it,” Beckwith said. “We're very concerned that guidance will do anything at all substantively to change any of this.”

Okay. You all know that I like to call out dumb graphs. And I've addressed a few on this blog previously.
Here are a few from the past: https://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/dumbest-real-reformy-graphs/
Now, each of the graphs in this previous post and numerous others I've addressed, like this one (From RiShawn Biddle) had something over the graph I'm going to address in this post. Each of the graphs I've addressed previously at the very least used some “real” data. They all used it badly. Some used it in ways that should be considered illegal. Others… well… just dumb.
But this new graph, sent to me from a colleague who had to suffer through this presentation, really takes the cake. This new graph comes to us from Marguerite Roza, from a presentation to the New York Board of Regents in September. And this one rises above all of these previous graphs because IT IS ENTIRELY FABRICATED. IT IS BASED ON NOTHING.
Perhaps even worse than that, the fabricated information on this illustrative graph suggests that its author does not have even the slightest grip on a) statistics, b) graphing, c) how one might measure effects of school reforms (and how large or small they might be) or d) basic economics.
Here's the graph:
http://www.p12.nysed.gov/mgtserv/docs/SchoolFinanceForHighAchievement.pdf
Now, here's what the graph is supposed to be saying. Along the horizontal axis is per pupil spending and on the vertical axis are measured student outcomes. It's intended to be a graph of the rate of return to additional dollars spent. The bottom diagonal line on this graph – the lowest angled blue line – is intended to show the rate of return in student outcomes for each additional dollar spent given the current ways in which schools are run. Go from $5,000 to $25,000 in spending and you raise student achievement by, oh about .2 standard deviations.
Note, no diminishing returns (perhaps those returns diminish well outside the range of this graph?). It's linear all the way – keep spending an you keep gaining…. to infinity and beyond. But I digress (that's the basic economics bit above). And that doesn't really matter – because this line isn't based on a damn thing anyway. While I concur that there is a return to additional dollars spent, even I would be hard pressed to identify a single estimate of the rate of return for moving from $5k to $25k in per pupil spending.
Where the graph gets fun is in the addition of the other two lines. Note that the presentation linked above includes a graph with only the lower line first, then includes this graph which adds the upper two lines. And what are those lines? Those lines are what we supposedly can get as a return for additional dollars spent if we either a) spend with a focus on improving teacher effectiveness or b) spend “utilizing tech-based learning systems” (note that I hate utilizing the word utilizing when USE is sufficient!). I have it on good authority that the definitions of either provided during the presentation were, well, unsatisfactory.
But most importantly, even if there was a clear definition of either, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO BACK THIS UP. IT IS ENTIRELY FABRICATED. Now, I've previously picked on Marguerite Roza for here work with Mike Petrilli on the Stretching the School Dollar policy brief. Specifically, I raised significant concern that Petrilli and Roza provide all sorts of recommendations for how to stretch the school dollar but PROVIDE NO ACTUAL COST/EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS.
In this graph, it would appear that Marguerite Roza has tried to make up for that by COMPLETELY FABRICATING RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS for their preferred reforms.
Now let's dig a little deeper into this graph. If you look closely at the graph, Roza is asserting that if we spend $5,000 per pupil either a) traditionally, b) focused on teacher effectiveness or c) on tech-based systems, we are at the same starting point. Not sure how that makes sense… since the traditional approach is necessarily least productive/efficient in the reformy world… but… yeah… okay. Let's assume it's all relative to the starting point for each…which would zero out the imaginary advantages of two reformy alternatives… which really doesn't make sense when you're pitching the reformy alternatives.
Most interesting is the fact that Roza is asserting here that if you add another $20,000 per pupil into tech-based solutions – YOU CAN RAISE STUDENT OUTCOMES BY A FULL STANDARD DEVIATION. WOBEGON HERE WE COME!!!!! Crap, we'll leave Wobegon in the dust at that rate. KIPP… pshaw… Harlem-Scarsdale achievement gap… been there done that! We're talking a full standard deviation of student outcome improvement! Never seen anything like that – certainly not anything based on… say… evidence?
To be clear, even a moderately informed presenter fully intending to present fabricated but still realistic information on student achievement would likely present something a little closer to reality than this.
Indeed this graph is intended to be illustrative… not real…. but the really big problem is that it is NOT EVEN ILLUSTRATIVE OF ANYTHING REMOTELY REAL.
Now for the part that's really not funny. As much as I'm making a big joke about this graph, it was presented to policymakers as entirely serious. How or whether they interpreted it as serious, who knows. But, it was presented to policymakers in New York State and has likely been presented to policymakers elsewhere with the serious intent of suggesting to those policymakers that if they just adopt reformy strategies for teacher compensation or buy some mythical software tools, they can actually improve their education systems at the same time as slashing school aid across the board. Put into context, this graph isn't funny at all. It's offensive. And it's damned irresponsible! It's reprehensible!
Let's be clear. We have absolutely no evidence that the rate of return to the education dollar would be TRIPLED (or improved at all) if we spent each additional dollar on things such as test score based merit pay or other “teacher quality” initiatives such as eliminating seniority based pay or increments for advanced degrees. In fact, we've generally found the effect of performance pay reforms to be no different from “0.” And we have absolutely no evidence on record that the rate of return to the education dollar could be increased 5X if we moved dollars into “tech-based” learning systems.
The information in this graph is… COMPLETELY FABRICATED.
And that's why this graph makes my whole new category of DUMBEST COMPLETELY FABRICATED GRAPHS EVER!

Rose Bowl matchup should be smashing STANFORD FOOTBALL
In an era of spread offenses and passing attacks, the Rose Bowl will match teams that are throwbacks to an era when there were no facemasks.
Both Stanford and Wisconsin play smash-mouth football. The Jan. 1 game in Pasadena figures to be a rushing festival.
"It's going to be a bloodbath," Stanford defensive end Ben Gardner said Sunday night. "It's going to be a physical game up front. We're going to try to show that we can play physical in the Pac-12 as well."
Linebacker Shayne Skov said, "It's going to be much more of an old-school, old-fashioned football game than people are used to. It's going to be fun."
On a conference call with the national media, Stanford head coach David Shaw said they and Wisconsin's Bret Bielema talked at a banquet last year "about how we admire how each other plays."
"This is probably going to be the first team for the both of us that's almost like a mirror image. I think our guys are going to see things they go against in training camp."
As recently as three weeks ago, few people imagined that the Cardinal and the Badgers would hold a rematch of their January 2000 Rose Bowl, in which Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne led Wisconsin to a 17-9 win.
Stanford's Ben Gardner says the Rose Bowl is "going to be a bloodbath." Good thing both teams wear red. Stanford's Ben Gardner says the Rose Bowl is "going to be a bloodbath."

Stanford needed probably the greatest finishing drive in its football history - beating Oregon State, then-No. 1 Oregon and UCLA (twice), all ranked teams. Wisconsin is the first five-loss team to reach Pasadena.
"We're a different team now than we were at the beginning of the season," Stanford linebacker Trent Murphy said. "The same thing can be said for them."
The Badgers finished third in their division but took advantage of being able to play for the title because both Ohio State and Penn State were ineligible for postseason play.
Their 8-5 record is highly misleading. The five losses were by a combined 19 points, including three overtime defeats. The Badgers erased any doubts by clobbering Nebraska 70-31 on Saturday in the Big Ten title game. They are only the second Big Ten team to play in three straight Rose Bowls; Michigan did it in the late 1970s.
Still, the Badgers are unranked in the Associated Press poll. Stanford remained No. 8 in the latest survey and was No. 6 in the final BCS standings. The Rose Bowl marks Stanford's third straight year in a BCS bowl game and fourth straight in a bowl.
The Pasadena trip is "definitely a dream come true" for Gardner, a Wisconsin native. "I was raised a Badger fan," they said.
On signing day at their high school, they recalled, one of their teammates signed with the Badgers, and both players received questions about a possible matchup in the Rose Bowl. "But the people obviously didn't believe it was going to happen," Gardner said. "They almost laughed at it as a long shot."
Shaw said the late-season successes of the two Rose Bowl teams are "part of the reason why conferences have gone to a championship game. You always have a chance. If you can find a way to get into those championship games, you never know what is going to happen."
Getting there: Rose Bowl tickets go on sale at gostanford.com at 9 a.m. Monday.
Sometime back in my childhood, I got the idea that it was "nicer" to say "I'm Jewish" than "I'm a Jew." And preferably, in the mainly Christian suburb of Milwaukee where I grew up, one said it in a sort of mumble.
And no one ever used "Jewess," which seemed archaic enough to ignore when encountered in 19th century novels like Ivanhoe or Daniel Deronda. (Nor was it considered pejorative then, as I learned from Daniel Krieger's excellent article "The Rise and Fall—and Rise—of 'Jewess.'") But the word was disturbing in modern contexts, for instance, when Raymond Chandler in The Big Sleep describes a woman as having "the fine-drawn face of an intelligent Jewess." What, we all have the same cheekbones? In that case, I'll take Lauren Bacall's. "Intelligent Jewess" so stuck in my craw that it inspired my novel, The Tin Horse, in which I imagine that "Jewess's" story.
In recent years, various "out" groups have reclaimed language, taking words once flung at them as slurs and boldly using them to self-identify. "Say it loud, I'm Black and I'm proud." The gay community has asserted ownership of "queen" and "queer," and my favorite Gay Pride Parade participants are the motorcycle-riding "dykes on bikes."
What linguists call "semantic reclamation" has also been happening for "Jew." The cheeky Klezmatics put out albums titled "Rhythm and Jews" and "Jews with Horns"—and they made klezmer cool. These days we've got the irreverent online mags Jewniverse and Jewcy, not to mention Jewcy tee shirts.
And some young, hip Jews are trying to embrace "Jewess." Look at the smart blogs Jewesses with Attitude and Jewess. Enter "Jewess" in Jewcy's search box, and you get ten pages of links. But those are niche websites, and they're not trying to appeal to a wide audience. When I floated the working title for my book, An Intelligent Jewess, some people loved its in-your-faceness—the wonderful woman who would become my agent wrote in response to my query, "From one intelligent Jewess to another, I'd love to read your book." Even more people, though, felt pushed away by it; non-Jews felt excluded, and it made many Jews squirm. And "Jewess" isn't just anti-Semitic, it's one of those sexist "ess" words like "flight attendantess," a double whammy that suggests Hebraic odalisques. Nevertheless, maybe the Jewesses with Attitude are on to something, and "Jewess" will flip from pejorative to cool. I'd love to see it happen. On the other hand, are some words beyond redemption?

This Game-of-Thrones election has been marred by a terrible injustice and we all know exactly what it is: the member for South Thanet right now should be UKIP leader Nigel Farage and the fact that he's not is a totally bloody disgrace which reflects exceedingly badly on Cameron's Conservatives and the political and media Establishment generally.
“Destroy Farage!” it often seemed was the single most important objective of their entire election strategy. Senior Tory after senior Tory was ordered into South Thanet to marshal the troops. Tame newspaper proprietors – who didn't necessarily love Cameron but loathed and feared Miliband – co-operated by smearing UKIP with every desperate non-story they could trawl up and by dutifully trotting out the Lynton-Crosby-endorsed line that a vote for Farage was a vote for Miliband.
If Farage had been a weird lefty wonk or a rabid kilted nationalist or an eco-fascist loon this concerted campaign would have been understandable. But he's not. As he's shown time and again throughout their heroic campaign, they are a brave, decent, funny, likeable bloke who speaks their mind, has a good sense of humour and the common touch, and the kind of robust political principles – see the UKIP manifesto – with which the vast majority of Conservatives would agree wholeheartedly.
And still the Conservatives shafted him: far more viciously and determinedly, in fact, than they sought to shaft any of their true ideological enemies, whether Nicola Sturgeon, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband or Natalie Bennett. Why?
Well, of course, partly it was a Judaean People's Front/Popular Front of Judaea thing: you always loathe those political rivals whose views accord most closely with your own. (Which is why the Nazis and the Communists so hated one another).
Partly too, it was straightforward Machiavellian commonsense. UKIP, by dividing the Tory party, had become an existential threat. Therefore UKIP had to be destroyed and the best way of achieving this was by decapitation.
Except we have a problem. Out there in the country right now are nearly four million UKIP voters who – having garnered 12 per cent of the vote – are feeling not a little disgusted that all they landed for their troubles was a single parliamentary seat. (Douglas Carswell)
Here, according to one tweeter, is the average number of votes it took for each party to win their seats. I don't know how accurate they are except for the UKIP one, which is definitely right and tells you all you need to know about the injustice of it all.
SNP 26,444
CON 34,342
LAB 40,232
GRN 121,216
LD 289,262
UKIP 3,767,137
These people are now the bitterest enemies of the government and if Cameron has any decency, magnanimity or political nous he'll do something to sort out this problem quickly.
Decency requires it of them because what they and their party did to Farage was politically expedient but morally reprehensible. No one has done more to earn their place in Westminster than Nige.
Magnanimity requires it of Cameron because having just won a stonking victory which had more to do with fear of the Scots and of Miliband's socialism than it did with their own achievements, they really ought to be of a mind to be spread their good fortune a little.
Political nous requires it of them because Farage is a brilliant, inspirational politician who deserves to be at the top table and because it makes no sense to make bitter enemies of a party which, though not the same as the Conservatives, definitely has much more in common with them than it does with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Greens.
What Cameron should do is follow the advice given by Lord Ashcroft in a tweet.
I know this won't be universally popular but I'd like to see @Nigel_Farage in the Lords…@UKIP has had 3m votes — Lord Ashcroft (@LordAshcroft) May 8, 2015
If I were Cameron, I'd go a step further than that and offer Lord Farage a place in the cabinet. A seat in government is the least Farage deserves. It's also the least UKIP deserves after all the effort it has put into this election and all the popular support it has won.
But it will never happen, I doubt. Even if Cameron were to countenance such a gift, Farage could never accept it because they would be seen as a traitor by their own party. They would be seen by the old Labourites within their ranks – Red UKIP – to have been co-opted by the enemy; while the Thatcherites and libertarians within their party would no doubt denounce them as a sell-out to the Conservative who destroyed Conservatism.
This pettiness, pride and factionalism is why I loathe party politics and why I'm so glad my attempts to become involved in it were so brief. I hate the fact that our two parties of the right now hate each other far more than the left-wing parties they ought to hate.
I wish there were some way of uniting the right. Anyone got any bright ideas?

Preview of Awesomeness
In the next couple screencasts, we're going to make something really awesome. Let me show you. Let's say that you're wanting to show these posts, but you don't really care when they're updated. That's fine. You also don't care who the author is. That's cool too. Oh, and you want to display created before the title. Yeah, we can do that. Best of all, it's all in the URL, so you can keep your settings.
I show you this at the start because we're going to have put in a little bit of work before we get to the cool parts, and I don't want you giving up part way through. So let's get started.
Abstract the Columns
The first bit of work we'll have to do is abstract the columns. Right now, you can see all 4 of them are hard-coded, both in the header and in the body, so let's move that array to our JavaScript. Here we have the available columns array, and it has important information like the title and the property, as well as the way we want it to be displayed. It's different for plain text versus a date because we'll want to do some processing on the date. Then we have columns, which right now is just an alias for available columns, but will be much more later on.
When we go to the template, we'll want to replace the headers and the body. Let's start with the header. We'll loop through each of the columns and set the title as the column title, and then the sort property as the column property. Then, selected sorts and is ascending will be the same as before. With that, we can delete the hard-coded ones. Let's check and make sure, and it is still displaying like before.
Now we'll pull the same trick with the data display, but it's going to be a little bit harder, as you can see, because all of these are much less homogeneous than the sortable headers are. We start off with our each loop, but then we have a little bit of a problem because we can't just do post.author, like we could down here, because each of these columns is going to have a different property they want to call, and that property is stored on column.property, but that won't work either because then post is going to look for a column property on itself.
ember-get-helper
Luckily, there's an ember add-on for this, ember-get-helper from Jane Murphy. I've already installed the add-on, so we can just use it here, get, and then the object, and then the key, the dynamic key. Let's go ahead and surround this by a TD, and then remove the previous things. When we check, we can see that it's working just like before, but the date isn't formatted quite like we would want, so let's go ahead and fix that.
We have our format date helper, however, we only want to apply it to dates. Luckily, we have our display property, so we can use that. We can check to see what the display property is, and display based on that, and we go back and we see that our dates are much more readable while still not processing the author and title as dates.
A Hint of Awesome
So far in this episode, we've dried up some code and made it a little bit easier to read, but we haven't really done anything powerful yet. Now let me show you how to add a column. That's all you have to do. It's that easy to add columns, whereas before, we would have had to add several rather long lines. It also paves the way for the amazing things we're going to be doing in the next episode, so join us in this week's Pro episode as we learn how to toggle columns at will, and then save that information in the URL. I'll see you soon.
Genes involved in tasting sweet and savory flavors on the tongue also play a key role in properly working sperm, new research in animals finds.
These findings could lead to novel contraceptives for men, and suggest ways to help treat male infertility, the researchers said.
In this research, scientists investigated proteins known as taste receptors. These receptors help tongues detect sugars, acids, salt and other chemicals responsible for basic tastes such as sweet, sour, salty, bitter and the savory taste known as umami.
Oddly, in the past decade, research has shown taste receptors are also located in other parts of the body, including the stomach, intestines, pancreas, lungs and even the brain.
But the functions of these receptors found outside the mouth have remained unclear.
To help solve the mystery, researchers focused on receptors that help taste buds detect the sugars and amino acids responsible for sweet and savory tastes.
The scientists discovered that one of these taste receptors, called TAS1R3, and a molecule that helps the taste receptor send signals to the brain, called GNAT3, were both found in the testicles and sperm of mice.
The investigators genetically engineered mice to possess the human form of the TAS1R3 receptor (but were missing the mouse version of TAS1R3 and GNAT3). When these mice were given the drug clofibrate, which inhibits the human receptor, the males became sterile due to malformed and fewer sperm. The mice quickly became fertile again once clofibrate was removed from their diet.
The study shows that "taste proteins are very important in male reproduction. We really didn't expect that," researcher Bedrich Mosinger, a molecular biologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, told LiveScience.
"We didn't find similar effects with female reproduction," Mosinger said. "This looks specific to males."
The drug clofibrate that belongs to a class of chemicals called fibrates, which are frequently prescribed to treat lipid disorders, such as high blood cholesterol or high levels of triglycerides. Mosinger speculated the common use of fibrates in medicine could be contributing to the decline of male fertility, a growing problem worldwide. They added that weedkillers known as phenoxy-herbicides, which are widely used globally, also block the human TAS1R3 receptor,
"If our pharmacological findings are indeed related to the global increase in the incidence of male infertility, we now have knowledge to help us devise treatments to reduce or reverse the effects of fibrates and phenoxy compounds on sperm production and quality," Mosinger said.
This research could also help design a male non-hormonal contraceptive, Mosinger added. Such a contraceptive might not disrupt hormone levels vital to normal life.
"We now need to identify the pathways and mechanisms in testes that utilize these taste genes, so we can understand how their loss leads to infertility," said researcher Robert Margolskee, a molecular neurobiologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.
The scientists detailed their findings online today (July 1) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.

What is This?
For more background on CSS Image Effects, you can check out my blog series here, or watch my video from CSS Conf EU, which gives a baseline on blend modes and filters.
Simply put, CSSgram is a library for editing your images with Instagram-like filters directly in CSS. What we're doing here is adding filters to the images as well as applying color and/or gradient overlays via various blending techniques to mimic these effects. This means less manual image processing and more fun filter effects on the web!
We are using pseudo-elements (i.e. :before and :after ) to create the filter effects, so you must apply these filters on a containing element (i.e. not a content-block like <img> . The recommendation is to wrap your images in a <figure> tag. More about the tag here.

[/caption]Another asteroid is set to make a close approach of 79,000 km according to NASA, a distance twice that of geosynchronous orbit around the Earth. Although the 15-20 metre-wide rock is not expected to cause any problems to Earth or satellites, some observers may be lucky to spot the faint light from 2009 FH as it passes.
Interestingly, this new object comes only two weeks after a larger (50 metre wide) asteroid was spotted passing the Earth at a similar distance. So it begs the question, why are we seeing so many asteroids lately?
“This asteroid flyby will be a good viewing opportunity for both professional and amateur astronomers,” said Don Yeomans from the Near-Earth Object Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “The asteroid poses no risk of impact to Earth now or for the foreseeable future.”
NASA is always very quick to point out these objects are harmless, passing the Earth at a very safe distance, often beyond the Moon's orbit. However, 2009 FH will pass at a similar distance to the 50 metre-wide 2009 DD45 on March 2nd.
In this case, 2009 FH will pass through the constellation of Gemini, as bright as a 14th magnitude star. Unfortunately there appears to be some fuzziness as to the time of observing opportunity. SpaceWeather.com reports that the best time to observe the asteroid has already passed (after sunset on March 17th, over North America), however, the NASA JPL news release states that close approach occurs at 5:17 am PST Wednesday morning. There is little more information available. However, check the 2009 FH ephemerides for more information.
This discovery was made by NASA's Near Earth Object Observation Program, known as Spaceguard, to detect and track potentially hazardous asteroids that stray close to the Earth. It appears the Spaceguard team are getting better and better at spotting these chunks of rock. Although it might seem there are a lot more asteroids than before, this isn't the case, we're just getting better at finding them.

TAMPA — Here we go again. Men's Health magazine says residents of Tampa are the most vain in America, based on the rate at which they consume things like Botox, teeth whitener, at-home hair dyes, shapewear, plastic surgery, cosmetic dentistry and tanning salon sessions.
This is not necessarily new, according to the magazine: "Five hundred years before Botox, that Ponce de Leon guy scoured Florida for a fountain that could rinse off the wrinkles."
Rounding out the top 10, in order, were Plano, Texas, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Houston, Miami, San Francisco and Providence, R.I.
St. Petersburg ranked 11th and Orlando 16th.
Los Angeles, if you're curious, ranked 60th — behind insecure, looks-obsessed cities like Billings, Mont., and Manchester, N.H.
Des Moines, Iowa, won the distinction of being the least vain of the 100 cities ranked by the magazine.
The Tampa Bay area, of course, has been down this road before.
In May, Tampa was ranked eighth on a Men's Health list of the smuttiest cities, based on online pornographic film views, number of adult bookstores and nature of Internet searches.
In January, CNBC did a survey that concluded that Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater is the most stressful metro area, as calculated by divorce rates, commute times, unemployment, violent crime, property crime, suicides, alcohol consumption, mental health, sleep troubles and the annual number of cloudy days.
In December, LivingSocial, with the help of a third-party research firm, did an online survey leading it to rate Tampa-St. Petersburg as the worst-dressed region in the country.
For that, survey respondents judged their own cities.
And in November, Men's Health declared St. Petersburg to be America's saddest city (Tampa was in fourth place) after looking at rates of suicide and unemployment, as well as the percentage of households using antidepressants and the number of people who say they feel sad all or most of the time.
Physicists have described a never-before-seen form of light, produced by binding photons (or light particles) to individual electrons.
The find not only points to easier ways to build the quantum computers of the future, it also suggests that it's possible to combine the properties of both photons and electrons in a single 'Frankenstein' particle.
"The results of this research will have a huge impact on the way we conceive light," says one of the team, Vincenzo Giannini from Imperial College London in the UK.
It's not unusual for photons to get right up close with electrons - in normal materials, photons interact with a whole bunch of them both on the surface and within their molecular structure. But Giannini and their colleagues wanted to figure out what would happen if photons could bind with just one electron.
Using a recently discovered class of materials called topological insulators, they modelled the behaviour of light as it flashed across the surface. They found that not only could the photons interact with a single electron in this material, but the result would actually combine the properties of both.
Discovered back in 2007, topological insulators are a unique type of material that won't conduct an electric current through the bulk of their structure, but will carry one along the surface, as the really handy explainer video below describes.
The UK physicists modelled a single nanoparticle - a tiny sphere less than 0.00001 millimetres in diameter - made from a topological insulator. This allowed them to simulate what would happen if a flash of light beamed across the nanoparticle and collided with its single electron.
You can see what the model looked like in the image at the top of the page, which illustrates light trapped on the surface of a topological insulator nanoparticle.
What's especially cool about the fact that the resulting particle combines properties from both the photons and the electron is that this appeared to change how the particle would move across the surface of the material.
As Joseph Dussault explains for The Christian Science Monitor:
"Light normally travels in a straight line, but when bound to a single electron, it could follow the electron's path along a material surface. And, while electrons usually stop when they encounter a poor conductor, the addition of photons would allow the coupled particle to continue moving."
Being able to control the movement of photons could have a huge impact on the race to build the world's first viable quantum computer.
Quantum processors are made of qubits, which can be a '1', '0', or both at the same time - a state known as 'superposition'. The problem with observing superposition is that physicists have to work with supercooled molecules chilled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero, and this is expensive and difficult to set up.
But combined photon-electron could allow researchers to observe this behaviour on the visible scale and at room temperature, Giannini explained to Dussault. The catch? The team now has to take their theoretical model and demonstrate it for real in the lab, and they're recruited some experimental physicists to figure this out.
The results have been described in Nature Communications.
INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- The officiating in the Cleveland Cavaliers' 115-84 win over the Toronto Raptors in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals seemed to go in the Cavs' favor. Toronto was called for more fouls -- 25 to 20 -- and the Raptors' All-Star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan attempted zero free throws for the first time as teammates.
Cleveland's LeBron James, however, was left wondering what it would take for a referee to whistle a flagrant foul on an opponent for contact above their shoulders.
"I have no idea what it is," James said after practice Tuesday. "I know what it is when it happens to someone else, but I don't know when it involves me. I have no idea what a common foul and flagrant foul is."
There were at least three plays in question in Game 1 that James could have been referring to.
In the first half, James caught a Bismack Biyombo elbow to the back of the head while fighting for a rebound.

In the second half, DeMarre Carroll wrapped up James around the shoulder area while stopping them from scoring on a fast break. A common foul was called.
Later in the third quarter, James took another hit from Biyombo to the face, but it was James who was whistled for an offensive foul because the referees determined they made contact with DeRozan's face before Biyombo hit him.
Biyombo was also involved in a play in which they fouled an airborne Tristan Thompson while the Cavs forward was going up for a layup, causing Thompson to fall to the floor. It was determined to be a common foul against Biyombo.
"I thought Tristan's throwdown last night was a little excessive, but they went up there and made two free throws and that's all that matters," James said. "I've pretty much chalked it up to common fouls [being called] with me [getting hit]."
This is not a new story for the Cavs. The team also took issue with the blows being administered by the Detroit Pistons in the first round, causing coach Tyronn Lue to say James is officiated the way Shaquille O'Neal used to be: inconsistently and unfairly.
The only flagrant foul from Game 1 went against Kevin Love, when their elbow caught Patrick Patterson in the face on a sweep-through move and Patterson fell to the floor.
Lue theorized that James might not get as many calls because of the way they remain unfazed after contact.
"We talk about our guys playing aggressive, being physical, playing the right way, continue to attack," Lue said. "But we don't want to flop and flail all around. Nowadays to get a flagrant foul, you've got to fall down and grab your head and roll on the ground. LeBron being so strong, guys bounce off him. He's not going to hit the ground as hard as other guys do.
"A lot of times it's still a flagrant foul. If someone else gets hit, they fall on the ground, grabbing their head, taking 30, 40 seconds to get up. That just automatically triggers the referees to go to the scorer's table and review it and come up with a flagrant foul. So I don't know."
Thompson was asked whether they are ever tempted to sell the contact they absorb to get calls to go theirs way.
"I just keep playing," Thompson said. "Foul, no foul, whatever players do to draw fouls or help their team out, so be it. I'm with it. If it's in our favor, I love it. I just got to stay out of foul trouble."
Canada has some of the poorest high-speed internet service in the developed world and is an example of what not to do from a policy perspective, according to a study by Harvard University.
The 232-page study, commissioned by American regulators and released Wednesday evening, found that Canada rates poorly compared to peer countries when measures such as national broadband adoption, network capacity and prices are taken into account.
Canada was 22nd overall out of 30 countries surveyed by Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Canada ranked 16th on broadband adoption, 20th on speed and capacity, and 25th on price. Japan, Sweden and South Korea headed up Harvard's rankings, while the United States placed above Canada at 13th overall.
Canada "is often thought of as a very high performer, based on the most commonly used benchmark of penetration per 100 inhabitants," the study said. "Because our analysis includes important measures on which Canada has had weaker outcomes — prices, speeds and 3G mobile broadband penetration — in our analysis it shows up as quite a weak performer, overall."
The purpose of the study, which had funding from the Ford and MacArthur grant foundations, was to give the Federal Communications Commission — the U.S. version of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission — a basis on which to form a national next-generation broadband plan over the next few months.
The study recognized broadband as a key enabler of economic growth that can benefit services such as telemedicine in rural areas, allow better management of transportation and energy systems and reduce infrastructure costs for businesses.
Open-access rules successful
The researchers concluded that if the United States wants to be a world broadband leader, it needs to look to open-access policies implemented in Europe and Asia to spur competition among service providers. The U.S. and Canadian approach so far, relying on competition between cable and phone companies to develop better and cheaper services, is the wrong way to go, the report said.
"Early aggressive facilities-based competition certainly made Canada an early starter, but it does not seem to have enabled it to maintain its standing," the report said. "The Canadian experience suggest[s] that reliance purely on competition between strong cable incumbents and telephony incumbents may be insufficient to sustain high penetration or achieve high capacity and low competitive pricing in the long term."
YOUR VIEW Should the government get involved in Canada's broadband market, and if so, how so? Share your thoughts here.
Canada has taken a "half-hearted" approach to open access, which enables a new entrant company to lease lines from a network owner to provide its own internet services to customers. The CRTC implemented open-access rules in 1997, but the report said the commission messed them up by allowing network owners to charge the highest lease rates in the developed world, about 70 per cent higher than similar fees in South Korea and Denmark.
The rules also had a "sunset" clause, meaning that open access would be discontinued in 2002. The CRTC extended the rules indefinitely in 2001, after few companies took up the offer.
These high rates and "regulatory hesitance" likely contributed to fewer new competitors making investments, the study said. Other countries that have had strong rules have fared better. France, as one example, has very little cable-versus-phone-company competition, yet it ranks well in Harvard's survey — seventh overall — because of strong enforcement of open-access rules.
The report took issue with the CRTC's recent "self-congratulatory reference" to Canada's leadership of G7 nations in terms of broadband adoption. Adoption is only one measure of broadband leadership, and the report "locates almost all of the Canadian companies in the cluster with the slowest speeds and highest prices."
"The highest prices for the lowest speeds are overwhelmingly offered by firms in the United States and Canada, all of which inhabit markets structured around 'inter-modal' [cable versus phone] competition," the report said.
ISPs step up lobbying
The report comes at a critical time for Canada's largest internet service providers. The federal government is considering several appeals of CRTC decisions on open-access rules, both from incumbent network owners including Bell and Telus and from access seekers such as MTS Allstream and a group of smaller internet providers. Cabinet has until early December to decide whether it should take action on the rules.
The CRTC is also debating whether it should impose so-called "net neutrality" rules that would limit how much ISPs are allowed to manage their networks.
The big ISPs have stepped up their lobbying efforts recently as a result. A report last week funded by Bell, Rogers, Telus, Shaw and a number of others attacked the methodology used in other studies — especially one from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development — which also found Canada to be laggard. The ISP-funded study proclaimed Canada to be a world broadband leader in four key areas: availability, user adoption, speed and price.
Mark Goldberg, the telecommunications consultant who was one of the lead authors on the ISP-funded report, on Thursday criticized the Harvard study for using some of the same "flawed" numbers as the OECD.
"Preliminary examination seems to indicate that many of the Harvard rankings appear to incorporate the same problematic data points from reports and measurement tools that we have already discussed," they wrote on their blog.
The Harvard researchers acknowledged that international comparisons are a "hot button" issue, particularly as ISPs try to fend off government intervention in their markets. They said they used multiple studies and methodologies and found that none of the critiques of OECD numbers invalidated their accuracy.
"The debate occasionally resembles that of a horse race; indeed, a horse race in which those who have already placed their bets are arguing about how to decide which horse has won," the report said.
David Johnston, president of the University of Waterloo, said several recent reports have assessed Canada's broadband situation, and the country has been found wanting.
"The reality is our rates are considerably higher than most leading countries. We have not yet been able to make a field that's as competitive as somewhere as Singapore or Finland," they told CBCNews.ca. "The measurement of Canada's standing in world broadband and that declining trajectory is pretty clear from numerous studies. I really don't think there's much dispute that we don't occupy the same spot as we did 15 years ago."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Burton directed Alice in Wonderland in 2010
Hollywood director Tim Burton is set to switch on this year's Blackpool Illuminations, it has been revealed.
Burton has described themselves as "Blackpool Pleasure Beach's biggest fan" and used the seaside town for scenes in their latest film.
They achieved fame through directing blockbusters like Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Planet of the Apes and Alice in Wonderland.
The famous lights will be turned on following a concert on 4 September.
A host of stars will perform including The Vamps, Lawson and Professor Green.
'Major coup'
Burton, who was formerly married to actor Helena Bonham Carter, chose to shoot scenes in Blackpool for US band The Killers' video "Here with Me".
Their latest movie "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" has also brought them to the resort.
Image copyright AFP/Getty/BBC Image caption Many differing celebrities have switched on the Illuminations
Those who flicked the switch
Yacov Malik - Soviet Ambassador, 1955
Jayne Mansfield - Hollywood star, 1958
Red Rum - Grand National winner, 1973
Dr Who - Tom Baker, 1975
Kermit The Frog - Muppet, 1979
Peter Kay - Comedian and actor, 2014
Hollywood actor Samuel L Jackson, was one of the cast who featured in scenes filmed on the promenade and inside Blackpool Tower.
They announced their arrival in the town in May by posting a selfie on Instagram.
Councillor Gillian Campbell, deputy leader of the town's council, said: "Having one of the most famous film directors in the world turn on the Blackpool Illuminations is a major coup and shows the high regard the town is held in the hearts of our famous visitors.
"We know they are a huge fan of Blackpool and we are delighted that they have agreed to switch the Illuminations on for us on the biggest night of Blackpool's year.
"This is gearing up to be one of the best switch-on events we have ever had."
Liberals Digging Their Political Graves
Do liberals understand what they are doing? I don't think they do. I think that they are blinkered by their one-dimensional view of politics: it reduces to the struggle for social justice. In 2010 after the midterm the Obamis decided they had to punch back twice as hard against the moneyed interests that would be unleashed by Citizens United. In Seattle the activist left is planning another May Day march: “Capitalist police state... rape of civil liberties.” Oh yeah! Liberals do not think about the real meat of political philosophy, which is not to design a perfect political system with perfect justice, but to deal with the real problem: rulers and their appetite for power. Liberals worry instead about how to flush out the racists, sexists, and homophobes that are lurking in the woods waiting their chance to turn back the clock on glorious progressive achievements. Their concern is that the ruling class of liberals doesn't have enough power to do good.
Mark Steyn has a brilliant article in The Spectator in Australia in which they do a “reveal” on the liberal war on free speech in all its embarrassing nakedness, from the silly girl at Swarthmore who is bothered by “the whole idea that at a liberal arts college we need to be hearing a diversity of opinion” to the liberal luvvies in London calling for “the first state restraints on the British press in three and a quarter centuries.” As Dave Barry likes to say: I am not making this up. When you go down the list of liberal free speech outrages you think: what are these liberals thinking? Do they not realize that when you shut down the opposition you are just cuing up Les Mis, barricades in the streets, and: Do you hear the people sing?
Singing the song of angry men?
It is the music of the people
Who will not be slaves again! And the tune is pretty good too. Liberals are convinced that they represent a noble cause of the evolved and the educated called by History to right the wrongs of the wretched and the marginalized of the Earth. Angry men? They must be angry bitter-ender white racists and sexists. HuffPo is already worrying that the Bundy ranch activists want fresh opportunities to “exercise armed defiance.” The thing about today's ruling-class repression is that the ruling class better decide, before it gets in out of its depth, how far it's prepared to go. Jung Chang in Mao:The Untold Story gives us the bottom line on political repression. Back in the 1930s Mao and Zhou Enlai were just bandits running a Red Base in southwest China. They found they could govern without the consent of the governed. But they could only stay in power by using terror. [Mao and Zhou] relaxed the purges for a while in 1931, but found that when people ceased to fear killings and arrests “they started to band together to defy Communist orders. It rapidly became clear that the regime could not survive without constant killings[.]” That's why I don't think that our all-American liberals have really thought through their sophomoric ideas about striking a “balance between free speech in a democracy and protection against racial abuse in a multicultural society” and the use of the IRS to punish their enemies. One repression leads with iron logic to the next, and each injustice provokes its own head of rebellion. At some point, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), you and your fellow House Democrats may have to embarrass yourselves and walk back your partisan insouciance, and admit that your opponents were right about the IRS and True the Vote. Unless you have the cojones to go for the Full Lefty. I don't think any of our liberal friends have looked around that corner yet. Meanwhile there is hope – for Republicans. Suppose you were to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016 and you were cudgeling your brain figuring out how to light a fire under the 4 million voters that didn't get out to the polls to vote for Mitt Romney in 2012. An aide comes in with some PowerPoint slides describing an America where liberals had forbidden conservatives to organize, where the IRS and the Justice Department had conspired to harass and maybe even criminally prosecute ordinary American citizens because they didn't fill in their incomprehensible government forms properly. The last slide has the quote from the Democratic president who had airily declared one day in 2014 that there wasn't a “smidgen” of evidence of corruption at Lois Lerner's IRS. The GOP nominee would say: where do we send the thank-you note?

In support of President Obama's comprehensive efforts to combat climate change and develop low-carbon alternatives to traditional electricity sources, the Energy Department today announced $22.7 million for 23 projects that will significantly reduce the costs for solar energy systems across a variety of technologies. The new projects will promote the next generation of products, services, and manufacturing processes to help accelerate the deployment and reduce the cost of solar energy across the United States. These private-sector companies will also help to grow the number of jobs in the domestic solar industry and increase U.S. solar energy manufacturing capabilities. Additionally, this will further the SunShot Initiative's goal to make solar energy fully cost-competitive with traditional forms of energy by 2020.
“The solar energy industry has been one of the fastest growing industries in the United States for the past five years. Costs are falling, deployment is booming, and factories are opening. As of the second quarter of 2015, total solar installed capacity in the U.S. surpassed more than 22.7 gigawatts with approximately 785,000 solar projects operating across the country,” said Dr. David Danielson, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. “The new projects announced today show the Obama Administration's continuing commitment to help industry develop and manufacture new, efficient, and innovative technologies that will help maintain and grow our country's solar leadership.”
This Technology to Market funding program combines three historically separate SunShot Initiative funding programs—Incubator, Solar Manufacturing Technology (SolarMaT), and Scaling Up Nascent PV at Home (SUNPATH). The new, comprehensive funding program supports projects with the potential to significantly reduce the costs for solar energy systems and bring disruptive innovation to the solar industry. This effort is also part of the Department's Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative, aimed at boosting American competitiveness and supporting a strong domestic, clean energy manufacturing sector.
The tools, technologies, and services developed by these new projects aim to reduce the costs of technologies, including photovoltaics (PV); tracking systems; PV, load, and storage integration; grid monitoring; and power electronics—all while cutting soft costs related to customer acquisition, permitting, project siting, financing, interconnection, and inspection.
While these new projects get off the ground, the SunShot Initiative is now accepting applications for the second round of awardees under this Technology to Market funding program. Mandatory concept papers are due Wednesday, November 18. Find application details and related deadlines HERE.

Earlier this week at E3, Microsoft made the big announcement that Minecraft will support cross-play with the Nintendo Switch version of the game. While Microsoft is hopeful that Sony will get on board, it hasn't happened yet, and now a Sony executive has explained one reason why.
Speaking to Eurogamer, PlayStation executive Jim Ryan said, "It's certainly not a profound philosophical stance we have against this," adding that Sony is "always" interested in talking with companies about things like this.
So why is there no cross-play between PS4 and Xbox One yet? Ryan said, "Unfortunately, it's a commercial discussion between ourselves and other stakeholders, and I'm not going to get into the detail of that on this particular instance."
Ryan went on to suggest that Sony is concerned about what could go wrong when allowing its own players, some of which could be children, to connect to a network outside of its own.
"We've got to be mindful of our responsibility to our installation base. Minecraft--the demographic playing that, you know as well as I do, it's all ages but it's also very young," they said. "We have a contract with the people who go online with us, that we look after them and they are within the PlayStation curated universe. Exposing what in many cases are children to external influences we have no ability to manage or look after, it's something we have to think about very carefully."
You can read the full interview here at Eurogamer.
Microsoft's Dave McCarthy told GameSpot at E3 this week that the company has had discussions with Sony about cross-play, but Sony is "not quite there yet."
"My hope is that they join the party as well because I think it's an awesome thing to do for gamers," they said.
In March 2016, Microsoft publicly announced that it was open to connect Xbox Live to other gaming networks, including PlayStation Network and Nintendo's own online service. Sony later suggested it was open to this, but it has not happened yet, and it doesn't seem like it will soon.

Next weekend's Glastonbury festival is to combat the scourge of the plastic water bottle as part of a long-term strategy to become the world's most environmentally friendly outdoor musical event.
Festival organisers are targeting the disposable bottle – one of the most conspicuous symbols of the throwaway culture that each year leaves the 900-acre Somerset site wreathed in plastic, with an estimated one million plastic bottles being used during the festival.
Stainless-steel reusable bottles will be given to 2,000 road crew and band members, with thousands more on sale to festival-goers to stop them relying on plastic bottles. The 140,000 ticket-holders are also being urged to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinking water taps dotted across the site.
Lucy Smith, Glastonbury's green issues organiser, said: "We have amazing water quality in the UK but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water."
They said the initiative precedes a plan for Glastonbury 2015 to replace all plastic pint pots and cutlery with reusable items in an attempt to eradicate the legacy of plastic waste from the huge rural site.
Environmentalists estimate that 150 million tonnes of plastic waste currently litters the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.
Ultimately, festival organisers hope to make Glastonbury the world's greenest greenfield festival, emulating America's Burning Man festival in the Black Rock desert of Nevada, which is a "leave no trace" event where people have to take away all that they bring.
Glastonbury revellers are also being urged to travel to the site on public transport or try car-sharing with friends. "We want to be as sustainable as we can. We do everything we can, but coping with the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge. We can't put bins everywhere," added Smith.
Campaigners say that plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade with their manufacture exacerbating their negative ecological impact. Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions.
Overall, an estimated 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the UK every year, yet just one in five is said to be recycled.
Smith said that instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap which is being drawn from huge underground reservoirs, instead of old-fashioned water tanks that provided heavily chlorinated drinking water. Charity WaterAid will also set up water kiosks around the site, stocking reusable bottles and cups and offering free refills. Next year the kiosks – modelled on those found in Africa – will double as DJ booths at night.
Organisers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled last year and add that there will be 15,000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds this year.
Despite its growing eco-credentials, critics continue to snipe at Glastonbury, accusing it of becoming increasingly corporate in tone with the latest, Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, vowing never to bring their band to Glastonbury festival after dismissing it as "the most bourgeois thing on the planet".
Meanwhile, the latest weather updates for Glastonbury are positive with the festival due to be sunny and dry with experts ruling out a repeat of 1985, the festival's windiest year; 1997, its muddiest and 2005, known as the "year of thunder".
Award-winning public speaker, New York Times bestselling author and world-renowned health expert, Dr. Sarah Ballantyne, PhD (aka The Paleo Mom) believes the key to reversing the current epidemics of chronic disease is scientific literacy. They create educational resources to help people regain their health through diet and lifestyle choices informed by the most current evidenced-based scientific research.
Despite mainstream nutrition's continued promotion of grain-based foods as part of a healthy diet, the evidence against wheat continues to grow (and grow, and grow!). And, it's becoming increasingly clear that celiacs aren't the only ones who need to be cautious about eating this ubiquitous grain!
One of the latest strikes against wheat is its impact on the innate immune system. Several studies have found that wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors, or ATIs (proteins that help protect plants from getting eaten by pests, and which are entirely separate from gluten!) have the ability to stimulate an innate immune response by activating certain myeloid immune cells (including dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes). (As a reminder, the innate immune system is the body's nonspecific first line of defense against foreign invaders, in contrast to the adaptive immune system, which is more complex and involves immunological memory of specific antigens. The innate immune system is our first response to pathogens and is responsible for generalized inflammation whereas adaptive immunity takes longer to activate but attacks antigens with high specificity thanks to the coordinated actions of T cells and B cells.)
One study found that wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors (which make up as much as 4% of the total protein in wheat!) were able to bind to and activate the CD14-MD2 toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex on innate immune cells. TLR4 is a protein that's highly involved in inflammatory cytokine production, and its stimulation causes the innate immune system to kick into gear (explaining the link between wheat ATIs and immune activation). In contrast to gluten-containing grains, gluten-free grains had no (or only trivial) levels of ATI bioactivity. The researchers noted that, along with the role of ATIs as co-stimulatory molecules in celiac disease, ATIs also seem to promote other immune-mediated diseases, both within the GI tract and beyond—making them likely culprits in the pathology of non-celiac gluten sensitivity!

Don't miss this online educational summit from March 4-10, 2019. Save your seat for free!
The most recent study on wheat ATIs, published in Gastroenterology in April 2017, compared the effects of amylase trypsin inhibitors from 38 different foods that were either gluten-containing or gluten free, including both unprocessed foods (wheat, barley, rye, rice, lentils, amaranth, soy, etc.) and processed items (like pizza, bread, biscuits, and pasta). The researchers extracted the ATIs from each food, determined their biological activity in both mouse and human cell lines, and then studied what happened when those ATIs were fed to mice eating gluten-free diets, mice eating ATI-free diets, or mice with induced colitis.
Th e findings? For starters, gluten-containing grains had ATI levels that were as much as 100-fold higher than gluten-free foods! And, the researchers found that processing and baking gluten-containing foods wasn't enough to reduce the bioactivity of their ATIs (in other words, even after cooking wheat to smithereens, it was still a potent activator of innate immunity). Not only that, but the worst offender of all was specifically modern wheat (bred to be hexaploid, or containing six sets of chromosomes), which had much higher ATI bioactivity than ancient wheat varieties like Emmer and Einkorn. (This could help explain why wheat has become such a problem food in recent times, whereas early wheat-eating cultures—who were consuming types of wheat that were much different than what fills our modern grocery stores—didn't seem to have the same epidemic of wheat-related health problems industrialized nations face today.)
On top of confirming that modern wheat is unusually high in ATIs, this study showed that consumption of those ATIs induced intestinal immune cell infiltration and activation, as well as the release of inflammatory mediators (this mostly took place in the colon, followed by the ileum, followed by the duodenum). Basically, ATIs from gluten-containing grains (most importantly, at levels found in a normal gluten-containing diet!) were able to resist intestinal proteases (our digestive enzymes), acid and heat and trigger low-level intestinal inflammation.
Why is this important? We now have a clear mechanism for how wheat can trigger health problems in people without celiac disease! We certainly have a detailed understanding of how gluten peptides (or more specifically, gliadin peptides, partially-digested fragments of a protein fraction of gluten) can increase intestinal permeability (leaky gut) and stimulate inflammation and adaptive immune responses in celiac patients, and there's evidence that anyone with celiac risk genes (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, see Genes to Know About: Celiac Genes) may suffer similar effects from gluten consumption (in particular, excess zonulin secretion opens up the tight junctions between gut epithelial cells, see What Is A Leaky Gut? (And How Can It Cause So Many Health Issues?)). But, mainstream nutritionists have often dismissed the idea of gluten sensitivity or gluten-related disorders among non-celiacs, and the wheat and grain industries have been pushing back hard as gluten-free, grain-free, low-carbohydrate, and Paleo diets continue to gain popularity (articles have even circulated claiming that gluten-free diets are nutritionally insufficient and dangerous! They're not! See Gluten-Free Diets Can Be Healthy for Kids). The conflicting information can make it hard to know what to believe, especially when our own personal experiences identify gluten as a symptom trigger for a wide range of conditions, from irritable bowel syndrome to autoimmune disease. Studies like these help us prune through the confusion and identify what, exactly, goes on in our bodies when we consume some of the most common foods in the American diet.
Will everyone in the world respond negatively to wheat? Wheat is not a nutritious food (vegetables and fruit have far, far more vitamins, minerals, and phythochemicals, plus just as much fiber, all for lower glycemic load and calories) but we can't definitely claim that wheat is bad for every one. However, the number of people who should steer clear from wheat and other gluten-containing grains is probably much higher than the 1 in 100 people with true celiac disease (see Gluten Cross-Reactivity: How your body can still think you're eating gluten even after giving it up.). And, as more research continues to pour in, our understanding of the impact of wheat on human health will only become clearer.

Scientist and TV presenter Heinz Wolff has died aged 89.
The renowned professor, famed for hosting BBC Two's science show The Great Egg Race, died from heart failure on 15 December, their family have stated.
German-born Wolff presented the show from 1977 to 1986, and was a former adviser to the European Space Agency (ESA).

Colleague and close friend Prof Ian Sutherland said: ‘Heinz was a most inventive and inspirational leader. There was nothing they loved more than having a team of people around them devising completely new ways of doing things.'
Wolff moved to the UK from Berlin at the age of 11 on the day World War Two broke out in September 1939.
They attended school in Oxford and worked in haematology at the city's Radcliffe Infirmary, where they invented a machine for counting patients' blood cells.

In their TV work, they became instantly synonymous with their trademark bow tie and eccentric hairstyle.
Professor Julia Buckingham, vice chancellor and president of Brunel University, said: ‘Heinz's remarkable intellect, ideas and enthusiasm combined to make them the sparkling scientist we will so fondly remember.
‘He was a wonderful friend and supporter to staff and to students – and an inspiration to all of us.'

Party brings in private member's bill to tackle an environmental exemption it dismisses as a 'cynical PR exercise'
The Greens have launched the latest attempt to stop the trapping and killing of sharks in Western Australia, putting forward a private member's bill that would halt the cull program.
The Senate bill would alter the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act so the government could not offer an exemption for the purposes of using drumlines to catch sharks.
Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, allowed the WA government to kill sharks, including the protected great white, as part of its attempt to prevent attacks on swimmers and surfers.
Hunt exempted the action from assessment under provisions which allow the federal government to wave through activities that deal with matters of national security or emergencies.
The Greens said section 158 of the act should change so this could not happen in the future. The amendment would also be retrospective, meaning the WA drumlines would be removed while an environmental assessment is made.
Rachel Siewert, the Greens' marine spokesperson, told Guardian Australia Hunt's exemption was “extraordinary” and should never have been made.
“This provision was meant for emergency situations, meaning a program with a significant impact on the marine environment wasn't assessed,” they said.
“This shark cull was a cynical PR exercise that completely misread the sentiment of people in WA. There is overwhelming support in WA to end the cull because people see the nonsense of it.”
Siewert said it was a “no-brainer” for Labor to support the bill to put pressure on the government, given its criticism of Hunt for granting WA an environmental exemption.
But Louise Pratt, Labor's senator for WA, told Guardian Australia the Greens bill was a “stunt”.
“We haven't seen the legislation yet, so we can't say one way or the other whether we'll support it,” they said. “I would point out that it is bound to fail in any case because clearly there aren't the numbers in the House of Representatives.
“Mark Butler, the shadow minister, has said they would've done things differently to Greg Hunt, who abused the EPBC act. So the only way we can protect sharks in the long term is to have a government with good environmental values. The Greens have limited value in providing this.”
The WA shark cull began in January, following seven shark attack deaths in the previous three years. More than 70 baited hooks, attached to drumlines, have been strung up 1km from popular Perth and south-west WA beaches.
If caught, great white, tiger and bull sharks more than three metres in length will be shot by contractors in patrol boats, while other sharks will be set free if still alive.
A court challenge to the cull, brought by Sea Shepherd, was recently thrown out, and the state's Environmental Protection Authority declined to assess the program despite 23,000 submissions urging it to do so.
The WA government has said the cull is necessary to protect beachgoers but critics have said it is cruel and counter-productive because it draws sharks closer to the beach to eat the bait.
Image caption No one was hurt during the Yellow Duckmarine sinking on Saturday
An amphibious tourist vehicle sank in the Albert Dock, Liverpool, while on a tour of the city.
The Yellow Duckmarine started to sink at about 12:45 GMT on Saturday.
Passengers were moved on to a pontoon in accordance with safety procedures, said a tour spokesperson. The vehicle then sank fully as it was being towed away.
The vehicles are a popular tourist attraction and take in city sights from land and water. They are staying on land during investigations.
An internal inquiry into the cause of the sinking is under way.
Diamond Jubilee
Paul Furlong, product sales manager for the Yellow Duckmarine, said the "unfortunate" incident happened towards the end of a tour.
They said: "We are looking into what happened.
"Our crew are very experienced and acted quickly and correctly. No one was injured and everyone was disembarked safely."
Nobody went into the water during the sinking and the passengers were later refunded.
Tours on land took place on Sunday using other Duckmarines.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had a trip on a Yellow Duckmarine in May as part of the Diamond Jubilee tour.
Jersey City's Casa Dante restaurant has been padlocked by the courts and its metal roll-down door was shut and its parking lot gates were locked tonight.
“These premises have been padlocked March 4, 2014 by order of a warrant issued out of the Superior Court—Special Civil Part,” reads a notice taped to the front door of the restaurant on Newark Avenue just east of Kennedy Boulevard.
The notice on the door of the popular Italian restaurant goes on to say “It is unlawful to enter or deface these premises under penalty of arrest.”
On the New Jersey Department of the Treasury Division of Taxation website there are two notices for the public auction of seized property related to Dante Edibles, doing business as Casa Dante at 733-737 Newark Ave.
Both say “the property to be sold was seized for unpaid state taxes” but both also list the date and time of the sale as “CANCELLED” in red letters. The notices list the property for sale as a “Plenary Retail Consumption License,” which is a liquor license.
It could not be determined tonight if the restaurant's court-ordered padlocking is related to tax issues.
Orthodox Christian icons are everywhere to be found in Georgia - gazing over the shoulders of butchers cutting meat, peeking among stacks of cards in notary bureaus, dangling over the windscreen on public buses and marshutkas, and a cross sway from the mirror in most cars across the country. Religious images are ubiquitous attributes of public spaces and lay bare the Georgian society's entrenched religious belief.
Georgia embraced Christianity as a state religion between around 327 AD and it has since then been the pillar of the country's character. As the country was engulfed into the Soviet project in 1921, religious institutions were undermined, many of their representatives were executed, and the authority of those who survived dissolved - in 1917 there were 2,455 working churches, by mid-1980 a mere 80 remained, plus a handful of monasteries and seminaries. When Georgia became an independent state at the meltdown of USSR in the early 1990s, religious feelings re-emerged, stronger than ever, and the Church played a key role in shaping the re-gained national identity - you are Georgian, hence you are Orthodox Christian. Today, 89 percent of Georgia's 3.7 million people define themselves as Orthodox Christians.
This affirmation spilled over the severe high walls of chapels and monasteries, inundating public spaces which have become places to communicate who Georgians are and stand for. Here, creed takes up different forms as religious icons mingle with religion's arch-enemies like former USSR's head Joseph Stalin, themselves a Georgian trainee priest till they met with Karl Marx's theories, and modern-day secular cult, footballers.

After months of delays, SpaceX‘s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off today carrying cargo bound for the International Space Station.
The Dragon capsule inside the rocket, which will complete the final leg of the journey to the ISS, contains an array of important science experiments, including NASA's OPALS project, which will test using a laser to transfer data between the space station and Earth. SpaceX will also deliver parts to repair a broken backup computer that is involved in the ISS's robotics system.

Late pop star Michael Jackson had a fairly close relationship with Sega, lending their image to Space Channel 5 and Michael Jackson's Moonwalker. Jackson was also rumored to have contributed to Sonic the Hedgehog 3, a rumor now confirmed.
According to an interview in the French magazine Black & White—the "official magazine of Michael Jackson"—Jackson's composer and musical director Brad Buxer says Michael was responsible for some Sonic 3's compositions. The themes that appear in Sonic 3 and some of Jackson's own songs are not a coincidence.
As for Sega and Sonic the Hedgehog lead Yuji Naka's caginess about confirming Jackson's involvement? This may be your answer.
"And if they are not credited for composing the music, it's because they were not happy with the result sound coming out of the console," Buxer said. "At the time, game consoles did not allow an optimal sound reproduction, and Michael found it frustrating. They did not want to be associated with a product that devalued their music..."

That translation of the interview comes from a poster on the VGMdb forums, who we'll credit for helping to finally(?) put an end to this mystery.
Update: Ken Horowitz from Sega-16.com—whose exhaustive research on claims that Jackson contributed to Sonic 3 can be (and should be) read here—disputes that Buxer's statements about Michael Jackson's musical efforts in the Genesis game do not yet constitute proof of anything. Horowitz also contends that Buxer's claim contradicts statements of some Sega employees.
In other words, our long national nightmare of not knowing whether or not Michael Jackson worked on Sonic 3 without a shadow of a doubt is not yet behind us.

I recently posted a video news story (see here) about a slightly built man with Down's Syndrome who had their colostomy bag ripped from their body (and suffered a beat-down by police) because they believed the bulge that was their colostomy bag contained “illegal drugs.” A couple weeks ago, a man in New Mexico was subjected to multiple forced anal probes, enemas and a colonoscopy (see here) because cops believed they were harboring “illegal drugs” in their clenched butt cheeks.
Such atrocities could perhaps be dismissed if they were aberrations – the actions of isolated, crazed cops in some cracker backwater. But they are terrifying because they're becoming routine – because crazed – and unrestrained – policing is now the norm.
The origins of the American Police State can be traced back not to Nahhnnnlevvven – which merely threw gasoline on an already burning fire – but to the odious “drug war.”
The war on some drugs is actually a war on reason as well as ethics – with the inevitable casualties being human beings, not the “drugs” allegedly being warred upon.
It is based on the twisted notion that some people (government people, whether they are politicians or bureaucrats or their paid enforcers) are entitled to arbitrarily decree that some “drugs” (but not others, the ones they happen to approve of) are – presto! – “illegal” and that mere possession/use/sale/manufacturer (all peaceful activities as such that entail no victim, hence no crime) is sufficient warrant to eviscerate not merely the Bill of Rights but human rights. This demented crusade justifies random rousting of anyone, at almost any time, anywhere, if a cop (or a got-damned dog) believes that person might have the arbitrarily illegal item in their possession.
The other day I was reading about a despicable but all-too-predictable case here in my area. A dirt poor dude who lived in a run-down single wide (until the SWAT team “took them down”) was sent to prison for two years – no parole. Their “crime”? Manufacturing meth. That is, they had an old 2 liter soda bottle and some cold pills he'd tried to transmute into the proscribed substance.
The judge lectured the poor hillbilly about the “harm they have caused the community” – though as usual, no evidence was presented that the hillbilly had harmed anyone (except perhaps themselves – which ought to be their business and can only be regarded as a “crime” by a society that believes people own other people).
But let's say the prosecutor had found a person who was hurt in a car accident caused by one of the hillbilly's customers. This is more or less what the judge meant by their use of the blanket indictment, “harm to the community.”
Let's try to parse this logic. What if the winery down the road sells a case of its “drug” to someone, and that person subsequently gets loaded and then plows their car into a van full of children, killing them all? Should a SWAT team be sent to the winery? Will the winemaker be arrested and caged and sent to prison for two years on account of what someone else did with the “drugs” they merely manufactured and sold?
No?
Why not?
It requires a blank-out – the suspension of one's critical thinking capacity – to take the position that, on the one hand, the meth-maker is a dirty drug pusher who is responsible for the negligent or criminal actions of their customers . . . but the winemaker is a respectable member of the community and not responsible for the negligent or criminal actions of their customers.
Of course, neither of them “pushed” anything.
They each made an intoxicating substance and offered it for sale. Neither forced anyone to purchase nor consume the intoxicants. People freely chose to do so. And their subsequent actions – their free will choices – are not the responsibility of the persons who made the intoxicants any more than GM is responsible for what I do with the 200 MPH-capable Corvette they sent me to review.
The fact that some people commit an irresponsible or even criminal act after using “drugs” does not mean everyone who uses “drugs” – of whatever type – is guilty of or even likely to commit criminal acts. The proposition is absurd. And the idea that everyone who uses or makes or sells “drugs” is – ipso facto – criminal and ought to be treated as such, vicious and downright stupid, too.
If it is not vicious or stupid or absurd then – to be logically consistent – alcohol Prohibition must be re-enacted immediately. If the meth maker is a criminal merely because some of the people who buy their product may cause harm to others after partaking of their product, then the government-run ABC store that sold a half gallon of 190 proof grain alcohol to the college kid who later took a dive off the third floor of a building to their death below is also a criminal enterprise and all involved ought to be rounded up and severely punished.
The half-brained uplifters and moral temporizers – the Clovers who rule us – cannot fathom such obviousness. Cannot grasp the sameness – and therefore, the arbitrariness and unfairness eludes them.
They demand group-guilt, not individual accountability.
Their petty prejudices drive them. The “good Christian people” in my area enjoy their whiskey, their wine and beer. So those “drugs” – and alcohol is a drug (a potent one) as much as THC as much as Meth, as much as any other intoxicating substance – are socially acceptable. And so, legal. And thus, it would never occur to these holy rolling hypocrites to sic the cops on the beer truck outside the country store – notwithstanding that the local alcoholic wife beater is awaiting the next delivery.
Nor send the SWAT team to kick in the door of the wine-maker at 2 in the morning and cart them off to prison for the “crime” of making an intoxicant.
Only the pariah “drugs” are “illegal,” the object of no-holds-barred prosecution and punishment.
Clovers are psychopaths. Not only are they unable or unwilling to think. They have contempt for it. Their personal, subjective feelings are what matters. They don't like this drug – but that drug (their drug) is ok.
This is why we have forced anal probing – and thugs in costumes ripping the colostomy bags from the side of mentally handicapped people. Because of the unwritten coda that people who partake of socially unacceptable, arbitrarily illegal “drugs” are an open-season class of subhumanity.
The new Jews, if you like.
But just as the “good Germans” who didn't sweat the fate of the Jews ended up learning the hard way, once you permit the arbitrary abuse of any individual – let alone a class of people – it is almost inevitable that all people will end up being arbitrarily abused.The fact that you didn't do anything doesn't matter.
Think about that next time you see those blue and red lights flashing in the rearview. And reflect on what may be about to happen to you.

Addressing Titania's Majesty
Dan Clark wanted to take a moment to address some concerns.
Hi HEXers, Dan Clark of the Development team here and we wanted to address the community about some concerns of Titania's Majesty.
The launch of Armies of Myth has been a very smooth one and we've been able to address major bugs. Although one card has stood out as being somewhat problematic, and that card is Titania's Majesty. When we made the card, we knew that we wanted to watch the card once it was released to see what impact it was having on the player experience and the evolving format of constructed HEX. The intention was to create a card that would promote a new deck that deck would become a powerful contender, then other decks would rise to quell the numbers and keep it in check. Unfortunately, Majesty's presence has been slightly bigger than we expected and the combination of cards in this deck is leading to a frustrating experience in how it plays. After reviewing the data and talking it over internally we've been able to finally make a decision. Therefore, we will be adding Titania's Majesty to the constructed PvP banlist.
Why are we doing this?
This is important to get into so we can express why we are banning this card. Frequently we hear “this is too powerful please ban card x” but power level does not necessarily warrant a banning. Although Titania's Majesty is powerful, the real concern that R&D has with this card is how it feels to play with, and against it. This card is frustrating because it does not promote interactivity in the game in order to win. When Majesty successfully hits an Ozawa, Cosmic Elder or a Walking Calamity, most often there is no gameplay after that. The opposing player has very few options once Majesty resolves and successfully hits, which is the opposite of the back and forth feeling we hope to achieve for the best gameplay experience.
In order to successfully fight against this deck, a player would have to focus their deck just to beat it, but since Majesty is more about “play this card and that is all you have to do to end the game”, and one of the best ways to fight against it is to just flat out stop them from playing Majesty, which ends up promoting decks that are also somewhat “unfun” to interact with. Either attempting to pick apart the opponents hand with cards like Inquisition or using cards like Countermagic to cancel the card they are playing. Both of these tools can lead to a bad expirence on the receiving end.
Circling back to the player playing the deck, there is one more part that leads to a frustrating experience. Since the deck is geared to just playing Majesty for the most part. When Majesty does not happen in the game or you play it and it just misses, even the player who is playing the deck ends up having a worse experience as well. Which begs the question, “Who is having fun with this card?”
How did this happen?
There are a lot of factors that go into designing cards and card sets, but I want to shed some light on some of the bigger factors for Majesty. As a digital TCG, we want to push the boundaries for what traditional TCG's can do. Socketing is a prime example of innovation in the digital space that players can utilize at the start of HEX. Being able to customize a card as you choose is certainly a sweet experience for players but can be particularly rough on development to make sure that all of the cards possibilities are still within the aimed power level of the card. With Armies of Myth, we wanted to add a new twist to socketing, cards that socket previously unsocketable cards. This greatly expands the creativity with sockets while being a developer's nightmare. For context, developers test the game to ensure that the game is fun and the power level of cards are balanced and in the right place. For socketing cards we have to look at the card and make sure it lands correctly with every possible socket it can have, when any troop can have a socket, it becomes very difficult to perceive all potential outcomes.
What does this mean for you?
Titania's Majesty will be banned from play inside of constructed PvP tournaments effective immediately. We feel as though this is the correct decision for the health of the game. With this card leaving the format should be refreshed with new innovation to discover now that Majesty is gone. Banning a card is never something that we want to do but we believe that players will find the new format without this card more enjoyable.
We always have our finger on the pulse of the community, looking for feedback to implement and improve the experience and enjoyment of HEX. We appreciate the response from players to let us know their thoughts on this.

On their radio show today, Glenn Beck came up with a solution to the Gulf oil spill. They think that Sarah Palin should use their oil industry expertise hold an oil spill summit where they and their team would come up with ideas fix the leak. Beck said that Palin has, “the connections and the knowledge to put a team together and say Mr. President, this is what we do.”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters:
Beck said, “If I were Sarah Palin, and I'm not…I would be down in the Gulf and I would be meeting with the heads of Shell and the heads of Exxon. I would be meeting with all of them, and I would be meeting with all of the engineers. I would be having my own summit down there, and I would develop policy, and say this is what we need to do. Sarah has the weight behind them They understand the oil industry. They can get these people together, and they can get the engineers together, because their husband is an oil rigger. They have the connections and the knowledge to put a team together and say Mr. President, this is what we do.”
Beck's claim is based on the myth that Sarah Palin is a well connected oil expert, but as they have proven time and time again, they know nothing about the oil industry. Recently, when they were on Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O'Reilly asked them for a solution, and they said we should call the Dutch, because they are good at fixing leaks. In the same interview they stressed them believe that oil drilled for in the US could be outsourced. Palin's oil expertise also led them to tell Gulf residents to pray for a solution.
Sarah Palin has two areas of expertise as it relates to the oil industry. The first is the ability to impose socialistic taxes, like their windfall tax when they were governor, in order to redistribute wealth, and send the oil companies fleeing out of Alaska. The second area is their uncanny ability to take the oil industry's money.
Speaking of Todd Palin, they were so much more than a rigger for BP. Released emails reveal that while an employee of BP, they are, “involved in a judicial appointment, monitored contract negotiations with public employee unions, received background checks on a corporate CEO, added their approval or disapproval to state board appointments and passed financial information marked “confidential” from their oil company employer to a state attorney.”
It would appear that from the information released, Todd Palin was eyeballs deep in a conflict of interest, “The 243 still-secret e-mails between Todd Palin and senior officials reach into countless areas of state government and politics: potential board appointees, constituent complaints, use of the state jet, oil and gas production, marine regulation, gas pipeline bids, postsecondary education, wildfires, native Alaskan issues, the state effort to save the Matanuska Maid dairy, budget planning, potential budget vetoes, oil shale leasing…”
Why is that Hillary Clinton was criticized in 2008 when they claimed that they had executive branch experience because they were First Lady, but Sarah Palin gets called an oil expert by the Right because their husband worked for BP? To answer Beck's question, Sarah Palin won't hold an oil spill summit, because they have no expertise or solutions to offer. Them expertise is a political myth that was designed by the McCain campaign to sell Palin as their running mate in 2008. Outside of their media fame Palin has no real power, because former half term governors don't have the sway needed in order to operate as a shadow president, as Beck suggests. Most importantly, unless the oil summit was going to pay them to show up, Sarah Palin will have no interest, as they have shown time again that their true and sole motivation is the almighty dollar.

One of the biggest ways that Google makes its money outside of its main search product is through investments. Their recently renamed investment arm, now known as CapitalG, recently revamped their home page to match their new name. The page features a number of different pages with all sorts of information about Google's investing operations, readable by any who wish to peruse it. One part of the new page is the logos of a few of the companies that they've invested in, without much other information in most cases. In the past, Google hid their investments quite well, with the public only finding out when either Google or the recipient decides to share the news. One of the logos on that page of companies, interestingly, is that of Snapchat, who also went through a recent name change to Snap Inc.
Back in September, Snap Inc. managed to raise their value to about $20 billion, fresh off of a round of funding that brought them around $1.8 billion in total. CapitalG has not said whether they put in part of that prize pot, and Snap Inc. is quiet on the matter as well. Still, it's quite likely that the search giant had a hand in the new-style social media entity's most recent growth spurt, since the two companies have a pretty decent relationship and the Snapchat logo now has prominent placement on the portfolio page for CapitalG.
Snapchat is one of Google Cloud Platform's best customers, and rumors swirl that Google tried to buy Snapchat up once. On top of all that, Snapchat is quickly becoming a prominent platform for AI-based chat bots, while Google recently purchased API.AI, who recently announced changes that allow just about anybody to create and spread a bot, with Snapchat as one of the supported platforms. Naturally, these bots will be able to harness the growing power of Google Assistant. While the bot angle could only be a small part of the reason for Google sending a bit of scratch Snap Inc.'s way, the possibility of Google Assistant integration with Snapchat in the very near future is certainly there, as well as more traditional reasons for the investment; after all, it's not too far fetched to think that Google simply has a ton of faith in Snapchat, or wants to keep them from turning into a rival like Facebook did.

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- Three toddlers are in the hospital in critical condition after being rescued from a fire in Southwest Fresno. They were inside an apartment on Church near Fig just before noon Sunday, when firefighters saved them. The children are just 1, 2, and 3 years old.
Dozens of firefighters came to the rescue at a small fire at a Southwest Fresno apartment. Smoke is all they could see when they arrived to the Westgate Garden Apartments. But amid the charred furniture were three small children trapped inside.
"The first words stated to the captain on scene was there's still children inside, and so that captain took them and their crew and they went straight into rescue mode," said Pete Martinez with the Fresno Fire Department.
Two apartments were damaged by the flames that investigators believe started in the living room of one of the units. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but hours later, crime scene tape and investigators still surrounded the scene.
"A lot of the firefighters have small children, so it was a pretty significant call for us as far as having that many children involved," said Martinez.
The parents of the toddlers were inside the home at the time of the fire, but it's unclear if they were with the children. Fresno police have interviewed the mother and say the investigation is ongoing.

Geneva: The founder of WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowers' website, said on Friday they may apply for asylum in Switzerland, claiming they and their group have come under increasing pressure since releasing hundreds of thousands of secret US military documents.
Julian Assange told reporters they were "still looking into the process" of requesting asylum, but was considering the Alpine country because "the Swiss have a history of fierce independence."
In October, Sweden denied Assange's application for a residence permit. The 39-year-old Australian had sought to establish a base for WikiLeaks in Sweden to take advantage of its laws protecting whistle-blowers.
Prosecutors in the Scandinavian country are still investigating rape and sexual molestation allegations against Assange by two Swedish women. Assange has denied the allegations.
Assange was speaking Friday at the United Nations in Geneva after a meeting organized by the Iranian Elite Research Center, a U.N.-accredited group based in Tehran.
They have urged U.S. authorities to probe possible rights abuses by American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq following the publication by their group of almost 500,000 secret U.S. documents about the wars there.
U.S. State Department legal adviser Harold Koh dismissed the call Friday, saying information in the leaked files was already known to U.S. authorities and hundreds of investigations into suspected abuses in Afghanistan and Iraq had taken place.
Assange, a veteran computer hacker, established WikiLeaks in 2006 and it has obtained secret documents, stored them outside the reach of governments, then released them globally.
That has included 391,832 secret documents on the Iraqi war and some 77,000 classified Pentagon documents on the Afghan conflict.
Assange has since been denounced by governments, and some of their own colleagues, for releasing Afghan documents that contained the names of Afghan intelligence sources for Nato forces, thereby theoretically placing the sources' lives at risk.
US officials have said they are weighing Assange's actions under the 1917 Espionage Act and demanded that they return all government documents that they have and publish no new ones.

Your Epic Texas Journey
The great imperial struggles of the 1800s were over control of strategic or otherwise prized resources, and the hostilities they generated helped stoke World Wars I and II. Many believe the Iraq war was all about oil.
China is considering adopting a contemporary variant of the colonial model. A Ministry of Agriculture proposal suggests that rather than conquer territory to secure needed farmland, it could simply buy it up. But this path proves likes to engender resistance from the locals in countries with conquered occupied investee sites. This might work if done quietly, with local players acting as fronts. But this program will have to be very large scale to achieve its desired aims, which is improving food security, which makes keeping a low profile well nigh impossible.
And does China really think it can export food from large tracts of land abroad if the natives are hungry? There are major risks, such as governments asserting eminent domain to repatriate property and sabotage of transport.
China is concentrating its efforts on Africa and South America. In many areas, the control of the central government is weak. Will China wind up employing local mercenaries to secure its interests? It will be interesting to watch this initiative play out.
From the Financial Times:
SOME of the world's biggest stars will be coming to Scotland to shoot the new £400million Avengers blockbuster, Infinity War.
The movie will be filmed in a range of locations across Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Highlands, which will boost the economy by around £10million.
Filming is due to begin at the end of February and will bring stars such as Robert Downey Jr, Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johansson to Scotland.
Brad Pitt's zombie movie World War Z took in over £3million for the economy in 17 days while filming in Glasgow in 2011.
However, Infinity War is likely to bring in a much bigger boost as filming is expected to take around six months.
Glasgow City Council declined to comment on the Marvel film however praised Glasgow's relationship with the film industry.
A spokesperson told the Sunday Mail: “Glasgow has a proud track record of helping deliver big-budget projects, and we are always keen to speak to people who want to come.”
The third Avengers superheroes movie is set to be a smash after the previous two films took in a combined £3billion at the box office.
The comic book crossover film will show superheroes such as Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk battling on screen.
Infinity War is the first of two new Avengers blockbusters in the pipeline.
I'm not a fan of shock journalism or Laura Loomer in general. But credit where it's due; Loomer showed guts asking the First Lady of Organized Crime the big questions face-to-face.
All Ms. Loomer got for their troubles, though, was Hillary's trademark witch's cackle, a dismissive “I'm so sorry you believe things that aren't true”, and an escort out of the building.
If the mainstream press would do its job properly, we wouldn't need “look-at-me”, gonzo e-celebs to ask Mrs. Clinton the questions we all want answered.
However, there was absolutely zero chance that a professional sociopath like Clinton would answer with anything other than pat answers to such an unoriginal ambush. At least the “Prison Time, Coming Soon” guy clearly unnerved Nancy Pelosi.
Still, it was good for a chuckle, if nothing else.
“Well it's great for you to be here.”
Phew, if that doesn't say it all about both this woman's ego and aloofness.
Early in the exchange I got a message from my secret canta, that I would recieve not one, but two gifts. This week they arrived and I couldn't be happier. The first gift was a case for my knitting needles. I thought about getting one for quite a while, but couldt't decide which one I would like. My Santa absoloutly nailed it! It is perfect. I love the fabric and the colour and everything about it! But thats not all. Two days later the second package arrived and the gift was even more amazing! It's a personalised apron! I love baking! In the christmas time you can barely find me anywhere else than the kitchen making cookies. This is perfect. I'm planning to make cookies with my students next week, so this came just in time. I think they will love it, too. Thank you Santa! I couldn't have asked for better gifts! You are a truely great gifter :) Hope you have a wonderful christmas!
We wanted to share some exciting news out of Harvard!
Harvard Students Vote to Support Fossil Fuel Divestment
First School in Nation to Pass Student Fossil Fuel Divestment Referendum
Cambridge, MA—Last Friday night, the Harvard College Undergraduate Council announced that the student body had voted 72% in favor of Harvard University divesting its $30.7 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
Members of the Harvard chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future have been campaigning since September to divest Harvard's endowment from the top 200 publicly-traded fossil fuel corporations that own the majority of the world's oil, coal, and gas reserves.
Chloe Maxmin, a co-coordinator for Divest Harvard, said that the election results show unprecedented student voice around divestment: “In 1990, 52% of voting students supported complete divestment from apartheid South Africa. Today 72% of voting students are raising their voices for fossil divestment, telling Harvard to stop investing in companies that are threatening our future.”
Divest Harvard was the first student group in six years to successfully qualify a referendum question for Harvard student government elections, gaining hundreds of signatures beyond the 670 (10% of the undergraduate student body) necessary for qualification. The passage of the referendum makes fossil fuel divestment the official position of the Harvard College Undergraduate Council.
The Divest Harvard campaign, supported by Better Future Project and 350.org, is part of a quickly-growing fossil fuel divestment movement that has spread to over 50 universities and colleges across the country. Inspired by the 1980s divestment movement the helped end apartheid in South Africa, the groups hope that fossil fuel divestment will help solve the climate crisis by stigmatizing the fossil fuel industry and supporting a clean energy future.
350.org founder, and Harvard alum, Bill McKibben is currently on a 21-city Do the Math tour which is promoting fossil fuel divestment to sell-out audiences across the country. Over 2,000 people attended the event in Boston at the Orpheum Theater last Thursday night.
“Forget the outcome of the Harvard-Yale game, nothing has made me prouder to be a Harvard alum than the news that its students are leading the country in standing up to coal and gas and oil,” said McKibben. “Let's hope the Harvard Corporation cares as much about the future.”
The divestment campaign has scored some early victories across the country, with Unity College in Maine announcing they would fully divest their endowment and the Mayor of Seattle pledging to look into divesting city funds.
Students at Harvard hope that the overwhelming support for the resolution will convince President Faust to end their refusal to meet with them to discuss divestment. The President recently stated in a public forum that Harvard University only divests in “the most extreme of circumstances” and that no issue made them feel “compelled to divest” at this time.
In the past, Harvard University has divested from tobacco corporations, corporations that supported the genocide in Darfur, and (in part) corporations involved in apartheid South Africa.

“Thoreau said– most men live lives of quiet desperation. I would like to know how it feels for my desperation to get louder.” ~Bill Withers
1974 — Muhammad Ali and singer/songwriter Bill Withers chat during the Zaire '74 Music Festivals that preceded the epic Ali vs. Foreman'Rumble in the Jungle' fight on Oct. 30th, 1974. Other performers included– James Brown, B.B. King, the Spinners, the Fania All-Stars, Miriam Makeba and Zairian musical artists, all chronicled in the 2008 film,'Soul Power'. When asked later if it felt like a moving, historic racial event at the time Withers recalled, “No. It was two big guys going to fight each other at four o'clock in the morning. It wasn't this great intellectual pursuit. And there's a certain reality to going someplace where there's a dictator. You notice the disparity in the wealth.” And in regard to the African-American movement that was hapeening to re-discover their roots? “Awwww, come on, man. It wasn't a great historical moment. Interesting, but that was that. No great spiritual experience. Mostly what everybody found out was–we had been shaped and transformed by American culture and the history we had here, and they had been shaped by whoever colonized their place. They weren't speaking any African languages. We were speaking English and they were speaking French. How African is that?” — Photograph by © Lynn Goldsmith via
Bill Withers was no natural born musician, or polished product of the recording industry. They were a simple man, a bit manic depressive he'd even tell you himself– and that may be why their plain spoken words, delivered so powerfully, pack the punch they do. The youngest of six kids, Withers was born in a bleak West Virginia town where coal mining was your best prospect. He'd be the first man in their family to escape its grip.
Withers joined the Navy and got the hell outta there. It turned out to be a nine year hitch, and along the way picked up singing in bars wherever they found themselves stationed. Later they picked up the guitar and taught themselves a crude, but effect, playing style where he'd form simple barre chords and rhythms– this allowed them to passionately pound out songs without having to give much thought to their fingering– they could just slide their hand up and down the neck.
“Bill played just enough guitar to do what they did– But, what they did was really good.” –Craig McMullen, Bill Withers backing guitarist. Withers openly admitted they were a hack on the guitar, but they managed to wrench more power and emotion out of their instrument than other, more accomplished, players. –Photograph by © Fin Costello
After the Navy, Withers found themselves working at an airplane assembly plant. It was glamorous work– they were bolting toilets seats on planes. They were also hanging out in LA clubs– mostly to meet girls. When they overheard how much a club owner was paying one of the acts– a light went off. “I wasn't particularly interested in music, though I sat up when it was Lou Rawls or Little Willie John. Then one night this guy behind the bar was moaning that the performer was late and they said, ‘You know, I'm paying this guy $2,000 a week and they can't even show up on time!' I thought, “They're paying this guy $2,000 a week? They don't even get up in the morning!” Withers got to honing their craft, and scraped up enough dough to cut a demo. Their big break came when the small Sussex label agreed to put out their album– and hired the highly regarded Booker T. Jones as producer. Booker saw potential in Withers, even with as raw as their talent was, and drafted their own session band (The MG's) to back them up.
Even after the release of ‘Ain't No Sunshine' Withers kept their day job. They later recalled, “I had been working at Weber Aircraft and then I got laid off. Then ‘Ain't No Sunshine' started appearing on the radio. And it's funny, I got two requests in the same day. A letter from my job, telling me I was called back to work. And a request to do ‘The Tonight Show' with Johnny Carson.” Bill Withers vulnerably revealed the essence of who they were that night when they told Johnny Carson, “I would like to say something that has not been said so much. I would like for music to be real for a change.”

In 1975, the label that had discovered and launched Bill Withers, Sussex, went belly up. CBS came along and bought out their album and recording rights for a paltry hundred grand. The relationship between Withers and CBS was strained. Sadly, long gone now were the days of their hard strummin', foot poundin', woeful, soulful tunes. Their recordings for CBS were over-produced, pandering pop songs that lacked much resemblance to their honest, early work. 1985 would mark their last original release– Bill Withers decided they were done. Fortunately, with over 250 artists eventually covering their tunes, they and their family would be able to live comfortably off of the songwriting and licensing royalties for decades to come. And they did it without caving in to the industry's pressure for them to crank out ‘black' music “with the horns and the three chicks.”

“You gonna tell me the history of the blues? I am the goddam blues. Look at me. Shit. I'm from West Virginia, I'm the first man in my family not to work in the coal mines, my mother scrubbed floors on their knees for a living, and you're going to tell me about the goddam blues because you read some book written by John Hammond? Kiss my ass.” –Bill Withers

The widow of a Dallas firefighter killed in the line of duty last year is demanding answers from the city about their husband's death.
Jenny Wilson said Wednesday they have been waiting patiently for 14 months and wants to know what caused the death of their husband of more than 20 years, Stanley Wilson, on May 20, 2013. Wilson's longtime friend, retired firefighter Jim Crump, has publicly said they believe commanders are covering for a deputy chief who allegedly sent Wilson and others back into a collapsing building long after it was safe to do so. The deputy chief still works for Dallas Fire-Rescue.
Wilson, now a single mother of two teenage boys, had Arlington lawyer Barry Hasten send a letter last week to Chief Louie Bright III requesting the line-of-duty death report or a date when the investigation would be released.
“I don't understand why the report is being held because I think it's complete,” Wilson said. “They're not doing right by him. They're not doing right by me and my boys.
“Out of respect for Stan, I would hope the fire department would no longer hesitate in releasing the report or at least privately providing my family answers.”
Hasten, who said they have handled fire investigations for clients for years, echoed those sentiments in their letter to Bright.
“Due to the fact that most, if not all, witnesses are under your control, it's difficult to understand why the investigation has taken this long,” Hasten wrote.
Hasten says in the letter that they were retained for now only to get a copy of the investigation.
Dallas Fire-Rescue Lt. Joel Lavender, a spokesperson for the department, said Wednesday that they are “anxiously awaiting” the completion of the report. But they declined to comment further, saying the investigation was still underway.
They have previously said that line-of-duty death reports typically take eight months to a year and that the department wants to get the investigation right.
The State Fire Marshal's Office and other agencies are also investigating Wilson's death.
Wilson was crushed to death by a collapsing building in the six-alarm blaze in an apartment complex in the 12300 block of Abrams Road. Crump said Wilson would not have gone back inside the building without an order.
“When Chief Bright spoke at Stan's funeral, they said Stan never hesitated when they went into that building,” Jenny Wilson said. “I don't think in 28 years Stan ever hesitated when given an order.”
In the initial months after their husband's death, Jenny Wilson did not publicly question the actions taken the night of the fire.
But around the first anniversary, they said they were struggling to cope with their absence. They also found it “almost incomprehensible” that the report wasn't out yet. They said their husband would be demanding answers, too, had someone else been killed.
Challenge leagues (like Rampage/Beyond) are a great place to test out new game mechanics while receiving plenty of feedback and data about how players interact with them. When challenge leagues end, we have to choose what parts of these new features to roll into the core game. Some systems like Rogue Exiles (Anarchy) and Shrines (Domination) came from challenge leagues in this way.
The updates described in this document will not all happen as soon as the leagues end. Most of these changes will be rolled into the 1.3.0 patch.
Untainted Paradise
Prior to the one-week race in late November, the experience awarded by monsters in the Untainted Paradise map will be reduced substantially. It'll still be very good experience but won't be a critical component in winning the ladder race.
Rampage League
We have decided not to introduce Rampage into the core game as an always-on feature. As of 1.3.0, the Rampage-specific uniques will grant a form of Rampage.
Rampage will also still be available as a Zana Map Device option. The level of Zana and price will likely change in 1.3.0.
Beyond League
Beyond portals and demons won't be making their way into the core game in an always-on way. Beyond will be available as a random map mod and will of course still be a Zana Map Device option. This option will probably have its price and level changed in 1.3.0.
You may encounter Abaxoth and their minions in other forms in the future (or past).
Forsaken Masters
The active expansion is still Forsaken Masters and will remain so until the expansion containing Act 4 is released next year. The 1.3.0 update is technically part of Forsaken Masters and adds to its featureset. Masters will remain just as common as they are currently.
Higher level missions will grant more reputation and favour than they do currently. It will be easier to reach level 8 with masters after 1.3.0 is deployed.
Once Forsaken Masters is no longer the active expansion (i.e. in 1.4.0), Masters will still be part of the core game.
Unique Items
None of the Rampage/Beyond-specific unique items will drop as part of normal play once these challenge leagues end. Zana's Map Device may offer some ways to obtain them. We may also use them for alternate art race/PvP rewards or in other forms in the future. As mentioned earlier, the Rampage uniques will grant some form of the Rampage mod. YouTube |

Untold thousands of people are trapped in the generations-old dependence in the plains of the ancient Khorasan. No one seems to know when the addiction took root in this parched soil. Some credit the armies of Alexander the Great with introducing the drug after they conquered the majestic city-state of Balkh in 327 B.C. In many ways, the landscape of today's Bactria remains the same as the Macedonian must have beheld: eroding walls of mud and straw; jackknifed farmers in unbleached robes tilling hand-sown fields with wooden tools; unpaved and unmarked clay roads.
Some of these roads lead to Dawlatabad, a dull and flat market town that unshutters its stores twice a week, on bazaar days. Dawlatabad is home to the only hospital that serves several hundred villages to the north of ancient Balkh—some just a couple of miles away, like Abdul Bashir's Joi Arab, some a day's trek by donkey or camel. A team of six doctors and ten nurses work at the grimy one-story walled compound. Dr. Mohammad Akbar, the sole pediatrician here, told me the hospital receives approximately 1,000 child patients each year. Every single one of them, they said, has some degree of opium poisoning. “Most of them have other diseases—tuberculosis, dysentery, pneumonia,” the doctor explained. “But all of the children in our area are treated with opium first. Only after that fails do their parents take them to the doctor.”
After the nurses resuscitated Abdul Bashir with a shot of naloxone, an opiate receptor blocker, the doctor took me through their ward. The cots along the green walls streaked brown with old blood, or maybe excrement, were mostly empty. In two different rooms, three mothers sat cross-legged on cots next to their children. The doctor made macabre introductions: A two-year-old child with meningitis and opium addiction. A seven-month-old baby with pneumonia and opium addiction. A month-old baby with giardiasis and opium addiction. “They are either giving opium to them when they cry, or the child is ingesting it with the mother's milk,” the doctor said. “We will treat them here, but when they go home…”
The doctor looked at Abdul Bashir. The infant, hooked up to a drip of IV fluid, was asleep and breathing normally. “Every month we receive two or three babies like this, not breathing, overdosed,” they said. “It is very common for people in this area to give opium to children when they cry. If they had gotten here twenty minutes later, they wouldn't have lived. Last year, we had three children who were brought here dead.”
The other day I lunched on rice and desert dove with a hunter in Oqa, a tiny cluster of low hand-slapped houses about 30 miles east of Dawlatabad—a five-hour donkey ride, since no one in Oqa has ever owned a car. Forty-knot wind blew bits of sand and dry desert scrub, and Oqa appeared to be an island floating in a moving sea of dust.
The wild meat was dark and cottony. Dessert was green tea and an opium pipe, an implement of soldered metal brought in by my host's seven-year-old grandson. Men took turns reclining before the pipe, supplicants before a fickle deity that enslaves and grants analgesia both. Sour smoke wafted toward the door, where half a dozen children had
assembled to watch.
The men smoked and talked about life. In the last decade, it has gotten worse. Western aid has not reached the village, but the wealth that has accumulated in cities has complicated the existence of Oqa's residents: The proliferation of cars in Mazar-e-Sharif, for example, means they can no longer take caravans with firewood their sons collect into northern Afghanistan's largest city, because the cars startle their camels. The Taliban's steady progress through the region means their village may once again become ensnared in fighting. The Afghan government has clamped down on the illegal trade of artifacts, which means fewer smugglers are willing to buy the small objects the men sometimes loot from the crumbling Kushan castles that rise out of their desert like ossified dragon spines.
A child by the door hawked dreadfully, a dark, sinister cough. What about doctors, I asked. Are there any doctors around, for when the children get sick? “The nearest doctor is in Dawlatabad,” the men replied. “But we rarely take the children there. Mostly, we give them opium.”

This image, “Standoff,” is one of many I took over a three-day period that I watched a wolf and bison together in their life-and-death struggle.
It happened at Otter Creek in Yellowstone National Park in October. The female bison (known as a cow) wasn't feeling very well. You could tell that just by watching them They were lethargic, and never moved very far away from a small meadow they had chosen. Had they felt better, I would have expected them to join the bison herd less than a mile away.
It was also pretty clear that the wolf knew they were vulnerable. All the cow wanted to do was rest. The wolf, then the beta from the Canyon Pack, acted as if they had all the time in the world. They would let the bison rest, resting themselves in the nearby shade. Then, at an interval known only to him, they would test the bison by moving in close. The bison would summon all of their strength and get up. The wolf would circle her, and usually they would kick or give some other indication that they were still willing to fight. The wolf would lay down again and wait.
Eventually the bison would lay down as well.
I first came across this standoff one afternoon on my way out of the Park. I watched for three or four hours and left anticipating that the rest of the pack would assemble, and that the bison would be killed sometime during the night. It often happens that way.
I came back the next morning before dawn and waited for the light. Much to my surprise, the bison was still standing. The wolf was in the trees — about where they were when I left the day before. This went on and on for the entire day. And at dusk, they were still kicking, literally. There was no sign of the other pack members all day. I went home and came back again the next morning before dawn.
It was 12 degrees out, and since it was October, I still wasn't used to the cold, especially while just standing around waiting. It was not until almost dark that 3rd day that the bison just couldn't get up and the wolf saw theirs chance.
The next morning, at first light, there was a big grizzly on the carcass. Within an hour, the Canyon pack arrived with the beta leading the way. The bear, who probably had been feeding for some time, tolerated the wolves' approach and then retreated into the pines for a nap. The rest of the day was a smorgasbord of carnivores coming in to feed. Bears, wolves, coyotes, ravens and eagles to name a few.
I can't leave this subject without mentioning the great job the Canyon District rangers did during this time. There was only a narrow spot from which to photograph this scene, and that happened to be on the bridge at Otter Creek. While we weren't standing in the road, our feet and tripods were right off the road. It was somewhat precarious with traffic still traveling the road.
By mid-October though, the traffic had thinned substantially, and the rangers made the decision to close the lane where we were standing. They stationed a ranger at the site for 2 days, directing traffic so that the group of photographers and other onlookers could have the best view. Had it been August, with heavy traffic, they could not have done that. They would have been forced to close the standing area on the bridge to one and all.
So I can tell you from this experience (and others) that when they can, rangers enjoy providing the opportunities for all of us to witness nature on one of its most basic levels.

He's creating documentaries, writing books, touring their one-man show, and helping a certain travel website boost its stock price 70 percent… in other words, William Shatner is one busy guy.
Their latest project, the EPIX five-part miniseries "The Captains Close Up" (just released on DVD), finds the Emmy winner returning to the role that made them a household name: "Star Trek" captain. But this time, instead of leading the Enterprise, he's leading their fellow "Star Trek" universe captains — Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Patrick Stewart, and Scott Bakula — through a series of interviews in which they get personal about their lives in and beyond "Trek."
The 82-year-old star — who won their first Emmy at age 73 — talked to Yahoo! TV about "The Captains," their upcoming album, and their new book, in which he'll advise job-seekers over 55 that the best way to find new opportunities is to get entrepreneurial, a concept he's practicing himself.
"The Captains Close Up" DVD is an expansion of the five-part series that ran on EPIX. What's new on the DVD?
The key difference is, it is an intimate look at these human beings' lives in totality, not just their lives in "Star Trek," so they talk about things they've never talked about before with me. They reveal aspects of their humanity that they were keeping back from other people. [But] they felt comfortable enough with me to talk about things they'd never talked about before.
Watch the original trailer for "The Captains" right here:
What's something that surprised you while talking to your fellow captains?
[Patrick Stewart's] willingness to reveal that their father abused their mother, [Kate Mulgrew revealing] they sacrificed so much time with their children to work, [Avery Brooks revealing] that the color of their skin affected their lives to the degree that it did… divorce… The subject matter was profound, and very interesting. These half-hours, each one of the actors who have seen it, they've never seen an interview of themselves like the one we did.
Was there any hesitation on anyone's part to be interviewed like this?
Well, they had to agree to allow me to show this aspect of them, but we've done it with such love, and they saw it. And that comes across in every frame, that there's great affection for these people. Here are these human beings who had to do all these things to get to where they were.
Aside from playing "Trek" captains, what is a major thing you found you all had in common?
The drive to succeed, and the willingness to sacrifice parts of your life that were valuable: time, children, family, love, comfort… willingness to sacrifice that in order to succeed. Success is different for everyone; everybody defines it in their own way, and that's part of what we do in "Close Up," finding what it was each person wanted to achieve and what their willingness to sacrifice for that was. That success was defined differently by each one of [us].
[Related: You Won't Recognize 'Star Trek' Captain Kate Mulgrew in 'Orange Is the New Black']
Did anyone have regrets in the end, that they had taken on these career-defining "Trek" roles?
Oh yeah, there are pieces of regret in that: "I had to do this to get that, and now that I got that, I'm glad that I got it, but I'm so sad that I had to lose the marriage, I had to lose the children, I had to lose whatever it was to get it." We get to see these people in all these aspects of their lives. Take a look at the strangeness of Avery Brooks, and the heart, the absolute depth that Patrick Stewart reveals, and Kate Mulgrew, and Scott Bakula… suddenly you're looking into their eyes and you're seeing this human being revealing themselves. It's quite wonderful.
Did you bond with your fellow "Trek" stars about how much being a part of this world continues to play a role in your lives and your careers?
Absolutely. We had this core understanding between us all, and that was one of the parts, one of the reasons for the intimacy. They saw me as a fellow traveler, and indeed I was.
You're the captain of the captains.
[Laughs] Well, that's true.
After speaking with all of them, how do you rank the captains? Who is the best "Star Trek" captain?
Well, you know, every single one of them had a — I'm giving you the political answer here — every single one of them had a characteristic that was unique. That was the reason why they were cast in the first place. Each brought those facets to the role, and made it totally different. Everybody is totally different. There's no similarity at all.
Letting agencies are private companies that can help you find private rented accommodation that suits you. Most agencies also manage the day-to-day running of the tenancy.
What do letting agencies do?
Letting agencies act as 'go betweens' between tenants and landlords. They can:
help you find suitable property to rent
collect your rent on behalf of the landlord
arrange for any repairs to be done.
Why use a letting agency?
There are several advantages to using a letting agency:
the rent you'll be paying will usually be fair for the area
all legal requirements, for example fire safety measures, are more likely to be met
if something goes wrong, a letting agent is more likely to sort it out for you promptly.
Letting agent registration
From 2 October 2018 all letting agents have to be signed up to the Scottish Letting Agent Register. If a letting agent is not on the register then they cannot operate as a letting agent.
If your letting agent is not on the register then they are committing a criminal offence and could face a £50000 fine, up to 6 months in prison or both.
Find out more about letting agent registration.
The Letting Agent Code of Practice
The code practice is there to help tenants and landlords understand what they should expect if they rent a property through a letting agent.
Under the code a letting agent must:
Carry out their business in a way that complies with all appropriate legislation.
Be honest, open, transparent and fair in their dealing.
Provide information in a clear and accessible way.
Apply all procedures and policies consistently and reasonably.
Carry out services provided using reasonable care and skill.
Make sure all staff and any subcontractors comply with the code and any other legal requirements
Keep records to show that a have met the requirements of the code.
Make sure that all private information is handled sensitively and in line with legal requirements.
Respond to all enquiries and complaints within reasonable timescales and in line with any written agreements.
Inform the appropriate person promptly of any important issues or obligations in the use of the property..
Not unlawfully discriminate against a landlord, tenant or prospective tenant on the basis of age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or belief or sexual orientation.
Not to provide information that is deliberately or negligently misleading or false
Not communicate in any way that is abusive, intimidating or threatening
If you think your letting agent is not complying with the code, you should complain, in writing, to the letting agent. The complaint must be dealt with inline with the letting agent's complaints procedure. If you are still unhappy after the letting agent has responded to the complaint you can apply to the First Tier Tribunal Housing and Property Chamber.
Find out more about the Letting Agent Code of Practice.
How do I find a letting agency?
Don't go with the first letting agency you find: shop around. Make sure any agency you choose is a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) or accredited by the National Approved Letting Scheme (NALS) or Landlord Accreditation Scotland or the Council of Letting Agents and also that it is registered with the council.
You can find letting agencies listed in the Yellow Pages and on the NALS website. You can find letting agencies in your area on the Citylets, s1homes or Zoopla websites.
Former GOP presidential nominee John McCain (Ariz.) used Saturday's floor debate on healthcare to repeat the controversial "death panel" charge for which their running mate, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has been heavily criticized.
In a scripted exchange with Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), McCain assailed a recent recommendation by a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services panel that women receive regular mammograms once they reach 50 years of age, instead of the traditional 40. McCain used that to revive a criticism of the Democratic-written healthcare bill that Palin raised over the summer, that advisory boards could create polices that would make them become "death panels."
"Isn't that the kind of advisory board that this legislation could put into law, that those kinds of mandates could come down which could literally jeopardize the health and lives of Americans?" McCain asked Barrasso.
Barrasso's wife is a breast cancer survivor, a fact they referenced.
"This type of legislation would have cost my wife their life," Barrasso said. "She is a breast cancer survivor, diagnosed by a routine screening mammogram. And they were in their 40s when that mammogram was performed... It was a screening mammogram that saved their lives."
A grinning McCain then asked, "You would not describe that as a death panel?"
Barrasso replied, "Some people might."
About 400 killed in past six weeks of fighting in Libya's Benghazi -medics
BENGHAZI, Libya, Nov 29 (Reuters) - About 400 people have been killed in six weeks of heavy fighting between Libyan pro-government forces and Islamist groups in Libya's second-largest city Benghazi, medical staff said on Saturday.
Backed by forces led by a former general, the newly formed government army launched in mid-October an offensive against Islamists in Benghazi, expelling them from the airport area and from several camps the army had lost during the summer.
In the past three weeks the fighting has centred around Benghazi's commercial port where pro-government forces say Islamists are holed up. The port has had to close, disrupting food supplies in the eastern city.
"The death toll has risen to 400," a source at a Benghazi hospital said, declining to be identified for security reasons. Medics at other hospitals in the city confirmed the estimated death toll.
The fighting in Benghazi is part of wider turmoil in the North African country. Two governments, each with their own parliament and army chief of staff are vying for legitimacy, three years after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi.
In August, Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni and their cabinet were forced to leave Tripoli for the east of Libya when group called Libya Dawn seized the capital.
The new rulers set up their own government and parliament, but these have not been recognised by the United Nations and world powers.
The situation has been complicated by the Benghazi fighting where former general Khalifa Haftar has merged their force with the army under a mandate from the elected parliament, which is allied to Thinni and also operates out of the east.
Haftar's spokesperson Mohamed El Hejazi said their forces had surrounded the Islamists in the port area. "All types of weapons including aircraft supporting the infantry are being used to deal with them," they said.
Western powers and Libya's neighbours fear the conflict is dragging the major oil producer towards civil war.
During the first few days of breastfeeding, it's common to experience mild nipple soreness or tenderness when your baby first latches on. This tenderness should not last through the entire feeding, and it shouldn't persist for more than a few days. Very painful, cracked or bleeding nipples are not normal and indicate that something isn't right.
Causes
An Incorrect Latch: If your baby isn't latched on properly, sore nipples are often the result.
Breast Engorgement: Hard, swollen breasts can be very tender, especially during latch on.
Mastitis: Soreness can result from inflammation or infection of the breast.
Blebs: Blebs are small, white spots on the nipple that can cause extreme nipple pain for some women.
Nipple Blisters: Blisters can form on the nipple, damaging the skin and causing pain.
Vasospasms: Vasospasms occur when blood vessels in the nipples squeeze together and cut off the blood flow, causing painful nipple blanching.
Breast Pumps: Using a breast pump incorrectly can cause damage to your nipples and breasts.
A Baby With a Powerful Suck: A strong, aggressive suck can hurt sensitive nipples.
Thrush: A fungal infection can cause pain, burning, redness, and itching.
Dry Air: The air in certain climates or during the winter months can cause dry, irritated, cracked skin on the breast and nipples.
Eczema, Psoriasis, and Dermatitis: These skin conditions can cause dry patches that crack and bleed.
Baby Teeth: Some infants clamp or bite down on the breast when they're teething; this can cause pain and even breaks in the skin.
A New Pregnancy: Tender nipples are common in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. If you're breastfeeding during pregnancy, you may have to deal with sore nipples for a little while.
Treatment
Do not stop breastfeeding. It's safe to breastfeed even if your nipples are cracked and bleeding: your baby will not be harmed if they swallow blood while he's nursing. Continuing to breastfeed also helps build and maintain your milk supply while preventing engorgement, plugged ducts, blebs, and mastitis.
Make sure your baby is latching on to your breast correctly. An incorrect latch is often the main reason that sore nipples occur.
Begin nursing on the breast with the nipple that is less sore or not sore. After the feeding has started, let-down has occurred, and the baby is not as aggressively hungry, switch to the breast with the sore nipple. Once your nipples are no longer painful, go back to alternating the breast you start each feeding with.
Rub your nipple and areola with your breast milk after each feeding to moisturize and soothe sore nipples. If possible, keep your nipples exposed and allow them to air dry.
Ask your doctor or lactation consultant if you could try a purified medical grade lanolin product or Dr. Jack Newman's All Purpose Nipple Ointment after nursing to moisturize and protect your nipples between feedings. Don't use any other lotions, creams or ointments without first discussing them with your doctor or lactation consultant, as not all products are safe for your baby, and some can cause even more irritation to your skin.
Do not use numbing creams or sprays to help with pain, as they can cause numbness in your baby's mouth and interfere with let-down.
Talk to your doctor about taking an over the counter pain reliever to help lessen the pain while you're nursing.
Hydrogel pads can be chilled in the refrigerator or freezer and then placed on your breasts after feedings to help heal and soothe your nipples.
See your doctor or a dermatologist if you have a rash or scaly patches on your skin. Skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis may need to be treated with a steroid, while thrush needs to be treated with an antifungal medication.​
If you are having another baby, you can continue to breastfeed while you are pregnant, as long as you're not high risk and your doctor has not advised against it. Your nipples may remain sore throughout your first trimester or even longer.
If you need to stop breastfeeding from one side to allow the nipple to heal, you should continue to breastfeed from the other side. Express or pump the milk from the breast that is sore to prevent engorgement, blebs, plugged ducts and a decrease in your milk supply.
If you have to stop breastfeeding from both breasts, express or pump your breast milk very frequently to maintain your milk supply. You may also want to use an alternative feeding method, such as finger feeding or cup feeding, during the time you're not breastfeeding.
Watch for signs of infection, which include fever, redness, swelling, yellow or green drainage and/or a warm area on the breast.
Complications
Early Weaning: Sore, cracked, or bleeding nipples might make it so painful to nurse that you no longer want to continue to breastfeed.
A Low Milk Supply: If you are breastfeeding less due to the pain, this could result in a decrease in your milk supply.
Breast Problems: Engorgement, blebs, and plugged ducts can result from not breastfeeding often enough.
Mastitis: Cracked, broken skin on the nipples can allow bacteria to enter the breast and cause an infection.
Prevention
Check your baby's latch and positioning. If you cannot tell whether your baby is latching on and breastfeeding properly, talk to your doctor, a lactation consultant or local La Leche group for assistance.
Use a nursing pillow and a nursing footstool to help you get into a comfortable position that will encourage a proper latch and more effective breastfeeding.
Alternate breastfeeding positions regularly to prevent one area of the nipple from getting sore.
If your breasts are full and hard, express some milk before each feeding to soften them. A baby can latch on much easier to a softer breast.
Feed your baby more frequently, and before they are very hungry. Your breasts will be softer, and the baby may have a less aggressive suck.
Wash your breasts with warm water, and don't use soap, which can dry out, irritate and crack the skin.
If you use nursing pads for leaking, avoid pads with plastic liners, and change them very often. Wet nursing pads left in place for a long period of time could cause the breakdown of the skin and lead to pain or infected breasts.
Anyway, I'm not dead. Contrary to popular belief, I'm very much alive. I don't ONLY want to sit and talk to a camera alone for the majority of my life, learning no real-world skills, so I've been taking some time to teach myself some very valuable, profitable, lifelong skills that I can simply add to the list of "Shit I know how to do now." I love doing YT, and trying to be creative, still one of my favorite things to do. Just because I don't do it for a couple weeks of my life doesn't mean I'm quitting. Also been whipping back into shape, since I was starting to get sick often, lose way too much weight, and becoming unhealthy af. Many weights very heavy, thick solid and tight.
I also haven't tweeted in two days because I didn't have shit to tweet about, shame on me. So yes, I'm alive. I've read and learned more in the past three weeks than I have for the previous 21 years of my life (not exaggerating). I'm still going to do YT, but I won't give you a time frame so you don't have tobe disappointed in my "lack of effort." Now you know where I've been. Knowledge is power. Past three weeks have been awesome for me and I don't regret a thing. ily. *Disappears back into the fog*

Time for an Assyrian Regional Government in Iraq As can be seen in the region every day, it is not realistic to expect the Assyrians to be quiet and accept their "fate" under the tender mercies of Shiite or Sunni rule.
The future Assyrian regional government could be an independent state or autonomous region like the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq. Even if it is city-state like Vatican City, it would be monumental in stopping the annihilation of Assyrian people and could also serve as a safe haven for other persecuted minorities.

A property once owned by one of the richest families in the city has gradually been abandoned, left to rot, and now burned. In the middle of the 19th century, the area bounded by Queen, Bloor, Jarvis and Sherbourne Sts. was a prime piece of real estate owned by the Allan family, which donated the horticultural park now known as Allan Gardens.
This vacant home on George St. was found ablaze Wednesday night. It was built in the 1850s and was once under the care of one of the city's richest families. ( Google streetview )
In 1853, George Allan began subdividing the area for residential uses after their father's death. Pembroke St., one block west of George, became one of the city's finest residential streets. The house that caught fire Wednesday night at 295 George St. was among those built at that time and is one of the oldest remaining in the city. But the house's fortunes faded as the area became less fashionable in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when wealthy Torontonians flocked to Rosedale and other new neighbourhoods. 295 George St. switched hands often before being bought in 1884 by William Gooderham Jr., a philanthropist and son of the family that established the distilling complex now known as the Distillery District. They purchased it for J.W.C. Fegan, an Englishman who established the Fegan Boys Distributing Home to bring destitute young boys over from Britain and set them up to work in homes out west.

It was owned by the boys' home until 1939, when it became a home for disabled residents. For a while it served as a warehouse for Interalia Co. Ltd. It was sold in 2000 and again in 2005 to a numbered company registered as 1654028 Ontario Ltd. It now sits empty, exposed to the elements after the roof was removed for renovations in the mid-2000s. The heritage structure was simply left to disintegrate, said Eva Curlanis-Bart, president of the Garden District Residents Association. The street has “undergone tremendous transformation for the worst” in recent years, they said, frequented by prostitutes, homeless people and drug dealers and users — a disincentive to maintain properties or attract tenants. Eleanor McGrath, a local writer and filmmaker, became interested in the house a year and a half ago while doing research for their film on the history of Irish immigrants in the city.
Walking by two days ago, they noticed new fencing around the house. They contacted Heritage Preservation Services when they got home and asked that they start the process of getting the house designated as a heritage site. The next day it went up in flames.

“I'm still in shock,” they said of the timing. They say the city needs to work harder to preserve its heritage buildings, listing several houses demolished in recent years. “If we keep letting condo developers do all the things they want, what are we going to look at in the city?” Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam was at a meeting with the owner of the property, discussing community revitalization for the neighbourhood, when news of the fire spread. Wong-Tam said there's an accumulation of reasons why many properties on the street have been abandoned. One often cited is the presence of Seaton House shelter at 339 George St. Built in the late 1950s, the shelter for homeless men has more than 500 beds. “That, compounded with the fact that there are other types of rooming houses on that specific street, I think created an atmosphere where they started to see their property values fall,” Wong-Tam explained. A designated heritage house at 305 George was a rooming house for years before being left vacant. Wong-Tam had been meeting with the property owners to find a way to repurpose the buildings and land and rebuild the street. “I don't recall ever seeing that street wholly populated,” they said. The house at 295 George, along with a parcel of other buildings, has been up for sale for the past month. The asking price: $8.9 million.

Emergency services were in Kilmarnock Road, Shawlands, this morning after a section on the front of landmark pub The Granary collapsed and fell into the road.
The large section, which contained the pub's sign, has detached and came down on to a bus shelter and the pavement.
Both police and the fire service were in attendance
One witness believes the problem may have been caused by vibrations from roadworks.

The popular pub is long established in Shawlands and serves a range of food as well as drinks.
It sits on the corner of Kilmarnock Road and Pollokshaws Road.
The pub was due to show three Euro 16 games starting at 12pm today. However, emergency services are still assessing the situation and it is unclear whether the pub will open today.

The Donald Trump 2016 Fever Dream White House Campaign Experience is a bizarre experiment in hybrid politicking. Their approach to tackling policy issues is to either directly challenge core Republican and conservative beliefs, or indulge and pander to the ugliest desires of the party's base. On the one hand, he'll buck GOP orthodoxy and call for an increasingly progressive tax system that prioritizes fairness. On the other, he'll promise to evict every undocumented immigrant from the country and tell a bigoted supporter that, as president, he'll investigate the problems caused by Muslims living in America.
Trump's no dope. They know which issues will generate the most heat and cause the most controversy, and those are the issues he'll pander to the hardest. So it makes sense that the “policy paper” they just released on guns embraces some of the worst, most extreme fantasies of the crazy pro-gun right.

The animating principle behind Trump's gun proposal is that the more guns you have out there, the safer everyone will be. They oppose the expansion of background checks for purchasing firearms, they want to get rid of bans on certain types of weapons and magazines, and they want state-issued concealed carry permits to be valid nationwide. “The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own,” the paper declares.
The goal of making more and higher-powered weapons available to more people, according to Trump's plan, is to enable ordinary citizens to “fight crime” using deadly force:
Here's another important way to fight crime – empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves. Law enforcement is great, they do a tremendous job, but they can't be everywhere all of the time. Our personal protection is ultimately up to us. That's why I'm a gun owner, that's why I have a concealed carry permit, and that's why tens of millions of Americans have concealed carry permits as well. It's just common sense. To make America great again, we're going to go after criminals and put the law back on the side of the law-abiding.
He's taking two very different concepts – personal self-defense and law enforcement – and just mashing them together into a policy that flirts with vigilantism. The Trump gun policy vision caters to the George Zimmerman types who deputize themselves as flight attendants of public safety, and it would give them access to more powerful guns with higher-capacity magazines so they can help the cops “go after criminals.” What could possibly go wrong?
All of this is rooted in the “More Guns, Less Crime” thesis articulated nearly two decades ago by gun-crazy Internet sockpuppeteer John Lott, who argued that crime goes down when more people are carrying concealed weapons in public. In the years since they made that argument, there's been a steady stream of research indicating not only that their conclusions are totally unsupported, but that the precise opposite is likely true: More concealed weapons means more aggravated assault. That has huge implications when you're talking about making concealed-carry permits valid nationwide.
Trump's policy paper also embodies the radical notion that the only way to be truly “free” is to carry a loaded firearm at all times:
It's been said that the Second Amendment is America's first freedom. That's because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights. We are the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment. Protecting that freedom is imperative.
This is an unsubtle nod to the idea that guns are necessary to prevent the government from taking away your rights – an idea that has migrated from militia movements and right-wing fringe groups to mainstream conservative and Republican politics. It's a pernicious fiction that casts gun ownership as the true test of American character.

The Trump solution to gun violence is to make more powerful guns available, make them easier to obtain, make them easier to conceal, and encourage their use as an instrument of freelance crime-fighting. It's difficult to see how that will end well, but it's a policy proposition that the most conservative elements of the Republican base are sure to love.
The Channel Tunnel operator has threatened to sue the Government for hundreds of millions of pounds if they are forced to shut down their services at night due to the Calais migrant crisis.
In an angry letter, Eurotunnel president Jacque Gounon accused British ministers of “sowing panic among customers and investors” after The Telegraph revealed closure plans have been discussed at the Government's emergency Cobra meetings.
Most freight services to and from the Continent take place at night when, simultaneously, would-be illegal immigrants launch the largest number of assaults on security measures at the French terminal in a bid to reach Britain.
Mr Gounon called for urgent clarification on the Government's plans in their letter, addressed to the head of the British delegation at the Anglo-French organisation which manages the Chunnel concession held by their company.
In the letter, seen by The Telegraph, Mr Gounon said: “Under the concession agreement Eurotunnel would be obliged to claim for losses which we estimate could easily attain the level of circa £200 million per year.
“Any significant reduction in overnight services through the Channel Tunnel would have a grave impact not only on the concession holder but also on the UK economy.
“We believe it would be far better for resources to be focused on resolving the ‘Calais crisis' rather than sowing panic amongst customers and investors and, ultimately, damaging the economy.”
The Telegraph revealed earlier this week how ministers had taken legal advice on what Whitehall sources described as the “nuclear option” of shutting the tunnel after dark.
No plans have yet been drawn up to enforce a closure but it was understood the measures could be put back on the table if the situation deteriorates in Calais, where up to 5,000 migrants mainly from west Africa are living in makeshift camps.
Mr Gounon's letter went on: “The briefing that has led to this article can only be described as irresponsible and the impact of the article may be profound.
“We have been receiving calls all morning from customers concerned by the impact of such a move on their businesses and asking what level of compensation would be payable by the government for their consequent losses and those of their final customers.”
John Keefe, a Eurotunnel spokesperson, said freight customers including car manufacturer, food manufacturers and parcel couriers would be able to claim compensation from the British Government under competition rules if the Tunnel were closed.
“Closing the Channel Tunnel overnight would be counter-productive,” they said.
“Trade flows overnight – that's just how the logistics of business works – and such an action would disrupt industry across the UK and across Europe.
“Our customers will be able to claim compensation against the Government in addition to the £200 million we estimate our annual losses would be in the light of such a step.
“There would be far-reaching consequences and somebody has to think this through.
“It just does not hold water.”​
When Rick Sauve visits prisoners these days, they have something new to discuss — the federal election.
They pester them with questions: What are the polls saying? Who do you think is going to win?
"It gives them something else to talk about," says Sauve. "Because everyday's like Groundhog Day. Everyday's the same.

"When this comes around, they pay attention."
Prisoners in all provincial jails and federal prisons get a chance to vote Friday — always 10 days before an election — in special advance polling stations set up in the institutions.
This is the fifth federal election in which they have been allowed to cast ballots.
Sauve, a former member of the Satan's Choice motorcycle gang, was serving a life sentence for murder in Ontario when they filed a court challenge over the right to vote in 1992.
During their legal battle, the government changed the Elections Act to give the vote to provincial inmates serving sentences of less than two years. And, in 1992, a ruling by the Supreme Court cemented voting for all prisoners.
The high court ruled that "blanket disenfranchisement" was an inappropriate punishment that would not educate prisoners about the values of community and democracy.
All prisoners were first eligible to vote in the 2004 federal election, a decade late for Sauve, who had been released on parole. The 63-year-old, who is still fighting to have their conviction overturned, works as a peer support counsellor for prisoners, most of them lifers, in prisons in Ontario.

They encourage them to vote, despite obstacles some of them face, such as trying to get ID with a proof of home address or being unable to read and write.
Figures from Elections Canada show voter turnout among prisoners has been steadily increasing, from 25 per cent of 36,000 inmates in 2004 to roughly 45 per cent of 38,000 prisoners in 2011. That's still lower than the 61 per cent for the country as a whole in 2011.
"I'm surprised at the effort Elections Canada is going to to make sure that prisoners are not disenfranchised," says Catherine Latimer, executive director of the John Howard Society.
Part of the problem for prisoners is the special voting process, they say.
Notices are posted in institutions when all elections are called — federal, provincial and municipal. Inmates must register to vote for candidates in their home ridings, rather than the ridings of their institutions.
When they get to the polling stations, it's not as simple as checking a box.

Elections staff must dig through a long list of every riding and candidate in the country to find out who an inmate can vote for. Inmates then get a special ballot with a blank space.
Elections Canada spokesperson Leanne Nyirfa says a correctional liaison officer helps inmates register to vote and hands them lists of candidates in their riding a week before voting. Misspelling a candidate's name doesn't necessarily spoil a ballot. The Elections Act says if intent is clearly indicated on a special ballot, it can't be rejected.
A deputy returning officer and poll clerk man each polling station, Nyirfa says. If they can't be there, a corrections worker can be sworn in to act in their place. They don't know if elections staff have ever refused to work in institutions.
Sauve says some prisoners are paying attention to this election campaign by tuning into news and debates on TVs in their cells. Others read newspapers.
They are obviously concerned about law-and-order issues, but also issues, such as health care, affecting their families back home, they say.
"Surprisingly, there's a number that lean towards the Green party, because they're concerned about the environment. A lot of people develop a social conscience when they're in prison."

Some men he's talked to are leaning toward the NDP.
Occasionally, they say, they run into a Conservative supporter.
Sauve plans to vote Liberal.
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Almost exactly one year ago, the Los Angeles Rams switched quarterbacks by making Case Keenum a backup again and jump-starting Jared Goff's career.
In the latest example of the NFL's uncanny randomness, the former teammates Goff and Keenum will be pitted against each other on Sunday in Minnesota.
Oh, and the Rams-Vikings matchup is widely considered the best game in the league this week.
Not only are their teams thriving. So are they.
“Just like everybody predicted: Case Keenum with the 7-2 Minnesota Vikings going up against the 7-2 Rams,” Keenum said with a smile.
The move last season was only a matter of time for the Rams, who went 4-5 with Keenum after drafting Goff out of California with the first overall pick.
At that point, the player picked to be the franchise cornerstone for at least the next decade was not going to get much better on the sideline with the Rams headed for another high draft pick in their rough return to the West Coast.
The Rams lost all seven games that Goff started down the stretch, four of them by 21 points or more. The rookie's 63.6 passer rating would've been last in the league with a qualifying amount of attempts.
Keenum moved on to Minnesota, signing on as the backup to Sam Bradford with Teddy Bridgewater looming in the background after an 8-8 finish by the Vikings.
Since then, the Rams hired a new head coach, Sean McVay, who has done wonders for Goff and the offense. With at least 300 yards and three touchdowns passing without an interception against the Vikings, Goff would join Tom Brady in 2007 as the only players in NFL history to check those boxes in three straight games.
When Bradford's knee began bothering them after the season opener, Keenum stepped in. They have started five and finished six of the team's seven victories, keeping the job for at least one more week despite Bridgewater's presence.
By finishing their fifth game this season without being sacked, Keenum established a team record for a minimum of 20 attempts per game. Bradford (2016), Randall Cunningham (1998), Rich Gannon (1991) and Fran Tarkenton (1972) each had four in a year.
“I couldn't be happier for the guy,” Goff said, adding: “There are so many things I learned from them on and off the field.”
Keenum had plenty of praise for Goff as well.
“He's a smart kid, man,” Keenum said. “He's a fighter, too, because it wasn't easy last year.”
Here are some key angles to follow with the game:
WELL WHITWORTH IT
One of the most important enhancements the Rams made for this season was on the offensive line where former Vikings center John Sullivan has stepped in as the steady anchor and 12-year veteran Andrew Whitworth arrived from Cincinnati as the shutdown left tackle.
Vikings coach Mike Zimmer overlapped with Whitworth for six seasons with the Bengals, when they were their defensive coordinator.
“He's huge, number one.  They are smart. He's got good feet. Typically, they like to set with their hands out. They don't give you their hands a lot. He's a tough guy,” said Zimmer, who's counting on star defensive end Everson Griffen returning from a foot injury that kept them out last week.
ADMIRING ZIMMER
McVay is a whopping 30 years younger than Zimmer, so there's some natural reverence in play, but the former Washington offensive coordinator expressed admiration for Zimmer's place as one of the league's top defensive masterminds over the years.
“You have such a huge amount of respect and appreciation for the consistency at which he's produced great defenses year in and year out at a bunch of different stops,” McVay said, adding: “You see alignment, assignment, technique, effort. They don't give up cheap things. They play hard. They're fundamentally sound. Every yard that you get is earned.”
REWARDING WOODS
Goff's progress has helped Robert Woods put together a breakout season in their fifth year in the NFL, the Los Angeles native's first with the Rams after leaving Buffalo as a free agent. Woods leads the team and is 13th in the league with 622 receiving yards. After going scoreless in the first seven games, Woods had two touchdowns in each of the past two games including a 94-yard score that was the franchise's longest offensive touchdown since 1964.
“He's been working really hard. I don't know if they were frustrated, but they were a little kind of maybe confused why they hadn't scored yet,” Goff said. “He'd gotten the ball probably more than anybody.”
TEDDY'S TIME?
Bridgewater will suit up with the Vikings in a regular- season game at U.S. Bank Stadium for the first time, having played in the first exhibition there on Aug. 28, 2016, before dislocating their knee and tearing multiple ligaments in practice two days later.
Though the timing of them retaking the job remains unclear, Bridgewater said this week he's not worried about getting any starts this season despite an expiring contract that at least mildly complicates their future.
“Whatever the plan is, I'm all for it, whether it's me getting out there right way … or taking it slow,” Bridgewater said. “The good thing about taking it slow is I get to sharpen my game even more: on the practice field, on the sideline.”

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances. For example, if you think that Francis Scott Key's “Star Spangled Banner” is hackneyed and unsingable and no longer fit to represent our great country, you have the right to petition the government to change the National Anthem to something more appropriate.
(MORE: Aerosmith vs. Modern Lovers: Battle of the Bands Brewing Over Massachusetts' State Rock Song)
A recent petition on the White House website, titled “We petition the Obama administration to: change the national anthem to R. Kelly's 2003 hit “Ignition (Remix)” lays out the following proposal:
We, the undersigned, would like the Obama administration to recognize the need for a new national anthem, one that even a decade after its creation, is still hot and fresh out the kitchen. America has changed since Francis Scott Key penned our current anthem in 1814. Since then, we have realized that after the show, it's the afterparty, and that after the party, it's the hotel lobby, and — perhaps most importantly — that 'round about four, you've got to clear the lobby, at which point it's strongly recommended that you take it to the room and freak somebody. President Obama: we ask you to recognize the evolution of this beautiful country and give us an anthem that better suits the glorious nation we have become.
This cause only needs 95,329 more signatures to meet the goal of 100,000 by Apr. 2. At that point, the White House will have to respond, just as it had to respond to the petition to begin construction of a Death Star by 2016. So head to Whitehouse.gov now if you want to support the campaign to ensure that the nation bumps and grinds before all sporting events and swearings-in — or argue Aerosmith's “Dream On” would make an even better national anthem.

There is growing scholarly recognition of the experience and diversity of sexual orientation beyond “heterosexual,” “gay,” and “lesbian” identities, and this recognition has led to challenges to the traditional stage models of sexual orientation identity development.
Scholars have found that bisexuals experience identity processes differently from the way lesbians and gay men do (Fox, 1995; Klein, 1990, 1993). For example, some individuals may come to bisexual identity after self-labeling as lesbian or gay. Others may identify bisexual feelings from childhood onward. Still others may not become aware of bisexual feelings until after experiencing heterosexual relationships or marriages.
Further, stage models do not account for ways in which the boundaries between Eurocentric notions of culture, sexual orientation, and gender identity are blurred and reconstructed in non-Western contexts (Brown, 1997; Gonsiorek, 1995). One such example is the existence of “Two Spirit” identities that blend Western notions of gender identity and sexual orientation within Native American communities (Brown, 1997).
Across cultures, LGBT identities have different names and meanings. Researchers are providing new perspectives on the experience of multiple and intersecting identities related to race and ethnicity, nationality, and sexuality. Research regarding the ways race and culture interact with the experience of LGBT identities in the United States has expanded (Boykin, 1996, on African Americans; Diaz, 1997, and Espin, 1993, on Latinos; Manalansan, 1993, on Asian Americans; Crow, Brown, and Wright, 1997, and Wilson, 1996, on Native Americans). Beyond the United States, scholarship on the intersections of LGBT identities and nationality is expanding as well, particularly in reference to Africans, Latin Americans, Middle Easterners, and South and East Asians (Ben-Ari, 2001; Kapack, 1992; Kovac, 2002; McLelland, 2000).
Additional research addresses the influence of gender, socioeconomic class, ability, and spirituality on LGBT identity development. Regarding gender differences, women's non-heterosexual identity processes have most often been presented as paralleling those of men, yet a number of scholars indicate that women may come out and have intimate same-gender experiences at somewhat later ages (Brown, 1995; Sears, 1989).
Recent research explores LGBT identities related to social class and class systems, posing questions about how non-heterosexual identities intersect with class privilege and oppression (Becker, 1997; Raffo, 1997; Vanderbosh, 1997). Scholarship is emerging that addresses ways that identities of people with disabilities are influenced by LGBT identity processes (Clare, 1999). DuMontier (2000) hypothesized interactions between sexual orientation and faith development, and other authors discuss specific religious traditions and sexual orientation identity (Love, 1998).
By expanding the theoretical bases for understanding LGBT identities beyond those represented by white, Western men in the foundational models of homosexual identity formation (such as Cass, 1979 and 1984, and Troiden, 1979), researchers provide a complex picture of non-heterosexual identity. They highlight the social context of non-heterosexual identities across cultures and draw attention to the diversity that exists within LGBT communities.
