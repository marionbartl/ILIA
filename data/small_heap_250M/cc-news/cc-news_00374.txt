Delays can be expected on Interstate 85 near mileposts 52 and 56 due to the painting of Moore's Mill Bridge (Source: WSFA 12 News)
The Alabama Department of Transportation would like to advise motorists of upcoming lanes closures on Interstate 85 southbound and northbound from milepost 52 to milepost 56. The closures are a result of Moore's Mill Bridge being painted.
Five lanes will be closed Monday from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. Drivers can expect traffic delays during this time.
“It does cause inconvenience and you know the roads get really crowded, and so you just have to slow down and really be careful," said motorist Victoria Barker. "It gives drivers less room to get out of the way if there was a potential accident. You know, you only have one side to get off.”
“The best way for me to view it is just like this is water and everybody stuck in it so there's no reason for me to really get like that upset about it. Like I'm not the only human being on this planet, there are bigger things for me to worry about than traffic," said motorist Hamilton Wasnick. "I think if you approach it with that mentality it's a lot easier to get through the day.”
Motorists are urged to use caution when traveling.

Peugeot-owner PSA Group is discussing the purchase of General Motors' European operations, making the French carmaker the second biggest player in the region and allowing GM to focus on North America and China.
In separate statements, GM which owns the Vauxhall and Opel brands, and the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars said they were looking at a number of “strategic initiatives” with the aim of increasing profitability and operating efficiency, including through a potential acquisition of Opel.
“There can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached,” the companies added. It was not immediately clear what price GM might want for the loss-making European business.
For PSA and Opel, both of which are active mainly in Europe, it is a rare opportunity to bulk up in a sector plagued by high costs, low margins and tough competition.
GM and PSA have already shared production of commercial vans and developed common vehicle platforms, a relic of their last attempt to forge a broader alliance, which was unwound in 2013 with the sale of the U.S. carmaker's stake in PSA.
GM has repeatedly failed to make Opel profitable even after shutting Opel factories in Belgium and Germany and withdrawing the Saab and Chevrolet brands from sale. The last time Opel and Vauxhall recorded a net profit was in 1999..
Together, PSA and Opel would command a 16.3 percent share of the European passenger car market compared with Volkswagen's 24.1 percent, based on 2016 data. They would overtake Renault as the closest rival to the German carmaker.
For GM, selling Opel and Vauxhall, which added almost 1 million cars to its sales, could mean abandoning the global volume race in which it is currently ranked third behind Volkswagen and Toyota, with just over 10 million vehicles delivered last year.
Selling Opel will free up GM to invest more to develop vehicles for the North American and Chinese markets, where it makes nearly all of its automotive profits, as well as to expand new businesses such as ride services, autonomous vehicles and connected commerce, Automotive News reports.

BEIJING (AP)  Automakers face a dilemma in Chinas huge but crowded market: Regulators are pushing them to sell electric cars, but buyers want gas-guzzling SUVs.
The industry is rattled by Beijings proposal to require that electric cars make up 8 percent of every brands production as soon as next year. Consumers are steering the other way: First-quarter SUV sales soared 21 percent from a year earlier to 2.4 million, while electric vehicle purchases sank 4.4 percent to just 55,929.
Its tough for someone with an EV to come and take away market share from SUVs, said Ben Cavender of China Market Research Group.
The Shanghai auto show, which opens to the public on Friday, will showcase work on electric models meant to appeal to Chinese drivers who are wary of the unfamiliar technologys reliability and cost.

The pressure for electrification in China is an added headache for automakers at a time when sales growth is slowing and competition heating up in a market they are counting on to drive global revenue.
Sales growth fell to 1.7 percent in March from last years 15 percent. SUVs made up 40 percent of sales, while sedan purchases fell 4.9 percent.
At the Shanghai show, the industrys the biggest marketing event this year, almost every global and Chinese brand plans to display at least an electric concept car, if not a model ready for sale, alongside its latest SUVs and sedans.
General Motors Co.s Buick unit announced plans last month for Chinese sales of its Velite 5 gasoline-electric hybrid sedan. Buick also sells a hybrid LaCrosse in China.
This month, Ford Motor Co. said it will sell an all-electric SUV and a plug-in hybrid Mondeo Energi sedan in China. Fords joint venture with state-owned Changan Automobile Co. will manufacture the Mondeo.
Ford said by 2025 it plans offer electric versions of 70 percent of its models sold in China.
We are prioritizing our electrification efforts on China to reflect its importance as a global electrified vehicle market, Ford CEO Mark Fields said in a statement.
NextEV, a Shanghai-based startup, says it will display 11 vehicles in Shanghai from its all-electric NIO brand. They include the two-door EP9, a contender for the title of the fastest electric car, with what the manufacturer says is a top speed of 194 mph (310 kph).
Volkswagen AG plans to announce its electric vehicle plans for China and unveil an electric concept car. Honda Motor Co. will show its new NeuV, a futuristic concept car the company has suggested might get an electric drivetrain.
Government planners see electric vehicles as a sector where China can lead, and a Cabinet technology development plan issued in 2013 calls for two of the top global brands in 2025 to be Chinese.
Hence the proposal, released in September, calling for electric or gasoline-electric hybrids to make up 8 percent of every automakers output next year. That would rise to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020.
Manufacturers failing to meet those targets could buy credits from companies that produce more electrics, helping to subsidize development.
People in the industry say manufacturers have warned Beijing those targets are too ambitious. News reports say regulators might have agreed to lower or delay them in an updated plan due out this year, but there has been no official confirmation.
Chinas stand-out EV success so far is BYD Auto Co. It sells all-electric vehicles to taxi and bus fleets in China and abroad and gasoline-electric hybrid SUVs and sedans to Chinese consumers.
BYD Auto says last years sales rose 70 percent over 2015 to 100,183 vehicles. That would make it the biggest electric brand for a second year, with Tesla Inc. in second place at 76,230 vehicles sold.
Other Chinese brands offer plug-in electrics but most sold only a few hundred vehicles last year. That is partly because their vehicles cost up to 350,000 yuan ($50,000), or two to three times the price of equivalent gasoline models.
Even Great Wall Motors Ltd., which became Chinas most profitable auto brand by making almost nothing but SUVs, has unveiled an electric compact sedan, the C30 EV, which looks almost comically small next to its hulking other vehicles. It has yet to say when sales will start.
Some brands promise a range of up to 200 kilometers (120 miles) on one charge. But industry analysts say that is too much money and too short a distance for most drivers, who have few places to recharge.
The the biggest worries for people buying an electric car are lack of convenience for charging and the miserable range most electric cars have, said Zhang Xin, an independent auto industry analyst.
To ease such range anxiety, the Cabinet has ordered the state-owned power industry to step up installation of charging stations.
Government plans call for China to have 100,000 public charging stations and 800,000 private stations by next year, up from a total of 50,000 at the start of 2016. Longer term, the government wants a network that can support 5 million vehicles by 2020.
The government also is trying to nudge buyers toward electrics by exempting them from sales taxes and from license plate fees and lotteries imposed by Beijing, Shanghai and some other cities to curb congestion.
Aside from BYD, Chinese manufacturers are waiting to see what price regulators set for credits before deciding whether to buy them or develop their own technology.
Even by 2020, its not going to be a profitable business, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive.
The industry has to prepare for the worst case, said Zeng. That means who you have to have all the technology ready in case you need it, but on the other hand they dont want to commercialize it now, because it is not profitable.
South Koreans voiced criticism over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent remarks on dealing with possible refugees amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, comments on social media showed Tuesday.
During a parliamentary session Monday, Abe said Japan is working on contingency plans for a possible influx of refugees from the peninsula in case of a crisis. He earlier said North Korea may have the ability to launch sarin-loaded missiles.

The remarks were made in the midst of growing concerns that the North might carry out an additional nuclear test or a long-range missile launch this month.Some of South Korea's social media users denounced the comments as Abe's efforts to divert domestic attention from a property scandal involving his wife."Do not try to cover up your scandal with South Korea," a person with the ID "dime****" said on the country's top portal site Naver."South Korea should also declare that we will draw contingency plans for possible refugees from Japan's radioactive contamination," another user dubbed "pds7****" said.On Saturday, the North marked the 105th birthday of Kim Il-sung, the late founder of the country and the grandfather of leader Kim Jong-un, by holding a military parade, showing off what appeared to be a new intercontinental ballistic missile.It was followed by a botched missile test Sunday, the day US Vice President Mike Pence arrived in South Korea for a three-day visit.

Facebook is promoting paid-for hoaxes about Lord Sugar, Professor Stephen Hawking and the Queen to their users despite recent promises to crack down on fake news, a Press Association investigation has found.
The world's biggest social network was found to be taking money from hoaxers who place the misleading adverts in the right column of newsfeed, where it is less clear to users how to block or report them.

When made aware of the hoax adverts, a Facebook spokesman said the company works “constantly to reduce any type of misinformation”.
One such advert claims Apprentice star Lord Sugar was “out of control” and featured an apparently manipulated picture of the Amstrad founder with bruises on his face.
Facebook users who clicked the advert were taken to a page made to look like The Sun newspaper website, in which Lord Sugar is quoted as supporting a money-making scheme.
“The claims made in these advertisements are baseless and entirely false,” said Andrew Bloch, Lord Sugar's spokesman, adding that the business magnate is aware of the adverts and is working on “legal remedies”.

The advertised scheme promises earnings of 50,000 dollars to 200,000 dollars (£39,950 to £159,900) per week and uses stock footage of a high-flying lifestyle and actors in its promotional material. It has been widely derided as a scam by internet users.
“Lord Sugar does not condone, endorse or use these services and has been intentionally misrepresented in an attempt to deceive the public,” the spokesman added.
The discovery of the adverts comes as the social network makes high-profile efforts to tackle misinformation on the platform.
Last week the network unveiled another new initiative in a “multi-pronged strategy” to tackle the issue – offering users advice for spotting hoaxes that appear in their newsfeeds.
Facebook has also engaged with news publishers in the US, Germany and France to alert users to content called into question by independent fact-checkers.
The site has relied heavily on reporting from users, and allows them to flag up stories they believe to be false by clicking a button on the post.
However, this functionality is not mirrored on the “sponsored” section of the site, where users have to hover over the post to be given the opportunity to remove them.
The issue of “fake news” has dogged Facebook in recent years and the 2016 US election, which spurred a cottage industry of hoax websites and articles, brought the issue of online misinformation to the world's attention.
At the time, a Facebook spokesman reiterated the network's promise to stop hoaxers promoting false information using the platform's advertising network, which places adverts on external websites.
But anyone can pay Facebook through an automated system, select a target demographic from Facebook's 1.9 billion users and promote any content they wish at a low cost.
Another hoax advertisement recently promoted in Facebook's “sponsored” section claims “The Queen Has Died”.
The accompanying web address takes users to a page made to look like Facebook, and text which urges users to call a phone number or risk having their computer infected with a virus.
The phone number and page have been flagged as a scam in numerous online forums.
Robert Harvey shared a picture of the Queen hoax in a tweet calling the social network “hypocrites”.
“Yesterday #Facebook were on the @BBCNews talking about their efforts on fake news,” he wrote. “Today I had this in my sponsored links. Hypocrites.”
Thomas Barton, a retired associate professor of nursing from Swansea, said he has seen multiple versions of the celebrity death hoax advertisement, featuring Prof Stephen Hawking and the actor Hugh Laurie.
He told the Press Association: “Facebook is such a lot of fun and it's such a nice social media tool. But every time, there you are, you've got all these pictures of famous people who have allegedly died who patently haven't.
“I just think, surely, if they can manage to remove pictures of breast-feeding women, can't they get rid of these?”
He added: “I guess the reason that they don't get rid of them is that they are a money-making means for them, but that doesn't make it right.”
Responding to the Press Association, Facebook said it has now removed the adverts and disabled the accounts of the uploaders.
As well as the “fake news” tips displayed to the site's users, Facebook has launched The News Integrity Initiative, a 14 million dollar (£11.2 million) fund “to advance news literacy, to increase trust in journalism around the world and to better inform the public conversation” in a “global consortium” of organisations directed by the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.
Professor Jeff Jarvis, Director of Tow-Knight Centre for Entrepreneurial Journalism at CUNY, told the Press Association the spam adverts are “just the beginning”.
He said: “The problem is that the spammers and the fraudsters are always a step ahead, and clearly this is a problem.
“All the attention lately has been on the fake news that gets circulated for free, but there's also the problem of that which is paid.”
The number of advertisers still paying the network to promote misleading and deceptive pictures, links and stories has cast doubt among some Facebook users about the company's efforts to tackle the full scale of the problem.
“People want to see accurate, authentic information on Facebook, and we want that too,” a spokesman for Facebook told the Press Association.
“Misinformation and hoaxes of any kind harm our community. We take immediate action when we discover advertisers attempting to serve misleading links to people.
“In these cases, the advertisers maliciously circumvented our advertising review process. In subsequent reviews we identified the advertisers and disabled their ads and account.
“We work constantly to reduce any type of misinformation on the platform and will continue to improve our systems.
DUBAI - Pakistan Super League (PSL) team Islamabad United has named 40-year-old Rafatullah Mohmand to the squad after elimination of Khalid Latif and Sharjeel Khan from the PSL.
PCB Friday provisionally suspended two players of Islamabad United after initial inquiry into their alleged links with an international syndicate which attempted to corrupt the PSL. "Raffatullah has been confirmed. The other replacement will be done after our next selection meeting," said an official of team Islamabad United after a high-level meeting of the team management.
Raffatullah, a regular performer in Pakistan domestic tournaments, has played three T20 internationals for Pakistan in 2015. "Raffatullah' exceptional consistency in domestic cricket made him the obvious choice to come in as a replacement," said the Islamabad United management in a statement. "Even at the age of 40 he has kept performing and remained fit. And we believe this is just due for his years of performances in the domestic game," the statement added. Islamabad United will play its next match today (Wednesday) against Quetta Gladiators in Sharjah.
After 29 games, the New York Islanders stand at 16-10-3, which is good enough for fourth place in the Metropolitan Division. However, there is no room to rest. While the Islanders hold the first wild-card spot, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New York Rangers are right behind them. Coming into the season, not many people would have those two teams missing the playoffs. Now, the Islanders will have to fend them off.
If they want to keep that position, they'll have to improve their recent play. The Islanders are losers of their last three games and are a mediocre 5-4-1 in their last 10. Despite this latest slump, Hockey Reference still has the Islanders' chances of clinching a postseason berth at 77.1 percent. There's no doubt the Islanders have a playoff offense, but if the scoring stops, can they still get in? Let's find out.
Goals, Goals, and More Goals
The Islanders have scored a whopping 103 goals this season, good for second in the NHL. This offensive outburst is due in part to their new second line made up of Andrew Ladd, Jordan Eberle, and Mathew Barzal. Eberle was acquired in a trade with the Edmonton Oilers, and Barzal is in his first season as a pro since being drafted by the Islanders in 2015.
Barzal has been the second-line center behind Tavares the Islanders have longed for. In 29 games, Barzal has eight goals and 20 assists for 28 points. Barzal has been a big reason that the second line has been so dominant driving play with great puck possession numbers. Barzal's Corsi-for is 55.8 percent, Ladd's is 56.3 percent, and Eberle's is 56.9 percent. Anything over 50 percent means that player is controlling the puck more often than not.
The second line hasn't been the only line that's been effective. Josh Bailey is currently in the midst of a career year, with 32 points in 29 games and 27 of those points registering as assists. To put that in perspective, Bailey had 32 points in all 82 games just two seasons ago. Bailey's vision has helped Tavares and Anders Lee bury 17 goals each.
However, one can't expect the Islanders to continue this pace all season. In their last three games, the Islanders have scored three goals or fewer, which is below their team average of 3.6 goals per game. Those three games were losses. This team can certainly score, but constantly outscoring the opponent won't always work as the games get tighter come playoff time.
Logjam at Defense
Since garnering more playing time, Ryan Pulock has proved he belongs. The 23-year-old is averaging 16:31 time on ice in 16 games and has a Corsi-for of 53.1 percent. As impressive as he's been, there's a feeling he can do more offensively. Perhaps he will with a solidified role. With Johnny Boychuk out the past few games, and Thomas Hickey being placed on the IR, coach Doug Weight has had to shuffle his defense pairs a bit.
Outside of Johnny Boychuk and Nick Leddy, the defense is a tad suspect. Pulock is improving and Calvin de Haan is doing his job. Yet, the Islanders haven't nailed down their third pair. Dennis Seidenberg has played in just 11 games and acts mostly as the team's seventh defenseman. Based on his play, that's the way it should be.
Adam Pelech, Thomas Hickey, and Scott Mayfield are the other three defensemen competing for the final two spots. All three have been adequate and average, but Hickey's latest injury makes the decision a little bit easier. However, when he returns, he should get his spot in the lineup back.
Out of the three, Hickey provides the most stability and has shown he can step up in big moments. Don't be surprised if the Islanders deal a defenseman at the trade deadline, because there's simply one too many vying for playing time.
No Clear Number-One in Net
Last but not least, the Islanders' biggest problem. Their situation in goal may be the only thing between them and a playoff run. Neither Thomas Greiss nor Jaroslav Halak has given the Islanders reason to believe they can carry the workload as a starter. Greiss has been the bigger disappointment of the two with a terrible .890 save percentage and a 3.79 goals-against average.
Halak has been slightly better, but he still holds a .903 save percentage of his own and a 2.93 goals-against average. Both are considered below average by league standards and are a big reason the Islanders are ranked 28th in the NHL in goals against. The team defense hasn't been great, but any team needs a few big saves and both goaltenders haven't been able to come up with them.
Do The Islanders Make It?
I fully expect the Islanders to test the market on goaltenders in the coming months. So far, this team has exceeded expectations, but that can fade quickly with one bad stretch. While the Islanders can roll four scoring lines, they still rotate between two backup goalies.
If the Islanders don't make any changes in net, I still think they have what it takes to make the playoffs, but it won't be easy. Maybe a goalie like Robin Lehner would be available for trade. If the Islanders acquire a starting-caliber goalie, I could see them being one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference outside of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Until then, they'll likely be fighting for their playoff lives the rest of the way.
Classic cars destroyed at Country Classic Cars Enlarge Photo
More than 150 classic cars were damaged or utterly destroyed after a fire broke out at Country Classic Cars in Staunton, Illinois. Thankfully, it seems most of the cars residing in the facility were for sale, meaning owners aren't mourning the loss of their classic metal. Still, it's an unfortunate event.
The Telegraph reports firefighters were called to the blaze around 8:10 p.m. on August 8th. By the time first responders had arrived, the blaze had already engulfed a major portion of the 510-foot long by 50-foot wide building. Firefighters say a quarter of the structure was already on fire when they arrived.
The flames continued to spread, only to go unchecked when firefighters ran out of water to battle the blaze. Around 100 firefighters from 13 different departments eventually responded and mutual-aid tankers arrived. Due to the classic-car dealerships' rural location, the nearest fire hydrant was a mile away.
A quick search of Country Classic Cars' inventory shows a variety of vehicles offered for sale. They ranged from vintage 1920s automobiles to low-mileage Japanese imports and American muscle cars. It's unclear which vehicles were destroyed in the fire. Fire officials say the vehicles housed inside the facility certainly fueled the fire as fuel, cloth, and rubber ignited.
Now, officials will attempt to decipher from where the fire originated, though it may prove difficult since the blaze was so far along and extensive by the time firefighters arrived on the scene.
For most of us, it's sad to see precious cars gone much too soon.

REAL Id is coming to Massachusetts, and with it some new rules.
The Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles will begin offering the new enhanced REAL ID Massachusetts Drivers Licenses Monday, March 26.
Starting in October 2020, people who want to board passenger aircraft, even for domestic flights, or enter certain federal buildings, will need the enhanced Real ID under federal rules passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.
The RMV is shutting down its computer system from 7 p.m. Thursday until 8 a.m. Monday as it changes over to a new computer system.
Inspection stations will be unable to conduct motor vehicle inspections on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
Also on Monday, March 26, the state will start requiring documentation showing U.S. citizenship or lawful presence as required by federal and state law for all drivers license renewals.
Those wanting a standard license or ID card — one that won't be valid for federal purposes after October 2020 — may be able to validate your U.S. citizenship or lawful presence documents online, such as entering a valid U.S. passport number, the RMV said in a news release.
REAL ID customers will need to visit an RMV Service Center, that would include AAA locations that offer Registry services, with original copies of supporting documents showing U.S. citizenship or lawful presence, as well as other required documents.
More detail is available here.
The REAL ID costs the same as a regular license, the Registry said. Renewals are $50.
But people with existing licenses or ID cards that are not expiring but who want to convert to REAL ID will have to pay a $25 fee for a duplicate license.
Congratulations!

State officials have made no change in the official estimate of state tax revenue during the current budgeting year.
The governor and legislators will still have to cut at least $35 million from the current state budget soon, based on a previous tax revenue estimate set in October.
A three-member panel met this afternoon to discuss the state's economy and set their official prediction of future state tax collections. Retired businessman David Underwood of Mason City said the farm sector is worrisome.
“Somehow or other our farmers enough reserves built up when prices were good that they were able to survive a couple of years of down commodity prices and fluctuations in cattle prices and hog prices,” Underwood said, “but just recently I've heard some of the bankers talking about farmers really in trouble now.”
Dave Roederer, the governor's budget director, said agland values seem to have “stabilized” and he predicted the manufacturing sector is poised for growth.
“Manufacturing is starting to hire, both large and small (factories),” Roederer said. “…Manufacturing represents on a wage basis about 22-25 percent of the wage income that comes into the state, so that is one of the reasons I think that we are a little more positive.”
Legislative Services Agency diretor Holly Lyons sees little change in the U.S. economy this fall.
“Iowa revenues, while still growing, are disappointing for the first five months of the fiscal year,” Lyons said. “There is nothing, however, to indicate that the growth will turn negative, but growth is very slow.”
Lyons, Roederer and Underwood are members of the panel that estimates state tax collections. The group has come under fire for missing recent predictions, forcing legislators to vote to cut the budget and the governor to dip into the state's reserves to ensure the last state budget didn't dip into a deficit.
The governor's budget director characterized the panel's predictions this way today: “From my perspective, we're very firmly on the side of we're not sure what's going to happen.”
Lyons offered a similar sentiment.
“Forecasting state revenues 18 months or more in the future is always risky and one this is certain: we know that we will be wrong,” Lyons said. “We will either be too high or too low.”
The panel is predicting tax collections will grow by four percent in the next state fiscal year. That's $9.3 million less than the group's October forecast.
AUDIO of Revenue Estimating Conference meeting, 27:00
Roederer told reporters after the meeting some or nearly all of the $98 million ending balance could be used to cover some of the expected shortfall in the current year's state budget.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Rapper Kendrick Lamar reclaimed the top spot of the weekly U.s Billboard 200 album chart on Monday, fending off country music star Brett Eldredge.
Lamar's "Damn." climbed from No. 2 to No. 1 with 47,000 album units sold, according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan. Streaming accounted for much of the sales activity, with more than 46 million streams in the past week.
Eldredge's self-titled album debuted at No. 2 with 45,000 album units sold.
The Billboard 200 chart tallies units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).
The only other new entry in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart this week was the "Now 63" compilation of current pop hits at No. 5.
Last week's chart-topper, Arcade Fire's "Everything Now," dropped to No. 38 this week.
On the Digital Songs chart, which measures online single sales, Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi's catchy hit "Despacito," featuring Justin Bieber, showed no signs off moving from No. 1, with another 82,000 copies sold.

A five foot high snow penis has been giving people the giggles in the Cambridgeshire town of Chatteris.
While most people were busy building snowmen and making snow angels when the snow fell on Sunday (December 10), two friends carefully crafted a sculpture of a very different kind in the middle of the road.
Posting a picture of the impressive sight on a village community page yesterday (December 10), one local said she found it "so funny".
"Chatteris in all its glory. Delete if not allowed," she joked.
So far the post has gathered 457 likes and 49 comments from locals who also found it a source of amusement.
Local Alan Growler later added: "I just saw some kids carting it away with what looked like a shopping trolley."
The men responsible for the prank, Mark Harris and his friend Connall Beith, told the News they built it to put a smile on people's faces.
"We decided to make it for a couple of reasons, mostly just because we thought it would be funny and it seemed to put a lot of smiles on people's faces," said Mark. "The majority of traffic slowed down, stopping to take pictures and laughing as they drove past.
"Ultimately, we were just having a bit of fun and trying to bring a bit of humour to the community, which most people really enjoyed and appreciated."
It is estimated around 20cm of snow fell over Cambridgeshire on Sunday.

The inaugural luncheon for the Mary Ellen Strong Foundation (MESF) honoring Milwaukee's African American Psychotherapists unfolded Saturday afternoon at the Holiday Inn Milwaukee Riverfront. The event celebrated members of the mental health profession and student scholarship recipients.
“We are focusing our efforts at this time on the African American community in general and specifically Milwaukee due to the documented mental health disparities in this community,” said Dr. Stacey Jones, MESF Director.
Hosting the event was WNOV's on-air personality Michelle Bryant. Carolyn Wright, Co-chair MESF Board of Directors, shared stories about her mother Mary Ellen Strong, whom the foundation is named after, and her service to mankind. Wright talked about going with her mother during Easter collecting toys, candies and gifts for creating baskets to distribute to those in need.
“I learned to be a help to other people. If I can help somebody, that is what I live by, that is what I was taught,” said Wright.
Over lunch, attendees heard remarks from Dr. Ramel Smith, and Dr. Earl Bracy, Licensed Psychologist and the recipient of the MESF 2018 Service Award.
Smith when introducing Dr. Bracy described him as “a brother that changes lives”.
Bracy, a native of Alabama moved to Oak Creek, Wisconsin when he was 12. In Alabama he lived in a racially segregated environment having to endure separate water fountains and separate public facilities.
He talked about how he couldn't frequent public swimming pools or tennis courts and segregationist, George Wallace was governor.
Growing up in Milwaukee in the 60s, Bracy noticed differences from Alabama that one wouldn't expect in the north.
“First time I ever saw a KKK member was in Wauwatosa, never in Alabama,” said Bracy. He discussed how people wave and smile in Alabama at people they meet in the street just being friendly. This doesn't happen in Milwaukee.
“People are just not smiling,” Bracy said. “We have a big job trying to work with this persuasive anger we seem to see.
Bracy continued by telling the audience primarily of psychotherapists “Remain humble to the gifts that we have, they are gifts, they come from God.”
MESF grants two scholarships to students pursuing their Master's of Social Work degree at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee every other year.
“These initial scholarships provided were secured from a partnership that we have with a national scholarship fund. All the money they provided goes directly toward the tuition costs for the two students awarded. This event was not a fundraiser, but a vehicle for us to introduce our organization and the Professional Development Program to Milwaukee. Our future events will be targeted towards raising money. We are also looking for sponsors and partners to help us with our ongoing efforts,” said Jones.
Shyterria Sparkman and Kentrell Washington both 2016 graduates of the University of Wisconsin- Whitewater were the recipients of the MESF 2018 scholarships.
“Our hope is that the Professional Development Program will continue to expand, offering more scholarships, continuing to provide support, mentorship and guidance to help grow the community of Black licensed psychotherapists in Milwaukee,” Jones said. “Down the road we would like to expand the program to other cities and partner with other underserved communities. We also strive to continue to improve our website and use it as a portal to provide education, resources and to connect with mental health students and providers.”
It seems Pakistan's establishment suffers from a ten-year itch to change the governmental system in the country.
If one looks at Pakistan's 70-year history, one is struck by the amazing regularity with which the governments in Pakistan have been overthrown or radically changed at ten-year intervals.
Nawaz Sharif's ouster from power is the latest symptom of this deep malady from which our body politic suffers.
It is an indication of restlessness and lack of persistence among our people and leaders, desire for instantaneous results and miraculous solutions of difficult issues which demand long-term application, and the stranglehold over power that the establishment or the deep state has acquired with the passage of time.
Unless we analyse the latest developments in the country accurately and draw the right lessons from our past experience, the danger is that the country will continue to stumble from one crisis to the other with little prospect of moving in the right direction in a sustained manner.
Pakistan came into being through a democratic process involving the exercise of the right to vote of its people after a hard struggle under the leadership of the Quaid-e-Azam and the Muslim League.
Mindful of the flawed thinking of and dangerous tendencies among senior army officers, the Quaid-e-Azam strongly advised them in an address at Quetta to remain conscious of the implications of their oath of honour and refrain from involvement in political affairs.
Unfortunately, the Quaid's advice was not heeded.
Within a period of about ten years after the Quaid-e-Azam's death, Ayub Khan imposed martial law in the country which was poised to hold general elections under the country's first constitution.
The martial law of 1958 not only derailed the fragile democratic system in the country but also set a bad precedent for later military adventurers to play with the destiny of the nation, often with disastrous results.
The country had to suffer from a military defeat and its dismemberment at the hands of India in December, 1971 because of the incompetence of its military rulers.
Even the tragedy of 1971 did not deter Zia-ul-Haq from overthrowing an elected government and imposing martial law in the country in 1977.
The nation continues to suffer from the culture of religious extremism promoted by him and the distortions introduced by him in the Constitution.
The dark era of his rule came to an end in 1988.
It is interesting that the investigation into the air crash that killed him was never allowed to be taken to its logical conclusion by the powers that be.
One wonders why.
The subsequent period of elected governments, in which the army's top brass controlled the strings of power from behind the scene, came to an end in 1999 when Perez Musharraf, another military usurper, overthrew the elected government of Nawaz Sharif.
It is a tragedy of monumental proportions that almost every time the overthrow of the democratic order by the military was validated by the country's superior judiciary to its eternal discredit.
Pervez Musharraf's dictatorial rule came to an end in 2008 as a result of the lawyers' movement for the restoration of the superior judiciary and a virtual revolt by the political parties and the public at large.
It is strange but perhaps not entirely surprising that this man who was responsible for the disastrous Kargil operation, a sell-out of the Kashmir cause, and Afghan policies which brought the country to the brink of a major national disaster, should be singing praises of the military dictatorship as against a democratic order in the country.
It is also intriguing that this usurper was provided protection and then given safe exit from the country by the powers that be even though he was under trial on charges of high treason under Article 6 of the constitution.
So much for the commitment to the rule of law, which is an indispensable condition for justice, internal stability, and economic progress in Pakistan, on the part of these powers.
It is against the background of the foregoing events that one needs to analyse the events which led to Nawaz Sharif's ouster from the office of the Prime Minister.
The attempts to discredit and weaken the restored democratic order started immediately after Pervez Musharraf's ouster from power.
These efforts were intensified after Nawaz Sharif's election as the Prime Minister in 2013.
Although Nawaz Sharif gained prominence in politics because of the backing by the top brass of the Pakistan army, his defiance of the military diktat and his determination to pursue internal and external policies which at times were at variance with the military thinking alienated him from the military top brass and created a gulf of mistrust between the two.
The dharna by Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri launched in 2014 with the covert support of some renegade elements from the deep state on the cooked up charge of rigged elections held a year earlier was the first attempt to weaken the democratic process and dethrone Nawaz Sharif.
The attempt failed but not without weakening Nawaz Sharif politically and delaying the launch of CPEC from 2014 to April 2015.
The Dawn leaks issue, which erupted in October 2016, was another indicator of the growing mistrust between the military establishment and the Nawaz Sharif government.
An overt and covert campaign was also launched by the members of the establishment in favour of a government of technocrats, which was a disguised form of a military government, in Pakistan in place of the current democratic order.
The disclosure through the Panama leaks in April 2016 of off-shore companies and properties owned by the Sharif family in London provided another opportunity to Nawaz Sharif's detractors to bleed him politically and oust him from power.
The effort was spearheaded by a sustained propaganda campaign launched by PTI with the support of many of the elements who were involved in extending support to the dharna of 2014.
It ultimately succeeded on 28 July when a five-member Supreme Court bench delivered a unanimous but controversial judgment disqualifying Nawaz Sharif from the membership of the National Assembly, thereby, ousting him from the office of the Prime Minister.
While the judgment has been welcomed by PTI, JI, and Nawaz Sharif's detractors within the establishment, it has attracted criticism not only from Nawaz Sharif and PML(N) but also from many leading members of the legal community in Pakistan who consider it to be deeply flawed from the legal point of view.
These critics have called for a review of the judgment by the full Supreme Court bench to remove its legal flaws and lay down guidelines on several constitutional issues raised by it relating to the interpretation of articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution.
Nawaz Sharif's successful march on the GT road from Islamabad to Lahore has clearly shown that he still remains quite popular among the people.
His ability to bring about a smooth change of command at the Centre through the election of a Prime Minister of his choice and his tight control on PML(N) have established that he remains relevant to Pakistan's future politics despite the efforts to end his political career.
The current situation in the country calls for concerted efforts by the various political parties and other stakeholders to reform the current constitutional dispensation so that ambiguities regarding articles 62 and 63 are removed, all state institutions operate through mutual consultations within their constitutional limits, the principle of civilian supremacy is reinforced, across the board accountability is ensured, and the various paths to a non-democratic political dispensation in the country are blocked.

Washington Capitals defenseman Karl Alzner, who had not missed a game in seven seasons, was out Monday night for Washington's 4-3 overtime loss to Toronto in Game 3 of their first-round series.
Alzner, who is day to day with an upper-body injury, had played in 599 straight regular season and playoff games combined.
The last game he had missed was Game 6 of the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, a 4-1 loss to Montreal in a first-round series won by the Canadiens in seven games.
Alzner, 28, is in his ninth NHL season, all with the Capitals.
Nate Schmidt stepped in to fill Alzner's spot alongside John Carlson on defense.
Schmidt, who had played 60 games during the regular season, assisted on the first goal of the game, by Nicklas Backstrom.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence arrives at the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War, South Korea, Monday, April 17, 2017. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)
PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP)  In a trip full of Cold War symbolism, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence traveled to the tense zone dividing North and South Korea and warned Pyongyang that after years of testing the U.S. and South Korea with its nuclear ambitions, the era of strategic patience is over.
The unannounced visit Monday at the start of his 10-day trip to Asia was a U.S. show of force that allowed the vice president to gaze at North Korean soldiers from afar and stare directly across a border marked by razor wire. As the brown bomber jacket-clad vice president was briefed near the military demarcation line, two North Korean soldiers watched from a short distance away, one taking multiple photographs of the American visitor.
Pence told reporters near the Demilitarized Zone that President Donald Trump was hopeful China would use its extraordinary levers to pressure the North to abandon its weapons program, a day after the Norths failed missile test launch. But Pence expressed impatience with the unwillingness of the regime to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pointing to the quarter-century since the United States first confronted North Korea over its attempts to build nuclear weapons, the vice president said a period of patience had followed.

But the era of strategic patience is over, he declared. President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.
In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to reporters Monday evening, said he hopes there will be no unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria and that the U.S. will follow the line that President Trump repeatedly voiced during the election campaign.
Meanwhile, China made a plea for a return to negotiations. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said tensions need to be eased on the Korean Peninsula to bring the escalating dispute there to a peaceful resolution. Lu said Beijing wants to resume the multi-party negotiations that ended in stalemate in 2009 and suggested that U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea were damaging its relations with China.
Later Monday, Pence reiterated in a joint statement alongside South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn that all options are on the table to deal with threat and said any use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang would be met with an overwhelming and effective response. He said the American commitment to South Korea is iron-clad and immutable.
Noting Trumps recent military actions in Syria and Afghanistan, Pence said, North Korea would do well not to test his resolve, or the U.S. armed forces in the region.
The vice president earlier visited a military installation near the DMZ, Camp Bonifas, for a briefing with military leaders at the joint U.S.-South Korean installation, which is just outside the 2.5-mile wide (4 kilometers) DMZ. Under rainfall, Pence later stood a few meters from the military demarcation line outside Freedom House, gazing at the North Korean soldiers across the border, and then peered at a deforested stretch of North Korea from a lookout post in the hillside.
In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking to a parliamentary session Monday, said: Needless to say, diplomatic effort is important to maintain peace. But dialogue for the sake of having dialogue is meaningless.
We need to apply pressure on North Korea so they seriously respond to a dialogue with the international community, he said, urging China and Russia to play more constructive roles on the issue.
Pences visit came amid increasing tensions and heated rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula. While the North did not conduct a nuclear test, the specter of a potential test and an escalated U.S. response has trailed Pence as he undertakes his Asian tour.
Trump wrote Sunday on Twitter that China was working with the United States on the North Korea problem. His national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the U.S. would rely on its allies as well as Chinese leadership to resolve the issues with North Korea.
McMaster cited Trumps recent decision to order missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack blamed on the Assad government, as a sign that the president is clearly comfortable making tough decisions. But at the same time, McMaster said on This Week on ABC that its time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.
The Trump administration is hoping that China will help rein in North Korea in exchange for other considerations. Last week, Trump said he would not declare China a currency manipulator, pulling back from a campaign promise, as he looked for help from Beijing, which is the Norths dominant trade partner.

At least one person was killed and 30 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia when white nationalists protesting plans to remove the statue of a Confederate general clashed with counter-demonstrators and a car plowed into a crowd.
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Body-camera footage released on Friday by a North Carolina police department shows a man had his arms raised to his side just before officers fatally shot him last month.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg police released five videos from the incident, including two which show Rueben Galindo getting shot.
Officers can be heard yelling at Galindo, 29, to drop a gun they said he was holding in his left hand before shots were fired Sept. 6. A still image taken from one of the videos shows a red circle drawn around Galindo's left hand, an indication by police that he had a weapon.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told local media at the time that the man had called police and said he had a gun. Galindo refused commands to drop the gun, Putney said. The officers perceived a threat and fired, he said.

Days after the shooting, attorney George Laughrun told The Charlotte Observer that Galindo "pointed the gun directly" at Officer David Guerra before officers shot him outside his apartment building. Laughrun represents Guerra.
The new footage shows that Galindo's arms were raised and did not appear to move in the three seconds that preceded the shooting.
In Guerra's body camera footage, he is heard loudly saying "Rueben! Policia!" He then yells "manos," the Spanish word for "hands" four times, getting less calm each time before switching to English and more desperately shouting "Put it down! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Do it now! Drop the gun!" just before firing. After the shots were fired, people could be heard screaming while Guerra yelled at them to "Get inside! Get inside!"
Galindo's wife, Azucena Zamoraro, also told the Observer that her husband had called 911 that night and asked for authorities to come get a gun he wanted to surrender. A friend told the newspaper that he wanted to give up the gun because he was nervous over a pending court date.
Guerra and Officer Courtney Suggs were placed on administrative leave, the standard procedure after a shooting.
It was nearly one year prior to that shooting that a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer shot and killed 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, setting off two days of violent protest. Last January, the department said evidence and witness statements showed Josue Javier Diaz, 28, fired a .22-caliber revolver at an undercover detective, who returned fire and killed him.

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (Reuters) - Golfer Tiger Woods is expected to enter a program for first-time DUI offenders to resolve charges filed against him after police found him asleep at the wheel of his parked car alongside a Florida road, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.
The former world No. 1 golfer was not in court as his lawyer entered a not-guilty plea to a charge of driving under the influence stemming from Woods' arrest in May.
But Woods, 41, is expected to appear at the Palm Beach Gardens courthouse for an Oct. 25 hearing to plead guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving, according Adrienne Ellis, a chief assistant state attorney for Palm Beach County.
The reckless driving plea would allow Woods to take part in a 12-month probation program that would involve community service, DUI school, a substance abuse evaluation, possible treatment and other conditions.
Woods would avoid a DUI conviction if he completes the program.
His attorney, Douglas Duncan, declined to discuss the case with reporters at the courthouse on Wednesday.

Police found Woods stopped on the side of a Palm Beach-area road in his Mercedes-Benz at about 3 a.m. on May 29. He had "extremely slow and slurred speech" after being awakened by a Jupiter police officer but was cooperative and told officers he takes several prescriptions, including Xanax, according to a police report.
Woods, who had been heading away from his home on the exclusive Jupiter Island, could not remember where he was going and told police he was returning from Los Angeles.

A blood test showed he had the painkiller Vicodin and the antidepressant Xanax in his system but no alcohol. He was charged with driving under the influence and improperly stopping his vehicle.
In a statement after his arrest, Woods apologized to fans and blamed the incident on prescription medication he was taking to manage pain from a recent back surgery.
In mid-June, Woods said he was receiving professional help to manage his use of pain medications and a sleep disorder. The following month he announced he had completed an out-of-state program.
Woods has won 14 major golf championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus, but has competed little during the past two years after undergoing multiple back surgeries. He currently is not ranked on the PGA's list of top 1,000 players.

The first trailer for the upcoming sci-fi thriller Replicas has gone online. Keanu Reeves plays a neuroscientist on the verge of transferring human consciousness into a computer when his family is killed in a car crash. Desperate to resurrect them, he clones his wife and kids, but soon discovers he can only bring back three of the four family members. Also, robots are involved in the plot somehow.
It looks kind of interesting, but the story seems to be pursuing two different plots, so it's also a bit confusing. One story is about transferring human consciousness into a computer and then using that to power a robot, but his family aren't robots. They're clones, and while I get that the human-consciousness device is part of the cloning process, it seems like the story is a mashup of two different kinds of premises when either one would probably work fine on its own. That being said, I like the dramatic stakes here, and I hope it all comes together, especially because I like to see Reeves carry more dramatic material.
Check out the Replicas trailer below. The film doesn't currently have a release date (the trailer teases that the film will arrive next year, but we don't know when), but it co-stars Alice Eve and Thomas Middleditch.
Here's the official synopsis for Replicas:

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Charges have been dropped against a police officer and a former sheriff's deputy in a California sex abuse case involving the teenage daughter of an Oakland police dispatcher.
The dismissals this week marked the latest setback for prosecutors in the high-profile case involving the troubled Oakland Police Department and other agencies. A judge previously tossed out allegations against another former officer in the case that cost 12 law enforcement officers their jobs.
Three other former officers have pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and paid small fines.
In the two latest dismissals, a judge ruled Wednesday that former deputy Ricardo Perez didn't know the teen was 17 when they engaged in consensual sex. Prosecutors on Thursday dismissed a similar case filed against Oakland police officer Giovanni LoVerde.

"I had the utmost confidence that this would be the result," LoVerde told radio station KQED (http://bit.ly/2kqsg28 ). "Unfortunately, it took a year and a half to get here. I am happy. I look forward to getting back and serving the people of Oakland."
The teen claimed she had sexual relations with nearly two dozen law enforcement officers throughout the San Francisco Bay Area while she was working as a prostitute. She said some of the encounters occurred when she was 17 but testified that she lied about her age.
The claims became public when an Oakland police officer committed suicide in 2015 and left a note implicating several colleagues. Oakland police Chief Sean Whent was forced to resign in June 2016 after a federal judge who oversees the department said the internal affairs investigation was botched.
A dozen officers from five law enforcement agencies were fired or resigned over their involvement in the case.
The woman said she no longer works as a prostitute. The Associated Press generally doesn't identify people who say they are sexual abuse victims.
Oakland paid the woman nearly $1 million to settle her abuse claims.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New Jersey man convicted of planting bombs in Manhattan's Chelsea neighbourhood does not deserve multiple life sentences and should be able to further his education and see his family while spending the rest of his life in prison, his lawyer argued on Friday.
Ahmad Khan Rahimi, 30, faces sentencing on Feb. 13 in federal court in Manhattan over the attack, including a bomb that injured 30 people when it exploded on Sept. 17, 2016.
Jurors convicted Rahimi in October on all eight counts he faced, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction. Rahimi became known as the “Chelsea Bomber.”
In a letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who will impose punishment, Rahimi's lawyer Xavier Donaldson said his client deserves no more than life plus 45 years in prison, all but 15 years of which are required by law.
Donaldson said Rahimi, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Afghanistan, has completed classes in business, entrepreneurship and drama since his arrest.
He said Rahimi should be allowed to “avail himself of any educational opportunities” he qualifies for while in prison, and said the father of three should be housed as close to Virginia as possible so family can visit.
Donaldson urged Berman not to “unnecessarily stack” extra life sentences on Rahimi for three of the eight counts.
“The obvious severity of a life sentence plus 30 years is crystal clear: said sentence is intended to ensure that Mr. Rahimi is never released,” he wrote.
On Jan. 16, federal prosecutors also urged a life sentence for Rahimi.
They said Rahimi has “failed to show remorse” and has tried to radicalize fellow inmates with Islamic State and al Qaeda propaganda. [nL1N1PB28U]

Ajaz Akhtar, one of the greatest local cricketers of all time, rolled back the years to bowl Barnack to a crucial Rutland Division One win yesterday (August 13).
The swing-bowler supreme has been a social media irritant to local players for most of this summer, but he still has the ability to torment on the pitch as well.

Akhtar rarely bowls these days, but he picked the ball up in a big relegation battle against Stamford Town and promptly claimed 7-38 from 10 overs as the bottom club were shot out for just 67 in 19 overs and two balls.
Muhammad Yaseen collected the other three wickets to fall. Yasir Mirza (48), Mohammed Hammad (44), Shahid Muhammed (33) and Akhtar (25) scored the bulk of Barnack's 183-7.
The other key relegation clash at Bretton Gate was won by Peterborough Town over Market Deeping.
Both clubs try and give club members, however talented, a run-out on a Sunday and Town edged this one after restricting Deeping to 169-9 in their 45 overs.

Teenagers were well to the fore with Nick Green top scoring with 39 and taking two wickets for Deeping, while Connor Parnell, who dismissed the impressive Green, taking two wickets and joining 18 year-old Mohammed Danyaal (31no) in a crucial unbroken seventh-wicket stand.
Kieran Judd, another emerging youngster, top scored for Town with 32, but the city side's man-of-the-match was 16 year-old off-spinner Mohammed Saif who finished with 5-26 from 12 exceptional overs.
There are now just 11 points separating Market Deeping, who are next-to-bottom, and Ketton, who are sixth.
Ketton were beaten by 33 runs at Bourne yesterday for whom openers Pete Morgan and Jordan Temple both cracked half centuries in a team score of 218-8. Pete Rowe responded with 78 for Ketton.
Leaders Wisbech hammered Nassington by seven wickets as veteran Ali Anthony smacked an undefeated 63.
Skipper Bashrat Hussain struck 75 for second-placed Oundle and bagged two wickets in a 19-run win over Grantham.

The St. Louis Blues announced on Tuesday that the team had agreed to a one-year, one-way contract extension with forward Robby Fabbri, according to Jeremy Rutherford.
The Blues and Robby Fabbri have agreed to terms on a one-year contract extension. Fabbri hasn't played a regular-season game since February 2017, when he suffered the first of his two ACL injuries. #stlblues — Jeremy Rutherford (@jprutherford) July 3, 2018
The deal reportedly carries an annual average value (AAV) of $925,000 which is a slight increase in cap hit and decrease in AAV from his entry-level contract that expired following the 2017-18 season.
Fabbri Remains a Question Mark
The 22-year-old from Mississauga, Ontario, has had a rough start to his NHL career – playing 72 games in his rookie season before just 51 in 2016-17 when he tore his left ACL on Feb. 4, 2017. He missed the entire 2017-18 campaign after re-injuring his surgically-repaired knee which likely led to him signing this one-year extension.

When he's been healthy, Fabbri's played some impressive hockey for the Blues. He had a career-high 37 points in his rookie season in 2015-16 and was on pace for an even better year when he tore his ACL back in 2017.
Through his first 123 regular season games in the NHL, the young forward has 29 goals and 66 points. On top of that, he's posted a 52.1 Corsi-for Percentage (CF%) over that span with 15 points in 20 playoff games during the 2015-16 season.
Fabbri Getting Ready for Return
Along with the announcement of his contract extension, it was also announced that Fabbri was cleared to participate in hockey-related activities as both the Blues and Fabbri ready themselves for training camp in September.
“He's doing very well,” said Blues' general manager Doug Armstrong according to NHL.com. “He is up in Toronto working very hard and time is going to tell on this one. It's very difficult, you feel for Robby. He was projecting to be such a good player and then these two injuries kept him out a year and a half. We want to make sure we're not putting him in a position to fail when he comes (to training camp). He'll come back in and be hoping for the best, but expecting a little bit of readjustment. But health-wise he's doing good.”
The extension will carry through to the end of this season at which point Fabbri will, once again, become a restricted free agent with his rights belonging to the Blues. With his history of injury already playing a role, the Blues will surely wait and see if Fabbri can make it through the season unscathed.
If, in fact, Fabbri can return to the form that landed him worthy of the 21st overall pick in 2014, he could be one of the biggest bargains of this NHL season. After all, the young forward will have something to prove after sitting for more than a year and a half. The question will be which Robby Fabbri will the Blues get when the puck drops on the upcoming campaign?
The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, also known as the ABC Board, voted unanimously on Wednesday to approve a 5 percent increase on mark up prices for liquor sales.
Dean Argo, government relations manager for Alabama's ABC Board, says the increase will go into effect on Nov. 1.
The board has been looking to make this change since March. The increase brings the mark-up price up from 30 percent to 35 percent. According to the board back in March, the five percent increase will affect a $30 bottle of liquor approximately one dollar, meaning it would cost the consumer a dollar more to purchase the bottle.
Argo says the money this increase will bring in has been earmarked in the general fund budget for district attorneys and the court system.

INDIO-Lady Gaga debuted a R&B-tinged love song as she headlined the Coachella festival, where the pop diva cast herself as sensual rather than sensational.
The first woman in a decade to top the lineup at the premier music event, Lady Gaga unleashed an action-packed spectacle of acrobatic choreography that culminated in confetti, fireballs and fireworks on her dance anthem “Bad Romance.”
Gaga seized upon the spotlight to introduce a new song, “The Cure,” that is built off an unadorned R&B rhythm before rising into a pop chorus with the lines, “If I can't find the cure, I'll fix you with my love.”
She released the song commercially as she left Coachella in the California desert, marking her first new music since her latest album “Joanne” came out in October. Coachella offered a preview of the global tour the pop superstar will launch in August for “Joanne,” an album that brought a more classic pop and even country sound to the 31-year-old artist long associated with synthpop.
Gaga made clear at Coachella that her old spirit remained undiminished. On “John Wayne,” one of her most country-driven songs in which she admits an attraction to rugged masculinity, Gaga paradoxically sang astride a human pyramid of her sweaty, topless and ethnically diverse crew of male dancers.
Sensuality oozed throughout Gaga's set. She beckoned one dancer by grabbing his jeans in the waist, as both male and female dancers rubbed her leotard-clad body seductively.
“Have you all found someone you want to sleep with yet?” she teasingly asked the 100,000-strong crowd, most of them young and many of them clad only in the bare minimum of clothing after a long day in the sun.
Yet for a singer once talked about as much for her outrageous outfits as her songs, she stepped back and put the emphasis on her music - giving herself space to show off her glowing, rich voice on tracks such as “The Edge of Glory.” Her biggest fashion message may have come as she played piano. She struggled to take off her sweater mid-song, in an endearing display of authenticity. Lady Gaga played her first Coachella after original headliner Beyonce canceled on doctors' orders as she expects twins.
One of the most lucrative events on the global cultural calendar, Coachella takes place over back-to-back three-day weekends with identical lineups.
In a Coachella hallmark, Saturday saw a slew of surprise performers - delighting fans who avidly posted to social media. The rapper Future, who recently made history with back-to-back albums debuting at number one on the US chart, drew cheers when he brought to stage Migos, the Atlanta trio behind the hit “Bad and Boujee.”
But an even bigger name soon came on - rap superstar Drake, a sometime collaborator with Future, who turned the crowd into a sea of waving arms as he performed his hit “Fake Love.”
Migos then crossed the lawn to make a cameo with DJ Snake, the successful but largely behind-the-scenes force behind mega-hits such as “Lean On.”
The French DJ pulled off a second surprise as Lauryn Hill walked on, singing the Fugees emblematic song “Killing Me Softly.”
Bon Iver, once a crowd favorite with indie folk tunes such as “Skinny Love,” brought to stage the band's turn into deep experimentation in a set of loop effects and references to numerological riddles from its latest album, “22, A Million.” Frontman Justin Vernon performed in headphones at a soundboard but by the end of the set brought the crowd into a frenzy as he knelt before his sound pedals and clamped aggressively onto his electric guitar's bridge as abstract images flashed on screen.
While Lady Gaga toned down her outfits, one artist who embraced costumes was Roisin Murphy. The Irish trip-hop singer took the stage with her face covered by a mask made of interjoined dolls and later carried over her head a faceless, zebra-colored dummy.
If Coachella handed out fashion awards, one could also go to frontman Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest, the prolific indie rockers with a unique talent to work songs down to quiet and back up to intensity.
The 24-year-old Toledo, long pictured as a scraggly younger, donned a tight, sky-blue suit with a black shirt and necktie.
We put the question to five other professionals in the field: What needs to happen to improve actor training in Canada?
What counts as best practice in Canadian theatre training? Alisa Palmer, an artistic director at the National Theatre School in Montreal — the country's flagship theatre academy — points to “agency and independence” as a core ingredient of its approach to actor training. The NTS “supports young artists-in-training to be in charge of themselves so they can identify and contribute to a safe working environment, and by this I mean an environment where it is safe to tackle challenging material, to dig deep and aim high, and to take creative risks,” says Palmer.
Actor training is under the spotlight, as an instructor at George Brown Theatre School , and the founder and director of the Randolph Academy have left their posts following allegations of inappropriate conduct toward students. Meanwhile, the crisis at Soulpepper Theatre, which runs its own training program and shares a building with George Brown, is raising related questions about power, authority and responsibility in the Canadian performing arts.
Institutions bear the responsibility to ensure teachers are trained in current best practices in acting training; otherwise the cycle of harassment will continue.
Teaching students to take risks and step outside their learned comfort zones makes the teacher/student power-imbalance ripe for misunderstanding and abuse. Teachers may not be current with their language, their use of touch, nor understand their gender bias or privilege.
Many acting teachers have little or no formal training as teachers. They tend to be actors who have cobbled together a pedagogy based on their own professional practice and their memories of theatre school. They can be terrifically dynamic and creative, but they can also bring with them toxic behaviours that can make the classroom a dangerous environment, especially for vulnerable first-year students.
Jennifer Wigmore is an artist and educator who has taught in multiple institutions and is working with the groups Got Your Back and Actors' Equity to address systemic problems in Canadian actor training.
2. Christine Brubaker: Lower the pressure
My experience in conservatory training is that there is little agency for the actor, very little encouragement to think or respond critically about the process they are engaging with — in fact, it is often openly discouraged: “We have little time and this is how the profession works.” And the stakes are high for the students to step in line. It's often highly competitive to get in and to stay in. For most schools, continuing through the program you either have to be “invited” back for subsequent years, or you need to audition to continue to the next level.
How do you navigate the minefield of challenging the structure and retaining favour all at once? We've seen how these power dynamics play out in the professional world. Schools need to be shaping the profession and not the profession shaping the creative learning process.
Christine Brubaker is an actor and director, and assistant professor in the School of Creative and Performing Arts at the University of Calgary.
3. Michael Greyeyes: Out with the old
Actor training in Canada, and certainly in my department at York, has changed significantly over the past five years. The change occurred because we, the professors who create and deliver the curriculum, have reshaped it in our own images, our own histories. Theatre and training for it is a tradition-bound institution, despite our reverence for innovators and innovative productions. But as younger faculty reimagine pedagogy to reflect our own artistic practice and processes, I've seen a marked shift away from canonical/traditional bodies of knowledge.
If the crisis of abuse that is overtaking our theatre is any indication, old systems deserve to be abandoned. That means tired thinking (and practice) must be abandoned if we are hoping to attract students and prepare them for a future not built on old fault lines.
Actor and educator Michael Greyeyes is an associate professor of theatre at York University.
4. Marcia Johnson: Careful what you say
Comments on physical appearance (usually weight) have to stop. Teachers have been known to talk about “creating a brand” and “being castable” as a pretext for making negative comments. The focus should stay on the work. There is no predicting how a person can change as they get older or to predict what will happen in the industry. I know of a male teacher who kept telling female students to wear dresses and high heels. Some students complained that his request had nothing to do with professional expectations but his own preference, especially since he made no comments to male students about their clothing.
Actor and writer Marcia Johnson has taught an introduction to playwriting course at Sheridan College.
5. Kathryn Shaw: Encourage students to speak out
Theatrical training institutions need to ensure they create a safe learning environment free from bullying and harassment. To that end, Studio 58/Langara College is the first theatre school to adopt the Canadian Actors' Equity Association's “Not in Our Space!” campaign. A statement is read out loud at the beginning of every rehearsal period with the guest director, designers and students present emphasizing that any form of bullying or harassment is not acceptable at Studio 58. This statement is also read out in classes, and “Not in Our Space!” material is posted on our call board. We encourage everyone to speak out if they experience or witness unacceptable behaviour. Our hope is by instituting this policy during their training our students will carry forth this standard into the profession as the next generation of Canada's theatrical practitioners.

Not all domain name disputes are appropriate for resolution under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP).
While the UDRP is clearly the "go-to" legal tool for trademark owners pursuing cybersquatters, some disputes are about larger — or different — issues than the UDRP was designed to address.
As stated in WIPO's Overview:
Depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, and irrespective of whether the parties may also be engaged in court litigation, in some instances (e.g., complex business or contractual disputes) panels have tended to deny the case not on the UDRP merits but on the narrow grounds that the dispute between the parties exceeds the relatively limited "cybersquatting" scope of the UDRP, and would be more appropriately addressed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
'Contractual and Trademark Dispute'
A UDRP panel addressed this exact issue in a dispute over the domain name . The UDRP complaint was filed by the owner of the trademark TONINO LAMBORGHINI "in numerous countries all over the world" for use in connection with, among other things, cell phones, according to the decision.
The respondent in the case claimed, "that he is an official dealer of the Complainant through an authorization letter from the Complainant's licensee."
While the panel had no problem finding the disputed domain name confusingly similar to the TONINO LAMBORGHINI trademark (the first element of the UDRP), the panel had concerns about even addressing the second and third elements of the UDRP (that is, whether the registrant had rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; and whether the registrant registered and used the domain name in bad faith).
As a result, the panel wrote:
The Panel notes that this dispute seems to be part of a contractual and trademark dispute that is outside the scope of the Policy. In this case, it is not clear whether or not the Respondent was an authorized agent of the Complainant or of a licensee of the Complainant when it registered the disputed domain name in 2015. The Respondent has submitted several contract and authorization letters which do not clarify this. It is beyond the scope of the Policy to interpret agreements between the Parties or to determine whether they have breached the Complainant's trademark.
Therefore, the panel dismissed the complaint, allowing the registrant to retain the domain name.
Complex Facts, Breaches of Contract, and Business Relationships
The conclusion in the LAMBORGHINI case — that the dispute was "beyond the scope" or "outside the scope" of the UDRP — has appeared repeatedly in UDRP decisions through the years.
For example:
A very early UDRP decision raised interesting issues, including a discussion about two criminal cases in Estonia related to a possible unlawful transfer of the disputed domain name . "Under these proceedings the complete correct facts can probably not be proved," the panel wrote, also noting that it "cannot know on this record the full extent of the relationship between the parties ." Thus, the panel allowed the registrant to keep the domain name because the "case is much more complex, factual and judicial than the domain name disputes suitably solved under the Policy."
." Thus, the panel allowed the registrant to keep the domain name because the "case is much more complex, factual and judicial than the domain name disputes suitably solved under the Policy." In another early UDRP decision, involving the domain name , the respondent was actually a co-founder of the company that filed the UDRP complaint and purchased the domain name "on the Complainant's behalf" but in the respondent's own name. The dispute arose after the respondent resigned. "[T]his is not a garden-variety cybersquatting case," the panel wrote. "In fact, it is not a cybersquatting case at all. Rather, this appears to be a breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty dispute between former partners."
between former partners." Similarly, another UDRP decision referred to "a long term business relationship" between the complainant and respondent, which "has evidently now unravelled," resulting in other (non-UDRP) proceedings between the parties. So, the panel terminated the case, writing: "In light of the existence of the parallel litigation, and the complex factual matrix which underlies the dispute and which has not been fully disclosed, the Panel finds that this Complaint is beyond the scope of the Policy at the present time."
Think Before Filing
Of course, just because a dispute is complicated doesn't necessarily mean that it's not suitable for the UDRP. But, as these cases demonstrate, when the issues between the parties involve criminal allegation, contractual disputes or other litigation, a UDRP panel may decline to issue a decision on the merits of the case. (The parties may then choose to go to court for a legal resolution.)
Importantly, complicated cases of any kind are typically not appropriate for disputes under the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS), a different dispute policy that applies primarily to the "new" gTLDs. The URS itself makes clear that it is "not intended for use in any proceedings with open questions of fact, but only clear cases of trademark abuse."
A trademark owner thinking about filing a UDRP complaint should consider whether the issues in dispute are "beyond the scope" of the policy, to ensure that its time and financial resources are spent in the proper forum.

Farmhands and doctors alike were called to service on the West Side when America joined the fight during World War I.
It was a time before frozen food, the electric guitar and credit cards, which may make it seem more like an ancient civilization than the country we call home.
But many of the memories from the war live on in West Baton Rouge. People like Ellis Gautier grew up hearing stories about the war from their family and community. Gautier, an Army veteran himself and a founding member of the WBR Genealogical Association, spoke of the war's impacts on the West Side at a lunchtime lecture at the West Baton Rouge Museum.
West Baton Rouge Parish's agricultural industry was largely devastated after the Civil War and had only begun to rebuild in the early 1900s when the war started, Gautier said. Many former slaves stayed on plantations as farmhands and sharecroppers as the agricultural industry was rebuilt.
When America entered the war in 1917, many farmhands registered for the draft and enlisted in the military. Many men lost their lives soon after enlisting when they contracted the Spanish Flu, according to Gautier and the WBR Genealogical Society's book “Soldiers of West Baton Rouge in World War I.”
The Spanish Flu claimed more lives than the Bubonic plague in medieval ages, Gautier said.
The number of men who never returned from the war had unfavorable effects on the West Side, especially on the agricultural industry.
“Everything was done by hand,” Gautier said. “Farming required a lot of labor.”
Although most men who enlisted were farmers, men from white-collar backgrounds in West Baton Rouge also registered for the draft, according to documents from the National Archives.
The West Side had four doctors at the time, three of whom have records of registering for the draft. None of the doctors asked for an exemption from service, according to the National Archives.
Dr. Paul Bernard Landry was the only one of the doctors from the West Side called to serve. His daughter, Joyce, attended the lunchtime lecture where Gautier presented historical information.
The West Side was also home for some distinguished military men who served in World War I. John Hill Carruth grew up on a plantation on the West Side and at 14 years old enrolled in Louisiana State University. After earning a degree in civil engineering, Carruth went to West Point. Carruth's brother, George Carruth, also attended West Point for one year before coming back to Port Allen, Gautier said. Both George and John Carruth had distinguished military careers, and George was often seen riding around Port Allen in his old truck, Gautier said.
Upon cleaning out George Carruth's house after his passing, Gautier found a peculiar flowerpot– George Carruth's doughboy hat from his service in World War I.
Gautier donated the doughboy hat to the West Baton Rouge Museum to be used in its two-part exhibition, “Over Here & Over There: Americans at Home and Abroad in World War I.”
Another distinguished military man with ties to the parish is known as “the mystery soldier” in Gautier's book. With seemingly no connection to the West Side, Maj. Gen. Walter Henry Gordon, was signed up to receive benefits in West Baton Rouge, likely by a friend or relative, Gautier said.
Gordon's mother was from New York and his father from Georgia, but he was born in Mississippi in 1863.
He enrolled in West Point from St. Landry Parish and after graduating fought in the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection. He commanded infantry in China and the 10th Brigade in France. Following the war he received the Distinguished Service Medal and retired as the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army. Yet, his ties to the West Side and registration for post-war benefits here remains a mystery.
The West Baton Rouge Museum will continue to explore the impacts of World War I with another lunchtime lecture, “World War I in the Air: America Joins the Fight!” on Thursday, Dec. 7, presented by Gary Ethridge.
The museum will also host two more Saturday reading and discussions, hosted by history scholars, Dr. Karl Roider and Dr. Paul Paskoff to explore the continuing relevance of the war by reading, discussing, and sharing insights into the writings of Americans who experienced it.

The following essay was submitted to The Hockey Writers by Calvin White in response to our earlier piece, “Why the Blues Should Sign Jaromir Jagr,” written by our own James Gaughan.
While non-sports fans will not care, nor even know about, NHL legend Jaromir Jagr's so-far-failing quest to play another NHL season in which he will turn 46 years old, and sports fans will have a restricted view that it is a “hockey” stalemate, perhaps there is a deeper societal issue at play.
Currently, we are all hyper-alerted to how racism, sexism, and identity discrimination emerges, and the raucous denunciations are quick to result. Maybe with Jagr's plight, we are watching a clear example of ageism. And perhaps, a bit of ethnocentric discrimination.
Jaromir Jagr's Worth
Jagr is, and has been, a phenomenon. He continuously garners terms like legendary, ageless wonder, incredible, and exemplary. No one disputes his level of physical fitness and his attitude to game preparation. With the second highest number of career points in NHL history, he is acknowledged as a certain first ballot Hall of Famer.
This past season he scored 16 goals and played all 82 games while having to play with a variety of line-mates due to injuries to his normal ones. The previous season he scored 27 goals in 79 games. The past two seasons his plus/minus is positive, which means he has been on the ice for more goals for his team than against. Stats show his puck possession is strong, and all commentators mention how difficult it is to get the puck from him due to his lower body strength and his experience. He seldom misses games from injury.
This past season, he made sports highlight reels with a “wow” play in which he stole the puck behind the net from 25-year-old defenceman, Josh Manson, of the Anaheim Ducks and in several nifty moves scored an unassisted goal.
So, obviously, the stellar Jagr can still play at an elite level. In addition, all reports say that teammates like him, that he shares knowledge abundantly, that his attitude in the locker room is great and that he inspires. So, too does he draw fans.
Ageism Hurting Jagr
Yet, as the off-season moves closer to training camps, no teams are making offers to sign him? Lesser players, by anyone's assessment, are being signed and at rewarding salaries and contract term lengths, while Jagr is not getting a sniff. Something is amiss! And it's the age factor. Not age as in can't do it hurts the team, but in age as age.
Simply put, it bothers NHL coaches and management that someone so old can compete so well in a “young man's” game that is riding on the impending glories of young superstars, Connor McDavid -20 years old and Auston Matthews – 19 years old. It's bad for the brand, so to speak.
This last season, for instance, a reporter asked Jagr if he would have a 45-year-old playing on the number one line of the Kladno team that he owns in the Czech premier league. Such a disrespectful question clearly embarrassed him, and he replied that coaches make line decisions. The question was ageist because it directly implied there was something wrong with a 45-year-old being in such prominence. Imagine if the reporter had asked a black or gay player the same question.
As well, many in the coaching and management circles are former players. It is not a stretch to wonder if it galls them that Jagr can keep playing at such a high level and that he wants to keep playing rather than “bowing out gracefully” which they all were forced to do because of diminishing skills or desire. In other words, somewhere in their psyche do they feel he makes them look less than?
Plus, Jagr is a Czech. He's not a good old Canadian boy or an American cousin, but a “foreigner”, a Euro. And according to on-air comments by TSN analyst and former goalie, Jamie McLennan who once played with Jagr, he's a fantastic player but a “strange sort of dude”. How does all of that sit with the North American old boy's network?
Jagr Deserving of a Spot
Now the one seemingly reasonable explanation offered for the reluctance to sign a player capable of putting up 20 goals and adding to team chemistry and leadership is that Jagr is too slow. Throughout the past season, this was never brought up, but each of his record breaking feats were and the fan adulation was.
Every team has a mix of faster and slower players. The too slow argument would only hold ice if other teams had no skaters of Jagr's speed on their top two lines.
Similarly, the refrain that “we're going younger” sounds good at first glance but falls apart when reality shows that every team wants players who can score 20 goals and not have a negative plus/minus. Everyone also knows that youth does not guarantee year after year performance. No one disagrees that Jagr's pedigree and track record indicate that a 20 goal level in the coming season is a fairly good bet especially with consistent line mates.
A team may still come to its senses and snap up the legend, but right now the only conclusion to be drawn is that there is a distinct prejudice against age.

Television Broadcasts (TVB), Hong Kong's leading free to air broadcaster, will up its game in the overseas over-the-top video sector. It will launch a new platform in Thailand and strengthen bundling plans with telco and hardware manufacturers.
TVB is partnering with MVTV in Thailand to create a Thai version of TVB Anywhere, the Hong Kong broadcasting giant's international OTT platform available outside of Hong Kong and mainland China.
TVBI's general manager Desmond Chan told Variety that the platform will feature TVB's original content dubbed into the Thai language. It will also act as a content aggregator, offering over 100 Thai channels. The new package is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2018. The platform will further expand to other Southeast Asian territories including Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, said Chan.
TVB Anywhere was relaunched last year. It now claims more than 100,000 subscribers, after selling the service into Macau through a bundling deal with Macanese telco CTM.
Chan said the TVB Anywhere app will be preinstalled on tablet computers manufactured by Alco Electronics, with subscription fees covered by the retail price of the tablets. The tablets are to be exported to North America and may be launched in the second quarter, he said.
TVB has no plans to launch an OTT platform in mainland China. Its Jade and Pearl channels are accessible in the Guangdong region, and its original content is licensed to mainland OTT platforms via TVBC, a joint venture with CMC and SMG.
ESPN released its first official Football Power Index for the 2018 season. The Chargers came in at No. 11 on the list, which is great for a team that is starting to gain a bit more respect nationally.
The rankings are really detailed. They take into account offense, defense, quarterback, backup QB, returning starters and Vegas Sportsbook numbers to tabulate their system. The Vegas projections are already one of the most accurate ways to gauge next-year success, but ESPN modifies those numbers with personnel turnover in mind.
The FPI also predicts postseason chances, and their findings might be intriguing to Bolt fans. They mark the team at 8.7 wins in 2018. They also predict a 54 percent chance of reaching the playoffs, 37 percent chance of clinching the division, eight percent chance of making the Super Bowl, and a four percent chance of winning the Super Bowl.
They see Los Angeles as having the highest odds to win the AFC West. The Chiefs have a 33 percent chance. The Raiders have a 20 percent chance, and the Broncos are looking outside in at 10 percent.
What is even more impressive is that only the Patriots and the Steelers are the only teams above L.A. in the AFC. They are very confident in the team that is on the rise after bolstering their roster this offseason.
The Chargers have all of their defensive starters locked in with the addition of safety Derwin James, edge rusher Uchenna Nwosu, defensive tackle Justin Jones, and linebacker Kyzir White.
Despite losing tight end Hunter Henry, they will also get several playmakers back on offense, including quarterback Philip Rivers, wide receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, running backs Melvin Gordon and Austin Ekeler, the second-round selection from 2017, offensive guard Forrest Lamp and the newest member in the trenches, center Mike Pouncey.

KARACHI - Another heatwave hits Karachi on Tuesday as the highest temperature was recorded 41.2 degree Celsius, making it very difficult for the citizens as they were experiencing hot winds instead of usual cool sea winds.
Pakistan Metrological Department had earlier issued a warning that new heat wave might hit the city from Tuesday and the temperature may rise up to 43 degree celsius. The scorching heat might continue to add miseries of Karachiites till Thursday. The department said that currently there was no chance of rain in the city.
Besides Karachi, the situation was not different in other parts of the province as the mercury touched 49.5 in Moen-Jo-Daro, 41 in Badin, 44 in Chhor, 49 in Dadu, 45 in Hyderabad, 47.5 in Jacobabad, 49 in Larkana, 41.5 in Mirpurkhas, 42.5 in Mithi, 48.5 in Nawabshah, 48 in Padidan, 47.5 in Rohri, 48 in Sukkur, 46 in Sukrand, 41 in Thatta.
Owing to prevailing humid weather, different nongovernmental organisations, city administration, Sindh police, Rangers and others have established heatstroke camps in different parts of the city. The affected people are being provided first aid at these camps. Besides, some individuals have started to shower water on the passerby who go out in the scorching heat. The experts urged the citizens to avoid unnecessary go out as long as they can and seek shelter whenever go outside. They said that the citizens could save themselves by remaining hydrated and wearing loose and light coloured clothes.
It was pertinent to mention here that it was not the first time that the city was experiencing heatwave as same sort of condition was witnessed last week as well when the Edhi Foundation had claimed that at least 64 people died in three days The head of Edhi Foundation, Faisal Edhi had confirmed the deaths from the scorching heat quoting relatives of the deceased, saying that that at least 160 bodies were brought to their Korangi and Sohrab Goth morgues during last three days – out of which 64 had been confirmed as the victims of heatstroke.
However on the other hand, the Sindh government bitterly opposed the assertion, as then health secretary Fazalullah Pechuho had said that no case of heatstroke death had been reported at the city hospitals.

KARACHI - Social activist and advocate Jibran Nasir was released after a brief detention at the Frere police station after he allegedly attempted to block the vehicle of a senior member of the judiciary here on Monday. Frere Police took Jibran into custody near Karachi Club and kept him detained for about one hour at the station.
Jibran is contesting the upcoming general election from National Assembly Constituency NA-247 and Provincial Assembly PS-111 as an independent candidate.
“I was forcibly taken into custody by the police personnel who were protocol officer of a judge,” alleged Nasir in a video message on social media. He claimed that protocol vehicle of pushed his vehicle and in result it collided with the footpath.
“Responding to act I tried to stop the police personnel but in return I received blow with guns chamber from the protocol official,” he added.
Nasir further informed that he submitted an application seeking inquiry of the incident at the Frere Police station. “I want to know under what authority judge ordered to practice such act,” said annoyed Nasir in the message. He also confirmed that after detention of an hour he was released. On the other hand, police said that Jibran Nasir was brought station but after verification he was allowed to leave. Police further said that investigation is being carried out to find the real facts of the incident.
PESHAWAR: Social media reports of a police official insinuating an Islamia College University (ICU) teacher earlier was arrested on charges of possessing drugs were denied by the city police on Wednesday.
ICU assistant professor Bashir Ahmed was arrested by the police earlier on Tuesday and found 20 grams of meth in his possession. In contrast, later rumors began spreading on the social media that the academician had a rift with a police official after a traffic accident.
In addition, a city police spokesperson declined the reports saying police found ammunition and drugs from the teacher's belongings and acted against him under the law.
He stated SHO Regi Model Town Shahinshah Khan had arrested the accused at a snap-checking point and a search of the professor's transport had resulted in 20 grams of meth, 50 grams of hashish and two pistols and rounds being found.
He said after the arrest reports started flooding on the social media, pointing fingers at the police officer of insinuating the teacher being involved in the drugs case. He said the suspected was arrested earlier in 2001 under the 16 MPO and other cases twice.
Moreover, the ICU Teaching Staff Association executive body held an emergency meeting and declared the episode as unfortunate.
A statement issued here said a singular person's actions should not be associated with an institution and the profession.
“Media trial of the blamed on the basis of allegations should at once be stopped,” it said. It also requested an independent inquiry of the episode.

Cindy Mthembu, 27, and her sister, Thando, 20, sit on a threadbare couch in a lopsided garage outside Glebelands R Block. The sheet of corrugated zinc behind them is peppered with bullet holes, testament to the wave of violence that in recent years has plagued this apartheid era hostel on the fringes of Durban.
Their father, William Mthembu, was murdered. An estimated 108 Glebelands residents, most of them men, have been murdered in politically linked violence since 2014. Some residents claim the number of victims is much higher.
Cindy recalls how her father was shot dead in the middle of the day on 12 September 2015. Her voice shakes slightly, and while she speaks, her sister stares at the litter-strewn ground in front of her.
Cindy and Thando had moved from their family home in the rural Eastern Cape to live with their father and pursue tertiary education in Durban. William Mthembu worked odd jobs. After his death, the two sisters could not cover the rent without the help of their father's salary. Thando, as the youngest sibling, was forced to put her studies on hold, perhaps indefinitely.
A friend of Mthembu said, “It is particularly painful that now one of his daughters can't afford to study. He always said he'd do anything for them to get an education so that their life would be better than his.”
“It is still very hard for us,” Cindy told GroundUp, “because we are still sharing the same house that we used to share with our father when he was alive. We want to move out but we don't have money for somewhere else.”

The plight of the Mthembu siblings is shared by many women in Glebelands, a formerly male-only hostel for migrant labourers. Its population has swelled to more than 20,000, with most residents housed in cramped, shared rooms across approximately 48 four-story red brick blocks.
Situated in Umlazi township about 17km south of Durban city centre, Glebelands was built in the 1960s as part of the apartheid government's push to meet the labour needs of a rapidly industrialising city. Black migrant workers, many of them from the Eastern Cape, moved to Glebelands to work in Durban's manufacturing and shipping industries.
Though an increasing number of women joined their husbands and fathers at the former hostel since the end of apartheid, it remains a male-dominated community. According to Vanessa Burger, an independent activist who has been heavily involved in Glebelands since 2014, most women in the hostel are unemployed. The spate of killings has left widows, orphans and even extended families bereft of their sole breadwinner.
Mamthina Pina, 46, followed her husband, Themba, to Glebelands in 1996. Themba was shot in the head on his way to work at a local butchery on 5 June 2015. Pina says that he'd been receiving death threats over the phone for two days before the shooting; he'd also been hospitalised following a knife attack earlier in 2015.
She says that her husband, a block committee member, had become embroiled in a disagreement with the local ward councillor, Robert Mzobe, who had been widely accused of dividing the community and not consulting them on developments in the area. Many Glebelands residents told GroundUp that the violence in the hostel originally stems from a rift between an ANC faction that supports Mzobe and one that opposes him.
Photo: Mamthina Pina's husband Themba was shot on 5 June 2015
An analysis of the Glebelands deaths by Burger shows that many of the victims were linked to block structures that opposed Mzobe. According to a 2016 report by violence monitor Mary De Haas, “From the outset, police were accused of being complicit with the ANC faction supporting the councillor.” The councillor has denied these claims. However, a Glebelands-based SAPS officer was arrested in December last year in connection with a number of the assassinations. (Mzobe did not want to comment for this article.)
Since her husband died, Pina has sold vetkoeks and packets of Niknaks out of the kitchen of her small, dank, third-floor hostel unit, which she shares with two of her children and two young grandchildren. She says she's struggling to support the family on her own.
“It's very difficult because my husband was the one who was looking after the kids and me,” she says. “I knew I had someone I could speak to whenever I felt that I had a problem.”
Pina says that her 15-year-old son has been hit particularly hard by his father's death. Shortly after the shooting, he threw himself out of his bedroom window in an attempt to take his own life. He landed on soft ground and suffered minor injuries.
Pina told GroundUp that she has never heard from SAPS concerning any arrests for her husband's murder. “I just notice that people continue to die. Even if there are any arrests, it will not take away the pain of losing my husband.”
In a 2016 report that looked into the violence at Glebelands, outgoing Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found that the residents of the hostel had been repeatedly failed by the police, as well as eThekwini Muncipality and the Department of Social Development. (Here is an updated 2017 version of the report.)
“The violence that wracked the Glebelands Hostel is reported to have produced many victims who required material relief of distress like food parcels and non-material forms of relief like counselling and mobilisation and co-ordination of resources for which the department's policy on relief of distress makes provision. Sadly, the department woefully failed to fulfil its responsibilities in this regard,” Madonsela's report said.
The Department for Social Development has repeatedly denied such accusations, claiming that a lack of contact details has made it difficult for social workers to track down and help victims. However, in just three days GroundUp managed to get hold of seven families who had lost their breadwinner, including some in the Eastern Cape. All of them said they had received no support from the Department of Social Development.
According to a Glebelands community leader who asked to be unnamed because of concerns for his safety, “It pains us to live in an environment where we are surrounded by orphans and widows and no one is assisting them. They don't know who to cry out to for help.”
In 2016, KZN Premier Willies Mchunu set up the R15 million Moerane Commission of Inquiry to investigate political killings in the province, including those occurring at Glebelands. Last year, Burger told the commission that the hostel was a “reservoir of hitmen”, some of whom she claims were involved in the targeted killing of block committee leaders including Themba Pina.
But women relatives of alleged hitmen have also suffered as a result of the continual violence at Glebelands. Nqobile Hlophe's brother, Bongani, who has been linked to many of the killings in Glebelands, was gunned down in his room in Block 52 in October 2015. Another of Nqobile's brothers, Wonderboy, was arrested along with six other alleged Glebelands' hitmen in December 2017 and is currently awaiting trial. Sanele, a third Hlophe brother, was recently released from jail after three years.
“Our family has been through hell in the last three years,” Hlophe told GroundUp. “It's been a very painful experience having to deal with so much loss.”
The morning after Bongani's death, Hlophe and her 70-year-old mother, who also lost her husband some years previously, travelled more than 150km from KwaDlangezwa to clean Bongani's blood off the floor of his unit. Sanele was arrested on various charges the same day.
Despite all of the allegations against Bongani, Nqobile says that the family “never really got answers as to why he was killed.”
“Sometimes it's just like that. Men are unable to tell you about certain things,” says Ntombikayise Jamjam, 37, who came from the Eastern Cape to join her husband in Glebalands in 2003. Her husband was shot and killed on 12 September 2014. Jamjam says she still doesn't know why.
Jamjam is unemployed and, although she receives a child benefit grant for her four-year-old daughter, she says it is not enough for them to live on. Jamjam says she has never heard anything from the police concerning any suspects in her husband's murder.
Two SAPS investigating officers assigned to the Glebelands murders, who spoke to GroundUp on condition of anonymity, say that their investigations have been routinely hampered by the unwillingness of witnesses to come forward. “People are afraid. They know that they could also be eliminated if they give testimony,” one of the officers said. The officers conceded that the lack of prosecutions for crimes committed in Glebelands has further fuelled the violence.
Jamjam, like the other women GroundUp interviewed for this story, has little hope that there will ever be any justice for the damage caused to her family. Most of the women had never heard of the Moerane Commission. De Haas, like many outside observers, has expressed doubt that the commission's findings will have any tangible impact for the women of Glebelands.
Meanwhile, Jamjam says that her young daughter still looks expectantly at the front door every evening, waiting for her father to return home. “It's like it has still not sunk in that he's dead.” DM

For President Trump, the campaign never ends.
He is on the stump, in full campaign mode now. He is intent on nationalizing this fall's congressional elections. As Steve Bannon put it, “Donald Trump will be on every ballot.” The choice will be for Trump or against.
Trump is even prepared to scar thousands of toddlers and infants—many of them permanently—by separating them from their parents at the border in order to frame that choice. The question this fall won't be simply about who controls the House or the Senate or the statehouses. It will be a choice of what kind of country, what kind of people we are.
Trump has and will put the question directly, brutally and inescapably. He isn't really interested in policy. His lack of knowledge and attention is infamous, even among his own aides. He isn't really interested forging a majority in Congress and actually passing reforms.
After creating the human horror at our border, he said only Congress could change it. When it became apparent that Americans couldn't abide torturing children, he changed it overnight, and told Congress they were wasting their time trying to deal with immigration policy before the next election. He wants immigration to be a threat, an issue, a club for the election, not something addressed by a bipartisan compromise.
Immigration flows into this country are down. The record long economic recovery that began under President Barack Obama has driven down unemployment. It is hard to argue that immigration is still about the threat of those people taking our jobs.
Trump uses immigration to rouse racial fear; immigrants “infest” our country, he charges. They are criminals, rapists, murderers and gang members. Democrats, he slanders, want open borders. Nancy Pelosi wants to open the country to MS-15 gang members.
That these are lies and libels is irrelevant. Trump is using the same scurrilous tactics made famous in the Jim Crow South—paint “those people,” the other, as a fearsome threat to rouse fears and gain support. It was ugly then and it is grotesque now.
It was effective in the old South; it remains to be seen if it will work again in today's America. But that's the gamble that Trump is making, and he will stick to it. Trump will ensure that this will be one of the most vile and poisonous election campaigns in memory.
Trump is on a rampage on immigration and posturing on trade to reinforce his biggest con, that he somehow is a populist champion for working people. The reality, of course, is much different. He's provided the bumptious cover for the traditional Republican agenda for corporations and the rich. His administration's major accomplishment—the tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the rich and the corporations—is already unpopular.
Dismay will spread as Republicans use the deficits the tax cut exploded to justify cuts in basic security programs—Medicare and Medicaid, health care, food stamps, investments in schools, and more.
Meanwhile, the administration's claim to be cleaning out the swamp turns out to mean allowing lobbyists to savage protections for workers, consumers and the environment. This isn't a “populist agenda.” It is a plutocrat's agenda, with a populist sales pitch and Trump as the lead huckster.
Most of this is about turnout in what are traditionally low-turnout, off-year elections. Trump wants to rouse his base. He believes that the politics of fear, featuring poisonous, racially charged libels and slanders directed at immigrants will turn more supporters out than off. The tax cuts consolidate support among the affluent that tend to vote; the venom rouses and distracts those whose interests are being trampled.
Trump does make the stakes this fall clear. If Republicans—almost universally cowed into echoing the president—sustain their majorities, we'll get more of the same: action that serves the rich; rhetoric that divides the rest. If instead Trump's foul politics rouse more opposition than support, the rebuke will attest to what kind of country we are.
All of us are complex. We have our better angels, our ideals and aspirations; we harbor fears and anxieties. Good leaders can appeal to our better angels, bring the country together and unleash energy. Dark leaders can evoke horrors, drive the country apart and unleash hatred.
Trump has chosen the latter, over and over, in greater and greater extremes. In the fall, citizens will have to choose: Is that the kind of leader we want? Is that the kind of nation we are?
Donald Trump may find out that we are a better people than he assumes.

LENOX - Imagine if Jimi Hendrix went straight to the guitar solo in "All Along the Watchtower."
Or if Jimmy Page did the same thing in Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven."
Or if Page's bandmate John Bonham had done the same and simply played the mother of all drum solos in "Moby Dick."
It would actually probably be pretty amazing.
Maybe that's why Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto remains such a stunning composition more than a century and a half later.
The concerto is basically just one, long, extended violin tour-de-force. Technically, Mendelssohn's composition has three movements and an entire orchestra as a backing band. But it's the solo violinist who grabs the spotlight right from the very first note and rarely lets go of the reigns during this gallop to the finish line.
On Sunday afternoon, that soloist was Joshua Bell. No stranger to the spotlight, Bell delivered a dazzling performance of Mendelssohn's masterpiece with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Lahav Shani, who made his BSO conducting debut Sunday.
Along with Yo Yo Ma, who performed last Sunday afternoon at Tanglewood, no one seems to attract a huge crowd like Bell. I'm not surprised.
Even though Bell is 49 years old, he still has an impish quality and youthful energy that shines through in his performances. He also brings a passionate, subtle approach to every piece he plays.
On Sunday, Bell brought out the best in Mendelssohn's vibrant violin concerto. Afterwards, the audience gave Bell a well-deserved standing ovation. In return, Bell gave the audience an encore, a short violin solo by Bach.
Sunday's BSO concert also featured two other outstanding pieces, the overture to Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" and Schubert's Symphony in C, often referred to as Schubert's 9th Symphony or "The Great" symphony.
Mozart's brief, bright overture was the first piece on the program and set just the right tone for a perfect, summer afternoon.
After Mendelssohn's scintillating violin concerto and a brief intermission, the BSO performed Schubert's final symphony.
Schubert's music has been featured throughout the summer at Tanglewood and will be the focus of a chamber concert on Thursday night at Tanglewood featuring Yo Yo Ma and pianist Emanuel Ax.
On Sunday afternoon, the BSO and Shani delivered an understated performance of Schubert's subtle, powerful piece, which features several strong solos, including many in the brass and wind section of the orchestra.
Overall, another great Sunday afternoon concert featuring some of the world's best musicians.

Want to go to the Super Bowl? You'll likely need an inside connection and a sizable chunk of change. Tickets for this year's installment of the big game, scheduled to be played Sunday in Minneapolis, will likely be the most expensive tickets in Super Bowl history, with the average price on the resale market on pace to smash the previous record of $9,722.
But 51 years ago, when the NFL and the rival AFL were preparing to face off in the very first Super Bowl, fans could request tickets simply by contacting their local team. And the tickets cost only 12 bucks.
That's the picture that emerges from some letters that were sent by Denver Broncos season-ticket holders in 1966. The letters, along with some other Super Bowl paperwork, were kept in the files of former Broncos general manager Jim Burris. Burris died in 2012, but his files were later acquired via an online auction by Tom Jacobsen, a collector specializing in Broncos memorabilia, who recently discovered the letters. They offer a rare glimpse into the inner workings of a pro football team on the cusp of the Super Bowl era.
"The files are like a time capsule," Jacobsen said. "It's amazing that Burris kept all of this stuff."
Burris' son Bob, who lives in the Kansas City area, confirmed that he had put the files up for bid. "My dad held on to everything, and I ended up with it after he died," he said. "At one point an auction house called me up, and I ended up giving them some stuff on consignment because, you know, why not? We never thought there was anything of particular value there. But it's fun to hear that you've found some interesting stuff in the files, especially because I was the ball boy for those Broncos teams. I was about 14 years old at the time."
Jim Burris ran the Broncos for only two seasons -- 1965 and 1966 -- but that turned out to be a very eventful period in pro football history. The NFL and AFL announced their merger plans in June of '66, and it was decided that the two leagues' respective champions would face each other for the first time. The game was slated to be played at the Los Angeles Coliseum, and although it was officially billed as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt began referring to it informally as the Super Bowl, and many others soon picked up on the name (which didn't become the official moniker until Super Bowl III, two seasons later). One of the most interesting things about the correspondence in the Burris files is seeing how the term "Super Bowl" had already entered common parlance before the first such game was played.
As the 1966 season wound down, the game became an object of curiosity among fans, including one Thomas E. Ross, a Denver dentist and Broncos season-ticket holder who sent a handwritten letter, dated Dec. 5, 1966, to Donald Smith, the team's director of public relations:
Tom Jacobsen
Dear Mr. Smith: As a loyal season ticket holder and member of Denver Broncos Quarterback Club [a local booster club] for seven long years, I have suffered thru good and bad. Please help relieve my suffering by obtaining six (6) tickets to the "Super Bowl" to be played in L.A. Sincerely, Tom Ross
Smith wrote back to Ross three days later, as follows:
Tom Jacobsen
Dear Dr. Ross: After receiving your letter requesting tickets to the Super Bowl, I called [team owner] Mr. Gerry Phipps to find out if he had heard what the situation would be as far as tickets are concerned. At this stage he does not know how many tickets will be available to this club and, therefore, we are just not in a position to make any definite commitments. We do know that each club will get a small number of tickets, but we do not know whether this will be 20 or 200, or just what number. Mr. Phipps did say that he felt we would have to limit the number of tickets to any one individual to two because he was sure that whatever our allotment finally turns out to be, will be very small. I am sorry I cannot be more definite, but this is the situation as it now stands. Certainly we will keep your letter in our file and, if there is anything that can be done, we will be most happy to help you. Sincerely, Donald R. Smith
At least two fans took a more proactive approach by phoning Burris, the GM, and then following up with reminder letters. One of them was R.D. Hermes, vice president of a local bank, who sent a quick note to Burris on Dec. 23:
Tom Jacobsen
Dear Jim: Confirming our telephone conversation of today and a previous discussion in October, we would appreciate the opportunity to purchase two tickets to the World Championship Game on January 15. One of these tickets is for Don Strait and the other for myself. We appreciate your assistance in obtaining these tickets. Thank you. Yours very truly, R.D. Hermes
A similar note was sent a few days later from the offices of a Denver physician named F.R. Lauvetz:
Tom Jacobsen
Dear Jim: I would certainly appreciate any direct or indirect help you might give me in obtaining two tickets for the Super Bowl, as per our telephone conversation. Thank you very much for your courtesies. Sincerely, F.R. Lauvetz, M.D.
It's not clear whether Ross, Hermes or Lauvetz ended up attending the game, or even whether they're still alive. Attempts to find them or their families during the preparation of this article were unsuccessful. (If you have information on any of them, please get in touch.) In any case, they weren't the only ones to request tickets. The file also contains several lists -- some typewritten and some handwritten -- showing other people who wanted to attend the big game.
Tom Jacobsen
Tom Jacobsen
Meanwhile, the Broncos were still trying to figure out their ticket allotment. The situation was spelled out in a letter team owner Gerald Phipps sent to AFL president Milt Woodard on Dec. 20:
Tom Jacobsen
Dear Milt: This refers to your letter of December 16 regarding tickets for the Super Bowl. First, we definitely want our full allocation of 200 tickets. These should be sent to Mr. James Burris at Bears Stadium, West 20th and Decatur Streets, Denver, Colorado 80211. Secondly, Mr. Bob Bowie of the Denver Post placed an order with the N.F.L. office the day following the announcement of the inter-league agreement last June for 200 tickets in his name. Mr. Bowie called me this morning and advised me that he had word from the N.F.L. office that these tickets would be added to our allocation of 200 and that a total of 400 would be sent to the Broncos. The N.F.L. could not at this time advise Mr. Bowie whether these tickets would be the $12.00 tickets, the $10.00 tickets, or a mixture of the two. In any event, our 200 at $12.00 plus Mr. Bowie's 200 should also be sent to Mr. Burris. Best wishes for the Season. Sincerely, Gerald K. Phipps
Ten days later, on Dec. 30, the Broncos received their basic allotment of 200 tickets, as evidenced by a receipt from the Los Angeles Rams (who were handling the ticket distribution because the game was being played at their home stadium, the Los Angeles Coliseum).
Tom Jacobsen
So who got those tickets? About half of them are accounted for on a list that was written on a Broncos envelope -- not exactly the most official-seeming document, but at least it was saved in the files. The list has a series of names, along with the number of tickets going to each person and the resulting payment owed, in multiples of $12. It seems likely that the envelope was used to hold the cash and checks that were used to pay for the tickets. This listing indicates that two tickets went to a "Dr. Ross," who is presumably Thomas Ross, the long-suffering dentist who had sent the handwritten letter:
Tom Jacobsen
It all seems rather haphazard and random, but that's part of the charm. From such humble beginnings emerged the corporate juggernaut that we now know as Super Bowl Sunday. Think about that as you watch the spectacle unfold this weekend -- especially if you paid thousands of dollars for one of the coveted tickets.

The Browns blew a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter and QB DeShone Kizer tossed an ill-advised interception in overtime in their 27-21 loss to the Packers. (0:52)
CLEVELAND -- The Cleveland Browns have only themselves to blame for squandering a 14-point fourth-quarter lead and losing for the 13th time in 13 games on Sunday.
In the litany of painful Browns defeats, this one will be remembered as especially bitter.
The Browns had so much going well. ESPN Analytics had their win probability at 95.9 percent at one point of the game, the highest percentage they've had all season. And the Browns led for 60.2 percent of the game's plays, the first time this season they've been over 50 percent.
DeShone Kizer was having his best game.

The defense had allowed the Green Bay Packers just seven points through three quarters.
And early in the fourth quarter, the Browns led by 14.
Yet they lost, inexplicably, improbably, illogically -- 27-21 in overtime.
“Another unfortunate event happens to us,” was the way Kizer described it.
Except the past two years the Browns have been living an unfortunate series of events that would be worthy of a series of kids' books had they not already been written (by the esteemed Lemony Snicket).
The Browns did themselves in during this loss with mistake after mistake. Most came in the fourth quarter, when it's time to win a game.
One defensive stop, one less offensive mistake, and the Browns would have erased the zero in their win column. Instead, they lamented their inability to finish and failure to come up with key plays at key times.
David Njoku dropped a third-down catch with 2 minutes, 59 seconds left that would have converted a first down and allow the Browns to run valuable time off the clock.
On the ensuing punt, the Browns let returner Trevor Davis weave his way through the initial wave of tacklers and escape for a 65-yard return.
That set up the Packers' game-tying touchdown with 17 seconds left, the second touchdown the defense gave up in the fourth quarter.
In overtime the Browns won the toss, got the ball and had third-and-2. Coach Hue Jackson called for a bunch of formation left, which left Josh Gordon one-on-one with Damarious Randall outside.
“I wanted to give our best player a chance to win on a one-on-one matchup,” Jackson said.
Kizer looked to Gordon, saw he was wrapped up by Randall -- the Browns thought Gordon was held; Gordon was not in the locker room to talk to the media -- and rolled right. He was pressured, then came back left. As he did, he saw Rashard Higgins spin away from coverage in the deep middle of the field.
Kizer planted and tried to throw to Higgins, who said he was five yards from any Green Bay defender. But Packers linebacker Clay Matthews caught up to Kizer as he threw and hit his arm. The ball was a fluttering duck high in the air and was intercepted to set up the game-losing touchdown.
Jackson and Kizer saw the play a little differently, with Kizer saying it was a touchdown had his arm not been hit.
“You strike up the band there and enjoy the first win of this year,” he said.
“DeShone, obviously, I think he saw Rashard in the middle of the field running, and you are running to your left and that is just hard to do, to throw the ball back across your body,” Jackson said.
The coach said Kizer should have just taken the sack or thrown the ball away and let the Browns play defense. Kizer thought he had a chance to win the game, and as he put his hands on his helmet as he walked off the field, he was thinking the game had been there to be won.
“You feel that if they make that play, you are going to come off and you are going to be rewarded for all the work that you put in,” Kizer said. “Even specifically in that play, you reverse the field and are making things happen. But obviously, another unfortunate event happens to us and unfortunately we are sitting here with another L.”
Kizer had a good game going until that turnover. He finished 20-of-28 for 214 yards with three touchdowns, but the Browns looked back at a lot of errors in critical times -- and calls they felt went against them.
In the first half, Gordon appeared to be interfered with at the goal line, but no flag was thrown. Add Njoku's non-catch, the punt return, then the defense's inability to stop Brent Hundley (265 yards and three TDs) as the Packers scored the game's final 20 points -- and the no-call on what many thought was a hold on the overtime interception.
There was plenty of shared responsibility.
In the postgame locker room, new general manager John Dorsey sat next to Kizer for several minutes, sharing some thoughts. It was evident Dorsey was stepping right into his new job.
The Browns, though, can't seem to take the steps necessary to get a win -- even when they play one of their better games of the season.
This 2011 photo shows a poison-tipped ballpoint pen and other tools firing poison bullets found on a failed North Korean assassin. Yonhap
A toxic spray is thought to have been used in the murder of Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.While the communist regime is often seen using poison to kill its “nuisances” abroad, it would be the first time that a spray has been used, if Kim's autopsy confirms it.Kim, 46, is reported to have fallen after two unidentified women sprayed his face with a liquid-like substance as he waited for his flight to Macau in an airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Kim, who was once North Korea's crown prince, has been under such a threat for at least five years, South Korean officials said.The communist regime is seen frequently using toxic materials to kill defectors in the South and South Korean human rights activists working overseas.In 2011, there was an attempt to kill rights activist Park Sang-hak, who headed a conservative civic organization that sent anti-communist leaflets to the North.A spy, who is only identified by his surname Ahn, was found to have received orders to kill Park from a spy in Mongolia.He was arrested with two poison guns, a poison pen with a toxic tip and the poisonous pills which could kill a victim in 3 second after ingested.The toxic pen contained neostigmine bromide in its tip, which can kill a victim with only as little as 10 milligrams.Ahn was caught by the nation's National Intelligence Service officials on Sept. 3 after he called out to Park on a subway station near Gangnam, Seoul, in an attempt to kill him with a poison pen.A South Korean pastor who helped North Korean defectors in Dandong, China was murdered in a toxic pen attack by a North Korean agent who has not been caught or identified. Patrick Kim gave out bibles and booklets that aroused anti-sentiments towards the North's late former leader Kim Jong-il and received warnings from the regime while he was alive.The North's methods of killing changed when they targeted Korean leaders or random civilians.A terrorist explosion occurred when former President Chun Doo-hwan visited the tomb of the late Myanmar's leader Aung San in 1983, which left 17 dead and 14 seriously injured. It was later found that three North Korean special forces officers implemented two explosives on top of the grave's roof.In November 1987, a year before the 1988 Olympics took place in Seoul, two North Korean spies also planted bombs on a Korean Airline plane to interfere with Seoul's preparation for the event. All 115 passengers on board died in the explosion.By Jo He-rim ( herim@heraldcorp.com

Robin Campillo's “BPM (Beats Per Minute),” France's foreign-language Oscar candidate, is leading nominations at the Lumieres Awards, Gaul's equivalent to the Golden Globes.
“BPM,” a sprawling and intense drama following French AIDS activists in the 1980's Paris, will be competing in six categories, including the best film, director, actor (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart), male newcomer (Arnaud Valois), script (Campillo and Philippe Mangeot) and score (Arnaud Rebotini). Since winning Cannes Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize, “BPM” has nabbed several prizes overseas, notably the New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC Critics Awards, as well as prizes at Chicago and San Sebastian film festivals.
Mathieu Amalric's “Barbara,” which world premiered at Cannes' Un Certain Regard, and Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache's contemporary dramedy “C'est La Vie” have garnered four Lumieres nominations, respectively, while Albert Dupontel's “Au revoir là-haut” and Alain Gomis's “Felicité,” winner of Berlin's Silver Bear, will each compete in three categories.
Juliette Binoche, the star of Claire Denis's “Bright Sunshine In,” will vie for the best actress award, along with Charlotte Gainsbourg for “La promesse de l'aube,” Emmanuelle Devos for “Numéro une,” Karin Viard for “Jalouse,” Hiam Abbass for “A Syrian Family” and Jeanne Balibar for “Barbara.”

‘Sudirsukt', a collection of Konkani poems written by Vishnu Surya Wagh, and targeting the Saraswat community, including women, with the use of extreme abusive words, has stirred up a hornet's nest, with the book now all set to win the Goa Konkani Akademi's annual literary award in the poetry category.
The 152-page book published in 2013 by Hema Naik of Volvoi-based Apurbai Prakashan publishing house, flouts the government guideline wherein a book considered for an award to be given from the public exchequer, should compulsorily refrain from making any casteist statements or using offensive and insulting language against a particular caste.
The news about the book being selected as the winner of the GKA award in the poetry category recently spilled out on the social media as one of the jury members, Sanjeev Verenkar, objected to the selection of the book for the award, and advocated vigorously against the decision of the other two jury members to support the book.
The director of Official Language Prakash Vazrikar, who is also the president of the Goa Konkani Akademi told ‘The Navhind Times' on Monday that the Akademi had not awarded its annual literary awards, for the past two years and therefore, started the exercise of selecting Konkani books for awards in various categories.
“The book by Wagh is just one of the entries, in one of the categories, and its fate is still sealed in the envelope,” he maintained, informing that one of the jury members had leaked the result before the official announcement, which is an unethical thing to do.
Vazrikar further said that the results of the GKA awards would be out only after the Model Code of Conduct, which is in force due to the August 23 assembly by-election, is lifted.
Meanwhile, Verenkar, himself a poet and writer of repute said that he had opposed the decision of his jury colleagues since he did not desire to be a party to the filth contained in the book, being selected for an award.
“I have never supported caste-based attacks, neither in my life, nor in my literature,” he added, pointing out that a book threatening the communal harmony in the state, should ideally not be given an award by an organisation, which runs on the government grants.
The leading Konkani protagonist and Sahitya Akademi Award winner Uday Bhembre, opposing awards to any literary work that threatens the social and communal fabric, and uses offensive language against any community, said that the government should form eligibility criteria for its literary awards, just as the Sahitya Akademi does.
“Awards mean encouragement to the writers and the content in their books,” Bhembre observed, pointing out, “If awards are given to something that is threat to the society, then that would directly mean encouragement to it, and nothing else.”
“In fact, such a thing could set a precedent, in turn bringing forth more such books and creating divide between communities, who lived in harmony till now,” the Konkani poet maintained, recalling that he himself as well as the Konkani litterateur, Ravindra Kelekar, in the past, wrote against few unacceptable traditions in some communities.
“However, we never carried out personal attack on the members of any community,” he noted.
Incidentally, ‘Sudirsukt', which was selected by two jury members, namely Nilba Khandekar, a Konkani writer, and Sonali Chodankar, who has no particular literary work to her credit, launches a harsh attack on the members of the Saraswat community, their traditions, rituals, and even their religious head, by using the filthiest language.
The poems paint Saraswats as those responsible for all the atrocities committed on various other local communities.
Even if one allows poetic licence and freedom of expression to the poet, the decision of a government-aided body to support a book of discriminatory nature does not auger well with the democratic system of considering all human beings at equal
level.
In fact, the Goa Konkani Akademi could land in trouble if a case is filed against it under Section 504 of the Indian Penal Code, which speaks about intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace, and Section 509 of the Act as regards use of word (words), gesture (gestures) or act (acts) intended to insult the modesty of a woman/ women.
Meanwhile, demand is growing to withdraw the book from all government libraries, including government as well as grant-in-aid school libraries around the state.
Washington
Former US officials who helped set up and run the notorious US military prison in Guantánamo Bay have warned President Donald Trump's administration about the economic consequence of keeping the facility open.
In a major foreign policy shift announced in Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday, the president signed an executive order to reverse former President Barack Obama's eight-year effort to close the facility in Cuba.
But those involved in establishing the detention center and running military tribunals there under former President George W. Bush warned that the move would be counterproductive, draining money, stretching the military and acting as a recruiting sergeant for terrorist groups around the world.
The former US officials and military lawyers warned that Trump risks repeating a $6 billion mistake by keeping it open.
“With respect to the Guantánamo military commissions, we have screwed them up so bad for so long that they are beyond redemption,” said retired Colonel Morris Davis, a former chief prosecutor of the military commissions set up in 2002.
“We've invested roughly $6.5 billion on detention in Guantánamo and what has it gotten us? We wasted our money. These guys could have been housed in federal prison for a fraction of the cost. We have over a thousand troops that are dedicated to the detention operations that could be used elsewhere. We have squandered our credibility around the world in these trials,” Davis said.
On Tuesday, Trump signed a new executive order to keep Guantánamo open. Trump said that new prisoners, including members of terrorist groups like Daesh (ISIL), will also be sent to the military facility.
Obama had pledged during his 2008 presidential campaign to close the military prison, but failed to fulfill his promise in the face of stiff opposition from the Congress.
Trump signs order to keep Guantánamo open: President Trump says he has issued an order to keep the US military detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, open.
Human Rights First, a human rights organization based in New York City, estimates the annual cost of keeping a prisoner in Guantánamo at more than $10 million, compared with $78,000 at a Federal high-security prison in the US.
The total number of detainees incarcerated at Guantanamo in its 16 years of existence is 780. Of the 41 remaining inmates, 23 are being held for indefinite detention without charge or trial.
More than 700 prisoners have been transferred to other countries. Only three have been convicted of a crime.
“The real tragedy here is that the 9/11 victim families have needlessly been denied justice. This could have been over and done long ago, but for it becoming a political issue,” Davis said.
John Bellinger, a legal adviser in the Bush White House, said he thought that, given past failures, there would be institutional resistance to refilling the camp.—Agencies
NEW DELHI: More than 34 years after coming into existence, the Sports Authority of India SAI ) is set to be renamed as Sports India , Union Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore announced on Wednesday after the sports body's governing body meeting here."Sports Authority of India is being renamed. The word authority is being removed. It will be known as Sports India now," Rathore said after the meeting even as the press release issued by SAI had no mention of the change in name being approved.The sports body, established in 1984, organised its 50th GB meeting, where it was also decided that coaches will be given a say in decision making and the food expenses of athletes will also be increased.The governing body also advised SAI to bring in reputed companies in the hospitality sector to manage the residential and food facilities under the SAI Residential Scheme."It was emphasised that the highest quality of food and nutrition which is appropriate to the development of athletes at various levels should be ensured and there should be zero compromise on this issue," said the release.Recently, the Indian men's hockey coach Harendra Singh had highlighted the shockingly low level of hygiene at SAI's Bengaluru centre, where the quality of food and standard of living came under the scanner.SAI will explore options for entering into public private partnership with appropriate agencies, including global agencies to develop the stadia, utilize the extra land which is currently not being used by the athletes, so that new facilities are created for sports which are accessible to the general public.In order to develop infrastructure of global standards at the best possible price, SAI will develop its procurement system keeping in mind the rules of the GFR, so that higher standards of infrastructure are developed and maintained.The governing body decided that the engineering wing in SAI would be strengthened to undertake this activity.The governing body also advised the SAI to encourage entry of professionals at various levels to manage critical activities for better accountability and efficient functioning.The Secretariat for the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) was also approved to provide support to the Mission Olympic Cell.

HAFIZABAD - Patients and their attendants on Tuesday protested against the non-provision of overhead shelter and seating facility at the counter of emergency ward in the District Headquarters Hospital Hafizabad.
They called upon the Health Authority chief executive officer and the deputy commissioner Hafizabad to ensure overhead shelter at the counter to facilitate them to get the prescription receit. They have also appealed to arrange seating arrangements near the counter to save them from the sizzling heat.
It is pertinent to mention here that due to crackdown on the quacks, there is heavy rush in the DHQ Hospital while it lacks proper arrangements of overhead shelter and seating which cause inconvenience to them.
The provincial government has provided all sorts of medical equipment including CT scan in the hospital and Trauma Centre but in most of the cases, some doctors refer the patients to Lahore, who die before reaching their destination.
The citizens called upon the CEO Health, MS and DC to discourage the tendency of referring the cases to other cities.
GANGS BUSTED: Police claimed to have smashed three inter-district gangs of dacoits, robbers and cattle lifters operating in Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat and Sialkot districts since long. The police have arrested 15 accused and also recovered stolen gold ornaments, cash, cattle and other valuable articles worth million of rupees.
Addressing a press conference, DPO Sardar Ghias Gul said that recently three daring dacoities were committed in the house of Union Council Chairman Rasulpur Tarar, a big business magnate Malik Nazir of Solgin Kharl and in the house of Rai Muhammad Tufail Kharl, a local business. The accused had snatched away gold ornaments, cash and other spacious articles worth million of rupees. He said as it was a challenge for the police, he had constituted numerous teams headed by SDPO Hafizabad and Pindi Bhattian which arrested Saddique, Muhammad Yaseen, Muhammad Yaqoob, Nazir Ahmad, Saddique, Shahyar alias Heera, Ahsan and have recovered cash of rupees 11 lakh, 35 tola gold ornaments, seven bikes and six heads of cattle from them. He said that more recoveries were expected shortly. The recovered articles and cash have been returned to the owners after the press conference.
Brad Feist is the new city employee. He began working for the city earlier this month, joining Public Works Directors Doug Brands and Jeff Snyder in the city's maintenance dept.
Doug and Jeff now share the position that was vacated by Dennis Smit last year, with Jeff handling wastewater and Doug handling water. But there is plenty of work to go around and having a third employee is a necessity.
Brad moved to Edgerton from Parker, Colo., last year. He is married to Pam (Mouw) who grew up in Leota and went to high school at Southwest Minnesota Christian.
Brad was hired by the city at the end of 2016, but tragedy struck his family when both his parents were killed in an automobile accident southeast of Edgerton on Dec. 28, 2016. His parents had moved to Minnesota with him and Pam.
The Feists moved to the area because life in the Denver area was getting to be too hectic and expensive. They were looking for a slower pace and a good place to raise their almost two-year-old son, Caiden.

Two weeks before her band released their debut EP, Avery Springer found herself on family vacation at Universal Studios dealing with a crisis. The new band she formed a few months prior had just been served a cease-and-desist notice from another band that was also using their name. Springer and her bandmates were in a frantic group chat, trying to come up with a name that they could move forward with, not wanting or able to deal with the time and money it would take to fight it, especially with their first-ever release on the horizon.
So, while Springer was on a two-hour line for the Minions ride, the band landed on Retirement Party, a joke because all of its members are relatively young, but one that feels apt for the sort of music they make, which is nervous and focused on a time when those nerves will eventually subside, when you'll finally be able to settle into some sort of stasis.
That first EP, Strictly Speaking — which was released in early 2017 — came together quickly and a little frantically, as well. It was Springer's first time working with her bandmates, lead guitarist Nick Cartwright and drummer James Ringess, both of whom she recruited to play with her right after moving to Chicago and both of whom she didn't know all that well. That didn't stop her desire to put a band together pretty much immediately after moving away from home.
Following one fateful practice together, it was set: “I had a bunch of songs already written and our first practice went really well, so afterwards I informed them that I had booked studio time for a month later so we had to get everything right,” Springer tells me. “Things kept snowballing from there and never really stopped.”
The band's first full-length album, Somewhat Literate, will be out at the end of May. The initial chemistry that was apparent at that first practice has coalesced into a remarkably well-oiled machine. The music is informed by Green Day — which Springer mainlined while growing up in a suburb outside Detroit — and more recent strains of energetic pop-punk, from Chumped to the Anniversary to P.S. Eliot.
Somewhat Literate is breathless and hooky and analytical to a fault, all qualities that can be gleaned from its lead single, “Passion Fruit Tea,” which is about the immense thrill that Springer and the rest of her band gets from making music. “It's about pursuing music without it being my career, about still having to work a 9-to-5 and go to school,” she explains. “‘I'll keep drinking passion tea to just get the taste of it.' That line is about getting just a taste of what it could be like to do this full-time.”
That infectious energy, that feeling of always having to do the most, is apparent throughout the whole album. Retirement Party play big and loose, chugging riffs and erratic drumming reined in my Springer's strong narrative pull. She has a tendency to stuff an impressive amount of syllables into every nook and cranny of the verses and then go for broke in the chorus, which means that half the song ends up sounding stumbling and insular and the other half feels like it could fill an arena. It's the best of both worlds approach, which mirrors Springer's musical ethos.
“I wrote [the album] in five months during a specific time in my life where I was starting to go through therapy and figure out myself, learning how to read myself. That's where the name Somewhat Literate comes from,” she explains. “Obviously, the songs are really fun and I pride myself on that and I like to have that, but the lyrical content of them is not easy and it does get very personal.
“It deals with mental health, but I like to keep things light and still-fun,” she continues. “What I'm hoping that people can get out of it is that shit sucks sometimes, but it's not always bad. Things aren't always terrible. Even if I'm writing a song about my depression, I can throw a little bit of shredding guitars in there and make it a little bit fun. It doesn't have to be all sad.”

Dr Alan Kivitz examines Heidi Wyandt, 27, at the Altoona Center for Clinical Research in Altoona, Pa., on Wednesday, March 29, 2017, where she is helping test an experimental non-opioid pain medication for chronic back pain related to a work related injury she received in 2014. With about 2 million Americans hooked on opioid painkillers, researchers and drug companies are searching for less addictive drugs to treat pain. (AP Photo/Chris Post)
Tummy tucks really hurt. Doctors carve from hip to hip, slicing off skin, tightening muscles, tugging at innards. Patients often need strong painkillers for days or even weeks, but Mary Hernandez went home on just over-the-counter ibuprofen.
The reason may be the yellowish goo smeared on her 18-inch wound as she lay on the operating table. The Houston woman was helping test a novel medicine aimed at avoiding opioids, potent pain relievers fueling an epidemic of overuse and addiction.
Vicodin, OxyContin and similar drugs are widely used for bad backs, severe arthritis, damaged nerves and other woes. They work powerfully in brain areas that control pleasure and pain, but the body adapts to them quickly, so people need higher and higher doses to get relief.
This growing dependence on opioids has mushroomed into a national health crisis, ripping apart communities and straining police and health departments. Every day, an overdose of prescription opioids or heroin kills 91 people, and legions more are brought back from the brink of death. With some 2 million Americans hooked on these pills, evidence is growing that theyre not as good a choice for treating chronic pain as once thought.

Drug companies are working on alternatives, but have had little success.
Twenty or so years ago, they invested heavily and failed miserably, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Pain is a pain to research. Some people bear more than others, and success cant be measured as objectively as it can be with medicines that shrink a tumor or clear an infection. Some new pain drugs that worked well were doomed by side effects  Vioxx, for instance, helped arthritis but hurt hearts.
Some fresh approaches are giving hope:
Bespoke drugs, as Volkow calls them. These target specific pathways and types of pain rather than acting broadly in the brain. One is Enbrel, which treats a key feature of rheumatoid arthritis and, in the process, eases pain.
Drugs to prevent the need for opioids. One that Hernandez was helping test numbs a wound for a few days and curbs inflammation. If people dont have big pain after surgery, their nerves dont go on high alert and theres less chance of developing chronic pain that might require opioids.
Funky new sources for medicines. In testing: Drugs from silk, hot chili peppers and the venom of snakes, snails and other critters.
Novel uses for existing drugs. Some seizure and depression medicines, for example, can help some types of pain.
The biggest need, however, is for completely new medicines that can be used by lots of people for lots of problems. These also pose the most risk  for companies and patients alike.
ONE DRUGS BUMPY ROAD
In the early 2000s, a small biotech company had a big idea: blocking nerve growth factor, a protein made in response to pain. The companys drug, now called tanezumab (tah-NAZE-uh-mab), works on outlying nerves, helping to keep pain signals from muscles, skin and organs from reaching the spinal cord and brain  good for treating arthritis and bad backs.
Pfizer Inc. bought the firm in 2006 and expanded testing. But in 2010, some people on tanezumab and similar drugs being tested by rivals needed joint replacements. Besides dulling pain, nerve growth factor may affect joint repair and regeneration, so a possible safety issue needed full investigation in a medicine that would be the first of its type ever sold, said one independent expert, Dr. Jianguo Cheng, a Cleveland Clinic pain specialist and science chief for the American Academy of Pain Medicine.
Regulators put some of the studies on hold. Suddenly, some people who had been doing well on tanezumab lost access to it. Phyllis Leis in Waterfall, a small town in south-central Pennsylvania, was one.
I was so angry, she said. That was like a miracle drug. It really was. Unless you have arthritis in your knees and have trouble walking, youll never understand how much relief and what a godsend it was.
Her doctor, Alan Kivitz of Altoona Center for Clinical Research, has helped run hundreds of pain studies and consults for Pfizer and many other companies. You rarely get people to feel that good as many of them did on the nerve growth factor drugs, he said.
A drug with that much early promise is unusual, said Ken Verburg, who has led Pfizers pain research for several decades.
When you do see one, you fight hard to try to bring one to the market, he said.
An independent review ultimately tied just a few serious joint problems to tanezumab and the suspension on testing was lifted in August 2012. But a new issue  nervous system effects in some animal studies  prompted a second hold later that year, and that wasnt lifted until 2015.
Now Eli Lilly & Co. has joined Pfizer in testing tanezumab in late-stage studies with 7,000 patients. Results are expected late next year  about 17 years after the drugs conception.
AVOIDING PAIN TO AVOID DRUGS
What if a drug could keep people from needing long-term pain relief in the first place? Heron Therapeutics Inc. is testing a novel, long-acting version of two drugs  the anesthetic bupivacaine and the anti-inflammatory meloxicam  for notoriously painful operations like tummy tucks, bunion removal and hernia repair.
Company studies suggest it can numb wounds for about three days and cut patients need for opioids by 30 to 50 percent.
Theres a good chance of preventing brain responses that lead to chronic pain if patients can get through that initially very rough period, said Dr. Harold Minkowitz, a Houston anesthesiologist who consults for Heron and treated Hernandez in the tummy tuck study.
Hernandez was part of an experiment testing the drug versus a placebo and doesnt know whether she got the drug or a dummy medicine. But she hurt less than she expected to and never filled a prescription for pain pills.
The goal would be to have half or more of patients not requiring an opiate after they go home, said Herons chief executive, Barry Quart. You have far fewer opiates going out into society, far fewer opiates sitting in medicine cabinets that make their way to a high school.
Studies so far are mid-stage  too small to prove safety and effectiveness  but Heron plans more aimed at winning approval.
ON THE HORIZON
Many companies have their eyes on sodium channel blockers, which affect how nerves talk to each other and thus might help various types of pain. Others are testing cell therapies for nerve pain. Stem cells can modulate immune responses and inflammation, and may overcome a raft of problems, said Cheng of the pain medicine academy.
Some companies, including Samumed, Centrexion Therapeutics and Flexion Therapeutics, are testing long-acting medicines to inject in knees to relieve arthritis pain. Samumeds aims to regenerate cartilage.
And then theres marijuana. A cannabis extract is sold as a mouth spray in Britain for nerve pain and other problems from multiple sclerosis. But cannabinoid research in the U.S. has been hampered by marijuanas legal status. A special license is needed and most researchers dont even try to obtain one, said Susan Ingram, a neurosurgery scientist at Oregon Health & Science University.
She is studying cannabinoid receptors in the brain, looking at how pain affects one type but not another. Such work might someday lead to drugs that relieve pain but dont produce a high or addiction.
Selective activity has precedent: The drug buprenorphine partially binds to opioid receptors in the brain and has become an extraordinarily successful medication for treating addiction, said Volkow, of the national drug institute.
It has shown pharmaceutical companies that if you come up with a good intervention, there is an opportunity to recover their costs, she said.

The Brooskville Baptist Church emerges from a 13-year restoration project and waits for its upcoming re-dedication ceremony. Beyond the pews, chairs, a podium and an organ sit at the front of the church, ready to be used.
by Monique Labbe
In 2004, the Brooksville Baptist Church was left in the hands of the Brooksville Historical Society. It had not functioned in decades and was left in disarray. It was then that a group of Brooksville residents stepped in and made the case for restoration. They called themselves The Keepers.
The Keepers began the restoration that year and obtained the church from the historical society in 2008 after achieving a 501c3 tax exemption status. After 13 years of blood, sweat and tears by countless volunteers and donors, major projects such as fixing the foundation, replacing the ceiling and redoing the walls have been completed.
“I can't even tell you how incredible the community has been,” said Audrey Peasley, who has been involved with The Keepers since the beginning. “Businesses have donated supplies, carpenters have worked for free and just charged us for the materials, we've raised thousands of dollars with yard sales. It's just been remarkable.”
The biggest fundraising effort has been “Pennies From Heaven,” which raises about $12,000 each time a handmade wooden penny sign makes its way around Brooksville. The penny starts at the church, and when a donation is received, it is moved to another part of town, until it eventually ends up back at the church.
Peasley said that yard sales have also helped to raise restoration funds and brought community members together in support of the efforts. The last yard sale, held last weekend, raised over $800 despite poor weather conditions.
“During this entire process, we have not borrowed any money from anyone, we have not gotten any grants from anyone. This project is entirely possible by the generosity of the people of this community,” said Peasley.
Another popular fundraiser is known as “the puffins,” a group of three wooden puffins that travel throughout Brooksville and raise funds as they move.
“Everybody loves the puffins,” said Peasley. “We put them on someone's lawn, they stay there for a little while, we send a thank-you card and then they move on.”
Carpenters and volunteers, including Peasley's husband Berwyn, were busy putting new hinges on the pew doors this past Monday, which had been purchased from an Amish village in Virginia. The hinges were handmade by a blacksmith there, to keep with the historical nature of the church, which was built in 1834.
With major projects out of the way, The Keepers decided that, with the 200th anniversary of the town of Brooksville on June 13, this year was the perfect time for a rededication of the church. The rededication is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday, June 11, just two days before the town's birthday.
“If you had asked me, when we first started, if I thought we'd get done everything we've gotten done, I would've told you ‘no' so fast,” said Peasley. “Looking around, it's almost overwhelming what we've been able to accomplish. There are still a lot of things that need to get done, but little by little, we'll chip away at it.”
A study has revealed that increased testosterone levels in male bodies will make them more obsessed with expensive luxury brands.
As per the joint study, published in the journal Nature Communications, was conducted by researchers at the INSEAD, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the Wharton Neuroscience Initiative, Ivey Business School, California Institute of Technology and ZRT Laboratories, testosterone is a major influencer of male consumer behaviour.
The new study report indicates that the level of testosterone in a male body has direct impacts in boosting the social status, and this is the reason why people with high testosterone levels tend to buy expensive apparels, clothing, watches and cars.
The intense desire to buy luxury goods among men with high testosterone levels has some biological reasons too. As per the study report, displaying higher social status brings various benefits to the life of men including increased mating opportunities, and huge access to resources and social influences.
During the study, Gideon Nave who works at the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues recruited 243 men aged between 18 to 55 for the trial. Some of these participants were given testosterone in the form of a skin gel, while others received placebo.
Later, they were asked to choose between two products, and interestingly, people who received the real testosterone doses tend to pick luxurious products when compared to others who received placebo.
"We found that the men who received testosterone showed greater preference towards the high-status brands. The use of brands to signal status does not necessarily have to 'work', it's enough that the men believe that it works," said Gideon Nave, Inquirer.net reports.
However, more studies should be carried out to know whether women tend to fall flat for men who drive a luxury car and wear a Rolex gold chain watch.
ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):The Pakistan Squash Federation (PSF) has written a letter to the game's world governing body in order to host the World Junior Squash Championship 2020.
Talking to APP, Squash Legend Qamar Zaman who is also the PSF vice-president said we had asked the World Squash Federation (WSF) to allot the World Junior Squash Championship 2020 to Pakistan.
“We are more than hopeful that Pakistan will be awarded the mega event,” he said and added the WSF president had assured him that more events will be given to Pakistan to be hosted in Karachi and Lahore.
Speaking about the recently held WSF meeting in France, he said I and PSF senior vice president Air Vice Marshal Shahid Akhtar Alvi represented Pakistan in the WSF meeting. “Many issues regarding the game were discussed in the meeting,” he said.
He said the meeting also discussed including the game of squash in the 2020 and 2024 Olympic Games to which all the members agreed. “PSF President, Air Chief Marshal Sohail Aman is doing all-out efforts for the promotion of squash in the country and is providing all facilities to the squash players,” he said.
I know I finished Season 1 of Love—at least, I think I did; the details are foggy, save for my thinking, wow, gotta find a friend who can take me to the Magic Castle.

Other feelings I know I had: these characters are annoying and in a purposeless way, except the roommate, who is pretty funny; I usually like Gillian Jacobs; what a deeply bad name for a television show, particularly if you're concerned about SEO; I would love to see a show that's fully committed to a behind the scenes of this teen witch drama the nerdy guy works on; I really don't need another love dramedy about white people in LA or New York; this show, whenever it ends, will definitely end with these two characters being broken up because I've never seen individuals so poorly matched.
Which means maybe the relationship of Gus and Mickey is analogy for watching Love—you shouldn't be watching it but there you are, doing it anyway. Here I am, doing this anyway: here is the trailer for Season 2 of Love.
The Flemish employers' organisation VOKA and the Association of businesses in the port of Zeebrugge say many questions remain unanswered. The impact of Brexit on Zeebrugge and the West Flemish economy, both heavily reliant on the UK, remain unclear. 46% of Zeebrugge traffic is linked to the UK. It provides 5,000 jobs and 500 million euros in added value.
Everybody is aware Brexit will mean more checks. Zeebrugge has the advantage that much of the traffic is unaccompanied and that unlike in Calais there are fewer drivers who need to pass through customs. Zeebrugge is eager to ensure a smooth flow of traffic despite the extra checks. Some 141 extra customs officers are being hired. The extra checks will require greater storage facilities at the port too.
Flemish trawler men also are concerned. In a hard Brexit Flemish trawler men will no longer be able to fish in UK waters that currently provide half of all Belgian catches. Local Euro MP Tom Vandenkendelaere urges Britain to “think long and hard” about leaving the customs union. In the event of a free trade agreement West Flemish business is asking the UK to take account of a close partner: "This isn't like an agreement with Canada or Korea. The situation is different because we are a close partner."

I can usually separate an actor from their part with ease; I know who they play in a movie or TV show is not who they are. But when you are sitting across from Iwan Rheon, who previously played Ramsay Bolton on HBO's Game of Thrones, it's a bit harder to separate the person from the role because he was so good at playing someone so bad. Thankfully, in real life, Rheon is nothing like his previous character. He's willing to joke around about that past role, too, while also revealing new details about his upcoming role as Black Bolt's brother Maximus on Marvel's Inhumans.
When Inhumans was filming earlier this year in Hawaii, I was able to visit the set with a few other reporters where we did a group interview with Iwan Rheon during a break in filming. He talked about working on another show with a high amount of secrecy, what it's been like making a show that will premiere in IMAX theaters and then air on ABC, filming in IMAX, the relationship between Maximus and Black Bolt, and a lot more.
If you're not familiar with the series, based on the Marvel comic, it's doing something incredibly cool and unusual. The first two episodes were filmed using IMAX cameras and will premiere globally in IMAX theatres for a two-week period, beginning September 1, 2017, and then ABC will air the entire eight-episode series beginning September 29th. It's an incredibly ambitious idea, but one I can't wait to see.
Finally, before getting to the interview, check out the first teaser trailer for the series followed by the official synopsis:
-
“Marvel's Inhumans” explores the never-before-told epic adventure of the royal family including Black Bolt, the enigmatic, commanding King of the Inhumans, with a voice so powerful that the slightest whisper can destroy a city. After the Royal Family of Inhumans is splintered by a military coup, they barely escape to Hawaii where they are greeted with surprising interactions with the lush world and humanity around them. Now they must find a way to reunite with each other and return to their home before their way of life is destroyed forever. - “Marvel's Inhumans” stars Anson Mount as Black Bolt, Iwan Rheon as Maximus, Serinda Swan as Medusa, Eme Ikwuakor as Gorgon, Isabelle Cornish as Crystal, Ken Leung as Karnak, Ellen Woglom as an undisclosed character, Sonya Balmores as Auran and Mike Moh as Triton. - The series is executive produced by Scott Buck, along with Marvel's Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory with Buck serving as showrunner. Roel Reiné directed the first two episodes. This series is a Marvel and IMAX project and is co-produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios. -
Question: How often do people come up to you in line at Starbucks and just fight you for no reason for something you've done in the past (Game of Thrones)?
IWAN RHEON: No one really does. I think there's something that happened in the character that because people enjoyed hating him so much I think there's a little small and they're kind of like, ‘Whoa you're evil you are, you are so evil' I think people enjoy the fact that he's so evil.
Could it be that more people are buying you drinks rather than wanting to fight you?
RHEON: I think more so, yeah. It says a lot about us, doesn't it, as a race. Generally I think people know that I'm an actor it and when you see me in a bar or whatever I'm probably not quite as intimidating as Ramsay.
Tell us about the experience making Inhumans. How does it compare?
RHEON: It's great. Marvel's Inhumans is being shot on IMAX cameras, the first two episodes including the pilot and those first two episodes will also be shown in IMAX in theaters which is making television history which is really exciting and then it will continue on ABC. It's a story that hasn't really been told before within the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it's a slightly different twist on a sort of superhero genre where you know they're not going out there to save humanity or help fight villains, they essentially don't want anything to do with humans, they're hiding from the humans. They all have these wonderful powers so it's kind of interesting to see what we will discover through the series, how the humans and Inhumans interact, how they clash and what happens during that initial meeting and how that happens. I think we see a totally different side to what Marvel is capable of and I think it's a very anticipated set of stories in the Marvel literature that hasn't really been explored before on film so that's all very exciting.
You're no stranger to working on shows that involve high levels of secrecy as this one does. Are you used to that and how has that been because many people also currently don't know a lot about the show?
RHEON: It's kind of becoming more the norm now for me that I don't say a word. You can see some intriguing stuff but it's just easier to just not say anything, just keep it vague but it's really it's a wonderful relief when it goes on television and in IMAX so then you can actually speak about it.
We saw you filming a scene with Black Bolt, a character who doesn't speak, and you were acting with three cameras. How is it acting in that kind of environment and who is it to act with someone that can't respond to you through speech?
RHEON: I'm quite used to working in the environment with many cameras anti always, as actor, blows you away when you think about how much attention there is to detail, how wonderful the sets look it's very interesting working with a character that doesn't speak at all so you have to communicate with each other through eye contact. With Black Blot as well, it's just the thought that if he was to just breath you'd get blown apart and that's a very interesting thing. Anson's great job with the training, everything that he's feeling through to essentially looks. It's something I've never done before, it's amazing. It's a slightly different dynamic when Medusa is around because she can communicate as well through a sign language that they've developed which is really cool as well, it's very original. It's a totally different challenge but it generally means I just have to learn a lot more lines which I'm not complaining about.
The first two hours are being filmed in IMAX and we've heard its one of them most expensive pilots that have ever been done. Is the action that we'll see on that level and what can fans look forward to?
RHEON: There is plenty of action. What is wonderful about it is you got to see a completely different world and this idea that these people live on the moon, that they've been there this whole time and we just haven't known about it. They're hiding, they've created this amazing dome which means that humans can't find it. I think to create this world and what they've done fantastically in the physical sets is unbelievable. I think that that's really where you see where the money is spent. That's the difficult thing, to create an original world and to you know and to reach all these aspirations because Attilan could be anything so you know you have to create something. There's plenty of action in this but what's wonderful about it is very much a family drama as well, it's about the family and their relationships and how they all respond to each other and there are wonderful moments of humor as well as drama and action so it's kind of go to everything.
At least 26 people died Tuesday when the bus they were traveling in apparently lost its brakes and plunged into a deep ravine in a northern Philippine mountain town, in one of the country's deadliest road accidents in years, officials said.
The rest of the more than 50 passengers were retrieved by rescuers who struggled with ropes to descend down the 24-meter-deep (80-foot-deep) ravine to reach the wreckage in Nueva Ecija province's Carranglan town, said disaster-response officer Mark Raymond Cano.
Many of the passengers had serious injuries and were taken to hospitals, with parents being separated from their children in the confusion, officials said.
“One child here sat beside her mother. The mother was dead,'' said Dr. Napoleon Obana of the Veterans Regional Hospital, where some of the injured were taken.
TV footage showed a line of rescuers and villagers, some holding on to a rope to climb up on a grassy slope with a victim on a stretcher. A throng of villagers waited in a clearing above them to help pull the victim to safety.
Cano said a preliminary investigation showed that the bus “lost its brakes and plunged down the ravine.”
The spot along the downhill road beside the ravine is accident-prone. Tuesday's accident was the sixth in the area in recent years, a local village official told DZMM radio.
The impact from the plunge ripped the bus, which could no longer be distinguished at the bottom of the ravine, said Nueva Ecija's police chief, Antonio Yarra. He said investigators could not yet talk to the still-stunned injured survivors to get more details on the accident.
Carranglan police chief Robert de Guzman said the bus from northern Isabela province was on its way to Ilocos Sur, a tobacco- and rice-growing region also in the mountainous northern Philippines, when it crashed shortly before noon in Nueva Ecija, about 200 kilometers north of Manila.
Poorly maintained passenger buses, inadequate road safety features and weak enforcement of local transport laws have been blamed for many vehicular accidents in the Philippines.
In February, a sightseeing bus carrying college students on a camping trip lost its brakes as it sped down a steep downhill road before smashing into a concrete electrical post in Tanay town in Rizal province east of Manila, killing 15 people. (AP)
CofC students partner with NASA to live stream eclipse from the sky
Students from the College of Charleston tested equipment they plan to use to live stream the eclipse on Monday.
The students have partnered with NASA and more than 50 other schools.
The group will launch 10-foot-wide weather balloons into the sky with video cameras attached.
Working together, the schools will live stream the shadow of the sun as it passes over the entire country.
“I guess you would call it a massive, sequential science project,” said Sam Fink, the College of Charleston's team leader.
Charleston-based startup Stream will make the live stream possible.
Will Jamieson founded the company in 2015.
“We're giving everyone an opportunity to witness it in real time, no matter where they are in the world,” said Jamieson.
Jamieson says he's excited to offer a unique way to view the eclipse.
Many people will be live streaming and photographing the moon itself, but very few people will focus on the shadow.
“It's going to be really breathtaking,” said Jamieson.
As the College of Charleston team prepared to launch the balloon as a test today, heavy rain and lightning caused a safety hazard.
Although the team couldn't perform their complete test today, Fink says he hardly considers today a failure.
“I think it's a priceless experience for our team to know—to get the panic out of the way, so if this happens they keep a cool head and get the job done,” said Fink.
The team will have another test on Thursday. They'll be traveling out on a boat with the Coast Guard to launch a balloon from the water.
You can watch the eclipse here.

The new United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said Sunday he would like to make 2017 a year to “put peace first,” in a message heralding the new year and marking his first day as the world body's chief.
“How can we help the millions of people caught up in conflict, suffering massively in wars with no end in sight?” Guterres said.
“Civilians are pounded with deadly force. Women, children and men are killed and injured, forced from their homes, dispossessed and destitute.
“No one wins these wars; everyone loses.”
Ushering in 2017, Guterres asked the world to make “one shared New Year's resolution: Let us resolve to put peace first.
“Let us make 2017 a year in which we all — citizens, governments, leaders — strive to overcome our differences.”
The unanimous election of Guterres — who fought for migrants' rights as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees for a decade — has energized UN diplomats who see him as a skilled politician who may be able to overcome the divisions crippling the international organization.
“Peace must be our goal and our guide,” he said. “All that we strive for as a human family — dignity and hope, progress and prosperity — depends on peace.” “But peace depends on us.”—Agencies
Ont. police say a man officers found covered in blood and windshield washer fluid told a gas station attendant to call 911 before he began a violent outburst.
It's alleged the man went to the Kingston, Ont., gas station around 3 a.m. on Tuesday, began kicking the door and told the attendant to call 911.
Police say he then allegedly started throwing jugs of washer fluid, smashing them off the store and ground.

Police say the man, covered in blood, sweat and washer fluid, was smashing another container when officers arrived.
They say he immediately put his hands behind his back and co-operated with police.
A 25-year-old Kingston man is charged with mischief.
An analyst says the shelving of TransCanada Corp.'s (TSX:TRP) Energy East pipeline means it's more vital than ever that three other pipelines to oil export markets proceed as planned.
AltaCorp Capital analyst Dirk Lever said Friday that Canadian producers will have to transport any new oil production over the next year or so using railcars because the pipelines leaving Western Canada now are essentially full.

He said the next capacity increase is expected to come with Enbridge Inc.'s (TSX:ENB) Line 3 replacement project, which is under construction and will add 370,000 barrels per day of capacity to the United States by early 2019.
But that additional room will only just accommodate new output from oilsands expansions and the situation will remain tight until the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline to the West Coast proposed by Kinder Morgan is in service, which is expected to add 590,000 barrels per day by late 2019.

TransCanada hasn't yet approved its Keystone XL pipeline into the U.S., but Lever said its 830,000-barrel-per-day capacity will likely provide enough room for Canadian oil production growth until about 2030, when the industry expects Canadian production to reach five million barrels per day.
He said Energy East could come off the shelf if any of the other pipelines don't go ahead, or if market conditions change to encourage higher production growth.

(Adds comment from acting CDC director)
By Deena Beasley
Feb 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. flu outbreak worsened over the past week as more people headed to doctors' offices and emergency rooms, with hospitalizations at the highest in nearly 10 years, U.S. health officials said on Friday.
Sixteen children died of the flu in the week ended Jan. 27, bringing total pediatric deaths to 53 for the season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly report.
Out of every 100,000 people in the general population, an estimated 51.4 have been hospitalized for the flu, surpassing the rate in the last severe season of 2014-2015, when 710,000 were hospitalized and 148 children died. Adults aged 65 or older had the most hospitalizations, followed by those aged 50 to 64 and children below 5.
“So far this year the cumulative rate of hospitalization is the highest since we began tracking in this way,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on a conference call.
With the previous record now broken, “we fear this year might be even worse than 2014-2015,” Schuchat said in a telephone interview.
The United States is now 10 weeks into the current flu season, which is expected to last for at least several more weeks.
The dominant strain during this flu season is an especially nasty type called influenza A (H3N2) that in seasons past was linked with severe disease and death, especially in the elderly and young.
Schuchat was named acting CDC director earlier this week after Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald resigned from the post because of financial conflicts of interest, including purchases of tobacco and healthcare stocks while in office.
Flu is widespread in 48 states, down from 49 last week, with Oregon reporting less flu activity, the CDC said.
“We are not out of the woods yet,” Schuchat said, noting that sick people should stay home to avoid transmitting the virus to others, frequently wash hands and cover their mouth while coughing or sneezing.
The CDC official also said it was not too late to get a flu vaccine. (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Richard Chang and Cynthia Osterman)
The opposition parties at Queen's Park are hoping the Ontario Provincial Police can get to the bottom of how nine power companies bilked ratepayers out of more than $260 million.
As first disclosed by the Star, Progressive Conservative MPP Todd Smith has written to OPP commissioner Vince Hawkes about the “egregious” abuses outlined in last week's auditor general's report.
Smith said the PCs had no recourse other than to ask the OPP to investigate. “We don't know yet (that they will launch a probe). We hope that they will because it doesn't seem like the government is taking it seriously,” he told reporters.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she was hopeful that police could find some answers for the public.
“I don't disagree that the OPP should be looking into this,” Horwath said.
In the brief time since his passing, the heirs to Prince's estate have time and time again taken actions that run contrary to the legendary musician's wishes. His music has been made available on streaming services, his back catalog has been mined as part of an ongoing reissue campaign, and recently, the estate obtained a permit to serve alcohol at Paisley Park during Super Bowl week. (During his life, Prince was famously anti-streaming, kept his music locked away in a vault for a reason, and banned alcohol from being served at Paisley Park.)
One of the events taking place at Paisley Park during Super Bowl Week was a listening party for Justin Timberlake's latest album, Man of the Woods. Beyond the fact that the album is a dumpster fire of epic proportions, many Prince fans took exception with the event given that it was sponsored by American Express and alcohol was served to the A-list crowd. Additionally, Timberlake and Prince briefly feuded in the mid-2000's. During a post-Grammys party in 2006, Prince referenced Timberlake's hit “SexyBack” by saying, “For whoever is claiming they are bringing sexy back, sexy never left!” Timberlake responded by mocking Prince's height at another awards show, and then released a diss track in which he sang, “If sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit?/ Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it.”
Adding insult to injury, TMZ brings word of a gross tribute planned by Timberlake as part of his Super Bowl halftime performance tomorrow night. Specifically, Prince will be resurrected as a hologram.
Prince's sister Tyka Nelson previously floated the idea of a hologram, but we had hopped the family would have come to their senses. After all, Prince himself vehemently rejected such an idea when asked about it in a 1998 interview with Guitar World.
“That's the most demonic thing imaginable,” Prince said at the time. “Everything is as it is, and it should be. If I was meant to jam with Duke Ellington, we would have lived in the same age. That whole virtual reality thing… it really is demonic. And I am not a demon. Also, what they did with that Beatles song [‘Free As a Bird'], manipulating John Lennon's voice to have him singing from across the grave… that'll never happen to me. To prevent that kind of thing from happening is another reason why I want artistic control.”
Unfortunately, it appears the color green, and not purple, is once again taking precedence.

NEW DELHI: Amid a spate of lynchings purportedly triggered by messages on its platform, WhatsApp on Wednesday said it is "horrified" by the "terrible acts of violence", and outlined steps being taken by the company to curb abuse of the messaging platform.The government had on Tuesdayto the social media platform asking it to take immediate measures to prevent the spread of "irresponsible and explosive messages". It categorically told the popular messaging platform that it cannot evade its accountability on the issue.In its response to the IT ministry 's missive, WhatsApp has said false news, misinformation and spread of hoaxes are issues that need to be dealt with collectively, by government, civil society and technology companies working together."WhatsApp cares deeply about people's safety, which is why we designed our app with security in mind ...," it said.The company also said it follows a two-pronged approach that includes giving people controls and information they need to stay safe, and working proactively to prevent misuse on WhatsApp.In its detailed response sent to the IT ministry, a copy of which has been seen by PTI, WhatsApp has listed out the various measures being undertaken by the platform to curb spread of false news and misinformation. These include product controls, digital literacy, fact checking advocacy and proactive actions to tackle abuse."We also respond to valid law enforcement requests to help them investigate crimes. And soon, we will start an engagement programme with law enforcement officials around India so they are familiar with our approach and how we can be helpful," it said.WhatsApp said it is keen to share "best practices" on how the platform can be used by local police as a resource for their community.The government's warning to WhatsApp came in theof innocent people because of certain "fake and motivated" messages purportedly circulated on the widely used messaging app.Last week,district in Maharashtra on suspicion of them being part of a gang of child-lifters.

The Kapolei High School counselor indicted for soliciting a child for prostitution pled guilty today.
According to the prosecutor's office, as part of the plea deal, 40-year-old Kendrick Padilla will be sentenced to 3 months in jail with credit for time served and five years probation.
Padilla was arrested and later indicted by a grand jury in May 2016.
Padilla must also register as a sex offender, go through sex offender treatment, and write an apology to the victim.
Padilla met the victim, who is a runaway, through an online ad.
He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27.
The Department of Education said Padilla has been with the school since 2009, and worked with 11th- and 12th-graders. He is currently on paid leave.

The Solano College baseball team beat visiting Skyline, 9-4, on Tuesday in a nonleague battle.
The Falcons (4-3) scored three in the fourth and five more in the fifth to break it open.
American Canyon grad Jared Denning was 3-for-4 with a double, steal and two RBIs for Solano. Jack Priddy was 3-for-5 with two doubles and two RBIs and Andrew Flores was 2-for-5. Bethel grad Kenny Quilitan had a sacrifice fly and American Canyon grad Nate Gutierrez had an RBI.
Jackson Berry (2-0) got the win as he went 5 1/3 innings, allowing five hits and four runs, three earned. He struck out five and walked two. Rylan Haney notched the save after going the final 3 2/3 innings, allowing one hit and no runs. He struck out three.
The Falcons return to action (weather permitting) at Santa Rosa on Thursday.
Monday night's “American Idol” elimination round lowered the number of contestants left on the show to just 10, but raised the level of emotions to 100.
Mara Justine and Compton resident Marcio Donaldson were sent home, as were country singer Garrett Jacobs and Johnny Brenns, who made his first official stage appearance as a musician on the show. While none of the contestants were happy to leave, it's safe to say there were no sore losers during this round.
Justine showed her poise and maturity when she said after the show, “I feel good. What a blessing it is to be here – to have made it this far. I never would have imagined something like this in my whole entire life.”
Donaldson echoed the sentiment, “Top 14 out of 300,000. When you think about that, it's only gonna be one winner at the end of the day, if you take it like a sore loser and think that this is the end, then it is the end. But if you take it and you catapult your own career, and you say look at me. That's where I'm at now. I'm just hungry for it even more.
On leaving, Brenn's said, “I'm gonna ride this as long as I can. This has kind of shown me that it can be a career and music can be number one in our lives so for the time being I don't think I'm gonna be returning (to school). It would be really dumb to give up the momentum and just quit, and say oh whatever I'm just going back to how it was before, because this has changed our lives.”

America's vote brought contestants Catie Turner, Cade Fohner, Caleb Hutchinson, Maddie Poppe, Gabby Barrett and Michael J. Woodard into six spots of the coveted top 10 this week, protecting them from a possible elimination from judges Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Luke Bryan.
Maddie Poppe's cover of The Bangles' “Walk Like An Egyptian,” had the crowd and the judges dancing in their chairs.
She said, “Some people look at it as just a singing competition, it's not. You've got to be the full package. You can't be switching around to different genres. I don't want to be a singer that's just on this show, so I really want to stick to my genre of music. It's such a good feeling to know that you don't have to be who everybody wants you to be, you can be yourself and still make it. It's nice to be accepted for who you want to be, it's a great feeling.”
Gabby Barrett brought the judges to their feet with her rendition of Miranda Lambert's, “Little Red Wagon,” a departure from her performance of Miley Cyrus' “The Climb” on Sunday night.
On choosing songs to perform, Barrett said she has considered using a song by Taylor Swift.
“I was thinking about that, doing a Taylor Swift song for the competition. I think she tells great stories, especially about boys (laughs). I don't know. I think I might throw back to an old one, when she started out, when she had the country vibe with her, one of those,” she said.
When asked, southern rocker Cade Foehner and country singer Caleb Lee Hutchinson both said without hesitation they would be willing to collaborate together.
Hutchinson gushed over his fellow contestant, “I love everybody on this show, but I remember the first time I heard Cade, during Hollywood week, I fangirled so, like y'all have no idea. Like, oh he's a rock star and he's so incredibly talented and there's stuff about him musically that people at home haven't seen yet, and when they see it, it's gonna blow their minds.“
The remaining four contestants – Dennis Lorenzo, Michelle Susset, Jurnee Siani and Ada Vox – were brought out of the danger zone and into the top 10 thanks to the judges' votes.
The most poignant moment of the night belonged to Vox, who delivered a show stopping rendition of “And I am Telling You I'm Not Going,” by Jennifer Holliday, to save herself from being eliminated. Immediately following her performance, the judges made an executive decision to move Vox into the top 10 without much deliberation.
Of the decision, Perry said, “When the Ada moment came it wasn't just one person's idea, we all looked at each other and we saw the math, like wait, you're gonna say Catie and Ada, one of them is going home? No, excuse us, we're gonna step in now. Now it's time for Mama, Papa, to step in and say, enough is enough, we are making an executive decision.”
Richie followed up by saying, “We messed up the timetable, but you know what it was, we felt so strongly about it we didn't have to wait until that vote.”
When asked her thoughts on why she didn't make it into the top 10 from America's vote, Vox said, “I'm considered a very controversial figure on this show, and it's just a testament of, maybe America isn't ready. But honestly maybe my performance wasn't good enough. All I have to do, I don't have to worry about what they think about me as a person. All I have to worry about is picking up my performance game, to make sure that I, no matter what, no matter what the outcome, end on a high note.”
RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's Mero field in the offshore Libra area should begin producing 40,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of February as part of a long duration test, an official at state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro said on Friday.
Fernando Borges, Petrobras' manager for Libra, said the area is already producing 20,000 bpd, adding that the company completed an initial shipment of 500,000 barrels of oil. (Reporting by Marta Nogueira and Alexandra Alper Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

NEW YORK (AP)  Shares of Netflix are streaming to new highs a day after the company announced its first true price hike in years.
That's a far different result compared with 2011 when Netflix separated its streaming and DVD-by-mail service and raised prices.
About 600,000 customers fled and its stock price plummeted by 80 percent.
But Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is a different animal today. The production powerhouse landed more Emmy nominations this year than any TV network other than HBO.

Some of that price hike, $1 per month for the company's most popular plan, will likely be plowed into the race to produce more blockbuster shows like "Stranger Things."
Netflix is up against HBO and Amazon, which has its own ambitions for great television.
Shares of Netflix hit $198.92 Friday.
Tuesday marked day five of the search for the missing plane that took off from Cranbrook en route to Kamloops.
On board were pilot Alex Simons and passenger Sidney Robbillard.
Searchers said it has been a challenge. They said low cloud has been hampering efforts and there's snow in the search area which is also causing problems because the plane is white.
Among those taking part in the search for the missing plane are private pilots who train for this type of situation. They are members of the Civil Air Search and Rescue Association who work in conjunction with the Canadian military in search and rescue operations.
Kelowna pilot Mark Payer took Global Okanagan's Kelly Hayes up for a mock search for an old wreckage in the forest near Kelowna to emphasize that finding a downed plane is not as easy as it sounds.
Nominations for the 75th annual Golden Globes were announced Monday morning, and along with nods for the year's best in film was recognition for their musical accompaniments.
Among those acknowledged in the original song category were Nick Jonas (“Ferdinand”), Mariah Carey (“The Star”), and Mary J. Blige (“Mudbound”). Songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who took home last year's prize for “City of Stars” from “La La Land,” also scored a nom for “The Greatest Showman.”
Seth Meyers will host the 2018 ceremony from the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7. The Golden Globes will air live at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on NBC. The full list of 2018 Golden Globe nominations can be seen here.
Here are the five best original song nominees:
“Home” From “Ferdinand”
The music by Jonas, Justin Tranter, and Nick Monson and lyrics by Jonas and Tranter scores 20th Century Fox's animated comedy based on the children's book of a loving and non-violent bull.
“Mighty River” From “Mudbound”
Off the soundtrack of “Mudbound,” a period drama that follows the lives of two families — one black and one white — after World War II, the emotional song was written by Blige, Raphael Saadiq, and Taura Stinson with music from Saadiq.
“Remember Me” From “Coco”
The heartfelt and upbeat lullaby from Disney and Pixar's “Coco” was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.
“The Star” From “The Star”
Carey and Marc Shaiman wrote the music and lyrics for “The Star,” the title track off Sony's animated Christian comedy.
“This Is Me” From “The Greatest Showman”
From the duo behind the music of “La La Land” and “Dear Evan Hansen,” Pasek and Paul earned their second consecutive nod for the powerful track from “The Greatest Showman.”
Students of Islami Jamiat-e-Taliba of the Punjab University on Monday night blocked the Campus Road, disrupting traffic, few days after the university administration barred political, religious and social personalities from entering the university premises.
The administration has initiated disciplinary proceedings after a clash between two student organisations left dozens injured. It has also barred students from entering university hostels after 10pm.
An IJT member said they took to the streets to protest against “hooliganism” of Pashtoon students in the Punjab University. Another IJT member, Usama Ahmed of Hailey College of Commerce (B Com, sixth semester) tried to stop the vehicle of this reporter.
IJT spokesman Taimur Khan while talking to The Nation said he does not endorse his fellows stopping vehicles of media persons. “But we will take to the streets when someone picks a fight with us in the university premises,” he added.
In a separate development, the university administration took action against four more students involved in the March 21 clash between IJT and Pashtoon students.
PU spokesman Khurram Shahzad said the university had issued charge sheet to four students and sought their replies within seven days. The students include PU Law College's Muhammad Usman, Hailey College of Commerce's Bilal Zahoor, Institute of Administrative Sciences' Amir Mushtaq and Institute of Education & Research's Rahat Ali.
He said the university administration had initiated disciplinary proceedings against the students involved in the incident indiscriminately without any pressure. He added that the administration would not adopt biased attitude towards any student.
The spokesman said that the university administration was taking action against students as per rules and regulations who had been identified on the basis of evidences.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday, April 17 that Japan's government is drawing up contingency plans in case a crisis on the Korean Peninsula sends an influx of refugees to Japan, The Associated Press reports.
Abe told a parliamentary session that the government is formulating measures including protecting foreigners, landing procedures, building and operating shelters, and screening asylum seekers.
Abe's disclosure came in response to a question that had been occasionally asked in the past but is now more realistic than ever with North Korea's missile capability rapidly advancing and tension with the U.S. rising.
The government has been also working on evacuation plans for about 60,000 Japanese from South Korea in case of a crisis.
Abe is set to discuss North Korea on Tuesday with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.
Pence will be flying to Tokyo from South Korea, where he declared "the era of strategic patience (with North Korea) is over," reiterating President Donald Trump administration's shift toward applying more pressure on Pyongyang. Abe praised the policy, noting a recent bilateral statement confirming the U.S. commitment to defending Japan with the use of both nuclear and conventional arms as extended deterrence.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Sunday said U.S. President Donald Trump was condemning all forms of "violence, bigotry and hatred" when he spoke about the violence in Charlottesville, including "white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups," after he came under fire for not naming those groups specifically.
“The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups," the White House spokesperson said. "He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.”
As Iowa's first female governor seeks election to a full term as governor, she is encouraging women to be “disruptive voices” in the workplace.
Kim Reynolds has been the chief executive of the State of Iowa for 406 days,ever since Terry Branstad resigned to become U.S. Ambassador to China. Last week, Reynolds spoke about female empowerment at a gathering of women bankers in West Des Moines.
“Iowa needs women who are competitors and provide the big ideas that shape how we live and work now and in the future,” Reynolds said, “women who are not afraid to challenge outdated concepts and they see problems not as barriers, but as opportunities.”
According to Reynolds, this is a “time of transformation” for women in Iowa.
“Iowa needs women who share their intellect and their creativity to drive diversity of thought in the workplace and women with transformational attitudes and disruptive voices that aren't afraid to confront the status quo,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds has said she sought a seat at the decision-making table from her very first days in the state senate. This is her advice to women who are reluctant to voice their opinions in the workplace: “First of all, you don't have to know everything and you don't have to be perfect. You just have to have a passion for what you're doing and your willingness to make a difference. If I…had waited until I thought I knew everything until I ran for office, I guarantee you that I would have never run.”
Reynolds first ran for office in 1994. She wound up serving as Clarke County Treasurer for 14 years. As Reynolds prepared to run for the state senate, she attended a candidate event and a man walked right past her to asked her husband what senate seat he was seeking.
“That poor guy, he felt so embarrassed. He was just mortified that he hadn't thought it might be me that was running for the state senate and not my husband,” Reynolds said.
It happened again this year, as the governor and her husband, Kevin, were entering an event at the National Governor Association meeting in Rhode Island.
“The people at the check-in said…not to me, to Kevin: ‘Governor, which state is it that you're here with?' And again, poor (Kevin), he's like: ‘Well, I'm not the governor. I'm the first dude. It happens to be her that's the actual governor of the State of Iowa,” Reynolds said.
Women who are forging a path in business and in politics have “moxie” according to Reynolds.
“I love that word because it's defined as having spirit, determination, courage, energy, know-how and attitude,” Reynolds said.

In Minnesota, packaged alcohol — other than low-alcohol 3.2-per-cent beer — can be purchased only from licensed liquor stores, not grocery stores or gas stations as in some other states. For 159 years, liquor stores were not even allowed to be open Sundays.
“We had to make the Sunday run to Hudson multiple times,” said Bill Lepsche, a Vikings fan who attended college at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul.
HUDSON, Wis.—As 73,000 fans make their way to U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday to attend the Super Bowl, thousands of Minnesotans not lucky enough to have tickets will head to their local liquor store to grab some beer for the big game. It's a common enough experience for football fans across the country — but not in Minnesota.
Until March 2017, that is, when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law permitting liquor stores to be open Sundays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
It was good news for football fans who often forget to stock up on Saturdays.
“It is not uncommon for people to procrastinate,” said Jeremy Miller, the Republican state senator who said he introduced the bill to give “liquor store owners the choice of being open on Sundays, and consumers the choice of buying beer, wine or spirits.”
Lepsche had a more concise reason to do away with the old Sunday restriction.
“It was a ridiculous law,” he said.
Forty-eight kilometres east of Minneapolis on Interstate 94, just across the St. Croix River, which separates Minnesota and Wisconsin, you'll find the town of Hudson. It has a quaint downtown along the river, but it was well known to Minnesotans, before the new law, as the best source for Sunday beers.
If you take the first exit off Interstate 94 in Hudson and make a right at the Dairy Queen, you'll end up at Historic Casanova Liquor, a liquor store known for craft beer, specialty wine and, according to its owner, Tyrrell Gaffer, being the “first one off the interstate.”
Gaffer estimated that 60 per cent of his Sunday sales before passage of the law were from Minnesotans. “A lot of it was: ‘Hey, I forgot. People are at my house and I need something,' ” he said. “Everyone in Minnesota knows this area pretty well.”
Compared with the owners of other border liquor stores, Gaffer is fortunate. His store is filled with high-margin niche beers and wines, and Minnesotans still come to buy products such as Spotted Cow, the farmhouse ale from New Glarus Brewing, which doesn't distribute to Minnesota.
What he now sells fewer of are name-brand spirits and cases of low-margin beers from macro breweries, such as 24-packs of Bud Light. “We haven't gotten hit as bad as some of the other stores and other places around here,” he said.
Tom Salewski owns Valley Spirits, just across the Wisconsin border in Osceola, about an hour northeast of Minneapolis. There is no town directly across the river in Minnesota, but he would still see plenty of Vikings fans who forgot to buy beer.
“It blew me away sometimes when people would come in, trying to leave their place at halftime and drive 20 or 30 miles and try to get back for the fourth quarter because they ran out of beer for the game,” he said. “You'd really notice it if the Vikings played a later game.”
He said his Sunday sales were down a third since the new law, and he now schedules one fewer employee to work Sundays.
Salewski is resigned to the fact that he will make less money. Without a town directly across the river, he cannot run promotions or otherwise attract Minnesotans to his store. “There is only so much you can do with pricing where you can make somebody drive 30 or 40 miles,” he said.
About 177 km south of Osceola is Fountain City, Wis., over the river from Winona, Minn., and the 8,400 students at Winona State University. “Before they changed the law, we were pretty busy, and it's not like it used to be,” said Bridget Johnson, a clerk at Wine House in Fountain City.
While the law is just seven months old, its effect is beginning to be quantified. During the first five months after it took effect, Wisconsin state sales tax collected from liquor stores in counties that do not border Minnesota grew 3.4 per cent compared with the same months in 2016, according to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.
But in Wisconsin counties bordering Minnesota, state sales taxes collected from liquor stores fell 5.5 per cent over the same period. A Revenue Department spokesperson cautioned that the data did not include alcohol sold at places including grocery stores and gas stations — such sales are allowed in Wisconsin — and that monthly data was volatile.
It isn't clear yet whether Minnesota liquor stores are seeing an appreciable rise in sales. The Minnesota Revenue Department has not completed its 2017 data, and it also lumps together taxes on all alcohol products, including those in bars and restaurants. Minnesota's border counties also tend to be much more populous than Wisconsin's, making small changes less noticeable.
It's not all bad news for Wisconsin's liquor stores. Unlike Minnesota's, they are still allowed to be open Thanksgiving and Christmas, and some stores still anticipate brisk sales to Minnesotans after their stores close Sunday nights before holidays such as Memorial Day and Labor Day.
Plus, as a patron drinking Wednesday afternoon at the newly opened Hop & Barrel Brewing in Hudson noted, without the hordes of Minnesotans running in to buy their cases of beer, on Sundays locals “can finally go to Casanova again.”
At least one person was killed and 30 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia when white nationalists protesting plans to remove the statue of a Confederate general clashed with counter-demonstrators and a car plowed into a crowd.
CLAIM
A Cleveland-area Fox affiliate described local murder suspect Steve Stephens as "dark white."
false
RATING
false
ORIGIN
On 16 and 17 April 2017 Facebook users, pages, and blogs shared an image of a purported screenshot from a WJW-TV broadcast that described a black suspect as “dark white”:
The viral image was part of a larger news story involving a manhunt for Cleveland resident Steve Stephens, accused of fatally shooting an elderly man on 16 April 2017. Stephens purportedly bragged about the murder on Facebook Live, subsequently claiming to have shot several additional victims. Cleveland.com reported:
Steve Stephens remained at-large early Monday morning, accused of a killing that unsettled Northeast Ohio and garnered national attention. Police say Stephens, 37, of Cleveland, walked up to Robert Godwin Sr., a 74-year-old father of nine and grandfather of 14, on Sunday afternoon and fatally shot him on a sidewalk in the city's Glenville neighborhood. Stephens posted a recording of the shooting on Facebook, then later posted another video laughing about the incident and claiming that he had killed more than a dozen other people. Police said there is no evidence of other shooting victims.
The blog ClashDaily shared the doctored image in a 17 April 2017 post, claiming it was authentic:
‘DARK WHITE SKIN': PC News Station Calls BLACK Facebook Killer WHITE When a description of a suspect is given, political correctness shouldn't EVER enter into it. When the suspect is on the loose, armed, and threatening to murder random people, the goal is to get him into police custody. And this guy live streamed a video saying he was going to commit murder on Facebook. Steve Stephens, 37, is wanted for aggravated murder for the death of a senior citizen, Robert Godwin Sr., 74, of Cleveland.
On 16 April 2017, a Twitter user tweeted to the WJW-TV account to ask about the circulating photograph:
@fox8news in Cleveland says that Steve Stephens has “dark white skin”. What does that even mean? pic.twitter.com/r7gvd6rtSZ — Based Monitored 🇺🇸 (@BasedMonitored) April 17, 2017
The news station confirmed that the image was doctored, providing the unaltered version side-by-side with the fake:
@BasedMonitored This image did not originate from FOX8. It was altered. This is a distraction from us trying to help authorities locate a murder suspect pic.twitter.com/aAIKCrpwxe — fox8news (@fox8news) April 17, 2017
In a statement to Snopes.com, a representative for WJW-TV forwarded both versions of the image and confirmed:
There's an image circulating that shows “dark white” as the station's description of this Facebook Live suspect, but it's a pretty obvious photoshop fake.
Steve Stephens remains at large as of 17 April 2017.

WWE News: Cody Rhodes on whether he misses the WWE
Responding to a fan question on Twitter, Rhodes also talks about whether he blames the WWE for holding him back.
@desibrah by Dushyant Dubey News 15 Jun 2017, 10:11 IST
Rhodes is currently wrestling for several non-WWE promotions
What's the story?
Former WWE Superstar Cody Rhodes has responded to a fan question on Twitter asking him whether he misses the WWE. Rhodes replied by stating that he does indeed miss his “homies” at the company and added that it wasn't the WWE that was holding him back. The Tweet can be seen below.
No. I miss my homies a bit. If anybody was holding me back, it was me. WWE put me on the map and in the game. https://t.co/qUz6GTi9wd — Cody Rhodes (@CodyRhodes) June 14, 2017
Cody also Tweeted that his dream match would have been against Ric Flair.
In case you didn't know...
Cody Rhodes, who currently wrestles as “The American Nightmare” Cody on the independent circuit, left the WWE in 2016, after being employed at the company for nearly ten years.
Rhodes has been a part of Impact Wrestling, Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro Wrestling since his departure from the company and has also wrestled on various other independent promotions extensively.
The heart of the matter
Responding to a round of fan questions on Twitter, Cody Rhodes was confronted by a question from a fan who stated that they loved his work on the independent scene a lot more than his work in the WWE. The fan also added that they felt that the WWE were holding Cody back and asked him if he missed the WWE.
Rhodes replied to the fan and said that he did indeed miss his friends and fellow Superstars (referring to them as “homies”) in the WWE. Rhodes also went on record to state that he wasn't being held back by the WWE but he himself.

Rhodes further went on to acknowledge the fact that the WWE put him “on the map” and “in the game”, referring to the popularity he received as a result of being a WWE Superstar and all the training and guidance that was given to him by the company.
What's next?
Cody Rhodes is currently signed up to New Japan Pro Wrestling as well as Ring of Honor and makes regular appearances on both the promotions.
As of right now, Rhodes is on a multi-promotion tour on the independent scene that he has dubbed as the “American Nightmare” tour. He will be performing in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey on 17th June and in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on 18th June.
Rhodes also has a 4th of July appearance with the Bar Wrestling promotion at Baldwin Park, CA.
Author's take
Despite his differences with the company in the past, Cody Rhodes has been speaking of the WWE only in a positive light as of late. Although he isn't slated for a WWE return anytime soon, maintaining good relations with the company on public record may be a good idea if Cody ever wants to see himself working for the WWE again.

By CASEY COLLIER
First female judge in the 16th Judicial District, Anne Simon spoke Tuesday of the marriage of her judgeship and her writing career at the weekly Franklin Rotary meeting at the Forest Restaurant.
Born in the eastern United States, educated at Wellesley College, Yale University and Louisiana State University Law Shool, Simon moved to south Louisiana 50 years ago.
Now 15 years retired, she travels, visits with family, takes walks with her dog and writes novels based on her experiences in Acadiana, and on the bench.
Simon has written three novels, and is working on a fourth.
The first three all have the same dedication: “Dedicated to everyone who works in the American system of justice—a flawed system, but the best as yet devised by man.”
Her first novel was Blood in the Cane Field. The second and third, were: Blood in the Lake and Blood of the Believers. All of which, are available on Amazon.com.
“I was a general jurisdiction trial court judge,” said Simon, “which means, I handled everything from broken refrigerators to first-degree murder, and I had more than my share of capital first-degree murder cases. I don't know why, but I did.
“Each day, whether it was the broken refrigerator case, or the first-degree murder case, I watched the human condition in a parade before me. I saw the tragic condition—one mistake and a life ruined. I saw the comical—a witness caught red-handed, spinning a complicated lie. I saw the weird—a citizen of his own sovereign state, persuaded he could roam the free sea of Lake Martin irrespective of wildlife regulations. And I saw the disgusting—a 15 year old truant girl found in the apartment of a 50 year old man, sat before me, displaying the wares she had peddled. That girl spelled for me, the name that her mother had given her: But'ty. Did she have any chance?
“All the time that I worked, I had a secret. I would go home at night and write-up some of these things that I had seen—descriptions of the people and descriptions of the area; and I kept three files: One file was labeled, ‘St. Mary,' one file was labeled, ‘St. Martin' and one file was labeled, ‘Iberia.'”
Simon explained that she didn't do anything with the nightly notes contained in the three files while she was a judge, for two reasons. The first reason, she said was, “It is not ethically permissible for a judge to promote anything for money… as if I would decide a case differently because somebody bought a twenty dollar paperback.”
The second reason, she said was that she didn't know how to put together a novel. “I got books from the library, and I read them,” Simon said, “the little nerd that I am, you know, had to read how to do it. And I had a set of CDs. There's one on the Great Courses that tells you how to write fiction. But still, the projects never got off the ground.”
Then, one day, Simon had a conversation with her daughter-in-law, who teaches writing. She invited Simon to join her writing group, and it was there that Simon decided to write her first crime fiction novel.
Simon said of being invited to join the group, “Sometimes I think she did that for cover, to criticize me. But anyway, I was grateful, because they did (criticize) and they were merciless, and that's what it takes. Not too many people want to tell me what to do. That's the problem with being a judge; people don't want to rub you the wrong way. But, that group was merciless, as I said, and I learned so much.”
Simon went on to discuss her yet-to-be titled novel, its status toward completion and the difficulties concerning its compilation.
“I'm trying to write something now about the year 1839, in this area, particularly New Iberia, though Franklin does figure into it very much because that's the stop of the steamship before it reached New Iberia.
“That year, F. H. De Perriere obtained a charter for Newtown, which became New Iberia. His story is dramatic. His parents were murdered by slaves in a rebellion in Saint-Domingue, in Haiti, and he, as a small child, was taken out.”
That was also the year there was a regular route of steamboats that went out of New Orleans, up the Teche and passed by Franklin, but stopped at New Iberia, because beyond New Iberia, “the Teche was full of scags and trash and what have you,” Simon said. “The people in New Iberia stole a lot of the cargo that had come through Franklin, and that was the cattle for Lafayette, and whatever.”
“In 1839 also, a slave of the De Perriere's, named Felicitae, nursed during the Yellow Fever epidemic, and she nursed very successfully using old folk medicine from Haiti,” Simon explained. “Her ways were successful and she became beloved, and when she died, it is said that the town shut down to walk in her funeral procession from St. Peter's to the cemetery. Unfortunately, when I started on this, I didn't know that I had kicked an ant pile. There are about 300 descendants of the De Perrieres, and they all have their own story, their own folk-lore, and they don't agree.”
But then, she said, “A blow came to me about three weeks ago: One of them opened a Facebook page to gather all these stories. So, now there are going to be even more stories that don't agree. I don't know what I am going to do with this thing. But, I may have an idea. I think I may have a way around that. That's what I'm going to do for the next year.”
Simon closed by saying that since she can't be a senior in college again, studying history, she intends to write historical fiction, if she can ever get the De Perrieres to settle on one story that they can live with.
“So, that's my post-career career,” Simon said. “Does anybody have any questions?”
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kurdish forces in Syria said on Friday one of their fighters was mutilated by Turkey-backed rebels, referencing a video circulating on social media.
Turkey launched an air and ground offensive last month against Kurdish fighters who control the northwest Syrian region of Afrin on the Turkish border, opening a new front in Syria's multi-sided war now approaching its eighth year.
The Kurdish-led administration of northeast Syria said Barin Kobane, a fighter with the Kurdish YPJ militia, was killed by Turkey-backed rebels who “played with her corpse and cut it up” as cameras rolled. The YPJ is the all-female affiliate of the Kurdish YPG militia.
“We hold the Turkish government responsible for this heinous act. We salute the soul of the free resistance (fighter),” it said.
Reuters could not immediately reach Turkish military officials for comment.
The footage showed a bloodied body on the floor. Parts of her torso appeared to have been cut.
The video has caused anger amongst the Kurdish population of northern Syria, a witness said. Memorial pictures of her are being circulated widely on social media.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said she was killed during fighting in the north of the Afrin region near the Turkish border where Turkey-backed forces have taken some territory since launching its operation last month.
Kobane - her nom de guerre - was in her mid-twenties and joined the YPJ in 2015, a YPG official said. He said she was killed alongside three other fighters near the town of Bulbul.
EAST LANSING >> John E. Jack Roberts, who has served as executive director of the Michigan High School Athletic Association since the fall of 1986, will retire in August.
Roberts will conclude his tenure as the second-longest serving full-time executive director during the MHSAAs 94-year history. He is the fourth person to serve that leadership role full time, following Charles E. Forsythe (1931-42, 1945-68), Allen W. Bush (1968-78) and Vern L. Norris (1978-86). Roberts currently is also the nations longest-serving executive director of a state high school athletic association.
The MHSAA has enjoyed continued growth under Roberts guidance, particularly in the number of Michigan high school students participating in athletics and in the number of MHSAA-sponsored tournament sports available to them.
The Association also has made advances in providing for the health and safety of athletes and promoting sportsmanship and the values of educational athletics while working to preserve competitive equity for its more than 1,500 member high school and junior high/middle schools.

I dont think anybody could have been luckier than I to enjoy their work so much and to enjoy the people he worked with so much, Roberts said. It has been a blessing to be able to bring my passions to work every day and be able to act on my convictions. I dont think anybody could ever feel more called to a job than I did. In fact, this wasnt a job at the MHSAA. The MHSAA was my purpose for these three decades.
Under Roberts leadership, overall participation in high school athletics in Michigan has increased 10 percent, and the MHSAA has added more than 200 schools in increasing its membership by more than 15 percent at the high school and junior high/middle school levels combined. Most recently, in 2016, 6th-graders were allowed to compete for member schools for the first time as a push was made to increase junior high/middle school membership and serve the states students earlier in their athletic careers.
His tenure has seen the addition of girls competitive cheer (1994), girls & boys bowling (2004) and girls & boys lacrosse (2005) to the tournament sport lineup, the creation of separate wrestling tournament to determine champions by team format (1988) and 8-player football (2010, first playoffs 2011) as many small schools across the state began having trouble fielding 11-player teams because of enrollment and population decreases. Meanwhile, also under his leadership, the 11-player football playoffs expanded, doubling to 256 teams in 1999.
A number of key rules changes came under Roberts watch and direction, including the addition of opportunities for multiple schools to create cooperative teams in sports where participation is lagging, as well as the creation of downtime and dead periods (2006) to ease pressure for year-round activity. A comprehensive sportsmanship package enacted in 1996 set a statewide tone for appropriate behavior and perspective.
But the most significant and arguably lasting work influenced by Roberts came on topics not related to specific sports or competition. The MHSAA has led nationally in concussion care with its first programming in 2000 and return-to-play protocols enacted in 2010, and with concussion pilot testing, mandated reporting and insurance for those who suffer head injuries rolled out in 2015.
A heat management policy and CPR requirements for coaches were introduced in 2013. The first program for coaches education was launched in 1987 and evolved into the Coaches Advancement Program that is now required for all newly-hired varsity head coaches, and all coaches (head or assistant) at all high school levels (varsity and sub-varsity) are now required to take annual rules/health meetings.
The Women in Sports Leadership Conference was created in 1989 and remains the first, largest and longest-running program of its type in the country, regularly drawing upwards of 500 participants. The first of now-annual statewide Athletic Director In-Service Programs was conducted in 1992, and the MHSAAs website  MHSAA.com  was launched in 1997.
We have accomplished a great deal over 32 years, but there is very much more to do  and it will always be that way, Roberts said. People ask me if I have any regrets, and I dont have many. But two come to mind right now.
I regret that I didnt spend more time writing notes to the folks Ive been serving at the local level who work so hard delivering the program every day, every week, every season, every year to the young people that we serve. I wish Id done more of that  that encouraging word to people in the trenches doing the work.
And I suppose the second regret is that in spite of everything that weve done, theres still a lot more to do to keep school sports as safe, sane and sportsmanlike as it ought to be  as it must be for schools to continue to sponsor these programs. You see, school sports done right brings help and hope to parents and to schools who are trying as hard as they can to raise up and educate kids in very, very scary times. School sports helps parents and helps schools bring stability and engagement into young peoples lives that can provide them life lessons and turn some good athletes into great citizens down the road.
Roberts privately made the decision to retire during May 2017. But even as he has prepared for his retirement this summer, hes catalyzed a Multi-Sport Participation Task Force charged with promoting the benefits of playing more than one sport and led the facilitating of statewide discussion on a sport-based transfer rule proposal that will come before the MHSAAs Representative Council in May.
Roberts previously served as an assistant director for the National Federation from 1973-80. He came to the MHSAA in 1986 from the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which he served as executive vice president.
Roberts is a 1970 graduate of Dartmouth College and taught English and coached football at high schools in Milwaukee and Denver. He and his wife Peggy reside in East Lansing.
LOS ANGELES-Award-winning star Gwyneth Paltrow has revealed she ‘'isn't sure'' about her future as an actress.
The Academy Award-winning star has recently been focusing her efforts on her much-discussed lifestyle company Goop, and Gwyneth has suggested she sees her long-term future in business rather than the movie industry.
She shared: ‘'I'm not sure how I'll feel about acting going forward. I'm doing just a teensy little bit here and there when I have time, but I am loving running my business.''
The 44-year-old beauty - who has children Apple, 13, and Moses, 11, with her ex-husband Chris Martin - admitted she's relishing the challenge of building her own company.
As a result, Gwyneth has spent very little of her time in recent years on a film set.
She told ‘Extra': ‘'You know, my life has been skewing far more heavily towards my business, and it has to right now that we have so much going on.
‘'We're growing so fast (at my company), and it's such an exciting time to be doing what I'm doing.''
Meanwhile, Gwyneth recently revealed she has reached a point in her life where she quite likes herself.
The ‘Mortdecai' star said she feels blessed to be ‘'liberated from the chains'' of other people's perceptions.
She shared: ‘'When you're at the forefront of something that's new, people can get really reactive, ‘This is crazy! Why are you doing this?' Then, five years later, everyone's fine with it.
‘'So I have a bit of pattern recognition in hand at this point - which is helpful. Also, when someone doesn't like something you do, or doesn't share your interest in something, that doesn't have anything to do with you. One of the best things someone ever said to me was that the only time criticism hurts is if you have a judgement about yourself about that very thing.
‘'If someone's like, ‘You d**k, you have red hair!' and you've got brown hair, it doesn't bother you. It's a blessing to be liberated from the chains of other people's perceptions of you. It's part of wellness, working at that. I've gotten to a point where I like myself. I do my best as a person. I also have nothing to hide.''

By turns intensely naturalistic and brutally stylized, “6 Balloons” mercilessly turns screws and escalates dread while spinning a worst-case scenario about the fraying family ties between a heroin addict, who's chronically incapable of curbing his self-destructive appetite, and his sister, who's buckling under the weight of the latest in a long series of his impossible demands.
Writer-director Marja-Lewis Ryan drew upon the real-life experiences of producer Samantha Housman while developing her edgy scenario, and audaciously cast in the lead roles two actors best known for their work in comedy — Abbi Jacobson (of “Broad City”) and Dave Franco. The movie leaves you with a deep respect for the willingness evidenced by Ryan and her collaborators to take several gambles that pay off dramatically and emotionally. But be forewarned: If your own experiences mirror in any way what unfolds in “6 Balloons,” it also will leave you more than a little bruised.
Katie (Jacobson) is busy preparing a surprise party for her boyfriend, with the help her mother (Jane Kaczmarski) and father (Tim Matheson) and a coterie of close friends, when she notices that her brother Seth (Franco) and his toddler daughter Ella (played alternately by twin sisters Charlotte and Madeline Carel) are late in arriving. When she can't reach Seth on his cellphone, it's easy to read in her worried expression that she knows what that probably means. So, using the pretext of running out for a birthday cake, she drives over to his apartment, where she immediately notices that Seth hasn't been picking up his mail. She knows what that definitely means.

Sure enough, Seth has been using again. At first, he claims he hasn't, but Katie won't buy it, and their give-and-take sounds unmistakably like a conversation they've had a zillion times before. Indeed, Katie already has come to fear she may be dragged down by her brother into his private corner of hell. She wants to “let go with love,” as she's encouraged by the self-help audiotape she plays in her car throughout the movie. (That may sound like a heavy-handed touch, but be patient: It builds to something powerful.) She wants to stop being Seth's enabler. She wants to save herself.
But, of course, she acquiesces when he asks her to take him in for detox.
“6 Balloons,” which will start streaming April 6 on Netflix, clocks in at a tight 74 minutes. But it feels as though it's gradually expanding to the enormity of a wide-awake nightmare as it follows Katie and Seth — and, in the backseat, Ella — along a circuitous L.A. roadway paved with good intentions and desperate measures. Stops along the way include a frustrating visit to a clinic that won't accept Seth's insurance; a paranoia-ratcheting side trip to an inner-city marketplace for unprescribed medications; and a near-closing-time interlude in the bathroom of a drug store, a sequence both darkly comical and grippingly suspenseful as Seth and Ella simultaneously require attention while a disapproving pharmacist (Heidi Sulzman, making every second count in a fleeting role) hovers nearby.
You can't help feeling that something terrible will happen at any moment, unless something worse happens first.
A textbook example of pared-to-essentials storytelling, “6 Balloons” tells us only what we absolutely need to know about Katie, Seth and their shared history, and requires us to infer just about everything else. Fortunately, that task is made appreciably easier by the remarkably exact performances by Jacobson and Franco.
Jacobson speaks volumes with anxious body language and quicksilver changes of expression, so that, even on those occasions when Seth appears cheery — maybe a little too aggressively cheery — Katie's smile is merely tentative; obviously, she knows from experience that things can turn poisonously sour in a heartbeat. Franco persuasively plays Seth as an indulgent weakling who only partly camouflages his skills as a crafty manipulator. His mother and father have grown immune to his dubious charms, but he knows (or, to be more precise, hopes) that his sister remains an endless source of sympathy.
Ryan, who first attracted notice in 2010 by writing and co-starring in “The Four-Faced Liar,” a well-received, sexually flexible romantic comedy, never attempts to emulate Seth's stealthiness here. From the opening minutes onward, she makes it clear that “6 Balloons” actually is a drama about two people straining to break free of crippling addictions. Perhaps the riskiest move she makes in the entire film is symbolically visualizing Katie's struggle in a manner that could have come across as inadvertently comical. But she pulls it off, and the movie is all the more potent for it.
Re: Time to cool the bluster, Aug. 11
Time to cool the bluster, Aug. 11
In your editorial, you state that more diplomacy is needed with North Korea.
Diplomacy has failed the past four U.S. presidents (from both sides of the aisle) and it is their failed policies that brought us to the point where we are today. Everyone is hopeful for a peaceful solution.
It is about time that a U.S. president took a firm stand and Donald Trump's words are refreshing to many of us Americans.
Shahid M Amin
SOME headway has been made in the past few days through patient diplomacy in improving Pak-Afghan and Pak-US relations. During a meeting held in Kabul on March 17, 2018, between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan National Security Adviser Nasser Khan Janjua, the former extended an official invitation to Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi to visit Afghanistan “to initiate state-to-state comprehensive dialogue” to resolve differences between the two sides. At about the same time, in Washington D.C., US Vice President Mike Pence had a one-to-one meeting with Prime Minister Abbasi, who was on a private visit to see his ailing sister. There were detailed talks on Afghan peace process. Abbasi was reported as saying that meeting was “positive”. Abbasi also talked to US officials separately at a hotel where Pakistani diplomats were present.
Later, the White House stated that Pence had told Abbasi that “Pakistan must do more against the Taliban, the Haqqani network and other terrorist groups operating in their country.” Pence had added that “Pakistan could and should work closer with the United States.” A few days earlier, Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua visited Washington for detailed talks. Moreover, US officials have also visited Islamabad. Alice Wells, US Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia stated these talks “could be beginning of a process with the Pakistan government.”
The reality is that, in the context of Afghanistan, both Pakistan and the US need each other. The US still has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan to bolster the Kabul regime. The logistic supply route for these troops remains through Pakistan. Though more than 16 years have passed since 9/11 and the US invasion of Afghanistan, the US is nowhere near a victory in the longest war in its history. The Taliban have control over nearly half of Afghanistan and are carrying out raids against military and civil targets with impunity. The need for a political solution is growing by the day. The latest offer of President Ghani for a dialogue with the Taliban is a step in right direction. Pakistan has officially welcomed this offer and should do everything in its power to promote it.
Without making it public, Pakistan also needs to hold a dialogue with the Taliban leadership to persuade them to show flexibility in their stance towards a political solution. They cannot win a “total victory” any more than the Americans and Kabul regime. The non-Pakhtuns in Afghanistan (Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras) will not accept outright Taliban rule, nor would the international community endorse it. Over time, the Afghan Taliban have benefited from Pakistani hospitality and aid. They must now understand Pakistan's security dilemmas and not exacerbate them. They should realize that their hitherto intransigent stance towards a negotiated settlement merely prolongs the horrific bleeding of Afghan people, who have known nothing but warfare and destruction since the 1970s. A political compromise with the Taliban can comprise of a sharing of power at the centre, with virtual autonomy in provinces which the Taliban dominate.
As for US-Pakistan relations, the point in contention is Washington's claim that the Haqqani network continues to operate from Pakistani sanctuaries. Pakistan denies it. This does not look like an irresolvable issue that cannot be tackled by patient diplomacy. In case the US/Afghan claim is based on solid evidence, the US should share it with Pakistan, which should offer every possible assistance to eradicate such sanctuaries. In case the US is unable to produce any such concrete evidence, Pakistan should persuade Washington not to persist with such accusations. Towards this end, strong lobbying would be needed by Pakistani diplomacy with the Congress, different power centres in the USA and the world media. Transparency on our part on the issue of sanctuaries will be more advantageous than our frequent official self-righteous assertions.
Another point that our chest-thumping super patriots need to understand is that Pakistan is at present beset with myriad problems. Internal political stability persists and economic indicators are alarming. Foreign exchange reserves are low, balance of payments is adverse, debts are mounting and international credit ratings are going down. In foreign policy, we are becoming friendless. We have a tough neighbourhood: India is bellicose, Afghanistan is hostile, Iran is less than friendly and Central Asian countries are unenthusiastic. Even a traditional ally like the UAE is showing pro-India leanings. This is hardly the time to have a confrontational relationship with the USA, the sole superpower, with which we had a history of close political, economic and military ties. Balancing of relations is all very good but, at present, Russia simply cannot be a substitute for the USA. Russia continues to have strong ties with India and is not an aid-giving country. Commonsense suggests that improvement of relations with the USA is in our national interest, not only for bilateral reasons but also due to its influence in world financial institutions like IMF and in FATF, which might put us in the Grey List of those involved in money laundering for terrorists.
Diplomacy is the method through which states pursue their national interests in international arena. It consists of formal and informal discussions aimed at resolving matters of common concern. Professional diplomats are trained for the job and have years of experience in dealing with other countries. They are in the best position to conduct diplomacy, which is a specialized profession like medicine and engineering. Pakistan needs sophisticated and patient diplomacy at this time but Prime Minister Abbasi has shown poor judgment by naming a novice like Ali Jahangir Siddiqui as new Pakistan Ambassador to US.

It noted that recent developments have reinforced its view that higher rates will be warranted to keep inflation near its target, but added it will take a gradual approach and be guided by the economic data.
"In particular, the bank will continue to assess the economy's sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity," it said.
Alicia Macdonald, principal economist at the Conference Board of Canada, has been expecting since January that the Bank of Canada will raise its key interest rate in July.
She said Wednesday there's now a possibility the central bank may also increase the rate in September or October, but that will depend on what happens with the trade talks with the United States and Mexico.
"We think there's reason to still think they might be cautious as they wait for these events to unfold," she said.
Macdonald also said she'll be watching what happens with the housing market, which she said the Bank of Canada expects to rebound over the rest of this year.
"We think that, yes, it won't be as bad going forward, but we do see the possibility for some continued softness in housing market activity over the next few months and that could weigh on future rate increases," she said.
However, David Watt, HSBC's chief economist for Canada, said he expects the Bank of Canada to keep its key interest rate on hold for the rest of the year.
"In our view, the Bank of Canada's hawkishness is premature," he wrote in a report.
Watt cited moderate job growth, lacklustre non-energy export growth, ongoing trade policy uncertainty, subdued capital expenditures and signs households are being squeezed by past rate increases and high gasoline prices as reasons the central bank would keep its rate unchanged.
The central bank's decision to keep its trend-setting rate on hold came as inflation sits above the two per cent midpoint of its target range of one to three per cent and core inflation has crept past the two per cent mark for the first time since 2012.
It noted that inflation will likely be a bit higher in the near term than was forecast in its April monetary policy report due to recent increases in gasoline prices, but that it will look through the transitory impact of the fluctuations at the pump.
The central bank has raised its key rate three times since last summer, increases that have prompted the big Canadian banks to raise their prime rates which are used to set the rates charged for variable-rate mortgages and other variable-rate loans.
In this Aug. 30, 1972 file photo, Guillermo Aillon, center, emerges from the Superior Court House where he was denied bail on charges he murdered his estranged wife and her parents in New Haven, Conn. Aillon died in 2014 and his remains were disinterred from the Connecticut State Veterans Cemetery in Middletown, Conn., on July 3, 2017, after state veterans' affairs officials learned that he had been serving a life prison sentence for the murders. It's not clear where the remains were taken. (Photo: Bob Child / AP)
Hartford, Conn. — The recent exhumation of an Army Vietnam veteran's body from the Connecticut State Veterans Cemetery was a rare invocation of federal laws aimed at keeping murderers and rapists out of veterans burial grounds, federal and state officials say.
The remains of Guillermo Aillon were disinterred from the Middletown cemetery July 3, after state veterans' affairs officials learned that he had been serving a life prison sentence for stabbing to death his estranged wife and both her parents in North Haven in 1972. It's not clear where the remains were taken.
Only one other person appears to have been exhumed from a U.S. veterans' cemetery under a 2013 federal law that gave the federal Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to dig up the remains of murderers and rapists, according to the VA.
In 2014, the body of Army veteran Michael LeShawn Anderson was removed from the Fort Custer National Cemetery in Augusta, Michigan. Authorities said Anderson killed Alicia Koehl, wounded three other people and killed himself in a 2012 shooting in Indianapolis. The 2013 law, named after Koehl, specifically authorized the exhumation of Anderson.
Burying convicted murderers and rapists at veterans' cemeteries was banned by a 1997 federal law, which was aimed at preventing Oklahoma City bomber and Army veteran Timothy McVeigh from being interred at Arlington National Cemetery.
The law prohibits people sentenced to life in prison or death on convictions for federal or state capital crimes and certain sexual offenses from being buried in national veterans cemeteries and other veterans burial grounds — such as the Connecticut cemetery — that receive federal funding.
But exhumation authority didn't exist until the 2013 law, which also was made to apply to people who committed murders and rapes but were not available for trial and not convicted. The law applies only to veterans buried after it took effect on Dec. 23, 2013, with the exception for Anderson.
The remains of another veteran convicted of murder, Russell Wayne Wagner, were removed from Arlington National Cemetery under an order approved by Congress in 2006 as part of a veterans' bill. Wagner killed an elderly couple in Hagerstown, Maryland, in 1994.
Connecticut officials did not know about Aillon's convictions because he was transferred from prison to a hospital before he died in 2014 and his death certificate listed the location as the hospital, said Thomas Saadi, spokesman for the Veterans Affairs Commissioner Sean Connolly.
“It's a very rare occurrence,” Saadi said of exhumation. “The Aillon situation was very unique.”
Saadi said the state has since required funeral directors to attest that veterans whose families have applied for them to be buried in the state veterans' cemetery were not convicted of murder or rape.
Relatives of Aillon did not return messages seeking comment. They previously have said they were unaware of the burial restrictions and were upset with the exhumation plans.
At the Michigan cemetery, Anderson was buried with full military honors, despite Koehl's killing.
“It was just a total insult,” Koehl's father-in-law, Frank Koehl, told the Detroit Free Press.
Anderson's mother, Debra Graham, said her son's remains were relocated to another cemetery.
“I couldn't believe it. It hurt so bad,” she told The Associated Press, referring to the exhumation. “A lot of pain and grief. I try not to think about it. I try to think about the good times we had.”

The Ferrari GTO stands as one of the most beautiful and exclusive cars of all time, and it boasts a racing record to back up its unparalleled collectibility. For one lucky car collector, the RM Sotheby's Monterey auction will offer the chance to own one—provided the purse strings can handle the price. That price could be the highest ever for an auction car.
This particular 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO by Scaglietti is the third of just 36 250 GTOs ever built. Wearing chassis number 3414 GT, the 1962 model has traded hands over the years, but each documented owner has taken care to preserve the historic car and its lineage.
Ferrari built the car in 1962 and it served as a test car for driver Phil Hill during that year's Targa Florio road race. The first owner was one of Ferrari's favorite private customers, Edoardo Lualdi-Gabardi. The racer entered the 1962 250 GTO in 10 races in 1962 and won every event minus one where he placed second.
After owning the car for just one year, Lualdi-Gabardi received a second 250 GTO in 1963 and sold the car to Gianni Bulgari. Bulgari, who would lead the famous jewelry brand, entered the car and won its class at the 1963 and 1964 Targa Florio.
Throughout its life, this 250 GTO competed in 20 races and was never once involved in a wreck. In fact, it retains the original engine, transmission, and rear axle. Scaglietti wrapped the car in a Series II body in 1964, which it also still wears.
The car is currently owned by Dr. Greg Whitten, who was previously chief software architect for Microsoft. Whitten has taken the car to various vintage motorsport events for the past 20 years and participated in four of the well-known GTO anniversary tours.
Just how much could this 250 GTO go for at auction? This past January, one 250 GTO brought in a record-setting $70 million. Another model sold for $52 million prior to that.
We'll find out if this Ferrari 250 GTO will set a new auction record when it crosses the block at the RM Sothebys Monterey auction set for August 24-25.

ISLAMABAD - The National Accountability Bureau, on the directive of a committee investigating illegal appointments, has issued a show-cause notice to its representative in the JIT probing Panama scandal, The Nation has learnt.
Headed by the establishment secretary, the committee was constituted by the Supreme Court, which is investigating illegal appointments, promotions, deputations in the NAB. The notice was issued days before the JIT started working.
Well-placed sources in the NAB told The Nation that the bureau did not issue any separate show-cause notice to JIT member Irfan Mangi in the case of illegal appointments, promotions, deputations and absorptions.
They said the NAB issued notices to more than 100 officers in this case on the direction of a special probe committee which was constituted by the Supreme Court under the chairmanship of Establishment Secretary Syed Tahir Shahbaz.
They said the national anti-corruption watchdog issued the notice to Irfan Mangi two days before joining the joint investigation team in the Panama probe. They affirmed the NAB gave 15 days to all officers to submit their reply and did not pressurise Irfan Mangi in this regard.
The sources also averred the NAB just issued the show-cause notices to the officers, directing them to appear before the inquiry committee, record their statements and justify the appointments, promotions and deputations.
The JIT on Tuesday in its report said: “The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was also accused of pressurising JIT member Irfan Mangi. It said the NAB issued a show-cause notice to Mangi on April 25 for his deputation in the anti-graft body in 2004 and sought his explanation within 15 days”.
The sources stated Mangi was using the JIT platform to avoid the inquiry committee, but he could not escape it. They said the bureau had also issued notices to 50 percent of its director generals in this regard, directing them to appear before the inquiry committee and prove they were hired on merit.
According to the NAB show-cause notice (a copy available with The Nation), NAB Deputy Chairman Imtiaz Tajwar had issued the notice to an officer, which says, “You, deputy director (BS-18), are informed through this notice that your initial appointment in NAB as a deputy director was inconsistent with terms and conditions of services (TCS 2002 and MAQ 2002) as the experience certificate from the previous department does not indicate whether it is in the fields of investigation/inquiries/ research/legal matters. And whereas I, as competent authority, am satisfied that the show-cause notice should be issued to you on the basis of above-mentioned grounds and in pursuance of judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 31-3-2017 in suo motu case No 13/2016 and in accordance with Section 8.02 of NAB's TCS.” “Therefore, you are called upon to appear and show cause within 10 days from the receipt of this notice as to why your services may not be terminated as per Section 8.02 of NAB Employees' Terms and Conditions of Services, 2002. Your reply will be examined by the committee which, after affording you an opportunity of hearing, will record its findings for transmission to the NAB chairman,” it added. On March 31, the Supreme Court constituted a committee headed by Secretary Establishment Syed Tahir Shahbaz and FPSC member Habibullah Khan Khattak and DG (HRM) Muhammad Shakeel Malik as members.
The documents further said: “If no reply to this show-cause notice is received within 10 days, it will be presumed that you have no defence to offer in the matter, prompting imposition of appropriate penalty. You should also state if you wish to be heard in person by the committee or not.”
When contacted, NAB Spokesperson Asim Ali Nawazish said he was not in a position to offer any comment on the issue.

From wardrobe choices to commercials to puppies, there are lots of interesting ways to place bets on everything surrounding the big game. (0:55)
LAS VEGAS -- With a day to go before kickoff, four reported million-dollar bets have already been placed on Super Bowl LII -- all on the underdog Philadelphia Eagles.
A bettor on Friday at William Hill placed a $1 million money-line bet on the Eagles at +155 odds. If Philadelphia pulls the upset over the New England Patriots, the unnamed bettor would net a $1,550,000 profit.
Earlier in the week, William Hill reported taking a $1.6 million bet on the Eagles +4.5 and another $1 million money-line bet on Philadelphia. Last week, MGM's sportsbook reported taking a "multimillion" bet on the Eagles.
It's not uncommon for million-dollar bets to show up each year on the Super Bowl, but not this many. Last year, for example, only one $1 million bet was reported on Super Bowl LI between the Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons.
The Patriots were 4.5-point favorites over the Eagles on Saturday at most sportsbooks. They opened as high as 6-point favorites two weeks ago, but the majority of the early action, especially the largest bets, have been on the Eagles.
On Friday night at Caesars Palace sportsbooks, 61.4 percent of the point-spread bets and nearly 70 percent of the money that had been wagered was on the Eagles. The action was even more lopsided at William Hill, where 85 percent of the money on the point spread was on Philadelphia.
The largest reported bets on the Patriots were in the six-figure range. MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood told ESPN that the largest bet he had taken on the Patriots was a "mid-six-figure" money-line bet.
The sportsbook at the South Point casino also reported taking a six-figure bet on the Patriots.
A lot could change leading up to kickoff. Las Vegas bookmakers say as much as 80 percent of the bets will be placed Saturday and Sunday. For right now, though, Las Vegas is rooting for the Patriots.

What should happen to the Waikiki Natatorium War Memorial?
Construction was completed in 1927 as a memorial to honor veterans of World War I.
But over the past several decades, the facility fell into disrepair. It's been closed to the public since 1979, and is considered a public health and safety issue for beachgoers and marine life.
On Monday, city officials outlined several possibilities for the landmark's future.
An environmental impact statement (EIS) is underway with a completed draft scheduled by summer 2018.
Its purpose is to recommend projects to renew the memorial and re-establish full public access to the area.
“We've been making steady progress with the EIS and the process is working,” said Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. “Through this process, and the consultations it requires, we've developed four alternatives to address the long neglected memorial. An additional alternative has recently been added, which looks promising. We're labeling it Alternative 2 and it consists of a flow through perimeter deck where the original, crumbling deck is now.”
The four alternatives proposed for the site include:
Alternative 1 – Closed Pool System
Reconstructs and restores the Natatorium in general accordance with the 1998 plans, except for the ocean-fed pool design.
Ocean-fed pool qualifies as a public swimming pool and would be subject to health provisions.
Estimated cost $40 million to $60 million.
Alternative 2 – Perimeter Deck
Retains the bleachers, arches, and reconstructs the pool deck in the same location but on new supports. Large lengths of the seawall below the deck level would be removed, allowing the free flow of water between the swim basin and ocean. Estimated cost $20 million to $30 million.
Additional renderings below.
Alternative 3 – Beach
Creates a war memorial beach between constructed groins with the removal of all structures built seaward of the 1927 shoreline.
Replica memorial arch would be aligned with the existing Roll of Honor plaque with construction of a new bathhouse, replacement offices for Ocean Safety, removal of the existing roadway and construction of a new parking lot.
Estimated cost $20 million to $30 million.
Alternative 4 – Debris Removal
All structures would remain in place with some debris removal and limited access to the public in the event of a collapse.
Estimated cost $2 million to $4 million.
“It needs to be done for a lot of different reasons. One, the historic value of this structure, the fact that it sits right on the ocean in the heart of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head,” Caldwell said. “The EIS is something that is important, because it gets the input from the community, and we address the various impacts both positive and negative on many of the alternatives that we may take.”
Following the draft, public hearings are anticipated for fall 2018 with the publication of the final EIS scheduled in spring 2019.
Nobody likes corporate trainings. Nobody.
In fact one of life's puzzles that eludes me most is how a person could enjoy corporate trainings enough to spend their time designing and running them. Perhaps only with distain for the status quo can a startup create something that people not only don't hate, but find helpful.
The idea for Butterfly, founded by David Mendlewicz, Simon Rakosi and Marcus Perezi-Tormos, originated from poor experiences the young managers had when receiving leadership training. The startup is announcing a $2.4 million seed round today from Daphni, Tectonic Ventures, Precursor Ventures and a number of angels with the hopes of making things better.
Mendlewicz told me that the gold standard for training is a compressed quarterly or yearly training. This tends not to work because it's not targeted in terms of content or timing. Instead, Butterfly monitors team feedback and uses machine learning to push brief, digestible, tips to managers via a chatbot named Alex to help improve outcomes.
“We're focusing on content that managers can take advantage of — short and conversational,” Mendlewicz added.
The startup is moving its focus to Fortune 500 companies. The team has already managed to onboard 20 large companies, including Citibank, Ticketmaster and Coca-Cola, with paid contracts reaching 50 percent or more of the addressable workforce at each.
Butterfly collects feedback about the impact its having within corporations. By building relationships with academics from the University of Oxford and Columbia University researching human behavior in the workplace, Butterfly hopes to unpack key drivers and use them to affect change.
“Younger workforces thrive on more feedback,” Charles Hudson, an investor in Butterfly from Precursor Ventures, told me in an interview. “You need a mechanism for delivering feedback to them in a way that works.”
Right now about a third of Butterfly's content comes from third parties and two thirds is content that the startup has indexed and reframed. In the future, the platform could make for an interesting content marketplace where managers could opt into the tools they think they could most benefit from.
“Buying central learning resources is going away and people at the individual or team level are going to have control over those budgets,” Hudson added.
With data of what resources work for which teams, Butterfly can inform decisions around what training content companies should be spending their money on. And ideally managers get accustomed to the format enough that learning starts to feel more like reading a story a friend sent via Messenger and less like a clunky, outdated, training exercise.

Last we heard from British alto Chlöe Howl, we were listening to her synth-pop collaborations and selections from her debut EP, The Rumour. The video for her latest single, “Do It Alone,” came out today. In it Howl refuses to be the other woman and instead dances in supermarket aisles, goes to the bowl-o-mat, takes a whack at a speed bag, and makes us all jealous of her diner fries. Seems like the better choice. Check it out below.

FLORENCE HALL - Pakistan were struggling at 129-4 against the West Indies President's XI on day two of their three-day game at the Trelawny Multi-purpose Stadium on Monday.
Earlier, West Indies President's XI resumed their first innings from the overnight score of 311-5 and they were all out for 419. Vishaul Singh's beautifully crafted unbeaten 135, which will probably earn him a place in the senior regional side for the first Test against Pakistan at Sabina Park starting Friday.
But he and his teammates had more to celebrate by the close of second day, taking four top-order wickets for 129 runs in 47 overs. Left-arm medium pacer Raymon Reifer led the way with 2-17 in 12 overs, troubling the vaunted Pakistani batsmen with his controlled swing.
The impressive 25-year-old Pakistani opener Ahmed Shehzad, not out on 53, and the established 31-year-old middle-order batsman Asad Shafiq, on 23, will resume today, having so far shared a fifth-wicket stand of 45 runs. Scores in a game disrupted by a 57-minute rain break on the second day: West Indies President's XI 419 all out; Pakistan 129-4.
The diminutive 28-year-old Singh, who walked to the crease with the President's XI 159-3 on Saturday's first day, had his heart in his mouth at 87 in the first over yesterday. But there was blessed relief as his edged cut off the persistent left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir went in and out of the hands of Azhar Ali at gully. Before that, and thereafter, the Guyanese left hander — watched by West Indies selector Eldine Baptiste — was mainly error-free, playing pace and spin with equal aplomb.
It was his sixth first-class century, but the first of what has been a moderate 2016-17 season, following strong performances for Guyana and West Indies A since 2014-15. By the time the President's XI were dismissed for 419, having started the day at 311-4, Singh relying heavily on wristy cuts and deflections had batted for 338 minutes and faced 234 balls. He hit a six and 11 fours.
Most support came from Reifer (45) who was unbeaten on 36 overnight and the massively built Rahkeem Cornwall (28). The innings fell away in the second hour of the morning with Cornwall, Kemar Roach (0), and Damion Jacobs (0) being dismissed in rapid succession. But Keon Joseph (12) stayed with Singh in a last-wicket stand of 30 to take the home side past 400. Amir was the top Pakistani bowler with 3-66. Part-time off-spinner Shafiq took 2-20, while spinner Yasir Shah, who got his leg breaks to rip yesterday, took 2-129 off 37 overs.
In their turn at the crease the Pakistani openers Shan Masood (14) and Ahmed Shehzad appeared in no trouble against the pace of Kemar Roach and Keon Joseph. But the introduction of Reifer with his swing left-arm medium pace changed the picture. He had the left-handed Masood — caught by Cornwall falling to his right at slip — with an away swinging delivery at 32-1. Azhar Ali (4) followed 12 runs later, edging Joseph (1-24), who had been brought back for a second spell, for wicketkeeper Jahmar Hamilton to take the catch.
Reifer, by now operating under overcast skies, got the prized wicket of champion batsman, 39-year-old Younis Khan, with another swinging delivery as the right-hander played away from his body for another edge to the ‘keeper at 64-3.
The rain break followed and the wrist spinner Damion Jacobs struck immediately after, taking the wicket of the 42-year-old Pakistan Captain Misbah Ul Haq (5), who like Younis has said he will retire at the end of the upcoming Test series in the Caribbean. Misbah, who was given out caught off bat and pad by Shimron Hetmyer at forward short leg, appeared to protest the decision. He seemed to suggest to the umpires that the catch had not been cleanly taken. Shehzad had struck five fours and faced 133 balls by the time the umpires lifted the bails at minutes after 6:00 pm.

Four preeminent, Black leaders in America today, addressed the challenges and celebrated the success stories of the African American community, during a “State of Black America” forum at the 2018 National Newspaper Publishers Association Annual Mid-Winter Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Dr. Lezli Baskerville, the president and CEO of the National Association for Equal Opportunity (NAFEO), spoke passionately about the future of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), while Julius Cartwright presented a sobering, yet optimistic report from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB).
And while Reverend Tony Lee, the pastor of Community of Hope A.M.E. Church, delivered fervent remarks about the strong state of the Black Church, it was a fiery, no-holds-barred speech from Dr. Amos C. Brown that brought the capacity crowd to its feet.
Brown, a civil rights icon, who serves as the senior pastor at the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco and president of the San Francisco Branch of the NAACP, touted the virtues of the oldest civil rights organization in America and its importance today.
In what amounted to a sermon worthy of any Sunday service, Brown said the Black Press must tell the story of African Americans.
“Let no one else tell it for us,” he said, before providing a vivid picture of his foray into the Civil Rights Movement, as a teenager.
“One of the problems with the Black community, today, is that we don't have enough rituals of remembrance,” Brown said.
Referring to the current administration and its policies, Brown said, “‘The man' is doing today what he's always done.”
Brown continued: “They say to make sure, ‘If you're Black you get back. If you're brown, you stick around and if you're White, you're always right. They're not any better than we are. We came from Mother Africa.”
Baskerville, a 2014 Harvard University Advanced Leadership Fellow, said the state of HBCUs remains strong.
“From my vantage point, HBCUs in 2018 are strong and getting stronger. In fact, it's harvest time for HBCUs,” Baskerville said.
Baskerville also said that the vitriol coming out of the White House and the policies that jeopardize voting and other rights are reminiscent of the time when HBCUs were born.
“The actions and words and legislation taking place will turn back the clock, if we let it happen,” Baskerville warned. “But, I say it's harvest time for HBCUs, because it's the 50th anniversary of the sanitation workers march [in Memphis] and the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and we are still going strong. We are 106 strong, but if you read fake news, HBCUs are closing.”
Baskerville continued: “We have lost just one [Black college] and we are still struggling to get it back. I say its harvest time, because while HBCUs are just three percent of schools, we graduate 20 percent of African Americans across the country; Sixty-percent of African American public health professionals; 50 percent of African American public-school teachers; and more than 40 percent of Black STEM professionals.”
Cartwright said NAREB, the oldest group representing Black realtors (which he called “realtists”), is working to help Black homebuyers.
“Most African Americans were stripped of their wealth with the housing decline when trillions of dollars were lost,” he said.
According to a recent report, Cartwright said that the median net worth for Black families is less than $2,000 while the median net worth of White families is roughly $100,000.
Further, he said, while the median wealth of White women was about $41,000, the median wealth for Black women was only $5.
“Real estate is the cornerstone of wealth,” Cartwright said. “That's the equity we need to pass on to the next generation.”
When it comes to the Black Church, Lee cautioned African Americans not to be disillusioned about religion by megachurches and television evangelists.
Lee said the A.M.E. church is united, and membership is beginning to climb; mobilization efforts like the get out to vote campaign in Alabama during the contentious Senate race between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore are also increasing.
Lee noted that Black Church isn't seeing the type of radical drop off in its membership that White churches are experiencing.
“Most of our churches are 200 or 300-member churches and the Black Church is doing major work in every community,” said Lee. “We are mobilizing when you look at the last election, the Black Church learned a great lesson…we must get back to training our people and understanding the science of mobilization.”

GUJRANWALA-The District Headquarters Hospital medical superintendent approached the health authorities for an action against illegal recruitments in the hospital.
MS Dr Anwar Aman had written to the secretary health Punjab alleging that the Medical College Principal Dr Mohsin Aftab has made against the merit grade 17 recruitments in the quality control unit.
He further alleged that Dr Mohsin asked him to appoint his favorite candidates but when he refused to do so, he took all the record with him and later issued the appointment letters to his favorite candidates. He requested the secretary health Punjab to look into the matter and illegal recruitments be cancelled.
ANTI-POLICE PROTEST: Dozens of citizens belonging to Nowshera Virkan staged a demonstration against police in front of CPO office on Thursday.
The protesters alleged that some influential persons have occupied their house illegally while the police concerned have taken no action against the accused persons. Later, the protesters dispersed peacefully after getting assurance from the higher police officers of an early action against the accused persons.
Iran Focus
London, 6 Oct - On October 5, Republican Senator Tom Cotton told the Washington Post that military action against the Iranian Regime was “a credible option” and the renegotiation of the nuclear deal should be a discussion between the United States, European partners, Israel, and Arab allies.
This came just ten days before Donald Trump must decide whether or not to recertify Iran's compliance with the nuclear agreement — which places restrictions on the Iranian Regime's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
When questioned on whether the military option was a good idea, Cotton replied that the US certainly had the option and it need not be like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which have left a bitter taste in the mouths of the American public.
He said: “Most of your argument [against] is that we don't have a credible military option, which is simply false. President Obama often implied that the only choice we had was capitulation under the [nuclear deal] or a decade of occupation after forceful regime change through the introduction of 150,000 mechanized troops, like we do in Iraq — that's simply not the case.”
He continued: “We have a number of calibrated military strikes — like Ronald Reagan conducted against Libya, like Bill Clinton conducted repeatedly against Iraq like Donald Trump conducted against Syria. Like Ronald Reagan conducted against Iran itself, by blowing up half of its navy and several oil platforms.”
One of Cotton's biggest concerns about the nuclear deal is that even if Iran was in complete compliance (evidence show that this is not true), it still allows the Regime to develop nuclear weapons in less than a generation, which is why he advocates for renegotiation.
He said: “Ultimately put Iran in the position of being a legitimate and lawful nuclear power in a mere 13 years.”
He continued: “I would say they're [Iran] not complying, fully, and verifiably, and transparently… and it clearly is not in our vital national security interests. Iran's role in the region is a campaign of imperial aggression across the Middle East. So, it's time for a new approach.”
Cotton is believed to have met privately with Trump to put across his views on Iran and how the nuclear certification should go.
Earlier this week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the administration would place several options before Trump with regard to the nuclear deal, which could include military action but is more likely to include decertification with and without the rollback of sanctions.
Detroit Lions linebacker/defensive end Brandon Copeland tore a pectoral muscle in Sunday's preseason win over Indianapolis, will need surgery and is likely out for the season, according to a source.
Copeland was injured in the second half of the game, went to the locker room and did not return. Copeland had been a key special teams player for Detroit as well as a player who could play both linebacker and defensive end.
The injury was first reported by NFL Network.
He had been lining up with the No. 1 defense as a SAM linebacker at points during training camp and had been in a competition with Antwione Williams. At defensive end, Copeland was a depth pass-rusher whose importance was growing with Kerry Hyder's Achilles' injury, also suffered against the Colts.
Editor's Picks Lions say Hyder has 'significant Achilles injury' Lions' breakout star Kerry Hyder sustained a "significant Achilles injury" Sunday after he lost his footing and fell to the ground during the team's preseason game against the Colts, coach Jim Caldwell said.
Now, the Lions are likely to be without both of them for a long time.
The 26-year-old Copeland joined the Lions in 2015, one of the few players to be signed following the NFL's first veteran combine. He played in every game for the Lions over the past two seasons, making 19 tackles with a half-sack and forced fumble.
With Copeland out, rookie Jalen Reeves-Maybin could have a larger special teams role and this could open up a roster spot for another primary special teams player.
Detroit now has four defensive ends -- or players who can play the position -- dealing with injuries: Ezekiel Ansah remains on PUP; Cornelius Washington has been injured throughout camp; Hyder has a "significant" injury according to Lions coach Jim Caldwell and Copeland. Armonty Bryant, another defensive end, is suspended for the first four games of the regular season.
Dallas County Public School Superintendent Hattie Shelton was not surprised by the ‘C' score handed down Thursday by the state department of education's annual report card.
Two public school districts have had a chance to digest the scores handed down. One school district did okay while another.. not so good, but both say the letter grade doesn't tell the whole story.
Meadowview Elementary School in the Selma City School District is the only school in the system that earned a 'C,' a high 'C' at 76.
School teacher Ashley Strickland, of coruse, is happy but tempered her excitement over the fact the remaining 10 schools didn't fare as well. The entire school system consisting of 11 schools earned an overall average of a 'D.'
"We're excited but we still want to look at our weaknesses and make sure we target those," said Strickland.
It wasn't that long ago when the school district was under a state intervention.
"I'm disappointed," said Selma City Public School Superintendent Dr. Avis Williams.
Williams just started her superintendent's job back in the fall. Although not pleased with the D score average, neither is Williams discouraged. In fact, the Selma City School District was just two points away from earning a 'C.'
"The letter grade does not define us in the school district, in the work we are doing to continue to make improvements on student outcome," said Williams.
A few blocks away at the Dallas County School Board office, Shelton was encouraged by the school district's 'C' average but not at all satisfied, particularly three schools getting an 'F' on the state's report card; Brantley Elementary, Tipton Durant Middle School and Salem Elementary.
"I think the root causes is some of our students have learning challenges. I make an effort to share with my staff articles, research of what works," said Shelton.
Two school districts, two different grade averages but both striving for the same goal, improving those scores. Here's a breakdown of the overall letter grades on the state report card: the Dallas County School District had three 'Cs,' four 'Ds,' and three 'Fs,'. Selma City Schools scored one 'C,' 6 'Ds,' and three 'Fs.'
The second-year superintendent did her homework and calculated the scores herself a few days before the state score came out and arrived at the same conclusion.
Shelton says she accepts the results but not the notion of being satisfied. Shelter has encouraged her teachers and students to hang in there and don't give up.
Dallas County has 11 public schools and a little more than 3,000 students.

A: The business was started a year ago as an offshoot of our other business in the sign industry. We started it because we saw a marketplace for people to design their own signage on demand. We have learned over time that many of our customers love the extra level of service we provide with regards to artwork. Many times our clients come to us and they have a vision but they do not have the means to express what is in their head, so thats where we come in.
Q: What is your most popular service or product?
A: Our most popular product is our fundraising packages that we work with high school boosters on. These include sponsor banner, yard signs, monster heads and more. We work with booster clubs and athletic departments to help them fundraise through the sale of our produces at a reduced cost.
Q: What is special about your business? What do you want your business to be known for?
A: Our business is full service. We work with customers to truly bring their ideas to life. We do not just want to be the corner printer, we want to assist our customers in developing their brand through amazing graphic art and unique signage. We want to be known as the company that goes above and beyond to bring great color to the world through signs.
Q: Whats something no one knows about your business?
A: People might not know that we have a great family atmosphere at work. Lunch is provided for the entire team and cooked fresh every day. We use this time to unwind and get to know each other on a more personal level than the work day allows. Having lunch together is a great representation of our culture. We also have a really cute mascot, named Sawyer after one of our coworkers sons. Sawyer is a graphic character we created. He is on collateral materials, and all over our office. We just cant get enough of him.

The Navajo Nation Library is looking for help to digitally preserve thousands of hours of oral histories that were once thought lost to the world.
The library is currently petitioning the Navajo Nation Council for $230,520 to digitize the oral history collection. That would cover the year-long process of transferring the audio tapes into a digital format as well as cataloguing the collection so that historians will finally know for sure what information the tapes contain in addition to preserving language and dialects for future study.
While the library is considering turning to other grants to preserve the tapes if necessary the library wants the funding to come from the Navajo Nation Council because it would allow the library to maintain control over how the tapes are preserved and presented.
Back in the 1960s, the Navajo Culture Center of the Office of Navajo Economic Opportunity turned to technology to preserve the oral histories of the Navajo people.
Over the course of the next decade, the center recorded thousands of hours of oral histories, logging stories, songs and details about life as experienced by many Navajo elders.
The original recordings were originally done with reel-to-reel tape and, for most of their existence, were sealed away in fireproof containers. Their contents were never completely cataloged or made widely available.
In the 1970's some funding was made available by the federal government to transfer the reel-to-reel recordings to cassette tapes to better preserve the audio. Funding ran out long before the project was completed and the cassette tapes were destroyed many years later in a 1998 fire at the Dine College Shiprock Campus.
AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  The Latest on the Austin police chief saying a repaired Ford SUV flunked a carbon monoxide test  then later contradicting that previous statement (all times local):
6:15 p.m.
The Austin police chief says a Ford Explorer SUV that the auto company repaired for a return to service with his department actually doesn't appear to have had exhaust containing carbon monoxide seeping into it  despite his saying earlier that it did.
Interim Police Chief Brian Manley said Friday that during a test of three SUVs repaired by Ford Motor Company, one tested positive for carbon monoxide.

But Manley told The Austin American-Statesman hours later that additional testing revealed alarms may have activated for some other reason.
He says: "We do not believe this issue is a Ford issue or related to the repairs they have done."
Ford responded to Manley's original comments by saying the methods it used to address Austin's carbon monoxide problem "have worked well."
__
3 p.m.
Ford Motor Company says "the methods and parts we've utilized to repair Austin's vehicles have worked well to address" carbon monoxide concerns  even though the city's police department says one such repaired Ford Explorer is being pulled off the road because of continuing problems.
Interim Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said that during a Friday test of three SUVs repaired by Ford, one tested positive for carbon monoxide.
Ford spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt responded the automaker "was not provided with information on the levels of CO detected but we are ready to inspect any vehicle."
She said the company has "been happy to collaborate with Austin" police on SUV repairs.
This summer, Austin police took nearly 400 Explorers off patrol because of carbon monoxide concerns.
___
12 p.m.
A Ford Explorer SUV that the auto company repaired for a return to service with the Austin police department has again been pulled off the street because exhaust containing carbon monoxide was seeping into it.
Interim Police Chief Brian Manley said that during a Friday test of three SUVs repaired by Ford Motor Company, one tested positive for carbon monoxide. The officer driving it was treated but didn't require hospitalization.
The story was first reported by The Austin-American Statesman. A police department spokeswoman confirmed the chief's comments for The Associated Press.
Austin pulled nearly 400 Explorers off patrol in July because of carbon monoxide concerns. Police departments across the country use Explorers and several have also pulled them off the road. Ford has said it is looking into the problem.
Yeezy is a “lifestyle” and Kanye West wants his people on board 100%. That's the word from insiders relating to the rapper's two-year relationship with manager Scooter Braun. The two parted ways professionally amicably this week, as reported in TMZ and Hits.
Not one to participate in the traditional tropes of the music industry, a source says West gave his core team, which includes attorney Peter Paterno, an ultimatum: to conduct all business through his Yeezy organization. A suggestion to restructure his management and bring Braun's services in-house was turned down, though the two may continue to work on other projects together between the two companies. “They parted on good terms,” says a source.
The split comes at a challenging time for West, who says he has lined up five albums for release in five consecutive weeks in May and June — one by himself, one in collaboration with Kid Cudi, and three that he produced, by Nas, Teyana Taylor and Pusha T. Until his abrupt return to Twitter earlier this month, the MC had kept a relatively low profile since the last 21 dates of his “Saint Pablo” tour were cancelled in November of 2016 after he was hospitalized in Los Angeles for psychiatric evaluation. West's behavior during the tour had been erratic and included several pro-Donald Trump onstage comments as well as his abrupt departure from the stage during New York's Panorama Festival when he learned that his wife, Kim Kardashian, had been robbed in Paris.
Currently, the rapper does not have a manager or an attorney representing him.
It's not the first time Braun and a major client have split up. In February 2016, he and Ariana Grande parted ways; she returned to the fold just seven months later. Braun has since steered the Grande ship with a firm hand, helping to lead her toward hit singles, a massive tour and a remarkably poised and generous response to the terrorist bombing outside her concert in Manchester, England last May; just two weeks later, she headlined the “One Love Manchester” benefit concert in the city, largely organized by Braun, which also featured Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Take That, Liam Gallagher, Marcus Mumford and Liam Gallagher. The concert raised more than $13 million for victims of the attack. Braun founded SB Presents in 2007 and manages Bieber, dance-music stars Martin Garrix and Steve Angello, model Karli Kloss and others.
During his time with Braun, West launched a successful partnership with Adidas and saw his highest grossing tour in “Saint Pablo.”
Ilamabad- Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) has expedited its mailing of books' process in order to ensure that the students, who enrolled themselves for spring 2017 semester, get the books well before time, so that they could do their academic assignments within stipulated schedule.
According to an official of the AIOU here Wednesday, the text-books and study materials have been sent so far to 392,697 students enrolled in Matric, FA, BA, BEd (Old and Fresh) programs. Mailing of Post-graduate programs is in process and it will be completed by the end of this month, University's mailing department announced.
The university has strengthened its delivery system, ensuring timely availability of books to the students while improving quality education.
Qualitative improvement was brought about in the process of admissions, examinations and announcement of results and issuance of degree, mainly through technology-based automation system. Special attention is also paid on consolidating students' support system that brings very positive results in terms of admissions and enhancing trust of the students in the varsity's teaching system.
The mailing process has been expedited in collaboration with Pakistan Post, which has set up its permanent office here at the university's main campus. The Post office will ensure books-delivery within 36-hours of its dispatch.
\Timely mailing of course books to students has been a challenge especially with the increasing enrolment this year. Meanwhile, a tracking system has been established to facilitate the students to check the status of books.
The new computerized tracking system has recently been developed through which the student using website can simply enter his/her roll number and registration number to track the mailing package.
In order to transform the mailing system, it was also decided to send text message to students on their cell phone as soon as books are dispatched on given postal address. As per current practices, all books are sent to the students through postal services. For facilitating the students, postage registry number and roll numbers have been kept same.
The students have been advised to contact their relevant post offices in case of delay in the books' delivery. The relevant staff has also been advised to ensure accuracy in the mailing system to avoid any inconvenience at the students' level.

WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a high-level international meeting on religious freedom, he announced Tuesday, putting the issue at the heart of the US human rights agenda.
The “Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom” will be held between the chief diplomats of “like-minded governments” in Washington on July 25 and 26. US President Donald Trump's administration has been criticized for downplaying human rights in international relations in favor of seeking America's economic interest. But Christian conservatives in the cabinet, such as Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, have been outspoken in support of religious freedom around the world.
“The ministerial will also be my first to host as a secretary of state, and that's very intentional,” Pompeo told reporters at the launch of the annual US religious freedom report.
“Religious freedom is indeed a universal human right that I will fight for, one that our team at the department will continue to fight for, and one that I know President Trump will continue to fight for.
“The United States will not stand by as spectators. We will get in the ring and stand in solidarity with every individual who seeks to enjoy their most fundamental of human rights.”
The report, compiled every year by US envoys around the world, covers the state of religious freedom in 200 countries and territories around the world.
In announcing its release, the State Department insisted that, while the report itself is meant to be a simple objective account, it does inform US government decisions.
- Watch list -
In particular, it will serve as a guide when Pompeo decides whether and when to update the US list of “Countries of Particular Concern” - those that most egregiously limit freedom of conscience.
Currently those countries are China, Eritrea, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - with Pakistan on a watch list.
But, while the United States does protest persecution in these states, the list has not stopped Washington maintaining extremely warm and close ties with Saudi Arabia, for example.
And the US envoy for religious freedom, Ambassador Sam Brownback, was forced to defend America's credibility to issue such a report in the light of Trump's efforts to halt or limit US visas for Muslim travellers.
Rights watchdogs were extremely guarded in their response to the report, concerned that the administration's evident enthusiasm for religious rights in some countries might be used to distract from broader concerns.
“It's clear Secretary Pompeo intends to use this report as a way to elevate the importance of religious freedom, which could be positive as long as doing so does not minimize other rights concerns and truly protects victims of all religious persecution,” said Sarah Margon, Washington Director at Human Rights Watch.
And she warned against the administration allowing itself to be “manipulated by ideologues” at home or abroad.
At the launch, special envoy Brownback made particular mention of the fate of Myanmar's Rohingya - a Muslim minority group that he said faced the “ethnic cleansing of a religious minority.”
“I don't think you've seen progress taking place there in the country. If anything, the administration there is doubling now its effort,” he said of Myanmar's authorities.
Brownback also warned that China's Muslim Uighurs and Tibetan Buddhists are facing persecution, along with the country's Falun Gong and Christian minority groups.
But, while acknowledging that the situation in Saudi Arabia - where non-Muslim worship is illegal - is bad, Brownback said he saw an opening for reform under Washington's ally Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.
“I'm hopeful you're going to start seeing change coming out of that country and that you are starting to see change come out of Saudi Arabia,” he said.

The Mountain Goats started out as just John Darnielle, an acoustic guitar, and a boom box. Over the years, the project has grown, adding more members and becoming musically lusher and more ambitious, to the point where Goths, the excellent album that the band released earlier this year, did not feature one single guitar. But on a new EP that he surprise-released in the middle of the night last night, Darnielle has gone back to his roots, offering up four new songs, with just him and an acoustic guitar.
Darnielle recorded the Marsh Witch Visions EP with producer Scott Solter. Its four songs are all based, in some way, on the life of Ozzy Osborne, who's been an inspiration to Darnielle for a long time. (Darnielle published a great novella about Black Sabbath's Master Of Reality in 2008.) The EP also features a demo version of the Goths track “Rain In Soho,” and Darnielle is offering it up as a pay-what-you-want download. Below, stream the EP and read what Darnielle has written about it on the band's Bandcamp page.

Yep. We've been doing this for 24 long weeks. The Chicago Blackhawks record currently stands at 30-34-9, for 69 points. This is good for 24th place in the league. If you had the ability to go back one year and then look ahead to today, you probably wouldn't believe it. After all, the Hawks have made the playoffs the past nine years in a row, and finished the regular season on top of the Central Division with 109 points and 50 wins last year. Not to mention those three Cups. We all thought the Hawks might not be as good this year, but no one saw them being this bad.
Yet this is the state of affairs as we sit today. It's getting harder and harder to watch the Hawks as this season winds down. Because even when this not-so-good team plays well, they rarely manage a win anymore. It's rock bottom right now. All we can do is try to look for the silver lining, and build for the future. With that in mind, let's discuss this past week's matchups.
Blackhawks matchups this past week:
@ Winnipeg Jets, Thursday, 3/15. Loss 6-2
@ Buffalo Sabres, Saturday, 3/17. Loss 5-3
Vs. St. Louis Blues, Sunday, 3/18. Loss 5-4 in OT
What Went Right for the Blackhawks-Forward Depth
This past Thursday, it was Brandon Saad and Patrick Sharp with goals. On Saturday, defenseman Jordan Oesterle, Tomas Jurco, and Jonathan Toews all scored. Sunday's contest included four goals from the Hawks: three from Alex DeBrincat, and one from David Kampf.
That's seven different players scoring goals, and pretty much every line represented. If you delve deeper and look at assists, 11 players contributed helpers throughout the last three games. The first line of Saad, Toews, and Kane led the way, as they're supposed to do. An argument can be made that loading up on the first line is at the expense of the other three lines. But the kids and company have proven them wrong, finding ways to contribute. And they're doing it on their own, without the support of the big boys. This is a good sign for the future.
What Went Wrong for the Blackhawks-Can't Close it Out
Um, they lost? Yeah, that's the simple answer to what went wrong. But here's the thing. The Hawks scored first in two of the last three games. They were winning in the third period in two of the last three games.
This team has forgotten how to win. Even when they're winning and playing well, they can't close it out. They find a way to lose. Whether it be a defensive breakdown, a soft goal, or a missed offensive opportunity, they always let the opponent back in the game. If they're going to go anywhere next year, the Hawks need to rekindle that will to win.
Blackhawks Goal of the Week
Well, well, well. I'm sure it comes as no surprise that we highlight DeBrincat's hat trick from Sunday night. The irony here is Brinksy was demoted from the second line to the third line for the last two contests. Perhaps it had something to do with him not scoring for 13 straight games. But he brought that to an end with a power play goal and then two more scores for good measure. Here's his third tally of the night.
﻿
This marks DeBrincat's third hat trick in his rookie season. He's now tied with Kane for the team lead of 25 goals on the season. Kudos to DeBrincat for making things happen with fellow linemate Jurco. But think what he could, and will, do with a more skilled partner. Next year, my friends.

Other Blackhawks News and Notes
Five Hawks' players have 20 or more goals this season. As mentioned earlier, Kane and DeBrincat lead with 25 goals. Toews, Nick Schmaltz, and Artem Anisimov each have 20 goals. Kane and Toews have now scored 20+ goals in 11 consecutive NHL seasons.
Defensive breakdowns are by far one of the biggest problems for the Hawks. This could easily be part of the “what went wrong” section. Last week it was Duncan Keith being a turnover machine, and this week the new third pairing of Oesterle and Connor Murphy especially struggled.
On a positive note, Jan Rutta played on the first pairing with Keith for the last two games. He stepped up with a solid defensive effort, and has taken his increased ice time in stride.
J-F Berube came in to relieve Anton Forsberg after Forsberg's exceptionally bad start on Thursday. He also took the net both Saturday and Sunday in back-to-back tilts. He's put up a valiant effort, especially considering the defense in front of him. But it still isn't good enough. He has a tendency to give up a lot of rebounds, as well as soft goals at the most inopportune times.
Matthew Highmore left Sunday's game in the second period after crashing hard into the boards. He did not return.
What's on Tap for the Blackhawks
Are you still with me, boys and girls? Are you going to see it to the end, and watch the rest of the season? Yeah, it's depressing, but there are silver linings.
Debrincat is the silver lining #Blackhawks — Sean Fitzgerald (@Diesal3426) March 19, 2018
The Hawks meet the Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday and the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday at the United Center. They head to New York to play the Islanders on Saturday. We're getting down to the wire. There's only three short weeks left to watch Chicago Blackhawks' hockey. If you can still stomach it. Hey, maybe they'll win a game or two.

The March for Our Lives has seen so many simultaneous marches pop up on its site that their march map is now epic. There are 817 events worldwide planned for Saturday, and so many are in the United States that the March for Our Lives map showing events near you is blanketed with red pins. The odds are you're not far from one of the gun control marches and protests.
The original march was conceived of and is being executed by surviving students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, where the school shooting occurred on Valentine's Day. They planned to head to Washington, D.C., and invited activists across the country and world to join them in solidarity. And it seems like plenty heard their call.
The map allows you to search for the closest events to you using a ZIP code or city name. Even searches in rural Iowa offers several options that are within an hour's drive.
If you click on one of the events, it gives you the address and start time. It also explains exactly what the local march will consist of. Some are more stationary protests with speakers, others include voter registration drives. Each one is different, as organized by the local organizers. You can click on RSVP to let them know you're coming. That also ensures you get updated with the latest information.
The biggest march will likely be the one in Washington, D.C. Organizers have estimated that as many as 500,000 people could attend, driving, busing, and flying in from all over the East Coast and beyond. The march there will start on the Mall and then head down Pennsylvania Avenue. There aren't any adults scheduled to speak — only students who are affected by the issue.
That turnout estimate of 500,000 could be low, given the success of the recent school walkout. About 3,000 schools took part, sending a clear signal that there are young people across the country dedicated to pushing for change on this issue.
Officials are prepared for the event in D.C. to be larger than the Women's March in 2017. That was the second busiest day in history for the region's transit agencies. Nearly half a million were thought to have attended.
You can find detailed information on the D.C. march online. They show where to be and when, what to bring, what to leave at home, and more. If you're thinking of attending, don't miss the FAQ. It answers just about every question under the sun and even explains how you can volunteer to help.
The planners have raised the vast majority of their $3.8 million goal on their GoFundMe. Half the money raised will go to the march. Famous donors include Oprah Winfrey and George Clooney.
Organizer Cameron Kasky, a Stoneman Douglas student, created the GoFundMe. "The funds will be spent on the incredibly difficult and expensive process that is organizing a march like this," Kasky wrote. "We have people making more specific plans, but for now know that this is for the march and everything left over will be going to the victims' funds." Ultimately about half of the money is expected to go to victims via the Broward Education Foundation.
The fundraising for the local marches depends on who has done the organization.
Kasky has been active on Twitter even as the final details come together. "Seeing people all over the world prepare their signs for the marches, setting up their transportation (checkout what @lyft is doing) & getting their friends and families involved brings a tear to my eye," Kasky wrote. "This is a time of beautiful, beautiful unity. Be proud."
No matter which corner of the country you're in, you can be part of that unity on Saturday.
Three checks, totaling $1.9-million, were on Tuesday presented to the Paix Bouche, Calibishie, and Bense-Anse de Mai-Anse Soldat village councils for home repairs in the wake of Hurricane Maria.
The Paix Bouche Village Council received $640,800 and will benefit 83 residents; the Calibishie Village Council received $972,000 which will benefit 92 villagers, while the Bense-Anse de Mai-Anse Soldat Village Council received $303,500 to benefit 35 members of the communities.
“As you would know that 95 percent of the housing stock in the entire country was impacted by Hurricane Maria,” Roslyn Paul, MP for the Paix Bouche Constituency said. “And the communities of Paix Bouche, Bense Anse de Mai, Anse Soldat, Calibishie, no less, we had our fair share. We were devastated just like every community in Dominica, particularly in housing.”
She added that close to $1-million has already used to address housing issues in the constituency.
“We have already disbursed just under $1-million between February and now that benefited 91 persons across the three communities,” she stated. “So work in ongoing. I also would want to thank the contractors because some of our contractors are working very quickly, particularly those who for a reasonable price have put up homes for the vulnerable people, the displaced senior people particularly.”
Paul said housing continues to be a priority for the government of Dominica.
“We need to ensure that we put people back under their roof, to ensure that they are secure, they are safe, that we can get rid of the tarpaulins, we can get rid of the temporary roofs that were put on, some of them are still leaking…” she stated.
She added that the Paix Bouche Constituency will be benefiting from the 1,000 homes promised by Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit.
Rawalpindi-Pakistan and Nepal share tourist attractions including mountains, culture, and cuisine. Now it is time to project a good image of the region including Pakistan and Nepal as peaceful countries, he said.
Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) Managing Director (MD) Chaudhry Abdul Ghafoor expressed these views during a meeting with the Nepalese Ambassador Sewa Lamsal Adhikari here on Wednesday. Pakistan is a land of opportunities, he said.
He said Buddhist remains in Pakistan are sacred for Nepali nationals but due to lack of knowledge and publicity, tourist flow from Nepal to Pakistan is very low.
“We are making efforts to ease the visa formalities as well as an introduction of visa on arrivals facilities to group tourists through designated tour operators including Nepal,” Ghafoor added. The Government of Pakistan is ready to provide maximum security and cooperation in this regard, he said.
The MD said that they are working on promotion of tourism, sports, and entertainment. Nepal and Pakistan will promote health tourism especially, he said.
Islamabad City Tour Bus Service would be launched soon with an inaugural ceremony at Pak-China Centre Islamabad, he said. New motels would be added to the existing chain of accommodation facilities of PTDC, the official said. Both the countries should exchange lists of tour operators dealing in mountaineering and trekking to jointly promote this common attraction, Ghafoor said. He invited the ambassador to visit PTDC Head Office and the Farm House in addition to Northern Areas.
The Nepalese ambassador said there are no two views that Pakistan is a beautiful country and she had already visited Swat valley and soon she would be visiting Gilgit-Baltistan. She said we wish to work together and portray a soft tourist friendly peaceful image of the region by using the SAARC forum.
She hoped that both governments would cooperate in this regard. Adhikari told that a delegation from Nepal is expected to visit Pakistan from July 5. Pakistani tourism stakeholders would be invited to a meeting with the delegation, he said.
PTDC MD assured all possible assistance for the delegation and also said that the ambassador's visit to Gilgit-Baltistan would be arranged by PTDC.

Fed raises key rate and unveils plan to reduce bond holdings
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
FILE - In this Monday, April 10, 2017, file photo, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks on stage as part of a conversation put on by the Gerald R.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate for the third time in six months, providing its latest vote of confidence in a slow-growing but durable economy. The Fed also announced plans to start gradually paring its bond holdings later this year, which could cause long-term rates to rise.
The increase in the short-term rate by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and slightly better returns for savers.
The central bank chose to raise rates again despite an economic slowdown at the start of 2017, which it predicts will prove temporary. It foresees one additional rate hike this year, unchanged from its previous forecast. It gave no hint of when that might occur.
The latest Fed rate hike, announced in a statement after a policy meeting, comes as the U.S. economy is growing only sluggishly. Even so, many of the barometers the Fed monitors most closely have given it the confidence to keep gradually lifting still-low borrowing rates toward their historic norms.
Though it assesses the overall economy, the Fed's mandates are to maximize employment and stabilize prices. And hiring in the United States remains solid if slowing, with employment at a 16-year-low of 4.3 percent — even below the level that the Fed associates with full employment.
Inflation has been more problematic, having long stayed below the central bank's 2 percent target rate. Recent data have suggested that inflation may even be slowing further. But Fed officials have said they think inflation will soon pick up along with the economy.
That said, no one expects the Fed's rate hikes to turn aggressive. If nothing else, the chronically low inflation and the political fights and uncertainty in Washington — over investigations into Russia's ties to President Donald Trump's campaign, health care legislation, tax-cut plans and about whether Congress will raise the nation's borrowing limit and pass a new budget — could lead the Fed to raise rates more slowly than it otherwise would.
Uncertainty also surrounds the membership of the Fed's own policy committee. Trump is expected soon to fill three vacancies on the Fed's influential board, and those new members, depending on who they are, could alter its rate-setting policy.
Fed officials have concluded that the economy, now entering its ninth year of expansion, no longer needs the ultra-low borrowing rates they supplied beginning in the Great Recession.
The central bank kept its benchmark rate at a record low near zero starting in late 2008 to try to boost consumer and business borrowing and lift the country out of the worst downturn since the 1930s. It finally raised the rate modestly in December 2015, then waited a year do so again. It acted again in March.
At the depths of the recession, the Fed began buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to try to depress long-term loan rates. That effort resulted in a five-fold increase in its portfolio to $4.5 trillion. The Fed said Wednesday that it would eventually allow a small amount of bonds to mature without being replaced — an amount that would gradually rise as markets adjusted to the process.
Some news reports have mentioned leading candidates to fill the three vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board. They include Randal Quarles, a top Treasury official in two past Republican administrations, for the vice chairman's job of overseeing bank regulation. Marvin Goodfriend, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, has been mentioned for another board spot, and Robert Jones, chief executive of Old National Bancorp in Indiana, reportedly is a candidate for a board seat designated for a community banker.
The betting is that the administration will choose officials who will tilt the Fed toward a more "hawkish" stance. Hawks tend to worry that rates kept too low for too long could escalate inflation or fuel asset bubbles. By contrast, "doves" favor the direction taken under Chair Janet Yellen, favoring relatively low rates to maximize employment.
Yellen, the first woman to lead the Fed, is serving a term that will end in February. So far, Trump has sent conflicting signals about whether he plans to nominate her for a second term.

Bruce Cockburn,
“Bone on Bone”
(True North Records)
This politically aware singer-songwriter may have enjoyed a brief flirtation with fame and fortune when the subtly memorable “Wondering Where The Lions Are” soared into the higher reaches of the U.S. singles charts in 1980, but for much of his lengthy career he's been something of a cult hero, delighting his devoted coterie of fans with material which often reflects his passionate interest in environmentalism and human rights. There's certainly no danger of Cockburn opting to slip on some comfy slippers and grow old gracefully on the evidence presented by the great man's 33rd album as he emerges from a lengthy self-imposed silence with a batch of freshly minted creations led by “Forty Years in the Wilderness” and his epic six minute tribute to the work of maverick poet Al Purdy, “3 Al Purdys.”
“American Road Trip”
(Universal Music)
The compilers of this highly listenable 3 CD set rather grandiosely describe it as “A 60 track journey through the heart of America,” and the contents certainly showcase a whole host of radio friendly rock and pop gems from the seventies and eighties, including, rather puzzlingly, contributions from British bands such as Whitesnake, Rainbow and Manfred Mann's Earth Band. As is the way with anthologies such as this the track listing juxtaposes much loved archive gems from such unlikely bedfellows as Kenny Rogers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Blondie and Iggy Pop to remind listeners of an era when genuinely memorable material dominated the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.
Rafal Blechacz,
“Johann Sebastian Bach”
(Deutsche Grammophon)
This absorbing vehicle for the talents of Rafal Blechacz finds the young Polish pianist applying his technical expertise to some of the most attractive works in Bach's keyboard repertoire. The “A minor Fantasia and Fugue” and “Italian Concerto” provide two of the musical highlights, and this stunning package also finds Blechacz breathing new life into the ever popular Dame Myra Hess arrangement of “Jesus, Joy of Man's Desiring.”
Arcade Fire,
“Everything Now”
(Columbia)
The fifth album from Montreal art-rockers Arcade Fire is an occasionally thrilling affair which finds the band experimenting with a variety of seemingly disparate genres from electro funk and synth pop to the expansive electronica of one of the stand-out tracks, “We Don't Deserve Love.” The familiar marriage of uplifting musical content and distinctly downbeat lyrics still permeates much of their best work, and although “Everything Now” is by no means an unqualified success it still demands your undivided attention nonetheless.
MANDI BAHAUDDIN/Sheikhupura/KASUR-Three martyrs of the Lahore suicide blast including the acting Dig (operations) were laid to rest in their native graveyards here on Tuesday.

BOSTON—The New England Holocaust Memorial in Boston has been vandalized for the second time this summer.
Police said a 17-year-old Malden, Mass. boy smashed a glass panel on the memorial Monday evening. He was detained by two bystanders until officers arrived on the scene. Police said he will be charged with wilful and malicious destruction of property. The police department's civil rights unit also is investigating to determine if additional charges are warranted.
It is the second time the memorial has been damaged in the past few months.
In June, police said James Isaac used a rock to shatter a roughly 9-foot-tall (3-meter-tall) glass panel on one of the memorial's six 54-foot-high (16-meter-high) towers. Isaac has pleaded not guilty to vandalism charges.
The six glass towers are lit internally and etched with millions of numbers that represent tattoos on the arms of many Jews sent to Nazi death camps.
LONDON (Reuters) - Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp defended his team selection after Everton snatched a late point in Sunday's Merseyside derby.

The German made six changes to the starting line-up that crushed Spartak Moscow 7-0 in a midweek Champions League group tie, leaving first-choice Brazilians Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino on the bench for the game at Anfield.
Dominic Solanke made his second league start up front instead.
Liverpool dominated possession and Mohamed Salah swept in a stunning goal just before the break, with the Egyptian then replaced by Firmino in the 67th minute.
Coutinho, who had scored a hat-trick on Wednesday, came on for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the 78th minute - a minute after Everton captain Wayne Rooney had levelled from the penalty spot for his first goal in a Merseyside derby.
“That's my job. That I make decisions before I know they are right,” said Klopp in a prickly interview with Sky Sports television.
”And afterwards it's your job to say I‘m not right, no problem with that.
Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Everton - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - December 10, 2017 Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp speaks with referee Craig Pawson after the match Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith
“Yes, I was sure this was the right decision. We brought Roberto Firmino on for Mo Salah. We could have scored before, we could have scored afterwards, we could have scored all the time. We lived more or less in their box,” added the German.
“And obviously we didn't do it. I have to take that. I have no problem with that.”
Liverpool's next outing is a relatively comfortable-looking home match against relegation-threatened West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday.

In Klopp's defence, Liverpool saw their title challenge collapse in January last year with numerous injuries and the manager will want to avoid a similar occurrence with Champions League knockout games to come.
A point from a match that always fires up the local passions was hardly a disaster and Liverpool at least continued two fine runs of form.
Klopp's side are now unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions, and stretched their unbeaten run against Everton in all competitions to a record-equalling 15 games. Everton have not won at Anfield since 1999.
Despite that, the circumstances of the penalty - with Dejan Lovren paying the price for a push on Dominic Calvert-Lewin - left the German showing his anger in his TV interview.
“We can stop the interview because I only want to talk to people who have a little bit of understanding about football. I‘m sorry. I‘m really... I cannot believe,” said Klopp when told by the reporter that it had looked like a penalty.
KARACHI - Police Welfare/Benevolent Fund Board has approved Rs290 million for the widows of late policemen. This was informed in a meeting of “Sindh Police Welfare” presided over by the Inspector General of Police Sindh AD Khawaja at Central Police Office Karachi, said a statement issued here on Wednesday. The meeting was attended by the Additional IG Sindh, Additional IG Special Branch, DIG Headquarters Sindh and others.
Additional IG Welfare Sindh briefed the meeting on the measures taken for police welfare and other departmental matters.
He informed that the welfare board had approved Rs290 million for the widows of late policemen and Rs3000 would be given to each widow per month.
The said amount had been allocated for the period of December 2015 to April 2017.
He said that Benevolent Account of Sindh Police had been opened at AG Sindh. The IG Sindh, on the occasion, directed to form a policy to provide the widows with funds whether through ATMs, Easypaisa or any other means for fair and transparent distribution.
A D Khawaja also thanked the Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah for the approval of Rs 100 million for policemen who severely injured in the line of duty.
He directed the AIG Estate Management to furnish a report relating to the properties of Sindh Police and their agreements.
In April, President Donald Trump announced his administration could allow for the sale of E15 all year long.
If this cheaper alternative to gasoline is allowed to be sold year-round, David Hudak, general manager of POET Biorefining, said ethanol is ready to take it on.
Each year, POET produces 1.8 billion gallons of ethanol in seven states, according to Hudak. With more than 200 biofuels facilities across the country, he has no doubts on supplying the demand.
Of the 1,300 gas stations that supply E15, Hudak said they will offer it more quickly than stations that need to build infrastructure to provide it, and retailers need to be engaged in the process.
“Once those retailers come onboard, and then we get thousands of stations, then you'll see the product fly,” he said on AgDay.
Currently E15 is banned during the summer months because of the belief it contributes to smog.
Will consumers end up purchasing E15? Hear Hudak's thoughts on AgDay above.

Source: Consider returning SMM to Mawere, Govt urged | The Herald
Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter
Government should seek investors for Shabani Mashaba Mines or return its ownership to Mr Mutumwa Mawere as part of measures to resume operations, parliamentarians in the National Assembly said on Thursday.
The legislators said this while contributing to a motion moved by Zvishavane — Ngezi representative Cde John Holder on the plight of the former workers of the mine.
Buhera South representative Cde Joseph Chinotimba, said Government should consider giving the mine back to Mr Mawere.
“We should return the assets so that he can resuscitate the mine. We should forgive him for whatever he did because as a nation we are a forgiving nation that is why we forgave Ian Smith despite his killing of thousands of Zimbabweans.
“I hope the Vice President (Emmerson Mnangagwa), who is here should take the matter up with Cabinet,” Cde Chinotimba said.
Cde Holder said the mine had collapsed despite Government's intentions to resuscitate it.
“An indigenous Zimbabwean had purchased this mine now it's dead, the infrastructure and houses are going down and the workers have not been paid,” Cde Holder said.
“Government gave the mine to the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation, but it has no capacity to run that mine. Government should look for serious investors because when it was taken over it (SMM) had debts but they were running and were able to pay off some these debts and contribute to the GDP.
“Since it was put under reconstruction together with its 26 subsidiaries and all of them have been stripped and sold.”
He added resuscitating the mine would not only benefit the residents of Mashava but Zimbabwe as a whole.
“Mutumwa Mawere was born in Gutu and there was no talk of the indigenisation (policy) there.
“We need to resuscitate SMM so that it not only benefits people from Zvishavane and Mashava but Zimbabwe as a whole,” Cde Holder said.
Southerton representative Mr Gift Chimanikire, said the closure of the mine had resulted in an increase in social decadence.
“What is happening at SMM and Mashaba Mine is a tragedy. The social decadence is tragic. The issues of child marriages are common as parents had to marry off their daughters to subsist,” Mr Chimanikire said.
He added that the ZMDC could not run the mine.
“ZMDC has a number of mines but none of them are running profitably,” he said. “What is important is the social welfare of the residents of SMM and Government should review its decision to pack SMM and Mashaba under ZMDC.”
Uzumba legislator Cde Simbaneuta Mudarikwa, said it was necessary to recall former workers and managers to resuscitate operations of the mines.
Government put SMM under reconstruction after it accumulated huge debt but the company has failed to resume operations and has been put under the ZMDC.

CLOSE Larry Bohannan and Shad Powers discuss the last day of the 2017 ANA Inspiration Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun

It was the single dumbest thing in golf.
No, not the stroke-and-distance rule on out of bounds, or the elimination of the anchored putting stroke. It was the fact that golf's ruling bodies believed someone a thousand miles away with the benefit of high-definition television and multiple replays should somehow be allowed to interject themselves into a golf tournament as a volunteer rules official.
Time and again, golf subjected its players to penalties brought to the attention of callers who were off-site and somehow had that one television angle that made a violation more obvious than it would have been to the player itself.
More: Slow play can infuriate most golfers in the desert
But that won't happen anymore. The United States Golf Association and the R and A, among others who were talking about the issue, have decided that it will no longer allow callers to be rule officials. Instead, only those on-site, players, caddies, rules officials and fans, will be the only ones who have a chance to report a potential violation.
Of course the new rule is too late to save players who have be struck by the long-distance callers. That includes Lexi Thompson, who is now perhaps the most famous of the players to be hammered by an off-site ruling. It was the Thompson incident at the ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage in April that started the landslide of opinion about callers and rulings. If you remember, Thompson was hit with two two-shot penalties on Sunday of that tournament after a caller questioned Thompson's marking of a ball on a short putt on Saturday. That caused Thomson to be penalized two shots for the improper ball mark and two more shots for signing an incorrect Saturday scorecard. That incorrect scorecard penalty – a player used to be disqualified for an incorrect scorecard – was often the result of the time lag between a viewer call and the enforcement of a penalty.
Thompson eventually lost the ANA Inspiration to So Yeon Ryu in a playoff. The Thompson penalties were correct, but her teary response and the absurdity of allowing callers to influence rulings at a major championship certainly gave the sport a black eye. Comparisons to callers trying to get holding penalties called in football games or strikes turned into balls in baseball were abundant. Too many people were laughing, not at the rules of the game but the way the sport's officials allowed just anyone from anywhere to get involved.
More: Closed Rancho Mirage Country Club golf course may get a second life
There will be those who will disagree with what the USGA, the LPGA and others are doing by eliminating the call-in rulings. A violation is a violation, they will say, and it is up to everyone in the game, players, officials and fans, to make sure the integrity of the game is upheld.
That's true enough. But the new ruling certainly doesn't encourage players to make mistakes or, worse yet, knowingly violate a rule. It just eliminates fans miles and miles away from the competition who, for whatever agenda they have, decide to try to impact the results of a sporting competition.
Think the Lexi adventure and other famous incidents are isolated and few and far between? Ask yourself how many people call in who never get through to the officials or whose accusations turn out to be incorrect.
No, Lexi Thompson didn't win the ANA Inspiration in April under the rules configured at the time. The new rules won't give Lexi that title back. And she did make a bad mark on Saturday of that tournament. No one believes there was an intent to violate the rules by Thompson, but the rules had to be enforced.
Now, golf has eliminated at least one dumb thing about the game, and it has silenced a few of the laughs from back in April

Mason Caton-Brown started the season playing in a 46-0 hammering at Championship Rochdale, and now stands two wins from Wembley.
Wakefield's Enfield-born flyer began the campaign on dual registration with partner club Dewsbury, but has now become a key figure for Chris Chester's side.
Caton-Brown has scored 15 tries in just 12 Trinity appearances, including a sparkling hat-trick against tonight's Challenge Cup quarter-final opponents and his former club Salford.
The 24-year-old will be hoping to repeat that feat tonight and move a step closer to the final - even if it means upsetting a few old mates.
He said: “I've still got a lot of friends at Salford and still live in Manchester.
“I see a few of them at the gym or around town, and the Salford fans are still really nice with me and were wishing me well even after we won there the other week.
“It's one of my favourite grounds to play at so it was good to score those tries.

“Both games we've played in Super League this year have been really close and we've managed to win both - there's a lot of belief in this team this year.
“Even when we've been in sticky situations we've stuck together.”
Trinity's coach Chester and head of rugby John Kear have a rich Challenge Cup history between them.
They lifted the trophy together with Hull FC in 2005, Chester took Hull KR to the 2015 final and Kear masterminded the biggest shock in the competition's history with Sheffield in 1998.
But Caton-Brown insists they haven't made reference to that in Wakefield's attempt to go one better than last year and reach a first final since 1979.
He added: “They haven't mentioned it at all to be honest - we've just been focusing on what we're doing.
“It would be nice for this group to create its own bit of history now.
“We haven't put any limit on what we can do this year or put ourselves in any bracket - we just want to compete in every game and we've been doing that.”
A Winnipeg restaurant staple is getting rid of plastic straws.
Starting June 1, Salisbury House restaurants will replace all plastic straws with a bio-degradable alternative, the company announced in a release Tuesday.

“Straws are just the beginning. We will be looking at all aspects of our business over the coming years in an effort to reduce our environmental impact at Sals,” Corporate Chef Jayanti Sharma said.
“In addition to reducing our use of plastics, Salisbury House is looking to source as much food supply locally and to reduce energy consumption as part of being a market leader in sustainable business practices.”
A number of civil governments have already made the move away from plastic straws. The UK has pledged to get rid of all plastic waste by 2042, the University of Guelph has removed plastic straws and bags from campus and a number of restaurants across Canada have already done what Sals is doing.

Straws have also been banned in several U.S. cities like Seattle, Miami Beach and Malibu.
The growing ban on plastic straws comes as United Nations figures show eight million tonnes of plastic — bottles, packaging and other waste — enter the ocean each year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain.
It takes plastic straws and stirrers up to 200 years to biodegrade.

Zverev celebrates after winning his first Rogers Cup title (Getty/Minas Panagiotakis)
World number seven Alexander Zverev will be in action at the China Open in October this year, the tournament has announced.
Zverev, who beat Roger Federer in straight sets yesterday to take his second Masters 1000 titles of 2017 at the Rogers Cup, has had a breakthrough season to date, and will head to the ATP 500 tournament looking for more ranking points as he aims to confirm his place at the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time.

The German is not the only notable name set to be in action at the tournament, which usually attracts a strong field on the men's side despite not being a Masters 1000 event. Current world number one Andy Murray has already announced that he will be in action, whilst Rafael Nadal, who could replace the Brit at the top of the rankings next week, will also be playing. Maria Sharapova has been handed a wildcard for the women's event, which is a Premier Mandatory tournament and will attract a stellar field from the WTA.
Zverev looks to continue stellar season going in Beijing
It has undoubtedly been an incredibly strong season for the German, who has risen to a career high of seventh after starting the year outside the top 20, and Zverev will undoubtedly be a contender for the title when the tournament begins.
As well as his triumph in Montreal just yesterday, Zverev won the Citi Open title the week before that, and also won the Masters 1000 title in Rome with a win over Novak Djokovic; he also won titles in Munich and Montpelier, as well as reaching the final in Halle. The German is yet to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal, but is expected by many to do well at the upcoming US Open and could be confident heading into Beijing. He will also be looking to defend his title in St. Petersburg shortly beforehand.

The announcement of Zverev's arrival undoubtedly means an extremely strong field is being built up, with Grand Slam champions Murray and Nadal both confirmed to be taking part in the tournament. Murray has struggled this season and will be looking for a good run as he looks to qualify for the World Tour Finals, whilst Nadal has had a resurgent season and will be looking for a good result, with a potential battle between him and the likes of Murray and Federer for the world number one ranking.

* Robust U.S. labor market report boosts dollar, government debt
* Stocks in Europe, Wall Street drop after U.S. jobs report
* Oil eases on strong dollar
By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The dollar and bond yields jumped on Friday while stock markets fell as U.S. data showed the strongest annual wage growth since 2009, raising the specter of accelerating inflation and more American interest rate hikes than expected this year.
Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note shot up to a four-year high within five minutes of release of the U.S. Labor Department's unemployment report, which showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 200,000 jobs last month.
The dollar surged against the Japanese yen, euro and a basket of six currencies.
The price of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note later fell further, pushing the yield up as high as 2.854 percent from 2.773 percent late on Thursday.
“It feels as though the grand era of interest rates below 3 percent will soon be in the rear-view mirror,” said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund in New York.
While wage growth may be good for the economy it could spell trouble for the bond market as inflation portends rate hikes, which augur a repricing of fixed income, he said.
Stocks in Europe and on Wall Street plunged at least 1 percent on the news, as the strong labor market report boosted the chances the Federal Reserve will raise rates four times this year instead of the three hikes analysts had expected.
“What is good for the average American worker ends up being negative for stocks because it increases the odds of further rate hikes,” Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
MSCI's all-country world index of equity performance in 47 countries fell 1.25 percent while its gauge of emerging market stocks lost 1.4 percent.
Deutsche Bank's disappointing results pulled the heavyweight banking sector down to help European shares post their biggest weekly loss in more than a year, while Britain's top share index sealed its weakest week in nine months on BT's results.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 1.37 percent and the blue-chip FTSE 100 index in London closed down 0.63 percent.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 369.84 points, or 1.41 percent, to 25,816.87, the S&P 500 lost 29.33 points, or 1.04 percent, to 2,792.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 62.58 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,323.28.
Disappointing results from some of the largest U.S. companies also weighed on stocks. Oil majors Exxon and Chevron fell 5.8 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly profits.
Google-parent Alphabet fell 4.9 percent after an earnings miss and Apple fell 3.5 percent as investors focused on its muted forecast rather than strong iPhone prices.
The dollar index, tracking the unit against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.38 percent, with the euro down 0.21 percent to $1.2482. The Japanese yen weakened 0.59 percent versus the greenback at 110.04 per dollar.
The U.S. bond market's gauges of inflation expectations added to their earlier rise on Friday as domestic wages recorded their strongest annual increase in more than 8-1/2 years, suggesting inflation may be accelerating.
The gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and 10-year Treasury notes reached its widest since September 2014.
U.S. crude fell 60 cents to $65.20 per barrel and Brent fell $1.10 to $68.55.
Spot gold dropped 0.99 percent to $1,335.50 an ounce.

She's been very vocal in her support and affection for her jailed boyfriend, Joey Morrison.
And, even though he's currently still in prison, it seems that Lauren Goodger was determined to celebrate Valentines day in style with her beau, as she shared a series of gushing posts, on Tuesday.
The reality star, 30, once-again declared her love for Joey - currently serving 18 months in prison - in a series of social media posts, which saw her sharing snaps of her romantic presents from the convict, which included a Balmain bag and a huge bouquet of flowers.
Taking to Instagram, the The Only Way Is Essex star was quick to show that her boyfriend had put in some effort on the special day - despite being locked up.

Sharing an image of herself in a black silk robe next to a huge bunch of white and red roses with her 735,000 followers, it certainly seemed as though Joey's efforts to make the day special had been appreciated.
Across the picture of the flowers was a caption bar, which simply read: "Thank you baby," which included a love heart.
Uploading the picture to her account Lauren shared a special message, thanking her boyfriend for making her "feel appreciated", writing:"Happy Valentine's day. I love you and thank you @m_joey1 the little surprises that make you feel appreciated when you can't spend the day together."
But it seems that flowers weren't the only thing that the Essex girl had received from her man, as she was also keen to flag up the fact he'd gifted her a Balmain (a favourite designer of the Kardashian clan) handbag.

In another snap uploaded to her account, Lauren simply shared a picture of the bag's inside tag, which simply bore the famed French fashion house's logo.
Apparently surprised by the fact she received such a grand gesture, she captioned the shot: "When he surprises you twice in one day and knows your favourite designer @balmain Thank you @m_joey1 ."
Another picture showed Lauren posing in a slightly seductive manner in nothing but her black silk robe, as she posed with her roses in front of the mirror - something she then turned into a Snapchat video.

The TOWIE star and Joey, who is currently serving his sentence at HMP Highpoint South, have been dating for six months.
Last month she spoke out publicly in defence of her beau after a number of stories emerged surrounding his behaviour in prison, and wrote an impassion missive in her new! magazine column for the jailbird not to be demonized.
She wrote: "He [Joey] accepts I'm in the public eye and it's my job, but he doesn't like the b***s**t that's written. I know people are interested in my relationships and I accept that, but I don't like the emphasis or opinion being formed on incorrect information."
“ON-LINE WITH LATE-LINE” By Desmond Kelly ‘the Star of eLanka'
“Aunty A.B.C.”, the ONLY T.V.Channel one can watch without the annoying interruption of “silly-ads”, every two minutes, has always been, as far as many Lankan-Aussies (myself included), the very BEST T.V. on offer, in Melbourne, anyway. Naturally, I cannot speak for our “viewers” in the other States in this sun-burnt Land, but I have always opted for the A.B.C. because of it's straight-forward approach to what is sometimes quite inapproachable “subjects” without fear or favour, which is “the way to go”. Unfortunately, now, in the topsy-turvy World that we live in, Politics play a major part in decisions that are sometimes difficult to comprehend. The Channel 2 “Four Corners” has been in the “gun-sight” of the Federal Government for a while, now, simply because this t.v. programme tells it like it is. “Aunty” will take a “story”, good, bad, happy or sad and “screen it” for those who wouldn't have a chance in hell, of seeing it on any of the commercial channels. I have always admired this “no holds barred” attitude, of the A.B.C.., & hope 4 Corners, together with it's ” no-nonsense” Cast & Crew keep their jobs for a long long time. They deserve it.
“On-line with Late-line” is self-explanatory. For reasons known only to themselves, “Late-line” Producers have “pulled the plug”(I have to stop using these phrases, however good they are), on a “Programme” that would certainly have been watched both on-line, by Lankan/Aussies everywhere, even though, as “late-line” , it was “on-late”(now, I'm even getting confused, myself). However, “Late-Line” is no more. How do you replace a superb show?. This is what I'd like to know. From here, where do we go? ( I will have to stop being poetic on “serious-subjects”).
Now, getting really serious about a top-class t.v. programme, first started on the 13th of February 1990, (13 has always been an unlucky number, while I have never been superstitious), covering both National and International events of interest to people with even half a brain ( no Lankan/Aussies or Aussies in that lot).
Some of us have no brains at all, & whoever is taking “late-line” “off-air” , certainly need their brains “looked-into”, as 28 years of thoroughly interesting investigative journalism, brought to us by superb “Characters” such as Maxine McKew, Kerry O'Brien, Leigh Sales & finally Emma Albericie, every one of them “top-journos” , in my opinion, comes to a sad end.
I have said (&written), many times that I am, by no means, a politician. I do not know anything about politics, don't want to know anything about it either, but still UNDERSTAND that there must be utter transparency with any incumbant Australian Government. There are “stories” that have to be told.
These may NOT reflect too well with the “big boys”, but as long as our Journalists substanciate what they are “reporting”, these stories, sometimes “covered” with risk to their own lives, MUST be permitted on-air, be.it Radio or Television. It is only then, dear Sirs, that people such as this writer will think, yes, our Government is telling us the truth. Lets vote them in, next time.
“Aunty A.B.C.” has been giving us quite a lot of excellent viewing. Candidly, I cannot find fault with ANY of their journalists & producers. If I did, my eLanka readers would be the first to know about it.
Let us leave it at that. I would be extremely happy to see “Late-Line” back on our screens sooner rather than later, and to keep in with my style of writing, let me close with “OTHERWISE” it might just be “Too late for regrets”(another Original song of mine, written under totally different circumstances).
Farewell Late-Line, you've been good,
Like Errol Flynn, in Robin-Hood
Let's not try to make a fuss,
Soon, you might be back with us. (hopefully).

If you've ever wondered what it would be like if Law & Order: SVU‘s Detective Elliot Stabler had a complete psychotic breakdown, or if Wet Hot American Summer‘s Gene decided to take up a law enforcement profession, you might have an idea of what awaits you in the new Syfy series Happy! Starring Christopher Meloni, of course, this adaptation of Grant Morrison‘s graphic (in both definitions of the word) novel features an ex-cop-turned-hitman who attempts to navigate his life post-near death experience with the aid of an imaginary blue flying horse named Happy. Yeah.
The first trailer for the new series is here and it's completely nuts. If you're a fan of Meloni getting a chance to let loose, as I am, then this is pure candy for your eyes and ears. It helps that Patton Oswalt pops in as the voice of Happy, adding a completely bizarre twist to an already unconventional story, but there is a narrative introduced here that adds some structure to what looks to be an otherwise off-the-rails series. And it arrives just in time for the holiday season!
Watch the first, graphic trailer for Happy! below:
The holiday season will never be the same. Based on the extremely graphic novel by Grant Morrison and Darick Robertson, HAPPY! premieres December 6th on SYFY.
Here's the official synopsis:
Happy! is based on New York Times best-selling author Grant Morrison and Darick Robertson's graphic novel of the same name. The series follows Nick Sax (Christopher Meloni, Law & Order: SVU) – an intoxicated, corrupt ex-cop turned hit man – who is adrift in a world of casual murder, soulless sex and betrayal. After a hit gone wrong, his inebriated life is forever changed by a tiny, relentlessly positive, imaginary blue winged horse named Happy (Patton Oswalt).
And for more on Happy!, be sure to check out this interview with Morrison himself.

Churches in the Caribbean are calling for the establishment of debt relief as an instrument for emergency support and reconstruction.
Under the banner of Jubilee Caribbean, various religious denominations from around the region are urging governments in the Caribbean and the international financial institutions to act quickly on that proposal ahead of the next hurricane season which begins in June.
A Jubilee Caribbean release states that “all research points to the fact that the growing severity of hurricanes in the Caribbean is related to man-made climate change. This means that we in the Caribbean, like some other nations elsewhere in the global south, are the least responsible for but most affected by climate change”.
According to the clerics and their churches behind the proposal, “the few dozen small Island States across the world, for example, have neither the size nor developmental history to have been major contributors to current climate change. Yet these small Island States are the most easily devastated by rising seas and harsher storms. Our brothers and sisters who inhabit these places are in peril, through no fault of their own”.
They are recommending a tailored Heavily Indebted Caribbean Countries Initiative, which will combine immediate relief and an efficient form of debt restructuring.
“We do not want to face the next hurricane season without a proper mechanism for relief in place” they emphasize.
The March 5 release also advises:
· Our own heads of State and Government must unite and collectively demand the creation of an efficient debt relief option ahead of the next hurricane season through all available means, including the United Nations System and the Bretton Woods Institutions.
· The IMF must use its rule-setting power to endorse a full debt moratorium once a hurricane or any other serious disaster brings destruction beyond a pre-defined level and make sure that a serious debt restructuring of all external commitments shall be possible under due consideration of our peoples' human rights.
·The ECCB and the CDB must act as supporters of a comprehensive debt restructuring process once it is needed.
The 19 signatories include Bishop Gabriel Malzaire, Roman Catholic Bishop of Roseau.
A senior bank manager was arrested last week after a Muslim colleague filed a complaint accusing him of blasphemy, reports Gulf News.
ED from Goa, India, was taken into custody within hours of the incident at the Bur Dubai branch of a local bank on June 7. He was held at Al Raffa Police station before being released on bail.
The complainant TA, 30, from Bangalore, India, said his boss ED made religious slurs against him and ridiculed Islam when he asked him for leave to go to Makkah for the Umrah piligrimage.
“This happened during our morning huddle. In front of several staff members, ED mocked me saying that if I was so keen to perform Umrah then instead of the Kaaba, I may as well take rounds (tawaaf) of his villa in Victory Heights,” TA said in an interview with XPRESS.
“I was shocked but I kept my cool and told my boss that he had no right to make such blasphemous comments against my religion but he remained unrepentant and went on to blame Muslims for terror attacks including the recent one in London. He also made jibes at my appearance, particularly my bloodshot eyes. He said they make me look as if I was drunk. I told him they were caused by lack of sleep during Ramzan but he refused to listen and said Ramzan was a month of giving but all that I gave him during Ramzan was pain. The same day I filed a police complaint.”
TA said several senior staffers of the bank have urged him to forgive the man and withdraw the police complaint but he has not heeded to their requests. “Ramadan is a time for piety and forgiveness but certain acts deserve no mercy,” he said.
Responding to a query, the bank in question said the issue was a “private matter between two individuals” adding that the police were handling the case.
Anti-discriminatory law
UAE's Anti-discriminatory law criminalises any acts that stoke religious hatred and/or which insult religion through any form of expression. Penalties include jail terms ranging from six months to more than 10 years and fines from Dh50,000 to Dh2 million.
N. Korean Leader Kim Jong-un's Half-Brother Is Dead. But Why?
Enlarge this image toggle caption The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images
It's the stuff of spy novels. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un's older half-brother Kim Jong Nam died mysteriously at the Kuala Lumpur airport, and both South Korean and Malaysian media report it was likely some sort of poison attack.
Several questions surround his suspicious death, but perhaps the biggest is: Who would want Kim Jong Nam dead?
Exiled Half-Brother Of North Korean Leader Reported Dead In Malaysia Exiled Half-Brother Of North Korean Leader Reported Dead In Malaysia Listen · 4:11 4:11
The eldest Kim brother has led a quiet existence outside North Korea for decades, except for making headlines when he tried to enter Japan in 2001 on a fake passport. He later said he was trying to go to Tokyo Disneyland.
That Kim has remained out of the limelight is rather remarkable given he's the son of Kim Jong Il, North Korea's notorious former dictator.
"You would live anonymously too if people were gunning for you," says Michael Madden, a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who runs the site North Korean Leadership Watch.
"Kim Jong Nam has lived a very leisurely life, primarily in a condo that the Kim family owns in Macau," Madden says. Kim is widely known for his love of gambling and clubs. Madden also says Kim Jong Nam manages the family's personal fortune overseas, which includes homes in Singapore, Beijing and Paris.
Kim's fate took a turn Monday morning, while he was in transit at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Something caused Kim's sudden death.
Malaysian media are showing closed-circuit camera images in which two women cover a traveler's face with cloth. Police say emergency responders rushed the man, whose travel documents identified him as "Kim Chol," to the hospital, but he died en route.
"It probably is the strangest story that I have encountered about North Korean elites and the Kim family and Kim family politics," Madden says.
In South Korea Tuesday, Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee confirmed the identity of the dead traveler.
"The government is certain that the murdered individual is Kim Jong Nam. We have not confirmed the exact cause of death," Jeong said.
Kim could have died of natural causes, given his sedentary lifestyle and the family's reported issues with gout and high blood pressure. But if he was killed, theories run the gamut as to why.
Some believe Kim was punished for skimming from the family fortune he handled, or that he was the scapegoat in a power play by elites wanting to get back into leader Kim Jong-un's good graces. But they're all just guesses, says Madden.
"Nobody knows, and I don't think we will know the full story about the death of Kim Jong Nam for many years," he says.
As with so much about North Korea, even a man's demise is dressed in mystery.

In yet another incident, fire erupted on Margalla Hills on Wednesday. Fires broke out at two points – behind Saidpur village and Daman-i-Koh picnic point.
“Our teams are making all-out efforts to extinguish the flames. So far, a major area has been cleared,” said CDA spokesman Malik Saleem. However, he could not ascertain the cause of the fire.
“Generally it is the season when fires break out on the hills due to human errors,” he said.
Other CDA officials said every year the civic agency hired services of hundreds of local villagers on a daily wage basis for three months to extinguish fires on the hills.—APP

Senkumbi Returns To Kampala In Police Mini Reshuffle
The Police have shuffled several officers resulting in the return to Kampala of Ibin Senkumbi from the village doldrums of Rwizi in Mbarara.
The Deputy Inspector General of Police, Okoth Ochola, signed off the transfers announce today.
Senkumbi, (pictured above) is appointed the new spokesperson of Interpol in Kampala.
Ssenkumbi, who rose to fame as Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson, returns to the city after serving time in Somalia and South Sudan under the United Nations. Up to today he has been the regional police spokesman at Rwizi in Mbarara.
Sekumbi's reshuffle affect five other senor police officers, namely, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Irene Chelangat becomes the new Regional Traffic Officer for Albertine Region while ASP Hadi Seiko is the new officer in-charge (OC) of traffic in Mbale district.
ASP Jude Nasucha goes to Arua from Kumi as the OC station, ASP Reinhold Rwakirenzi is now OC traffic, Lwengo, and ASP Stephen Ojok goes to Kumi as OC station.
The transfers take immediate effect and the affected officers are expected to immediately move to their respective positions.
The battle between the San Antonio Spurs and Indiana Pacers was a delight to watch as both teams' All-Star forwards faced off and didn't disappoint. Both Kawhi Leonard and Paul George's matchup made the contest less like a basketball game and more like a prize fight.
Indiana's Paul George drove hard at the rim on one end and completed a difficult layup in traffic. Kawhi Leonard, on the other end, backed George down, dropping in a textbook turnaround jumper that looked sweet as honey.
Watching this all unfolds, from start to finish off a tough and hard-fought 110-106 Spurs victory, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich sounded more like a fan than what we typically hear from him. "It's times like this where you have to slap yourself because I'm just watching those two go at each other and do what they do," Popovich said during the post-game interview. "It's so much fun to watch."

Here's just how good Kawhi Leonard was in the Spurs' win at Bankers Life Fieldhouse: According to ExpressNews, George had 27 points, 6 rebounds 3 assists, and was the second-best All-Star in the game. Leonard on the other end erupted for 32 points Monday, which is his fourth straight game scoring at least 30 and 19th overall of the season - plus he added four steals.
Leonard leads the Spurs to one of their most impressive victories of the season in just less than 24 hours after suffering one of their worst losses at of the season at the hands of the New York Knicks. "Anyone could've won it," Popovich said. "We made some key shots down the stretch, and it usually comes down to being able to put the ball in the hoop as long as you play some decent defense to top it off."
According to Yahoo! Sports, the Pacers were actually the club that drafted Leonard in 2011, then shipping him to the Spurs in a pre-arranged deal - partly because they already had Paul George on the roster. Leonard and George might revisit their duel on Sunday in New Orleans during the All-Star game.

ISLAMABAD - Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Bajwa Wednesday said mainstreaming of FATA is essential for enduring peace in the region.
He said that Pakistan's main focus now is to transform its operational achievements in FATA into enduring peace and stability for which early mainstreaming of the tribal region through reforms is essential. He said that Pak Army fully supports all the efforts towards achieving the goal.
According to ISPR, Chief of Army Staff made this statement during his visit to Peshawar Corps Headquarters where he was given a comprehensive briefing on situation along the Pak-Afghan border, continuing and future operations, progress on development works and return of TDPs.
The COAS appreciated improved security situation and measures for better border management including fencing. He expressed satisfaction over operational readiness of the formations, and asked them to stay vigilant against all types of threats.
Regarding the country's relations with Afghanistan, he said: “We consider Afghanistan as a brotherly neighbour and terrorists are our common enemy. The threat thus requires a trust-based coordinated response rather than blame game or unwarranted skirmishes.”
The army chief said that unilateral actions like drone strikes are counterproductive and against spirit of ongoing cooperation and intelligence-sharing being diligently undertaken by Pakistan.
He said Pakistan Army is capable of taking effective measures if actionable intelligence is shared.
General Bajwa said that our brave tribal brothers, through their support, cooperation and resolve, have enabled its security forces to succeed during the operations and now it is time for them to live a fearless and quality social life as citizens of Pakistan.
He said that Pakistan Army shall continue its efforts to consolidate gains achieved so far and stated that army stands with all other institutions to get Pakistan rid of menaces retarding its progress and prosperity.

Chief Executive Officer of the Private Sector Organization in Jamaica (PSOJ), Chartered Accountant and prominent businessman in Jamaica, Dennis Chung, has described the construction of an international airport as a “very important” necessity for Dominica.
He made that statement at a Dominica Business Forum (DBF) Luncheon held on Wednesday, June 14th at the Fort Young Hotel.
Chung stated that Jamaica has a “significant advantage” in having two international airports that ensure a constant flow of international flights moving in and out, and so in order to experience that benefit, Dominica should take a step towards building one.
“Because of our two airports we have, almost every single international flight comes in directly to Jamaica, and that's why our tourism has grown so much. We don't have any advantage over you (Dominica) in terms of beauty but just the access is very, very important,” Chung said.
According to him, access must not only be available for people but also for goods and despite the cost “it is worth it.”
“It is critical, and I have heard that there are some concerns over the cost of everything but it is worth it, to get the people here. It really is worth it, I mean, can you imagine, I'm looking at your waterfront. It didn't go the route that we did – we (Jamaica) ignored our waterfront, and it's really a dump now. I just have a vision of here ( in Dominica) for tourists, 24 hours a day just walking through and shopping; that is significant money,” he said.
He added that considering all this, there is still a sense of not understanding the capabilities of particular tourist attractions which results in those attractions not being developed to fulfill their potential.
“We live in this paradise, sometimes it seems as if we take it for granted and we don't understand the treasure that we have. I feel it is important for us as citizens to take care of it. The problem is that, as a region, we have not always done what is necessary to ensure the sustainability of paradise,” Chung stated.
He said Dominica must learn from the mistakes of Jamaica and develop aspects of the tourism industry to enhance productivity, to upkeep the environment and must also address crime.
“I see Trinidad making the same mistakes in terms of crime, it is not good, it is not pretty because it really suffocates the productivity and not to mention the emotional scars that it leaves on children. We have environmental challenges; we don't take care of our environment,” he remarked.
Chung was invited to Dominica to speak at the DBF's ‘Strengthening the Dominica Private Sector -The Jamaica Experience' forum, which was opened to all Private Sector Organizations in Dominica.

James Gunn, writer/director for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise, has confirmed that he'll return for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as writer and director. The news comes as Gunn prepares to kick off the U.S. press junket for the highly anticipated sequel, after which they'll head to Europe by week's end. Gunn got out in front of the inevitable questions about his return for a third installment by taking to Facebook, but there's a lot more here to sort out than just the very welcome news that he'll be back to captain the ship.

Starring Chris Pratt, Kurt Russell, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillen, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, Elizabeth Debicki, and Pom Klementieff, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 rolls out internationally later this month and arrives in the U.S. on May 5th.
You can probably guess some of the standard questions Gunn is about to hear during press rounds:
“Wasn't there a lot more pressure dealing with the sequel of a beloved film?” (No, there was less, because this time I knew there was an audience waiting to see it!) “What was it like working with Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone?” (Daunting and at times overwhelming – I ran around in my backyard as a kid pretending to be Snake Plissken and John Rambo, so these guys are true icons to me.)
Gunn's been around a while, however, and he knows that the tendency is to look far ahead to a likely sequel rather than to focus on the current release. With that in mind, he put some thought into his response to whether or not he'd be returning for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rather than simply avoiding the question:
I needed to know it was, in my heart, what I truly felt called to do. There is a history in Hollywood of haphazard endings to trilogies, and I didn't want to become a part of that dishonorable tradition of pretending the third one doesn't exist. I couldn't do it for the money, and I couldn't do it because it was what other people wanted me to do. I needed to do it because it was what I needed to do. I have never made choices in my career based on anything other than passion and love for the stories and characters, and I didn't want to start now.
After much introspection, Gunn had his answer, and he wanted to share it with you, me, and us; the fans:
So, yes, I'm returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula – and some of the other forthcoming heroes – goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit. And, like in both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, we will work on creating the story that goes beyond what you expect.
After praising the creative team behind the MCU and the Marvel Studios brass he gets to work alongside, Gunn also teased Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3‘s place in the greater MCU:
Much of what's happened in the MCU for the past ten or so years has been leading, in a big way, to the Avengers' Infinity War. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will happen after all that. It will conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond. I will be working side-by-side with Kevin Feige and the gang to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far. I promise you, the fans, I'll do it all with integrity and love and respect for the characters.
As great as Gunn's respect for the fans and the characters is, that bit about the timing of the Guardians‘ third volume is quite interesting. As I talked about in my review of Insight Editions' “Guardians of the Galaxy: Creating Marvel's Spacefaring Super Heroes: The Complete Comics History”, there have been a lot of Guardians team members over the years. The current iteration isn't even the original one, not by a long shot.
Could Major Vance Astro, Martinex T'Naga, and Captain Charlie-27 be making an appearance? And now that Mantis is here, perhaps Adam Warlock and Quasar/Phyla-Vell will join the party as well. Even Venom swung by a time or two in recent years. I'm not saying any of these characters will/won't appear (though Venom's likely out due to Sony's plans for their own Marvel Universe), but there are quite a few options for team-ups in the years to come. Let us know who you want to see on a future Guardians team in the comments below!
Here's Gunn's entire Facebook rundown:
Free stuff is good stuff.
The holiday season is here, and to help celebrate it, Project Fi just launched a fun little browser game that you can play from either your phone or desktop.
The game has you controlling a yellow character as they ski down a snowy slope, and your objective is to ride as long as you can without running into any trees, logs, or even a yeti. Going over the yellow ramps will give you a nice boost to increase your score even more, and after messing around with it for a few minutes, I can confirm that it's a great time-killer.
When you go to play the game, you'll be given the option to log in with your Project Fi account if you have one. There's a special gift available to those that play the game and use Project Fi, but looking through the Twitter thread for the announcement of the game, it looks like the login functionality is broken for a lot of people.
AC's Andrew Martonik managed to get logged in without any issues and was rewarded with a promo code for free in-flight Gogo Wi-Fi on one flight that needs to be redeemed by March 31, 2018. It's not huge, but free's free.
In any case, if you want to check the game out for yourself, you can play it here.

LONDON - European stock markets and the euro extended losses Tuesday as political uncertainty in Italy stoked fresh fears about the eurozone. Having already slumped Monday, Italy's FTSE MIB stocks index plunged again. Madrid's IBEX 35 also dropped, on Spain's own political crisis."The fear of another election and political uncertainty in Italy is driving significant losses throughout Europe," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG traders.
"It comes as no surprise that we are seeing Italian markets suffer heavily, with the FTSE MIB hitting a 10-month low, and the two-year (Italian) bond yield topping two percent for the first time since 2013."
Italy's 10-year bond yields meanwhile surged over 300 basis points higher than Germany's early in the session, reflecting investor worry over the prospect of a fresh eurozone crisis. The Italy-Germany spread stood at around 266 basis points in mid-afternoon. The euro meanwhile struck the lowest level against the dollar since last July.
Italy, the eurozone's third biggest economy after Germany and France, has been plunged into crisis with President Sergio Mattarella at the weekend vetoing the nomination of a fierce eurosceptic as economy minister.
The move led the prime minister-designate to step down, scuppering the bid by the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement and the far-right League to form a government.
- 'Heightened uncertainty' -
Mattarella then named Carlo Cottarelli, a pro-austerity economist formerly with the International Monetary Fund, to lead a technocrat government, with another election likely in the autumn.
The chaotic developments have spooked investors, who fear another election could see a better result for the essentially anti-EU parties.
"We may now be in for an extended period of heightened uncertainty ahead of fresh elections," Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, said in a note to clients.
Adding to the selling pressure was a brewing crisis in Spain, where Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faces a no-confidence vote after his party was found guilty of benefiting from illegal funds in a massive graft trial.
Wall Street opened ... as traders returned to their desks after a long holiday weekend.
Earlier Tuesday, Asian stock markets closed mostly lower, with traders keeping an eye on oil prices, which have tanked since Saudi Arabia and Russia indicated they could raise output after abiding by a self-imposed cap for two years.
The comments come as supply worries increase, with major producer Venezuela hit by economic uncertainty, Iran facing painful export sanctions and demand seen picking up.
Brent crude manage to rebound on Tuesday, while WTI slumped once more.

As God's revelation to mankind, the Bible is complete in itself and capable of equipping the believer for every good work. Thus, with it alone, the Christian has everything that is necessary to learn the essentials of salvation and the wisdom necessary to sail the turbulent seas of life. Yet, unlike many other theological and religious texts, the Bible presents numerous universal truths by addressing concrete historical situations rather than by presenting a set of detached philosophical postulates.
As such, an understanding of the backdrop against which certain Biblical texts were written can provide the believer with a deeper appreciation of and greater insight into the Word of God. That said, to the average believer, that has not already acquired an extensive background knowledge of the Ancient Near East, such a task can seem quite daunting. Fortunately, “A Survey Of The New Testament” by Robert Gundry makes such a goal much more manageable.
“A Survey Of The New Testament” accomplishes this in part by grouping various New Testament books together in relation to when they were written or by thematic topic. For example, Galatians, I Thessalonians and II Thessalonians are classified together as the early epistles of Paul; I Corinthians, II Corinthians, and Romans are categorized as the Major Epistles of Paul. Philemon, Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, I Timothy, II Timothy, and Titus are lumped together as the Pastoral Epistles of Paul because they were written specifically for young pastors (409). The books of James, I Peter, II Peter, I John, II John, III John and Jude are classified as Catholic or General Epistles because these texts were not targeted towards a specific locality. Hebrews and Revelation are each assigned their own individual chapters.
From this system of classification, Gundry proceeds to analyze each of these New Testament books. He accomplishes this by first outlining the major themes of the book under consideration for quick reference and then proceeds to a more in depth analysis of the text under consideration. For example, in the outline for I Corinthians, the student will see that marriage is discussed in I Corinthians 7:1-40 (361). Flipping ahead a few pages, the reader will find, thanks to the convenient subsection headings, where Gundry provides a more detailed examination into the Biblical teaching prohibiting divorce on the part of believers married to unbelievers and where he delves in an evenhanded manner into the debate whether the Christian abandoned by an unbelieving spouse is permitted to remarry.
Though Gundry does highlight the wisdom found in the pages of the New Testament epistles most are accustomed to discussing in Sunday school, his “Survey Of The New Testament” is no mere devotional and will keep the attention of those seeking deeper academic understanding of the sacred documents. For example, in his examination of the Book of Galatians, Gundry goes into considerable detail as to whether the epistle was addressed towards either North or South Galatia.
Such an academic conjecture has bearing upon as to when the book was written. Gundry points out that, if the text was addressed to the area of Northern Galatia which Paul did not visit until his second missionary journey, this means the epistle was not written until after the Jerusalem Council detailed in Acts 15. If the epistle was addressed towards Southern Galatia, then it is believed to have been written after Paul's first missionary journey and thus prior to the Jerusalem Church Council (346).
If one is not particularly inspired by such academic technicalities, one might find the chapters regarding the cultural settings of the New Testament world much more interesting. One may even find considerable similarity with our own era.
Religiously and philosophically, Gundry describes a world of considerable variation. Permeating the non-Jewish population of the Mediterranean was the official state religion of Rome combining Greco-Roman mythology along with emperor worship to which the population was expected to grant tacit consent.
However, it must be pointed out to the reader that this belief served more as a backdrop rather than the sum total of religious expression. For it is from the assorted esoteric sects and various philosophies that many drew inspiration and centered their lives around.
It is at this point where Gundry lists some of the various philosophies popular at that time that the reader can see similarities with those prevalent in our own era. For example, Epicureans taught pleasure as the chief end of life, Stoicism taught dutiful acceptance of one's fate, and the skeptics are described as relativists who abandoned belief in the absolute. As the Apostle to the Gentiles, Paul would have confronted these philosophies on a regular basis as exemplified by his encounter on Mars Hill in Acts 20.
In light of the popularity of works such as “The Da Vinci Code” and “The Gospel Of Judas”, it can be easy for the faith of the Christian to be shaken by those claiming to have attained higher levels of academic expertise. Written from a solidly Evangelical perspective, “A Survey Of The New Testament” by Robert Gundry is a trustworthy defense against these pervasive heresies that have stalked the Church from its earliest days.
It is often assumed that Christianity appropriated the ideas of the immortality of the soul, resurrection of the dead, and ceremonial washing such as baptism from the so-called mystery religions. However, Gundry points out, “On the other hand, not until the second, third, and fourth centuries of the Christian era do we get detailed information concerning the beliefs held by the devotees of the mysteries...Where their later beliefs look slightly similar to Christian beliefs, the direction of borrowing may have gone from Christianity to the mystery religions rather than vice versa (58).”
It has been said that the Scriptures are simple enough for a child to understand yet deep enough for a theologian to drown in. “A Survey Of The New Testament” by Robert Gundry will serve as a sufficient life preserver as the believer heads out into doctrinally deep waters.

Distilled water is water that's been purified of contaminants through distillation. The process is relatively simple; water is brought to a boil and converted to steam. The steam flows through cooling tubes and condenses back into pure water. This is different than simply filtering water in that this process removes all potentially harmful organisms and chemicals. As you may imagine, there are benefits to drinking and using distilled water beyond superficial smell and taste improvements.
1. Removing Contaminants
The most important health benefit distilled water offers is the elimination of water borne contaminants that may potentially be found in water. Drinking contaminated water is one of the fastest ways to spread disease, toxic metals and industrial pollutants. By removing the contaminants from water through distillation, we can help alleviate the risk of future illnesses and toxic buildup.
2. Elimination of Chemicals
The most common problem with drinking municipal water is that chlorine and/or fluoride are added as part of the water treatment process. The addition of fluoride is a huge can of worms alone and perhaps one of the greatest scams perpetrated in modern times. Among a host of other problems, too much fluoride in your drinking water can have adverse effects such as tooth discoloration and breakdown of tooth enamel. Chlorine can be harmful to your skin in undiluted amounts, it can also be harmful to your body in the diluted amounts of city water. Distilled water has filtered out these chemicals as well as others to make what is called pure water.
3. No Additives
Many municipal water supplies also contain calcium. While calcium is essential to maintaining good health, too much calcium can be a precursor to kidney stone formation. For some people, kidney stones can be a constant and painful problem and drinking distilled water can reduce the risk of developing more kidney stones. And, if you just prefer to be in complete control of how you receive your vitamins and minerals, there is no substitute for distilled water.
The Flipside to No Additives
Distillation will remove impurities found in water but will also remove the naturally occurring minerals. The World Health Organization has stated that 14 necessary micronutrients are absent from distilled water; our bodies do require these minerals to function. If you're not receiving your daily amount of these minerals in your water, it is necessary to get them from food sources or a multivitamin.
How to Make Super Water
Add the following to 1 gallon of distilled water to give it a boost of enzymes and nutrients:
2 tablespoons of non-pasteurized, organic apple cider vinegar
Juice squeezed from ½ organic lemon
2 ounces of organic aloe vera juice
To receive the maximum benefits that super water offers, divide your body weight by two to determine the number of ounces of super distilled water to drink daily.
This is the dramatic moment a car went up in flames in a quiet Doncaster residential street.
Local residents looked on as fire crews tackled the flames as the vehicle was wrecked by fire outside a house in Smillie Road, Rossington.

The blaze, which broke out at around 9.30pm on Monday, was eventually extinguished by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue crews about half an hour after the fire began.
Resident Dominic Jeffrey who witnessed the drama said: "I don't know what type of car it was, none of us could get near for obvious reasons."
The fire in the street, which is off Clay Pit Lane, could be seen for miles around, with a huge plume of smoke rising from the estate during the fire.
No one is thought to have been injured in the incident.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks in Washington, Wednesday, June 14, 2017, to announce the Federal Open Market Committee decision on interest rates following a two-day meeting.

WASHINGTON>> The Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate for the third time in six months, providing its latest vote of confidence in a slow-growing but durable economy. The Fed also announced plans to start gradually paring its bond holdings later this year, which could cause long-term rates to rise.
The increase in the Feds short-term rate by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and slightly better returns for savers. The Fed foresees one additional rate hike this year, unchanged from its previous forecast. It gave no hint of when that might occur.
The overarching message the Fed sent Wednesday was an upbeat one: It believes the U.S. economy remains on firm footing as it enters its ninth year of recovery from the Great Recession, with little risk of a recession. Though the economy is growing only sluggishly and though inflation remains chronically below the Feds 2 percent target, it foresees improvement in both measures over time.
And the most important pillar of the economy  the job market  remains solid if slowing, with employment at a 16-year-low of 4.3 percent  even below the level that the Fed associates with full employment.

The Feds decision to raise rates, announced in a statement after its latest policy meeting, was approved on an 8-1 vote with Neel Kashkari, head of the Feds Minneapolis regional bank, dissenting in favor of holding rates unchanged.
The announcement that the Fed plans to begin paring its balance sheet later this year  provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated  involves its enormous portfolio of Treasury and mortgage bonds. The Fed began buying the bonds after the Great Recession to try to depress long-term loan rates. That effort resulted in a five-fold increase in its portfolio to $4.5 trillion.
On Wednesday, the Fed said it would eventually allow a small amount of bonds to mature without being replaced  an amount that would gradually rise as markets adjusted to the process. This process could put upward pressure on long-term borrowing rates.
Under the plan it unveiled, the Fed would start with monthly reductions in Treasury holdings of no more than $6 billion and $4 billion in mortgage bonds. Those figures would rise in increments over a year until they reached $30 billion a month in Treasurys and $20 billion in mortgage bonds.
By using a gradual pace for reducing its bond holdings, the Fed hopes to avoid upsetting financial markets.
With the Fed stating its intentions to start reducing the size of the balance sheet this year, it is offering a clear vote of confidence for the economy, said Curt Long, chief economist of the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions.
The Fed also issued updated economic forecasts that showed it still foresees one additional rate increase this year, to follow Wednesdays increase and an earlier rate hike in March.
The rate forecast, based on the individual projections for each member, envisions three more rate hikes in 2018 and three more in 2019. By then, the Feds forecast would put its key policy rate at 3 percent. Thats the level the Fed believes is a neutral rate  neither stimulating economic growth nor restraining it.
But the Feds forecasts are only predictions and are frequently revised as its assessments evolve.
The revised economic forecast bowed to reality by reducing its estimate for unemployment by years end to 4.3 percent from a March projection of 4.5 percent. Unemployment has already reached a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.
The Fed kept forecast for economic growth this year of 2.2 percent, up slightly from its March forecast, with growth of 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019. Those forecasts are far below the 3 percent annual growth the Trump administration has said it can achieve with tax cuts, deregulation and tougher enforcement of trade rules to protect American jobs.
The central also updated its projections for inflation to take account of a slowdown. It forecast that prices will rise just 1.6 percent this year, down from a March forecast of 1.9 percent. The Fed continues to project that prices, as measured by a gauge tied to consumer spending, will rise 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, achieving its target.
At the moment, uncertainty surrounds the membership of the Feds own policy committee. President Donald Trump is expected soon to fill three vacancies on the Feds influential board, and those new members, depending on who they are, could alter its rate-setting policy.
Some news reports have mentioned leading candidates to fill the vacancies. They include Randal Quarles, a top Treasury official in two past Republican administrations, for the vice chairmans job of overseeing bank regulation. Marvin Goodfriend, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, has been mentioned for another board spot, and Robert Jones, chief executive of Old National Bancorp in Indiana, reportedly is a candidate for a board seat designated for a community banker.
The betting is that the administration will choose officials who will tilt the Fed toward a more hawkish stance. Hawks tend to worry that rates kept too low for too long could escalate inflation or fuel asset bubbles. By contrast, doves favor the direction taken under Chair Janet Yellen, favoring relatively low rates to maximize employment.
Yellen, the first woman to lead the Fed, is serving a term that will end in February. So far, Trump has sent conflicting signals about whether he plans to nominate her for a second term.
A 59-year-old man from Leduc County has been charged with second-degree murder and causing an indignity to human remains in connection with the death of his 32-year-old son.

Google's newest phones feature Pixel perfect home screens.
Google's Pixel line, like the Nexus line before it, features Google's vision for Android, and nowhere is this truer than the home screen. The Google Now Launcher (is that ever retiring?) is still one of the most popular launchers on Android, even though it hasn't had an update since 2015.
The Pixel Launcher is Google's current vision for the home screen, and this is what will be coming to it with the Google Pixel 2.
Search moves south
Google has kept the search bar top and center on its home screen for many years now, and it's still a major part of the home screen on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. It just moved from the ever-more-distant top of the home screen to the bottom, where it'll be easier for users to tap. I don't quite see the need in having the search bar there when Assistant is a tap away on the home button directly below it, but Google wants users to use Search more, and having it right there, between your dock apps and navigation bar, should raise its visibility and hopefully its use. It also stays present when swiping between home screens
The search bar now has rounded edges to help it fit in with the default circular Adaptive icons on your home screen. It'd be fun to have the search bar adapt along with the other masks available to Adaptive icons, but who knows what the future will bring to the Pixel Launcher.
Get Google's notifications at a glance
With the Google Search bar at the bottom, the Pixel Launcher's home screen is a little bottom-heavy. To help things even out while still allowing the beauty of your wallpaper to shine through, Google has a new, completely transparent widget up top giving you information from Google Calendar and Google Assistant a glance, like upcoming meetings and, soon, traffic. Google's previous widgets from Google Now were bold, white, and completely clashed with most home screens. This version is much more refined and theme-friendly. Here's hoping it makes its way to more devices.
Living Universe Live Wallpapers
Live wallpapers, which have fallen into relative Android obscurity, are getting some beautiful new life in a series called Living Universe. These wallpapers feature movement, both when you switch between home screens and movement within the scene, like waves on a beach. They're quite beautiful, and we're looking forward to seeing the rest of the series. Last year's Pixel wallpapers came from the Google Wallpapers app, and then to the rest of Android. It's not yet clear if Living Universe will be Pixel-exclusive or eventually come to Google Wallpapers, but we can only hope.
Your turn!
Which home screen element from the Pixel 2 are you most looking forward to? Does moving the search bar throw off your home screen balance? How long do you think it'll take for these new features to come to third-party launchers? Tell us in the comments!
MUMBAI: The reintroduction of long-term capital gains ( LTCG ) tax in the Budget sent Dalal Street on a selling spree on Friday, as the sensex crashed 840 points (2.3%), its second-sharpest post-Budget day fall every by points, and closed just a tad above 35K. Bond yields rose on fears that the government might not be able to manage the fiscal deficit target, which also affected investor sentiment on the stock market.After plunging to a low of 35,006 points in late trades, the sensex closed at 35,067 while the Nifty lost 256 points to close at 10,761. The day's session left investors poorer by Rs 4.6 lakh crore, with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 153.7 lakh crore. In terms of market cap loss, it was the fifth-worst day for Indian investors.In addition to LTCG tax and rising bond yields, lack of clarity about the applicability of LTCG tax and its grandfathering clause in case of foreign investors also led to strong selling.In a post-market conference, the government, however, clarified that all LTCG tax-related rules would apply to foreign funds also. A section of the market said the sell-off is expected to continue in the coming week as well. "The worst is not behind us yet. Markets need to stabilise after such a major shakeout," said Arun Kejriwal, director of investment advisory firm KRIS. "It will not only take some time, but also some more value erosion," he added.Several foreign portfolio managers said they were taking a close look at the possible impact of LTCG tax on their India investments. These fund managers have in recent times banked on a stable rupee. But the burden of an extra tax could now force them to rethink their investment models, which may lead to some selling in the coming weeks, market players said.Interestingly, though, in Friday's session, foreign funds clocked a net inflow of Rs 950 crore, compared with Rs 509 crore net selling by domestic funds. There are additional concerns that some of the foreign players may shift part of their portfolio to Singapore, where the exchange is planning to launch derivative contracts on the 50 stocks that constitute NSE 's Nifty index.On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government securities rose to a high of 7.68%, from 7.17% when it was introduced on January 5. A rising gilt yield puts pressure on banks to hike their lending and deposit rates."Global market volatility led by rising bond yields, profit-booking (Indian markets had posted a strong monthly gain before the Budget) and concerns on deteriorating macro-economic conditions were the probable reasons for the market fall," said Sandeep Chordia, EVP strategy, Kotak Securities During the day, the sell-off in the stock market also caused the rupee to weaken. It closed at 64.06 to the dollar, more than a month-low figure.

With elections less than a month away, we are already being subject to the hullabaloo of party campaigns. Political parties are embroiled in their campaigns, decorating the streets with their posters and holding rallies to scavenge votes. One party, however, is strangely silent.
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had been known as a powerhouse for campaigning, with the party investing huge sums into its street campaigns and advertisements. In the previous years, PML-N has both been able to draw in huge crowds in its rallies and demonstrated a knack for door-to-door canvassing, which has given it an edge in the voting booths over other parties.
This season, however, the party's campaign has been almost missing, with no real attempts by PML-N to engage its voters. There have been no big rallies or passionate speeches, and PML-N leaders are mostly silent. With Nawaz and Maryam in London, the strength of the campaign lies on the shoulders of Shahbaz and Hamza Sharif, who are better suited to administrative roles than charismatic campaigning ones. There has been some effort from Shahbaz to lead the PML-N election campaign, but those too have been minimal, or if one consider his comments on Karachi, counter-intuitive.
Justifiably, it has been a hard time for PML-N this year. The party has seen a myriad of troubles since the ouster of its president, Nawaz, and those have only worsened close to the elections. The party has seen some of its loyal leaders, like Chaudhry Nisar and Zaeem Qadri, depart, along with many minor candidates switching to PTI or PPP. Thus it is easy to see why the party may not have campaigning as its first priority.
Yet, despite its struggles, PML-N has always managed to struggle through and maintain its voter's base. Any other party whose president was disqualified would have broken apart, but PML-N was able to hold on to its support and go on to win by-elections. “Vote's respect” has been the party's logo and indeed, its voters have been the party's biggest strength, which has not wavered (even after numerous disqualifications) - until now, as PML-N's lackluster campaigning appears to have weakened its position for the elections.
It is understandable why Nawaz and Maryam, with the illness of Begum Kalsoom, have not found time to invest in campaigning. However, their negligence is resulting in a decisive hit in the party's popularity at a time when it needs it the most.
The company allegedly exploited the personal data of 50 million Facebook users to sway the US presidential election
Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham has said she plans to seek a warrant to examine the computer systems used by Cambridge Analytica in an ongoing controversy about the firm's alleged use of personal data on tens of millions of individuals improperly obtained from Facebook.
Christopher Wylie, a former contractor with the company, alleges it used information gathered on 50 million Facebook users as part of an academic research project in a campaign aimed at influencing the US presidential election. Cambridge Analytica denies the claims, saying it deleted the data.
The New York Times and the Observer published reports on Wylie's allegations over the weekend, saying their investigation found evidence that Cambridge Analytica not only used the data, but still possesses most or all of it.
On Monday evening, Channel 4 News broadcast the results of its own investigation. The broadcaster showed secretly recorded conversations with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boast of their ability to sway elections using digital and political trickery.
‘Shocked'
“I think we should all be shocked by this,” Denham told Channel 4.
She said she had demanded access to the Cambridge Analytica's data systems by 6 p.m. GMT, but the firm hadn't complied.
“I'm not accepting their response so therefore I'll be applying to the court for a warrant,” Denham said. “We need to get in there, we need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica.”
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is already conducting a probe into the way personal data has been used in British political campaigns. That investigation involves Cambridge Analytica and Facebook as well as 30 other organisations and political parties.
Facebook has said it is conducting its own probe that includes audits of Cambridge Analytica and Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge academic who originally gathered the data.
Policy violation
“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook stated.
In Channel 4's programme, an undercover reporter posed as a Sri Lankan businessman looking to discredit a political rival.
Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix appears in the secret recordings giving examples of how the company could make the necessary arrangements.
Nix told the BBC's Newsnight the report was a “misrepresentation of the facts”, adding he felt the company had been “deliberately entrapped”.

Playing with Sidney Crosby his entire career, Evgeni Malkin‘s greatness is often forgotten.
The 30-year-old Russian is reminding the hockey world again this season even as Crosby continues his rule over the sport. Malkin has actually overtaken his Pittsburgh Penguins counterpart in the NHL scoring race, tied for top spot with Edmonton Oilers prodigy Connor McDavid at 43 points apiece.
Watch below: Connor McDavid speaks to media after 3 point season openers
Malkin, who scored the overtime winner in the Penguins' New Year's Eve victory over Montreal, is on pace for his most prolific offensive season since the 2011-12 campaign when he won the Art Ross trophy with 109 points, later capturing his first and only Hart trophy as league MVP.
Though he's not as celebrated as Crosby, Malkin's career numbers are right there among the very best despite the fact that he's not played 70 games in a season since that MVP campaign.
READ MORE: Malkin's OT winner propels Pens past Canadiens
Malkin's 803 points trail only Crosby, Alex Ovechkin, and Joe Thornton since he entered the NHL in 2006, while he sits sixth in assists (492), and seventh in goals (311) over that span. On a per-game basis, Malkin ranks behind only Crosby in points, fourth in assists and fifth in goals.
Malkin, a two-time Stanley Cup-winner and the 2009 Conn Smythe trophy victor as playoff MVP, ranks third in total post-season goals overt that same span (behind Crosby and Patrick Kane), and second in both assists and points, trailing only Crosby.
Stack Malkin up against the all-timers and he's right there too, currently 11th in NHL history (minimum 500 games) with 1.18 points per-game, trailing only Crosby among active players.
READ MORE: Penny, Crosby, Rio Olympics: 10 big Canadian sport stories from 2016
There are benefits, certainly, of playing behind Crosby in the Penguins No. 2 centre hole, primarily a likelier matchup against an opponent's second-best defensive pairing and forward line. He's also benefited this year by starting a heavy amount of shifts in the offensive zone (78 per cent), while playing alongside fellow top-10 overall scorer Phil Kessel.
None of that downplays Malkin's incredible season, nor a career that will surely end with a plaque in the hall of fame.
Even-strength boom
The NHL's current leader in even-strength points? Not Crosby or Malkin or even McDavid, but Columbus Blue Jackets' 24-year-old winger Brandon Saad, who has 31 such points in 35 games this season.
Sophomore leap part 1
Patrik Laine and Mark Scheifele have attracted most of the Winnipeg spotlight, but Nikolaj Ehlers is having a pretty special sophomore season for the struggling Jets. Still just 20, Ehlers is producing at nearly a point per-game pace, currently with 31 points in 39 games while leading his team in five-on-five production on a per-minute basis.

The ninth overall pick of the 2015 draft has played much of year with Laine and Scheifele and underlying numbers suggest both are far better off with him than without him. Ehlers, a speedy, shifty and creative winger ranks eighth in the NHL with 25 even-strength points and will soon surpass the 38 points he managed as a rookie last season.
Living in music city
P.K. Subban, now 29 games into his Predators career, on the differences between life in Nashville and Montreal, where he spent his first six NHL seasons:
“The difference is that coming to Nashville I'm a lot older than I was, let's say, the first time I moved to Montreal. I remember when I first moved to Montreal I thought that the centre of the city was Crescent St. I thought that's where all the nightlife was and all the action and then by my third year I realized that Montreal's much more than that. In Nashville it's the same thing. When I came here all I thought about was everything revolved around the Broadway strip. Now, I'm three months into it and I can't remember the last time I was at Broadway, you know what I mean? There's so much more to the city.”
The Predators meet the Canadiens Tuesday night in Nashville for the first time since the shocking summer trade which saw Subban swapped for Shea Weber, but Subban won't play. He was recently placed on injured reserve by the Predators, sidelined since mid-December with an upper-body injury.
Sophomore leap part 2
Quietly emerging after a slow start to his second NHL season is St. Louis Blues 20-year-old Robby Fabbri. The Mississauga, Ont., native had six goals and 13 points in 14 December games after posting only 10 points in October and November. Fabbri registered his first career hat trick last week in a win over Philadelphia.
Behind the streaks
Columbus extended their shocking win streak to 15 games over the weekend, ending Minnesota's equally surprising 12-game run.
Driving the Wild during their franchise record stretch was exceptional goaltending (.938 save percentage), a superb penalty kill (92 per cent) and a whole lot of shooting luck (46 goals on 13.4 per cent shooting). The Blue Jackets, meanwhile, are benefiting from a terrific power play (30 per cent), scorching offence on equally hot shooting (3.67 goals per-game at 12 per cent), and like Minnesota, terrific goaltending (.943 save percentage), most of it from Vezina trophy candidate Sergei Bobrovsky.
2016 scoring leaders
1. Sidney Crosby: 100 points
2. Patrick Kane: 87
3. Artemi Panarin: 81
4. Joe Thornton: 80
5. Connor McDavid: 78

Ann Arbor — Michigan sophomore running back Chris Evans is generous with his compliments and gracious with his thanks.
No one is excluded.
He is especially appreciative of his offensive line.
“I love running behind them,” Evans said recently after practice. “I tell them I appreciate them every day. I tell coach (Tim) Drevno, every time he dials a play, ‘I love that play,' just to let him know whatever play he runs, it's going to be a good one.”
Evans also feels the need to give the quarterbacks – Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh last week said Wilton Speight and John O'Korn have separated themselves in the quarterback competition – some extra support.
“I always tell them both separately, ‘Hey, you're the best quarterback in the country. Just go with that every day.' I text them, tell them that,” Evans said. “I tell them just so they can feel like, ‘I got somebody in the backfield with me who believes in me.' If nobody believes in (them), I believe in them. That's what I tell them.”

It was pointed out that by making public that he tells each quarterback the same supportive comments, they would find out.
“I'm not worried about that all,” Evans said with a quick smile. “Just the type of relationship we have. If they both find out, they know I want the best for them.”
For Evans, now it's about finding the best for himself and improving on a productive freshman season. He was the team's second-leading rusher last year with 614 yards on 88 carries and he scored four touchdowns. He averaged a team-best seven yards a carry and also caught six passes for 87 yards.

The 5-foot-11 back is 211 pounds, about 11 pounds heavier than he was last season
He said changing his body and adding strength are his biggest offseason highlights.
“Gaining extra weight and being more of an every-down back and also just being there mentally,” Evans said when asked his biggest improvements.
But his confidence also has changed. He said he now has “the demeanor and body language” that show “this is where I'm supposed to be.”
And that's partly because he played so much as a freshman and has a better understanding of the offense. His position coached changed before spring practice from Tyrone Wheatley to Jay Harbaugh, and he said he hasn't missed a beat.
Last week, Jim Harbaugh praised Evans, Karan Higdon and Ty Isaac and said Kareem Walker has been working hard and improving.

“I feel a little more in the mix,” Evans said. “Last year at this point I really didn't know if I was going to be playing or doing this, doing that. So I feel more intact with the team this year. Physically, mentally, emotionally.”
He also flexed some leadership muscles in the offseason and called running back meetings to encourage film watching, and they would have walkthroughs to work on plays.
And he has worked diligently on pass protection by adding weight and honing technique.
“Last year I didn't really know the protections,” Evans said. “I was only in on free releases or running plays, so last year I was in, I was doing one job. Now it's more of a scan, check this, check that, get out and do that. I feel a lot more comfortable in the backfield.”
DHAKA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's finance minister said late on Saturday he wanted to “wipe out” a Philippines bank that was used to channel $81 million stolen from the Bangladeshi central bank's account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year.
Abul Maal A. Muhith was responding to questions from reporters about a Reuters story on Friday that said Bangladesh Bank had asked the New York Fed to join a lawsuit it was considering filing against Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) seeking damages.
“The Bangladesh Bank has taken a decision (on filing a suit). They will let me know. We haven't so far taken any steps as the Philippines government was taking care of it (investigating the heist),” Muhith said.
“But it seems Rizal bank has been playing delinquent. We want to wipe out Rizal bank from the world.”
Muhith did not elaborate. He did not respond to requests seeking comment.
Unidentified hackers stole the money using fraudulent orders on the SWIFT payments system. The money was sent to accounts at RCBC and then disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines.
Nearly two years later, there is no word on who was responsible and Bangladesh Bank has been able to retrieve only about $15 million, mostly from a Manila junket operator. (reut.rs/2jk1W74)
The Philippine central bank fined RCBC a record one billion pesos ($20 million) last year for its failure to prevent the movement of the stolen money through it.
RCBC has said it would not pay any compensation to Bangladesh Bank and that Dhaka bank bore responsibility for the theft since it was negligent.
RCBC did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on a Sunday about Muhith's comments. (Reporting by Serajul Quadir, Krishna N. Das, Ruma Paul and Karen Lema; Editing by Toby Chopra)
The City of Page is going through some pretty good times money-wise. And the person who oversees the incoming dough is the city's Finance Director Linda Watson.
Referring to the December 2016 statistics that came out a couple of weeks ago, Watson says the stats show the city is certainly moving in the right direction.
When comparing December 2016 with December 2015, the numbers are somewhat staggering.
Incoming Sales Tax:
December 2015: $474,477.00
December 2016: $614,332.61
That represents a 32% increase.
“They are very good numbers and we are really pleased with the tax revenues that are coming in to the city,” said Watson.
She tells us the money comes in from various sources, but with 70% coming from: 1) retail businesses 2) hotel accommodations & 3) restaurants and bars. Other sources include leases, license fees and amusements.
The sales tax reports come in to her office monthly from the State of Arizona.
Entire fiscal years are looking brighter and bright, too, in the city of Page. Five years ago the annual sales tax figures with just under seven Million dollars.
“As of our last fiscal year, 2016, we brought in 10.2 Million dollars,” she said. “So there was a substantial growth between those years.”
Right now Watson's 5-person staff is in the process of preparing the next year's budget, which would be for fiscal year 2018.
One of the reasons more and more money is coming into the city, is of course, tourism. And tourism, season in Page seems to be getting longer and longer. Watson is hoping for the day when there is no off-season in Page.
“That's what we would like to see; 12-months a year,” she said. “From my perspective; I love going out on weekends or evenings and counting the cars in the parking lots. That's a good sign for the City of Page,” she said with a chuckle.
She added that the season is certainly growing and we can tell by the sales tax revenue.
The pushrod engine is a rather archaic piece of engineering, but automakers have stuck by it to this day. Notably, Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors still shove pushrod V-8 engines under the hoods of hundreds of thousands of vehicles.
Why has the pushrod engine failed to die, especially when compared to dual-overhead camshaft setups? Jason Fenske of Engineering Explained is here to provide five reasons why the pushrod engine has stuck around.
It starts with low-end torque. Although pushrod engines typically don't boast sky-high redlines, they do produce oodles of low-end torque. That's because pushrod engines typically use two valves per cylinder, which improves air velocity. At low rpm, when the airflow is more restricted, having only two valves for air to flow through speeds up the flow of the intake air. Higher air velocity leads to better combustion and, ultimately, more torque. Transversely, that airflow becomes restricted at higher rpm because two valves per cylinder doesn't allow enough air to flow.
Secondly, pushrod engines are downright simple. Without complex construction, like DOHC engines, automakers can shelve engineering headaches. As Jason says, sometimes the simplest designs are the most reliable, and if a solution can be achieved with a simpler design, it makes greater sense. Digging deeper into a 3D-printed model, Jason puts simplicity on display. A pushrod engine features a single camshaft close to the crankshaft. Thus, a belt, gear, or chain doesn't have to travel very far to rotate the camshaft. A DOHC V-8 has four camshafts, four drive gears, and two chains, among other components.
Jason combines the next two reasons into one section: size and weight. Again, the 3D-printed model shows how a pushrod engine is much more compact than a DOHC engine. A single camshaft in the center of the V-8 engine makes for small cylinder heads, which means the engine doesn't have to be very wide or tall, and it is often lighter than a DOHC engine. That helps when packaging the engine under the hood of a vehicle. It can also lead to suspension improvements and an improved center of gravity. By comparison, the DOHC is wider and taller and often heavier because those two cams sit atop each cylinder head and require larger heads.
Last but not least, the final reason is cost. Jason quotes a Car and Driver interview from 2004 with GM's chief engineer for small-block engines, who said the pushrod V-8 engine design was roughly $400 less expensive to build than a DOHC engine at the time. While $400 isn't a ton of money for an automaker flush with cash, that figure has certainly grown in the last 14 years. When you multiply that figure or an updated figure by hundreds of thousands of cars, trucks, and SUVs, the cost advantage quickly becomes clear.
The pushrod engine may be behind the times in terms of technology, but there are at least five good reasons why it continues to exist.
After Season 2 finally answered the often-asked question of “How did Jack die?,” Season 3 of “This Is Us” will tackle new unexplored stories, the cast of the NBC hit hinted at the show's For Your Consideration event on Tuesday.
As for what fans can expect when the series returns this fall, star Mandy Moore told Variety, “I'm excited to get into the weeds of Rebecca and Miguel, I want to know all about that relationship. Personally, I'm excited to see young Jack and Rebecca because that means Milo [Ventimiglia] and I get to have fun hair and makeup and costumes and stuff, anything in the '70s gets a big thumbs up from me.”
Ventimiglia, Moore's onscreen counterpart, said, “I'm looking forward to knowing more of Jack's early 20s when he was in Vietnam. I'm looking forward to always exploring with Mandy Moore, exploring what makes Jack and Rebecca tick at every age and just how Jack's presence impacts each of his children individually.”
Meanwhile, creator Dan Fogelman said the show would continue to use standalone episodes to further dive into the specifics of each character, after each member of the “Big Three” was given an episode to more fully explore their paths to adulthood in Season 2.

“It's something we really like doing, it keeps our story fresh, it keeps our audience guessing what they're going to be tuning into each week,” Fogelman said. “I think sometimes the death of a show that goes for a while is the fact that there's comfort in knowing what you're getting every week but there's also stagnancy, so what we try to do with our plot lines and our characters is keep the stories moving, keep the audiences guessing.”
The FYC event, held at The Theatre at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, welcomed Fogelman and his cast of Moore, Ventimiglia, Justin Hartley, Chrissy Metz, Susan Kelechi Watson and Chris Sullivan for a screening of the “Super Bowl Sunday” episode and a panel moderated by Variety‘s Executive Editor for TV Debra Birnbaum.
The selected episode featured the long-awaited death of Ventimiglia's character after the Pearson's family home went up in flames and Jack suffered a heart attack after inhaling too much smoke. The cast discussed filming the high pressure scenes, including the moment when Moore's character sees Jack dead in his hospital bed.
Moore said the shoot was all the more emotional because she thought Ventimiglia had left the set to go home for the day and didn't know he would be a part of the scene. “I walked into the room for the first time and didn't expect him to be lying on the bed. I had mentally prepared myself for an empty hospital bed, and just having to get to that place myself and as soon as I walked in and saw him it was just so unexpected.” Ventimiglia joked, “It might have been the best acting I've ever done.”
Ventimiglia also discussed filming the scenes inside the burning house and being surrounded by real flames, which he said was “one of the most intense stunts I've ever done, dealing with the fire and the emotion that goes along with it.” Fogelman shared behind-the-scenes video of the actor rehearsing those high pressure shots with the audience.
Sterling K. Brown was unable to be with his castmates in LA due to a New York premiere for his upcoming film “Hotel Artemis,” but joined in on the conversation briefly via video chat. Brown teased that Season 3 of the show would dive into Kevin and Beth's cousin forming a relationship, Kate and Toby dealing with depression, and Jack's time in Vietnam, adding, “it sort of leads you toward the end game of our show as a whole, not the season per se, but the end of the show.” He also joked about the hours of makeup he underwent to portray future Randall, and how he didn't struggle with revealing “This Is Us” spoilers after acting in “Black Panther.”
To close out the conversation, Fogelman dropped a few more tidbits about the new season, promising more origin stories and more looks at the future of these characters.
Although he admitted most of it isn't written, he teased, “In my mind it's the best season of television that's ever been made. I'm as excited about it as I've been about any of our seasons, it's our biggest and most ambitious.”

Warner Bros. and Alcon Entertainment have kept the sci-fi sequel Blade Runner 2049 under incredibly tight wraps all the way up to its release, but the film is now finally out in theaters, meaning all the secrets have been laid bare. After seeing the film it's even more impressive how tightly the studios were able to keep the movie's secrets under wraps. It's true, the very plot of Blade Runner 2049 is a spoiler, and by some miracle the nature of K was never revealed. It's a testament to the marketing team that they were able to craft such lush, intriguing trailers while steering clear of all of this.
But now we know, and boy is Blade Runner 2049 a sight to behold. Director Denis Villeneuve does a tremendous job of maintaining the pacing and atmosphere of the first Blade Runner so that this feels like a continuation of that story, but he brings enough new to the table that this feels far from a retread. Indeed, this is one of those legacy sequels that offers new revelations about old characters while having new characters take center stage, and the screenplay by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green is packed full of surprises that really shouldn't work, but totally do.
Ryan Gosling is the heart and soul of this thing as K, and the film follows something of a Pinocchio story with regards to his character. The revelation that he isn't a “special boy” makes his decision to save Deckard and reunite the family all the more impactful—he's making a choice not out of obligation or hope for reward, but because it's the right thing to do. Of course he's also colored by his love for Joi (Ana de Armas), which is another delicate touch that works beautifully. And then there's Harrison Ford, giving a flat-out great performance with limited screentime. When the guy cares, and when he's given a good character, he can knock it out of the park. And this is all to say nothing of the tremendous craftsmanship on display, from Roger Deakins' jaw-dropping cinematography to the pulsing, surprisingly emotional score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch.
But enough of my rambling. Matt's review is on the site, but we now want to know what you think, readers. How do you feel about Blade Runner 2049? What are your thoughts on the twists and turns? Is it truly a better film than the original Blade Runner? Sounds off in the comments below.
LeBron James back in Miami?
It's a possibility, according to one betting service.
The online sportsbook Bovada released its initial betting lines for what team James will open on in the 2018-19 NBA season.
The Miami Heat is one of eight teams that made the list. Its 25-to-1 odds (+2500), though, are tied for the worst among the potential candidates, along with the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers.

The Cavaliers (+180) and the Philadelphia 76ers (+185) are the clear favorites.
The other three teams: the Houston Rockets (+270), the Los Angeles Lakers (+300) and the Golden State Warriors (+1600)
James, 33, is in the second year of a three-year, $100 million contract with the Cavaliers. However, James' contract has a player option following the 2018 season, meaning James can decide whether to play one more season in Cleveland or head to free agency.
He spent four seasons in Miami (2010-2014) as part of the Big 3 era with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The Heat reached the NBA Finals all four seasons and won back-to-back NBA Championships in 2012 and 2013.

Come next season, James could find himself in a new place, leading a new team to newfound heights.
For now, James will be in a familiar place when the 2018 NBA Finals get underway on Thursday. James will be playing in the best-of-7 series for an eighth straight season and is looking for his fourth NBA Championship in that span and second with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Is the selection process for Honolulu's new police chief about to hit a snag?
Honolulu Police Commission chairman Max Sword is related to one of the finalists. So what could this mean for the final decision?
Sword went to the Honolulu Ethics Commission to let them know of his relationship to candidate Thomas Aiu.
Up until this point, the five Honolulu police commissioners only knew each police chief candidate by number.
They only learned of the names when they decided to move forward with seven finalists.
Sword disclosed to the ethics commission that the retired federal agent, now currently head of corporate security at Hawaiian Airlines, is his wife's first cousin.
View his full statement on the issue below.
The ethics commission did not answer our questions Friday, so we turned to ethics professor Ken Lawson at the University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law.
“Most individuals who are seated in a seat of public trust, when there's a relative or a close friend with a contract or coming up from the job, they recuse themselves,” he said.
It's a question Sword posed to the ethics commission.
The five commissioners will choose the new chief. How will the voting process work now? That's up to the ethics commission.
To Lawson, the answer is simple: “He's got to step back and say, ‘You know what, I've got to step back, because one of the candidates is a relative.”
The other six finalists in the running are Susan Ballard, Kurt Kendro, Kevin Lima, Mark Lomax, James Lowery, and Paul Putzulu.
We asked Lawson, even if the ethics commission allows Sword to remain part of the selection process, should he still step aside?
“In order for it to be transparent, yeah,” Lawson said. “Part of the reason why we're in this position is there was a lack of trust in police department. Now we're starting process where there may be favoritism shown. Give us a clean process, a process where everybody says you know what, it was done fair and square.”
The commissioners are holding the final interviews with the finalists in two weeks.
Statement from Max Sword regarding disclosure to ethics commission: “After learning that Thomas Aiu was one of the seven finalists for the Chief of Police position, chosen by independent assessment panels on the mainland and Hawaii, I discussed with the Police Commission staff my relationship to him through my wife. Mr. Aiu is her first cousin. “The Police Commission staff then had informal discussions with the Ethics Commission on how to proceed on this matter to see if there is any conflict of interest. Mr. Aiu and I do not interact on any business matters and we have no shared financial interests. “In an abundance of caution, I have filed a Conflict of Interest disclosure statement with the Ethics Commission, and await their decision. “I know I can be completely impartial and fair to all of the candidates. I will not give special treatment to any one of them, and will use independent judgment in determining which of the candidates will be the best Chief of Police for the City and County of Honolulu. “The Commission set up the entire selection process to be as objective as possible, with no Commission input on the candidate selection up to this point. When the final seven candidates come before the Commission in 2 weeks, it will be our first interaction with them, as they were selected by outside panels. “I fully intend to continue to perform my duties as a member of the Honolulu Police Commission, including participating in the interview and selection of our new Chief of Police, as objectively and responsibly as possible.”
Criminal charges have been laid in the case of Serenity, a four-year-old Alberta girl who died in kinship care three years ago. Julia Wong reports.
The provincial cabinet is now considering a report that recommends British Columbians vote on two things during this fall's electoral reform referendum. The questions are:
Which should British Columbia use for elections to the Legislative Assembly? The current First Past the Post voting system
A proportional representation voting system If British Columbia adopts a proportional representation voting system, which of the following voting systems do you prefer? Dual Member Proportional (DMP)
Mixed Member Proportional (MMP)
Rural-Urban PR
These are not the determined questions for the referendum, they are recommendations that will be decided on by cabinet. B.C.'s Attorney General David Eby wanted to release the suggested questions based on public input so that any changes by cabinet would be publicly known.
“To maintain my actual and perceived neutrality throughout this referendum process, I have recused myself from all Cabinet and caucus debate and discussions regarding all aspects of the referendum,” writes Eby in a letter submitted to cabinet alongside the recommended questions. “To enhance the level of transparency around decision-making respecting the referendum, I have also taken the step of making this report and my recommendations publicly available prior to transmitting the report to you.”

On the first question, British Columbians can only vote for one option and the winner needs 50 per cent of the vote plus one.
On the second question, British Columbians can rank the three choices or select one, two or three options. If no voting system receives more than 50 per cent of first-choice votes, then the system that receives the fewest first-choice votes is dropped from further consideration.
If the outcome of the referendum is to stay with the current system, then the second question is moot.
The recommendations come out of an extensive public consultation that saw 91,725 questionnaires completed on the issue of electoral reform. Eby says this is the largest public consultation that the British Columbia government has ever conducted.
Eby has submitted a 106 page report to the cabinet for consideration. The report recommends the referendum campaign period kicks off on July 1, with the referendum taking place between October 22, 2018 and November 30, 2018.
As part of the recommendations, designated referendum proponent and opponent groups will be selected and provided with $500,000 in public funding.
Eby is also recommending that if the result of the 2018 referendum is the adoption of a PR voting system, a second referendum would be held after two provincial general elections in which voters would be asked to keep the current system or go back to the old first past the post system.

Emboldened by a recent Superior Court decision strongly condemning Canada's practice of indefinite immigration detention, lawyers representing a West African man who has spent nearly four-and-a-half years in maximum-security jail waiting to be deported will demand his release Thursday at a hearing in Etobicoke.“His ongoing detention is unconstitutional because it's both arbitrary and indefinite,” said Jared Will, an immigration lawyer who recently took up the case of Ebrahim Toure, a 46-year-old failed refugee claimant who is not charged with a crime but has been in jail since February 2013. “They say they're detaining him for removal but they have no means of removing him. There's no end point to his detention and it's disconnected from its purpose.”Toure, who was profiled earlier this year as part of a Star investigation into immigration detention, is the longest-serving immigration detainee in detention. He says he was born in The Gambia and raised partly in Guinea. But he can't prove his citizenship to either country so neither will take him back. Canada's border police accuse him of not co-operating with his deportation, but he insists he is willing to be deported and has given them all the information he has.“Their position is that it's his lack of co-operation that is the impediment to the removal,” said Will, who recently won the release of another immigration detainee who had been locked up for more than seven years. “But they have nothing concrete to demonstrate that there's anything that he can actually do to facilitate the deportation.”Article Continued BelowToure's case is just the latest to draw scrutiny upon Canada's immigration detention system, which is facing a potential overhaul in light of recent court challenges. Will was the lead lawyer in those cases as well.Last month he argued in Federal Court that the entire immigration detention regime violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and should be struck down or dramatically altered. A decision is expected sometime this summer.In April he successfully persuaded Superior Court Justice Ian Nordheimer to order the immediate release of Kashif Ali, who had spent more than seven years in immigration detention. In a firm reprimand to Canada's border police, Nordheimer called Ali's situation “unacceptable” and said the government could not justify jailing someone indefinitely — even in cases where they were not co-operating with their removal.
The total of volume of trade recorded in the I&E forex window last week grew by 39.6 percent in contrast to the volume recorded the previous week.
According to analysts at Cordros Research, the total volume traded in the I&E FX segment for the week stood at $900.50 million in contrast to $645.1 million the week earlier.
Cordros Research said the Naira was flat against the Dollar in the parallel market at N363 while it appreciated by 0.07 percent to N360.41k in the I&E FX window.
During the week, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) injected $210 million into the forex market, comprising $100 million, $55 million, and $55 million disbursements to the wholesale, SME, and invisibles windows, respectively.
Given the continued accretion to the foreign reserves and the CBN's continued intervention, our theme on the Naira remains stability.
Cordros Research said in its continued bid to improve the ease of doing business in the country, the Federal government has reduced documentation requirements for exports and imports to 7 and 8, from 10 and 14 respectively, and saddled the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) with additional responsibilities – including Saturdays for official work, shipping manifests to other examination agencies as soon as they are received and coordinating mandatory joint examination.
With plans toward ensuring 24-hour clearance of cargo, using cutting-edge technology amid continuous removal of bottlenecks, we think this will further improve Nigeria's ease of doing business ranking and more importantly, facilitate trade.
Earlier, Fitch Ratings cut its 2017 economic growth forecast for Nigeria to 1%, from 1.5%, on the back of fragile recovery (as oil revenue remain depressed), and also added that oil production target of 2.3mbpd was ambiguous, cutting its forecast to 2mbpd levels (which was partly linked to a potential resurgence violence in the Niger Delta region as election approaches in 2019).
While acknowledging the continued vulnerability of the domestic economy to oil-related shocks, we think government efforts (albeit unfolding too slowly) at implementing reforms (the ERGP in particular) provide short to medium term comfort vis-à-vis a firmer recovery

What did we learn from the Chicago Blackhawks' dominant performance against the Pittsburgh Penguins?
Emily Kaplan: After the morning skate on Thursday, a reporter informed Jonathan Toews that many national pundits have the Blackhawks missing the playoffs. "Interesting," the captain said, noting his teammates hardly felt the same way. Maybe we should listen to Captain Serious more often. Thursday night against the Penguins, Chicago scored five goals in the first period -- two more than they did during their entire 2017 postseason. Pundits' usual concern about the Blackhawks? They're too top-heavy with a roster hamstrung by the contracts of Toews and Patrick Kane. But for anyone skeptical about Chicago trying to get the band back together, it looks like the band could have a few more hits.
A hat trick-scoring Brandon Saad was one of many good things about the Blackhawks' blowout victory over the Penguins. Dennis Wierzbicki-USA TODAY Sports
Chris Peters: On paper, there are certainly holes in this Blackhawks' lineup, but offense should not be a problem. Much was made of Kane losing Artemi Panarin as a linemate, but Kane looked just as comfortable alongside Nick Schmaltz and Ryan Hartman. Those three players accounted for 12 points -- five for Hartman, four for Kane and three for Schmaltz -- while skating circles around the bewildered Penguins. Five points a night won't be the norm, but Kane is going to put up points no matter who he plays with. On top of that, Brandon Saad reintroduced himself to Blackhawks fans after a two-year run wiht the Columbus Blue Jackets with a hat trick, bolstering Chicago's top line. Yeah, the Penguins were on the second half of a back-to-back and sure, they started a rusty Antti Niemi, who actually stumbled before he even got onto the ice Thursday night, but to get waxed like that? It takes a talented team to dismantle the defending champs so completely.
Editor's Picks Who will stop the Penguins' Stanley Cup run? Sidney Crosby & Co. are the favorites to win the Stanley Cup this season. But, they'll face particularly tough challenges from these five teams that can exploit the Penguins' weaknesses.
Experts' picks for the 2017-18 NHL season Connor McDavid earned the big hardware last season in his second attempt. Can he do it again? And will the Penguins pull the unfathomable and three-peat? Our experts have got this.
Previews, predictions for all 31 NHL teams Will the Penguins continue their dynastic run? Will the Blackhawks return to dominance? And just who are the Golden Knights, exactly? ESPN has the lowdown on every team. 2 Related
Ben Arledge: It is the second day of the season, the Penguins played the previous night and they started their backup goaltender (who didn't even post a .900 save percentage last season). Let's not overreact to Game 1 of 82, even if it was a 10-goal blitz. With that said, Chicago looks very good to start the season. Kane looked fantastic, stacking the highlight reel all night with two gorgeous backhand assists and a ridiculous top-shelf goal, and Saad seems happy to be back in Chitown, finding the back the net three times. Early word from Coach Quenneville is that Schmaltz is fine after leaving with a right leg injury, which is great news considering how strong he looked. Alex DeBrincat didn't join the scoring party, but I think he is in for a big season, too. The Blackhawks continue to masterfully dance around salary-cap troubles in the offseason and stay right in the middle of contention every season. Bottom line is Chicago isn't going anywhere, it was never going anywhere and it will likely take the Central Division yet again this season -- but we didn't need to see it run over a team in October to know that.
Paul Grant: Sure, it's just one game, but the Blackhawks looked great against a Penguins team that was playing its second game in two nights, especially in the first period. Offseason returnees Patrick Sharp and Saad both scored, which is huge for the Blackhawks. If those guys can contribute depth scoring like it's 2013, the Western Conference is in trouble.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec 11 (Reuters) – Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore touted his ties to President Donald Trump on Monday in the final stretch of an election campaign in Alabama in which Moore has battled accusations of sexual misconduct toward teenagers.
On the eve of Tuesday's election, Moore, a conservative Christian and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, was holding a rally in Midland City, Alabama, where he was to be joined by Steve Bannon, Trump's close ally and former chief strategist.
In an echo of Trump's 2016 campaign pledge to get rid of Washington insiders, Moore labeled his Monday rally a “Drain the Swamp” event. Bannon, an executive at the right-wing Breitbart News site, has been one of Moore's staunchest supporters.
READ MORE: Alabama's Roy Moore dodges campaign spotlight as sexual misconduct accusations loom
Moore, 70, will face off against Democrat Doug Jones, 63, a former U.S. attorney who is hoping to pull off an upset victory in deeply conservative Alabama, which has sent only Republicans to the U.S. Senate for the past 20 years.
Moore has been accused by several women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied any misconduct. Reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations.
WATCH: Many women in Alabama still supporting Roy Moore for Senate
The Alabama race has divided Trump's Republican Party.
The sexual misconduct accusations prompted many senior Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to distance themselves from Moore.
But Trump has endorsed Moore and taped a “robo-call” that the campaign has rolled out urging voters to back the Republican candidate in order to help support the president's agenda.
READ MORE: Alabama Republicans sticking with Roy Moore despite sexual misconduct allegations
Democrats also made robo-calls using two of their party's own big guns – former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden.
A Fox News Poll conducted on Thursday and released on Monday put Jones ahead of Moore, with Jones potentially taking 50 percent of the vote and Moore 40 percent. Fox said 8 percent of voters were undecided and 2 percent supported another candidate.
WATCH: Donald Trump backs Roy Moore during Florida rally
An average of recent polls by the RealClearPolitics website showed Moore ahead by a slight margin of 2.2 percentage points.
Jones has cast himself as a “voice for reason” for Alabama and has touted a record that includes prosecuting former Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham in which four girls were killed.
“Right side of history”
Jones has spent the past week rallying African-Americans, the most reliably Democratic voters in the state, and hammering Moore in television ads. He has told supporters that his campaign is a chance to be on the “right side of history for the state of Alabama.”
If Jones wins on Tuesday, Republicans would control the Senate by a slim 51-49 margin, giving Democrats much-needed momentum ahead of the November 2018 congressional elections, when control of both chambers of Congress will be at stake.

Moore's campaign has cast Jones as a liberal out of step with Alabama voters, seizing on the Democrat's support of abortion rights.
Many Republican officials in Alabama, including Governor Kay Ivey, say they will vote for Moore. But the state's senior Republican senator, Richard Shelby, said he did not vote for Moore and instead backed a write-in candidate on his absentee ballot, telling CNN that Alabama “deserves better” than Moore.
WATCH: Roy Moore gets boost from Steve Bannon at campaign rally
Moore, who was twice removed from the state Supreme Court for refusing to abide by federal law, may find a chilly reception in Washington if he wins. Republican leaders have said Moore could face an ethics investigation if Alabama voters send him to the U.S. Senate.
Democrats have signaled they may use Moore's election to tar Republicans as insensitive to women's concerns at a time when allegations of sexual harassment have caused many prominent men working in politics, entertainment, media and business to lose their jobs.

Allegations of sexual misconduct prompted the resignations last week of three lawmakers – Democratic Senator Al Franken, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks.
Agassi perplexed by 'unexplainable' Federer exploits

Roger Federer in action at Wimbledon
Andre Agassi has described "timeless" Wimbledon favourite Roger Federer's exploits in the twilight of his career as "unexplainable".
Federer returned from injury following a six-month absence to win the Australian Open last year at the age of 35, ending a five-year wait for an 18th grand slam title.
The legendary Swiss followed that up by claiming Wimbledon glory for a record eighth time 12 months ago and took his tally of major triumphs to 20 in Melbourne back in January.
Federer again opted to skip the clay-court season to prepare himself for Wimbledon and will take some stopping as he goes in search of a 99th tournament triumph at the England Club.
Agassi, a winner of eight grand slam titles in a stellar career, is at a loss to explain Federer's incredible achievements.
The American told Omnisport: "He is the favourite [to win Wimbledon] and watching him play, what is remarkable to me is how easy he makes it look after not competing for so long.
"It's almost as if he doesn't need to play tennis matches, it comes so natural for him. He makes it look easy, he has so many options, so as he gets older maybe if he loses half a step, it doesn't change how he plays.
"He gets more efficient it seems the older he gets, he seems timeless, it's remarkable, unexplainable."
PanARMENIAN.Net - Editor of the Russian travel magazine Interesniy Mir (Interesting World) Igor Shiryaev and his wife, Larisa, have shot a documentary about Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh), Shiryaev said in a Facebook post.
Titled "Nagorno Karabakh (Artsakh)", the movie was filmed during a press tour in Artsakh on the 30th anniversary of the Armenian national liberation movement in the country in 2018.
“Our film is ready and available online. Many thanks to everyone who helped, supported, believed in us,” Shiryaev said.
“In the film, we show beautiful Artsakh, and the film is definitely tourist-oriented. So, here's hoping that travelers will go to our lovely Artsakh.”
Shiryaev was among the group of journalists who visited Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh) to participate in events marking the 30th anniversary of the Karabakh movement on February 10-13.
7 Ways to Schedule Your Day for Millionaire Success
Millionaires are master schedulers. When most of us think of scheduling our day, the number one consideration to account for is time. There are 24 hours in the day and at least a third of that time needs to be reserved for personal pursuits – such as sleeping and eating!
Millionaires aren't privy to some kind of secret sauce that leads them to success. They simply schedule the various parts of their day better than the rest. They know what to prioritize, and how to rank the various personal and professional items on their to-do list in order of importance better than most low and middle-income folks do.
Here are 7 bits of great advice the majority of entrepreneurs who've ascended to their own version of greatness have used to get there:
1. Rise before the sun
The typical millionaire, who wasn't born with a silver spoon in their mouth, wakes up between 4 and 5 in the morning and starts their routine shortly thereafter. Eric Thomas likes to beat the 4am rush and get up for 3:00! He does this most every day, but occasionally life throws him curveballs.
If you're on the road to greatness and looking for the edge, consider getting up before everyone and getting a bunch of things done while the rest of the world is sleeping.
2. Start the day on your terms
The worst thing anyone can do is grab the phone off the nightstand and immediately start reading and answering emails, or jumping right into social media. This puts you into reaction mode and that's the way the rest of your day will likely go. Not because of everyone else, but because you made the wrong choice.
The early hours need to be for you, to plan how you want your day to go, or to spend some time being creative and getting some solid ideas for your business and life down on paper – not spent in reactionary mode like so many other constantly-pulling-out-their-hair professionals do!
3. Make tasks and sequences of tasks easier by chunking down
Everything, even the fun stuff, can become a burden when you look at your day as one big continuous event. When you view tasks and the day as a whole as one big lump, it's easy to get overwhelmed and think you can't get it all done. Millionaires tackle this problem by chunking everything down, with actual or approximate times to complete each chunk within:
Email time (30 mins)
Social posts (30 mins)
Meetings (1 hour)
Interviews (50 mins)
Blogging (40 mins)
Lunch (15 mins)
Dinner with family (60 mins)
Gym (90 mins)
Etc.
Tasks can easily be broken into chunks to, either chunks of time for each task (eg., proofreading, signing documents, calling clients), or chunks of time to complete key parts of a given task (eg., Proofreading: skim for 5 mins; in-depth read-through with red pen for 10 mins; consult with marketing manager for 15 mins about document).
4. Always pencil in time for creativity
Few of you could imagine allocating enough time each month to come up with 10 truly creative and potentially actionable ideas of your own. James Altucher, author of “Choose Yourself” claims to come up with 10 new ideas each and every day!
If all your days are spent responding to people and problems or brainlessly looking for things to do, how are you going to compete with the likes of this man, Seth Godin, Tony Robbins, Grant Cardone, and many others? Trust me, none have become so big they just pay everyone to create new ideas for their brand.
5. Realize efficiency will only take you so far
Most millionaires espouse the benefits of constantly refining processes and finding new ways to get things done faster. They're not wrong, but few got their start by finding ways to get other people to do work for them, or signing up for trials of the latest productivity apps.
Most kept pushing forward and working their tails off to get their businesses profitable. After, things like personal assistants, chefs, trainers, and entire teams of professionals started to make their lives easier for them. Barbara Corcoran's advice is: “If you're gonna do well at anything, I think you just have to put the work in.”
6. Embrace gratitude
If you have nothing to be grateful for, what's the sense of continuing the journey? Millionaires understand that putting out tons of effort all the time, without some introspection to admire what you've created, and to find joy in one's surroundings is a recipe for burnout and possible depression.
Gary Vaynerchuk, a prolific entrepreneur and author, urges you to never, ever take things you have for granted because there's so much goodness in where you live and what you are.
7. Don't get trapped into dogma
We've all heard this famous quote from Steve Jobs. He wasn't just referring to those who work in the tech industry like he did either. The idea that we all must follow what the experts recommend, to get where we need/want to go, is an opinion that most millionaires definitely reject.
A fact they've all learned (and you will too) throughout their rise to glory is that everyone has to follow their own path. Regardless whether certain unavoidable modicums of “how things must be done” need to be adhered to (ie., putting the battery in your smartphone backwards doesn't work!)
If you need to write a book in two weeks instead of two months – or else – then that's what you have to do!
Closing Thoughts
As you can see, there's a lot more that goes into executing the perfect day than merely typing out a schedule and following it. You'll have to make sacrifices that go against your own preferences (such as waking up early).
You'll also have to think outside the box, constantly refine your creative process, go against accepted ways of thinking, and get introspective and figure out what's going great and what needs improvement for continual improvement.
Wherever the path leads you, good luck and remember “failing to plan is planning to fail!”

In talking to Resident Evil producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi for the theatrical and home video release of Resident Evil: Vendetta, I've learned what the future of the live-action movie franchise might just look like. Long involved with the franchise–he began as a programmer for Capcom on the original video game back in 1996 and has produced both live-action and animated films since then–Hiroyuki Kobayashi has seen the horror title evolve a number of times in his last 20 years with Capcom. But as a recent report suggested, once Paul W.S. Anderson and Milla Jovovich‘s six-film series came to a close early this year, wheels were already turning for a franchise reboot.
That franchise might very well continue without either Anderson or Jovovich's involvement as director and star, but their contributions have already set the tone for the future of the franchise. You can't really blame the Resident Evil brass for wanting to divert from a plan of attack that's brought in over $1.2 billion worldwide over the last 15 years and also set a franchise high for the box office with their closing chapter. Fans may differ on their opinion for how Resident Evil should move forward, but it sounds like they should expect more of the same.
Some words of warning: In Hiroyuki Kobayashi's words (through a translator), “nothing has been decided yet. No script, no storyline, no director, no cast members.” There are also more entities involved in the reboot than Capcom, including Constantin Film and Screen Gems, to name but two. So it's worth mentioning that the plans are still in the early works and many things can and will change going forward.
That being said, here's what we learned about the current state of the Resident Evil live-action movie franchise reboot, after confirming that Hiroyuki Kobayashi is indeed involved. He described his role on Resident Evil: Vendetta as follows:
I'm the producer at Capcom, so I had to make sure that the world of the game is depicted in the film itself. That was my main responsibility.
I'm going to make an assumption that his role in the live-action movie production will be along the same lines, especially since he's been involved with them for three of the six films, so far. The surprising reveal for the future of the franchise came when I asked what will separate the new films from the existing series:
We will be getting a new director and also the cast members are going to change, too, but I'm looking forward to doing it.
Since no hard decisions have been made, I asked him what tone–more action vs more horror–he was going for with the new films:
I personally like Paul W.S. Anderson's [direction] on the live-action [films]. Stuff like that, I would like to see more action.
So if you're a fan of the current slate of Resident Evil films, and plenty of people around the world certainly are, it sounds like you can expect a similar ride from the new wave, whenever it arrives.
Be sure to let us know your thoughts in the comments below, and keep an eye out for more from my chat with Hiroyuki Kobayashi and the cast of Resident Evil: Vendetta soon!
Hundreds of Indigenous students took part in the annual graduation powwow at the University of Saskatchewan (U of S) on Wednesday.
The powwow recognized the academic achievements of graduating First Nations, Métis and Inuit students from the U of S and high schools in the area.

Many groups of Indigenous drummers, singers, and dancers from around North America took part in the powwow, which featured competitions throughout the day. Roughly $20,000 in prize money was up for grabs.
“We want to showcase the culture, so people can see, recognize and honour it,” Graeme Joseph, team leader with First Nations, Inuit and Métis student success at the U of S, said. “Interestingly this year, what we're doing is incorporating much more of the Metis community into the powwow.”
Over 380 Indigenous students are expected to graduate from the U of S in June, with another 116 students that graduated in the fall.
“We do see increasing numbers of aboriginal students at the university, there's been a significant increase within the last five years,” Joseph said. “We see increasing numbers of graduates as well.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook “likes” can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of — and which Facebook may have enabled.
The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections.
Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain's information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's servers because the British firm had been “uncooperative” in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it “stood down” that effort at the request of British officials.
Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet, Stamos said he's still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed.
It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence.
Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm “took fake news to the next level.”
“This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening,” Wylie said Monday on NBC's “Today.” It's not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that.
Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn't downloaded the app or given explicit consent.
Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku.
Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon — later President Donald Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser — as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work.
The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person's viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch.
But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it's connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media.
Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.”
Wylie told “Today” that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views.
The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge's data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn't retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn't use it in its 2016 campaign work.
Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016.
Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.
Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime.
It's possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz's campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter.
Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn't immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn't immediately respond to emailed questions.
Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook's mapping of the “social graph” — essentially the web of people's real-life connections — is also invaluable for marketers.
For example, researchers can look at people's clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting.
Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according to Pew Research Center. While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.

(Reuters) - Arsenal will assess new signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's fitness before deciding if the striker can make his debut for the club in Saturday's Premier League clash with Everton, manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday.
The London club bolstered their forward line by signing the Gabon international from Borussia Dortmund for a club-record fee on Wednesday but Aubameyang, 28, did not fully participate in Thursday's training session due to a fever.
“Aubameyang, I have to assess how well he is physically today and how well he feels,” Wenger told a news conference.
“He had a fever so he could not practise a lot. He started yesterday, was still not completely well. I have to assess with the medical department how fit he can be.”
Wenger revealed that he would take a late call on midfielder Jack Wilshere, who is also unwell.
“We hope he is capable of being in the squad, he is better. He will practice with the team today and we will see how he feels,” Wenger added.
The manager said Armenia midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan, another of Arsenal's recruits in the January transfer window, is in line to start against ninth-placed Everton.
Wenger, however, kept his cards close to his chest when asked if the attacking quartet of Aubameyang, Mkhitaryan, Mesut Ozil and Alexandre Lacazette could play together on Saturday.
“It's always possible. Will I do it? Maybe, I don't know. But it is possible, yes,” Wenger added.
“We can play two up (front) as well. One up or two up. You need at least two top strikers to play in the Premier League because if one gets injured you have a problem.”
Arsenal is sixth in the table with 42 points from 25 games.
Tiger Woods had five different drugs in his system when he was arrested for DUI, ESPN reports. (AAP)
Tiger Woods had five different drugs in his system when he was arrested on the side of a Florida road, according to a toxicology report cited by ESPN.
Tiger Woods had five different drugs in his system when he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, ESPN reports.
ESPN, which cited a copy of the toxicology report, said the former world No.1 golfer had in his system hydrocodone, the generic form of a painkiller branded as Vicodin; hydromorphone, a painkiller known as Dilaudid; alprazolam, a mood and sleep drug known as Xanax; zolpidem, a sleep drug known as Ambien; and the active ingredient in marijuana.
It is not known if Woods had prescriptions for all the medications. Medical marijuana is legal in Florida.
Woods checked into a clinic in June for treatment to help deal with prescription drugs.
He said in July he had completed treatment.
Police found Woods in his Mercedes-Benz on the side of a Palm Beach-area road early on May 29.
He had "extremely slow and slurred speech" after being awakened by officers.
A blood test showed he had Vicodin and Xanax in his system but no alcohol.
He was charged with driving under the influence and improperly stopping his vehicle.
Woods apologised to fans after his arrest and blamed the incident on prescription medication he was taking to manage pain from back surgery.
Eating healthy is something that many people find difficult over time. People give all kinds of reasons not to. In this economy, a big reason may be that they can't afford to eat healthy. However, the below article will prove that it is possible to eat healthy on a budget.
It may sound like a broken record but when it comes to nutrition, pull out that food pyramid you were given in elementary school. This will ensure that you get the proper combination of starches, proteins, carbs, and other essential elements of a healthy diet. If you are looking to be a productive member of society, or just of the workplace, being well nourished is the first step.
Use cinnamon to trick your body. If you get strong cravings for sweets, but you are doing your best to stay on track, cinnamon can help. Grab your favorite fruit and sprinkle copious amounts of cinnamon on them. This works great with apples and bananas. Make sure the cinnamon is pure and has no added sugar.
Nutrition is a science with some objective elements. But there is also a subjective aspect to nutrition. While studying nutrition, you need to be mindful of your individual needs as well as rules that apply generally. For instance, a person with celiac disease needs to avoid certain grains, while these grains may be fine for other people.
Keep your portions reasonable to your body size. Try resisting the urge to get up, and fill up your plate with that second helping. Look online to see the recommended potions of food that you should be having for a variety of foods such as meat, dairy, and whole grains.
Summer time is a wonderful time to enjoy all the fresh fruits the season has to offer. Because it is easy to get bored with eating the same thing every day, you need to learn how to mix things up. Next time you buy grapes, try putting a serving size in the freezer. Then you will have a healthy frozen treat to enjoy.
Drinking a glass of orange juice every morning is one of the best ways to start off your day. Orange juice is loaded with vitamin C, potassium, and other great nutrients. Some brands even add calcium to their orange juice. One tall glass of 100% orange juice per day is a great way to get the recommended amount of fruit in your diet.
Use low-fat yogurt as a healthy alternative to chip dip. Chip dips are notoriously high in fat and calories. Low fat yogurt makes a great healthy substitute. It is thick enough to cover the chips and it packs a punch in terms of taste. Use it just like you would any other dip.
Crunchy carrots are healthy additions to your diet. Don't forget to add them to your diet. Besides being tasty snacks, they have significant health benefits. There carotene, vitamin A, minerals, antioxidants and dietary fiber content protect your skin, improve your eyesight and add healthy levels of minerals to your body.
A good nutrition tip is to eat darker colored vegetables. Darker colored vegetables tend to offer the best nutrition. A good example of a darker vegetable would be something like broccoli or spinach. Avoid lighter colored vegetables such as celery and iceberg lettuce because they offer very little in terms of nutrition.
When you are pregnant and nutrition is especially important, it may be hard to get the essentials you need for you and your baby when you don't feel like eating. Try a slice of mango. The fragrance of a ripe mango is truly enticing and it's high in iron, too!
If you have never read food nutrition labels before, pregnancy is the time to start. Everything your baby uses to grow and develop comes from what you eat, so make every bite count. Look for labels that list whole grains, vitamin C, iron, and other essential nutrients that ensure the best nutrition for your baby.
More and more people are discovering that they are gluten intolerant or completely allergic to it with celiacs disease. Gluten is the protein found in wheat, barley, rye and other grains. If you have a sensitive stomach, or digestive issues, check with your doctor to see if you might need to be tested.
A good rule for better nutrition is: If you don't know what it is or how it is pronounced, don't eat it. The preservatives and additives in most processed food is by and large nothing but chemicals. Many of these things are unnatural to the body and will result in unnecessary waste in your system. Keep to simple ingredient lists that are easily read.
If you're pregnant, check with your doctor about getting a magnesium prescription. Magnesium deficiency can lead to cramps, premature delivery, or even a miscarriage. It's recommended that you take in at least 310 milligrams of magnesium everyday. Your doctor may be able to write you a prescription for a daily dose of magnesium.
By buying produce at a local farmers market or from a farm stand that one knows of in the area, an individual can get a variety of locally grown fruits and vegetables. Not only will one be getting the nutritional benefits from the fruits and vegetables but they will be supporting their local farmers.
A good health tip that everyone would do well to heed is to eat small meals. Studies have shown that smaller meals help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight range. Most of the time our eyes are bigger than our stomachs so implement some self control and reduce your portion size.
Now that you know what types of things you should be eating for proper nutrition, you should start to see a difference in the way you look and feel. You really ARE a reflection of the things that you eat, and information given here, can help you be a healthier person.

The perfect pancake is a delicate balance of art and science.
The traditional Pancake Day blowout takes place on 28 February, and there are still a lot of Shrove Tuesday questions to be answered.
Do you go savoury or sweet? How long should you fry them for? When should you toss it?
If you don't want to find yourself scraping burnt batter off the bottom of a pan - or worse, the ceiling - then follow these handy tips.
Filming your Pancake Day efforts? Don't forget to share the video with us using the form below
Your basic ingredients
For any good pancake, you need to start with the basics. This recipe will serve four, so just double it if you've got more mouths to feed (or you're really hungry).
200g/7oz plain flour
350-400ml/12-14fl oz milk, or for a thinner, lighter pancake you can use half milk and half water
2 large eggs to be lightly whisked
1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
A pinch of salt
You'll also need vegetable oil to lightly drizzle in the pan if they're not non-stick.
Method
- Put the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the centre and pour in the milk and eggs.
- Whisk the mixture for a minute before incorporating the flour.
- Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter.
- Add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and whisk thoroughly.
- Drizzle a dash of oil into your pan and swirl it round - or using some kitchen roll, carefully wipe the inside of the pan until it has a thin layer.
- Heat the pan over a medium setting for one minute.
Now it's time to make your pancake!
- Add your batter to the pan (just under a ladle full is the perfect amount) and immediately start tilting the pan until you have an even layer.
- Cook the pancake for approximately 30-40 seconds and when it is ready use a palette knife to lift the pancake carefully.
- If the underside is golden-brown turn it over or toss it, if you're feeling brave - just be careful when you're doing this that you don't burn yourself.
- Cook the other side for approximately 30-40 seconds and finally transfer to a serving plate.

Workers at a north-end Toronto recycling plant were being decontaminated early Friday due to an unknown substance that caused some to have difficulty breathing.
Toronto Fire Dept. platoon chief Doug Harper said crews arrived at the facility (near Arrow Road and Sheppard Avenue) just before midnight because of an unknown substance which created what he called a "minor irritant."
Harper says several people experienced respiratory difficulties but firefighters have so far been unable to identify and find the substance.
Two people were reportedly taken to hospital.

KARACHI - The K-Electric Tuesday conducted a anti-power theft drive in Babar Market, Landhi to curb power theft.
Around 10 illegal commercial connections confiscated over 240 meters of cable in Babar Market.
It is pertinent to note that the drive was conducted with the support of market association members.
Some consumers were also facilitated with rebate and settlements in their bills on the spot to avoid disconnections.
Prior to anti-theft drive, the KE also upgraded power infrastructure by converting 18 PMTs on ABC (Arial Bundled Cabling) System. Infrastructure up-gradation coupled with anti-theft drives help in enabling reliability of power supply in the market.
Babar Market Association Finance Secretary Muhammad Ameen said: “Consistent power supply during business hours has boosted commercial activities in our area. We will continue to cooperate with the K-Electric to eliminate the menace of electricity theft.”
The KE's consistent efforts towards curbing power theft along with other initiatives have enabled the power utility to reduce its Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses by around 14 percent since 2009.
According to KE spokesperson, “Power theft is the leading cause of faults in the system and a source of inconvenience for the community at large. The power utility remains fully committed to eradicate power theft and appreciated the support of the community to help curb the menace of electricity theft.”
LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - "Annabelle: Creation" may not be able to save the summer -- which, after this weekend, will only fall farther behind last year's pace -- but it is doing its part to frighten audiences into theaters.
The latest from New Line and Warner Bros, which serves as the fourth installment in what has become the "Conjuring" extended universe, is casting its evil eye on $35 million from 3,502 locations. That's a strong start for the horror flick, which was made for about $15 million.
The track record for the franchise is strong -- "Annabelle" ($37.1 million); "The Conjuring" ($41.9 million); and "The Conjuring 2" ($40.4 million). David F. Sandberg directed the sequel about a dollmaker whose creation terrorizes a group of orphan girls. For those invested in the "Conjuring" canon, it serves as a prequel to the first "Annabelle." Stephanie Sigman, Talitha Bateman, Anthony LaPaglia, and Miranda Otto star in the pic that critics have generally given a thumbs up to (it currently has an 68% on Rotten Tomatoes).
"Annabelle is scary as hell," said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief at Warner Bros. "And it's exciting to see how broadly audiences enjoyed it," he said, adding, "I think our marketing team did a fabulous job."
The same studio's "Dunkirk" continues to show strong during its fourth weekend, as it holds onto second place. One of the lone bright spots in a generally dismal summer for the box office, Christopher Nolan's World War II epic should make an additional $11.4 million this weekend, pushing its domestic total past the $150 million mark.
While it should land in the top three, Open Road's sequel "Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature" appears to be a miss. From 4,003 locations, the animated adventure should earn $8.9 million. That's less than half of the first "Nut Job" movie, which opened to $19.4 million before going on to take in $120.9 million worldwide during its run. The sequel's story centers around a group of animals who attempt to save their home from being bulldozed and turned into an amusement park.
After "Nut Job 2" is Sony's "Dark Tower" which underperformed during its opening weekend, and continues to slide. With $7.9 million from 3,451 locations, the movie looks to slip 59% from its first frame. The same studio's "Emoji Movie" is rounding out the top five with $6.6 million from 3,219 theaters, just ahead of Universal's "Girls Trip" which is closing in on the $100 million milestone. That landmark was just met by Sony's "Baby Driver," which took in $1.5 million this weekend.
Meanwhile, Lionsgate's new release "The Glass Castle" is pulling in $4.9 million from 1,461 locations. Those are meager earnings, but also a low theater count. The adaptation of Jeannette Walls' hugely-popular 2005 memoir mostly appealed to women, who made up 80% of the audience. Audiences have been generally receptive, earning the movie an A- CinemaScore, while critics are more mixed (50% of RottenTomatoes). Brie Larson reunited with "Short Term 12" director Destin Daniel Cretton for the project, which also stars Naomi Watts and Woody Harrelson.
In limited release, Paramount's "An Inconvenient Sequel" added 376 theaters this weekend for a total of 556 where it's expected to make $800,000. TWC expanded Taylor Sheridan's "Wind River" to 45 locations, where it is earning $642,067 -- the studio plans to continue the film's expansion to between 600 and 700 locations next weekend. Neon's "Ingrid Goes West," starring Aubrey Plaza and Elizabeth Olsen, should make $141,216 from just three locations. And A24's Robert Pattinson-starrer "Good Time" is opening in four theaters to $137,625.
This time last year, "Suicide Squad" suffered a steep second weekend drop to $43.5 million. But that is still more than this weekend's winner. And while Disney's "Pete's Dragon" faltered, Sony's "Sausage Party" surprised with $34.3 million, or about the same as "Annabelle: Creation" this year. That is to say, the box office continues to slip behind, and the summer of hell is only getting hotter.
Winemakers in the Okanagan Valley rely on the gargantuan power of the sun to produce the grapes, but now more and more wineries are using the sun's rays for a different purpose.
To convert sunlight into electricity.
The last panels are being installed on top of a carport at Burrowing Owl Estate winery in Oliver.
“I think it's a continuing philosophy we have here to be environmentally friendly,” said founder Jim Wyse.
Wyse said it's more economical than ever.
“As the cost of the electric panels comes down much like flat-screen TV's we've got interested in this,” he said.
But it is still a significant investment.
Another Okanagan winery goes solar. Local solar power company says business up 300% this year– majority of clients are wineries. pic.twitter.com/QcWg5isEWZ Story continues below — Shelby Thom (@Shelby_Thom) August 14, 2017
The cost of installing solar panels on five buildings totals almost $340,000 and will be for in 15 years through energy savings.
Wyse said the wine consumer cares about sustainability and he hopes sales will improve.
“Sure, ya I'm not going to pretend it won't, I hope so, we will do it anyway but if it improves sales that's a bonus,” Wyse said.
The trend towards green energy is growing in B.C.'s wine industry.
Roger Huber is the CEO Swiss Solar Tech, the Summerland-based company that installs the panels.
Huber said business has increased 300 per cent over the past year in large part due to interest from wineries.
“I think it's just to reduce the CO2, the carbon that can get off the grid,” he said.
Huber said he uses special panels that can produce electricity from the top as well as from the reflection underneath.
So as the technology develops and the trend towards businesses reducing their carbon footprints continues, expect to see more wineries going off the grid.

The John Wick franchise is expanding beyond the big screen in a very big way. When the first John Wick hit theaters in 2014, it kind of came out of nowhere. It marked the directorial debut of veteran stunt coordinators and second unit directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, and the R-rated actioner grossed an impressive $88 million worldwide. That then spawned a sequel, the Stahelski-helmed John Wick: Chapter 2, which doubled the gross of the original film to stand at $166 million worldwide. Stahelski is already hard at work developing John Wick 3, but the franchise is already looking to expand to the small screen with a John Wick TV series.
Lionsgate is currently in the midst of developing this John Wick TV series, and IndieWire has some details on what to expect. For one, the show is currently going by the title The Continental, and will focus on the network of assassins that's become a key part of the John Wick mythology. Stahelski further teased that the prequel show will follow a variety of characters, not John Wick:
“They've got a really good structure. It's very tied to the film [in that] it's about the Continentals all over the world, how certain people come into that world, and what happens in relation to those people, which is cool. I think the world is very vast, and everything I've heard from it is very positive. […] It's something that studio seems very, very intent on [making] and very, very behind… You can be with the consigliere, concierge, the sommelier — you can be with all these different characters and walk through the world in different aspects; ones that I'm a little limited [from exploring] by staying with my lead guy.”
Stahelski says he thinks the plan is for Keanu Reeves to make an appearance in the series, but the show won't be about John Wick. That character's got more story to tell in John Wick: Chapter 3, which may or may not conclude his arc. Stahelski is currently developing to direct John Wick: Chapter 3, and he tells IndieWire he'd like to stay involved with the John Wick TV series through development and potentially direct a few episodes.
As for bringing the level of action that fans expect from the John Wick franchise to the small screen, Stahelski cites Game of Thrones as a touchstone:
“Look at ‘Battle of the Bastards'. As an action designer, I think that's the best battle I've ever seen on TV. They did a great job, and they weren't careless with their money. They planned it, they boarded it — you watch the behind-the-scenes, [it's clear] the guys did everything right. Granted, they're the biggest budgeted show on TV right now, but could we do something interesting with John Wick with what we have? Yeah. I'd like to give it a go and prove to the TV world that you can have feature action on a TV show. It would be a nice little feather in my cap, sure.”
It'll be interesting to see where The Continental ends up, be it on a pay cable channel like HBO or Starz or a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. Lionsgate Television has produced a number of projects in recent years ranging from CBS' MacGyver to Starz's Crash, and they have a high-profile new series coming up in the form of Netflix's GLOW. They've been with various networks so there's no obvious choice here, but Starz's commitment to action and genre sounds like it might be a swell fit.
Wherever it ends up, the TV landscape has become so cinematic in recent years that there's a strong potential here for The Continental to be a great expansion of the John Wick universe that doesn't feel like a half-assed spinoff.
Yesterday, protests erupted in Mexico: gas prices shot up by 20 percent in areas of the country after the Mexican government's new deregulation policy went into effect. The unpopular measure is being called “gasolinazo,” which is reported to translate to “price slam,” by Mexican citizens who have become accustomed to the federal government controlling prices at the pump. For many Mexicans, who are used to the idea of the government setting gas prices, yesterday's spike is being perceived as a price hike. Rather than a price hike, which implies that the Mexican government is continuing to set the price, the uptick is said to be the result the market being opened to the forces of supply and demand, as the country prepares to open its state-controlled oil and gas resources to international oil companies in March; the first time since 1938, the year the government nationalized its petroleum reserves, as reported by the Washington Post. The government of Mexico has set the official price of gas in the country since 1992. Despite the Mexican government effectively running a monopoly on the production and sale of gasoline in the country for over 80 years, Mexicans are reported to pay the second-highest prices for gas in the world, trailing only behind South Africa, even though the country has the 17th largest oil reserves, close to 10 billion barrels, as reported by World Atlas. Citizens of Mexico appear to be familiar with this seeming disparity. “There was a sort of psychosis going around [in the 1980s] that gasoline price hikes every other day caused inflation, which helped cause shortages of basic goods,” David Shields, with Energía y Debate, was quoted by the Washington Post. “This remains in people's minds.” Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto set the wheels in motion for gas deregulation beginning in 2013, as reported by Oliver Wyman. He promised the move would result in the nation gaining “more energy, more cheaply for all Mexicans,” and GDP growth of 5 percent annually, by 2016. Expecting an economic windfall from the change, Peña Nieto's administration was described as starting to “borrow and spend” revenue that had not yet been generated. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto speaks at the United Nations on September 20, 2016. [Image by John Moore/Getty Images] As Mexican GDP is expected to grow at only 1.1 percent and inflation is forecast to jump to close to 5 percent, in 2017, Mexicans appear to be feeling the squeeze at the pumps — and are becoming impatient. The 1992 move by the government was held up as a measure to control inflation. For many citizens, higher gas prices equate to higher prices for staples, such as transportation and food. “In rural areas, people will starve to death,” a woman at a protest in Mexico City was quoted by Press TV. She went on to describe the rise in prices, attributed to deregulation, as a “price hike.” Protesters in Mexico City shut down a gas station; chanted slogans decrying the move by President Peña Nieto, admonishing the government to “roll back” prices to what was paid in 2016; and called attention to the poorest among Mexicans, expected to be the hardest hit by the price spike. Mexican gas is reported to be sold to foreign nations for $0.50 per liter, while Mexicans are reported to be paying near $1.00 at the pumps for the lowest-grade gas. A taxi driver interviewed by Press TV expressed frustration with working longer hours for less money, combined with the fact that the minimum wage in the country hasn't been raised in years. Litler reports that the official Mexican minimum wage was raised on January 1, 2016, by 4.2 percent, from $4.08 to $4.25, seemingly not keeping pace with 4.7 percent inflation and 20 percent gas-price shocks, giving perspective to the cab driver's point of view.

During the same period, the state-owned Mexico gas producer Pemex was reported to have maintained higher prices. Trading Economics reports that the price of gas in Mexico fell, by about 22 percent, from the beginning of 2014 through the end of 2015. Over the same period, Gas Buddy reports that the average price paid for gas in the United States fell by over 30 percent. Mexican gas prices hit a low of $0.68 per liter in November 2016. It is being reported that some gasoline retailers were hoarding fuel in anticipation of deregulation, possibly further exacerbating the shock at the pumps.

Herpetologist and wildlife photographer Nirmal Kulkarni has launched a new initiative ‘Living with Pythons' where he will create awareness about this enchanting snake species and why we need to conserve them
‘Living with Pythons' is a nationwide initiative kick-started with the start of 2017 by herpetologist and wildlife photographer Nirmal Kulkarni, to create awareness and instil appreciation about India's three python species. These include the Indian Rock Python (Python molurus), Burmese Python (Python bivittatus) and Reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus).
Speaking about this initiative Nirmal says: “My interest in pythons was fueled due to the large number of rescues I did of these species from homes as well as from snake charmers in my formative years as a snake handler. Further on whilst working at the Katraj Snake Park and the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, these snakes held me in awe for their sheer size as well as strength.
Reading about pythons in tales and anecdotal references across wildlife books, scientific literature and notes by naturalists became an unconsciously pursued passion. This initiative was the result of a 20-minute chat with mentor and guide Romulus Whitaker, whose own work on pythons continues till date. Rom does that to you always… plants seeds of enterprise and fuels this get-up-and-do-something craving that seldom others can whip up for sure.”
Elaborating on these three non-venomous snakes Nirmal confirms that these snakes represent some of the largest snake species of the world. While the Reticulated python is now acknowledged as one of the largest snakes in the world, the Burmese python is a near threatened species in its range in Burma. Illegal skin trade and habitat loss have taken a heavy toll and one ray of hope is forest of North East India where few populations survive.
The species found in Goa and across the Indian mainland commonly, The Indian Rock python has been now accepted as threatened due to human reptile conflict and habitat loss.
This initiative aims to thus promote acceptance, awareness and understanding about these python species through conservation outreach and field based herpetology techniques.
This initiative will operate from a conversation hub in Nachinola. But will travel across the country and also collaborate with local partners across the country. They will have field discussions, engagements with communities, youth and Forest Department personnel.
This project will also contribute to creating awareness on the issue of human-snake conflicts that are key to python survival in human dominated rural and urban landscapes.
“The habitat destruction, road kills, killing due to fear and superstition in some rural areas in the hinterlands,” Nirmal states the reasons for the decline in the species of rock python in Goa.
However, Nirmal confirms that the situation currently is better. “But the situation is definitely far better than what it was a decade ago thanks to the combined work of the Forest department as well as snake rescuers. There is now need for acceptance for these snakes in the areas where they exist – urban as well as rural landscapes. That is the need of the hour,” says Nirmal.
This initiative will also work on target group of reptile enthusiasts and amateur snake handlers and rescuers in the states of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra to sensitise them about these ecologically important species.
Beside this, the initiative proposes to address a need for a common protocol for python rescue and release, as it will help minimise and address issues relating reptile-human conflict and provide vital answers to this growing challenge especially in urban India.
On a concluding note when asked about the role of rock python in ecology and the need to protect it, Nirmal says: “Pythons are also at the apex of food chains and play a major role in keeping in check small mammal and rodent populations. Young as well as adult pythons also keep a check on rodents, birds, etc in an ecosystem and at the same time they are prey to raptors as well as carnivorous mammals themselves.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told California state senators Tuesday to set standards for edible marijuana goods and driving under the influence of cannabis as soon as possible to avoid repeating mistakes his state made when it legalized recreational pot.
The senators heard from Hickenlooper as the Legislature prepares to regulate sales of the drug. California voters legalized recreational marijuana in November through Proposition 64.
Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012 and faced a host of challenges implementing the new policy, from taxing marijuana dispensaries to keeping edible marijuana products away from children.
"We made an awful lot of mistakes as we were trying to wrestle with some of these issues," Hickenlooper said.

California faces a similar challenge implementing Proposition 64. Marijuana sales under the law are scheduled begin in 2018.
"We are in a sprint between now and Jan. 1 to be able to implement the mountain of rules and regulations associated with Prop 64," state Sen. Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg, said during the committee hearing where Hickenlooper spoke.
Colorado saw a rise in child hospitalization because of kids ingesting edible marijuana products in non-child-proof containers, Hickenlooper told the committee. The state now requires edibles to be sold in child-proof containers and has stricter regulations on labeling such products.
California faces challenge determining how to enforce laws prohibiting driving under the influence of marijuana, Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, said.
"There is no real quantifiable, definitive impairment level as there is with our alcohol," Hill said. "That's been the criticism or the challenge that we've been faced with here in terms of defining what impairment would be."
Colorado struggled to quickly pass laws to regulate impaired driving for that reason, Hickenlooper said. He recommended California lawmakers start to address that issue quickly because it will likely take time to resolve.
Marijuana dispensaries generally are forced to pay taxes in cash because federal law prohibits banks from taking their money, which can present a challenge for the state and local governments collecting taxes from the businesses, Sen. John Moorlach, R-Costa Mesa, said. State analysts estimate the California legal marijuana industry could generate more than $1 billion in tax revenue each year.
Other speakers at the hearing, including local and state officials charged with overseeing the marijuana industry, also spoke about challenges implementing regulations so sales can begin next year.
"We are flying the plane while we are building it," said Amy Tong, director of the California Department of Technology.
Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level. Recently confirmed U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he opposes marijuana legalization but has not announced specific plans to target marijuana industries in states that have legalized the drug.
Colorado has worked with federal authorities to crack down on black market marijuana sales, which Hickenlooper highlighted as critical to the success of the legal marijuana industry in the state. Hickenlooper said he is optimistic President Donald Trump will not crack down on Colorado's legal marijuana industry, pointing to comments the Republican made during his campaign indicating he was open to letting states that have legalized marijuana continue to do so.
"We're optimistic that he's going to let the experiment continue," Hickenlooper said. "But they're going to closely watch it, I'm sure."

LEXINGTON, S.C. — Authorities in South Carolina say four people were found dead in a home in what appears to be a murder-suicide.
Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher said in a news release that the dead — a man, a woman and their two children — were found Sunday around 8 p.m. Fisher says it's believed all four died of gunshot wounds.
In a tweet, the Lexington County Sheriff's Department said the deaths appear to be a murder-suicide and the investigation is ongoing.
Fisher identified the dead as 26-year-old Marissa Hope Reynoso and two of her children, four-year-old Elijah Chavez and one-year-old Ezra Chavez. Also dead was 25-year-old Jorge Luis Chavez, who's believed to be the father of the two children.
Fisher says an older child of Reynoso wasn't at the home at the time.
The President and CEO of the Interior Health Authority (IHA) paid a visit to the South Okanagan General Hospital in Oliver, B.C. Friday to speak with staff and address a myriad of issues plaguing the rural hospital.
In 2017 the emergency department closed during the overnight hours of April 24 to 26 and June 16 because no physicians were available to fill the vacant evening shifts.

“I personally think it's ridiculous that we don't have the doctors to staff this place,” said patient Christen Rausch last June.
The hospital's former chief of staff Dr. Peter Entwistle resigned last March over staffing problems and the number of hospital beds available.
“I think our health services is underfunded and I think people have to speak out,” he said at the time.
Today IHA boss Chris Mazurkewich laid out plans to improve patient care.

“One of the factors is emergency room renovation that was one of the issues that was raised as a concern, we're also looking at staffing levels of nursing in the hospital, we put in security because that was a concern,” he said at the hospital's conference center on Friday.
Mazurkewish said keeping the ER open is a priority.
“Four to five physicians came to the community, we've seen the emergency room open on a regular basis,” he said.
Wage parity across the region has also been an issue with doctors telling Global Okanagan they can earn more and have better support at Penticton Regional Hospital or Kelowna General.
“We've been working with the local physicians and the Ministry of Health around is there an alternative payment structure that would make it easier to retain and attract physicians to work in the emergency room,” Mazurkewich said.

Almost one million dollars in renovations is also on the books including the development of a new waiting and triage area, a separate ER entrance and the relocation of admitting services.
He said the regional district hospital board is responsible for funding 40 per cent of capital upgrades and a final decision will be made in the coming weeks.

Tyler Baltierra and his wife Catelynn celebrated their daughter's second birthday this New Years as she was a New Years baby a few years ago. And Tyler, the proud father that he is, decided to share some videos of his daughter on social media this weekend. They had added plenty of balloons to the floor of their living room so she knew that the day was a bit more special that other days, but it didn't appear that Nova realized it was her birthday. And as Tyler was sharing these videos and pictures of his daughter, some people had plenty of thoughts and feelings about them as parents. According to a new tweet, Tyler Baltierra is now revealing that he's used to getting harsh feedback from Teen Mom OG viewers, especially after the previous season of the show aired. On this previous season, Tyler revealed that he wanted his wife to watch her weight, as he didn't want her to gain too much. Catelynn was clearly suffering from postpartum depression and he was highly criticized for not being a supportive husband to her. So when they decided to share the news of Nova's birthday this weekend, the couple received some surprising tweets from viewers, who didn't have anything nice to say. @CatelynnLowell @TylerBaltierra one of my fave pics with you two & Carly….love! pic.twitter.com/9XtCXMG46U — Katherine Childress (@katie4jafra) December 22, 2016 “I don't know how you ignore all these knobheads^ Enjoy your lives, have more babies. Be happy,” one person wrote to Tyler Baltierra, who had an interesting reply, where he clearly put himself above his Teen Mom OG fans, writing, “It's very simple when you know your own heart & soul & know that you are a good person. The lion does not dwell on the opinions of sheep.” It's a very interesting comparison that Tyler Baltierra decided to make on Twitter. While he was just trying to say that people's opinions don't matter to him, especially people who don't know him and have no right to judge his life, he seems to forget that the Teen Mom OG viewers are the ones who are keeping the show alive. It's thanks to these viewers that he has a job with MTV and that the ratings are so high that they keep going each year. “I'm sorry ppl are so cruel-if/when you guys decide to have a baby congrats-plz don't give negativity ur time,” another person wrote to Baltierra, apologizing for people's negative comments and mean behavior, to which Baltierra replied, “It's okay. Cruel people do exist. I signed up to be on TV…I expect the hate & criticism. I don't expect anything more from those people.” Of course, they have both been criticized for having another baby. The two of them gave up Carly for adoption and while many people have been hoping for a second baby, Catelynn and Tyler took their time. They now have little Nova, but people like to bring up the fact that Catelynn wasn't ready to have another baby. @CatelynnLowell‘s heart and soul???????? @TylerBaltierra pic.twitter.com/yO5EHE0EJs — Catelynn & Tyler Fan (@catelynn_fan) December 12, 2016 “Catelynn is “mentally ill.” Or so she insists. Why bring another baby into it?” one person wrote in one tweet, while adding later, “Loving parents do not smoke weed and leave their baby with people who do drugs. April. Nor do they let a druggie live with them.” “B/c even people who struggle with mental illness can be successful loving parents. Itsnik to have an opinion never ok to attack,” one person wrote in defense of Tyler Baltierra and his wife. What do you think of Tyler Baltierra calling the Teen Mom OG viewers sheep and himself a lion? Do you think he's saying that their opinions don't matter to him or do you think he's trying to say that he's better than viewers, because he doesn't attack them?

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau kicked a number of hecklers out of his town hall in Nanaimo on Friday after they wouldn't “respect anyone in this room.”
While the specific hecklers were hard to hear, many people in the audience were voicing concerns over Trudeau's action or lack thereof on environmental issues like the Kinder Morgan pipeline and fish farm regulations.
Some First Nations members have marched out of town hall saying @JustinTrudeau ignored them. They wanted to ask a question about fish farms. #Nanaimo pic.twitter.com/ofcEvNuNkr — Jill Bennett (@jillreports) February 2, 2018
First, as Trudeau was heckled by some members of his audience at Vancouver Island University, a First Nation chief stood up and asked for people to have a conversation based on “respect and listening.”
“We'd love to carry on this discussion, and if we can't carry on we'd love people to please excuse themselves and let us carry on this discussion,” he said.

Then, as Wyse spoke, police approached a man in the audience and escorted him out.
But the heckling didn't stop.
One protester later stood up and, yelling, she said to Trudeau, “why won't you talk with us, why won't you engage with us.”
Trudeau responded, “I am trying to engage with you, I am trying to speak with you, I'm trying to answer a question from someone who asked me a question that is extremely important to her.
“I'm not able to answer her question that she asked of the prime minister because you think your voice is more important than her ability to listen,” he said to loud applause and cheers.
He then asked her to show some respect for people in the room.
Then he said, to more cheers and applause, “You don't respect anyone in this room? Then I'm going to have to ask you to leave this room.
“Usually it's not that easy, usually it's harder to get them to admit they don't respect anyone in this room.”

But the heckler didn't leave, and she was soon joined by another who stood with her in the audience.
“Oh come on, come on. Really? Really? OK, this is it,” Trudeau said.
Police later escorted both hecklers out of the room.
“Thank you and I apologize for the behaviour of our fellow citizens,” Trudeau said.
The prime minister's Nanaimo event was the sixth and last stop on this year's town hall tour.
It ended with a crowd chanting “stop Kinder Morgan” as Trudeau left.

It's a debate that you may not know exists, but in the world of social media, it has been a hotly debated topic.
So fierce is the debate over the pronunciation of Primark that some customers have even asked in stores across the UK about the proper way to pronounce Primark.
Others have submitted a written question on the ‘help' section of the Primark website.
Much debate has followed the brand over the pronunciation of their name, with customers debating whether it should be called “Pr-eye-mark” or “Pree-mark”.
Finally, Primark have revealed the correct way to say their store name.
In the ‘other stuff' segment of their ‘queries' page, where you can search for FAQs, they answer the question: “How do you pronounce Primark?”
They responded saying: “That's a very good question. We like to use Pr-Eye-Mark.”
Have you been wrong this entire time? How do you say Primark?
Snapchat is teaming up with The Pokémon Company to introduce a new Pikachu filter to the app. The official Pikachu filter applies the electric mouse's trademark rosy cheeks, pointy ears, black nose and big eyes to faces in the app, and when users open their mouth the iconic Pikachu cry rings out as an animated version of the characters leaps into frame.
The Pikachu filter is a pretty perfect tie-in for Snapchat, which aims at a demographic that is already pretty gaga for the most recognizable of Nintendo's pocket monsters. Plus, Snapchat could use some brand juice, and Pokémon and Pikachu have proven to offer that for a lot of other platforms, including any of Nintendo's hardware consoles and even AR via Pokémon Go.

Snapchat's Pikachu filter is a limited run option, so if you want to capture yourself looking like Ash's best pal you'd better get on it. The best strategy is probably to stockpile a wide range of selfies of yourself as Pika so you have one for every possible emotional response you can possibly make.
Will Snapchat Pika reach the lofty heights of Dancing Hot Dog? Only time will tell.

LOS ANGELES-Christina Aguilera found Kanye West 'endearing' in the studio.
The controversial rapper produced the tracks 'Accelerate' and 'Maria' on the 'Fall In Line' singer's new album, 'Liberation', and while she was blown away by Kanye's artistry and they ''clicked'' immediately, she doesn't agree with everything he says.
She told Entertainment Weekly: ''[Kanye's] always said things that have stirred controversy and attention. I'm not getting involved in what he's saying or anything like that. I know him as an artist.
''I do know that when we sat down and he played me these tracks, he got me.
''I think he's an artist first and foremost and we're not always going to agree with artists. ''I loved our initial meeting and we totally clicked. I found him to be very endearing.'' The 37-year-old star worked with the 40-year-old producer on the two tracks in Malibu, California in early 2016, but they lost touch after he embarked on his 'Life Of Pablo' tour later that year, during which Kanye was hospitalised with exhaustion.
She said previously: ''There were some personal things that arose...''
The 'Dirrty' hitmaker revealed the new album has a strong hip-hop feel to it, insisting she sees herself as more of a soul singer than a pop star.
Christina said: ''To me, there's nothing like an amazing hip hop beat.
''At the end of the day, I am a soul singer. When you strip back the words 'pop star' and the many things that I've done, singing soulfully is where my core, my root and my heart really is. And as you can see, it's what I'm inspired by.''
'Liberation' is Christina's first album in six years, with her last studio venture being 2012's 'Lotus'.
Britain's Kyle Edmund will face Rafael Nadal for the first time on the ATP tour at the Monte Carlo Masters, having accounted for compatriot Dan Evans 7-5, 6-1 in the first round.
Nadal is bidding to win a record 10th Monte Carlo title on his preferred surface, after making three finals in 2017, including the Australian Open.
However, Edmund isn't overawed by the challenge that awaits.
"I played Novak Djokovic three times, Andy Murray twice, Stan Wawrinka, Milos Raonic. It's another top-10 opportunity for me," Edmund told the Guardian.
"I like the clay. I've been getting better on it over the past few days. It will be just a great experience. It will be a tough match, whatever the court.
"The flip side, he's not played me. Different game styles. At the start of the match, no one gets a head start just because of ranking or past wins. It's 0-0, game on."
Edmund is aware he won't be able to afford a repeat of the bad start he made in his match against Davis Cup team-mate Evans.
The 22-year-old fell behind 4-1 after an error-strewn start, before putting together four service breaks of his own to claim the first set.
Evans missed two opportunities to break at the start of the second set and, having held off that surge, Edmund eased to victory with another four breaks to round things out in an hour and 20 minutes with his second ace.

Apple is to set up an alliance with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to reach more suits in the corporate world, The Register can reveal.
Similar arrangements are already up and running between Apple and IBM, Cisco, SAP, GE and Deloitte. Apple said in 2015 its enterprise business turned over $25bn in sales. HPE is to be added to the list, a recruitment ad has indicated.
The ad on LinkedIn is for an enterprise strategic partner manager for HPE, Dimension Data and GE. The role is based in London.
“At the end of the day, we are here to grow Apple's enterprise business through our Strategic Partner's team. We've partnered with experts in enterprises around the world, to change the way people work.”
The position includes working with the global partner, regional sales and channel marketing and systems engineering teams, both inside and out of Apple.
Business development, creating enterprise sales and training programmes are also listed as tasks for the successful candidate. These plans are then “embedded” in Apple's major account teams, industry sector teams and among resellers that sell the kit, the ad continued.
The ideal applicant will have a BA degree, a track record as a Strategic Partner Manager, be an “expert at presenting”, and bring “integrity, honesty and accountability in all that you do, every day. You are a trusted advisor who does what you say you'll do - and always do what is best for Apple.”
The last is of note, given the long-running dispute between MacBook owners and Apple over the temperamental butterfly mechanism used in it keyboards that can fail when dust blocks the keycap from pressing the switch or disable the return mechanism, as pointed out recently. Apple has relinquished and will provide replacements for free for those that qualify.
Back to the ad, Apple then reminded us of the fairy dust and ground unicorn horns that are used to produce its shiny stuff. The ad stated:
The people here at Apple don't just create products – they create the kind of wonder that's revolutionised entire industries. It's the diversity of those people and their ideas that runs through everything we do, from amazing technology to industry-leading environmental efforts. Join Apple, and help is leave the world better than we found it.
Indeedy.
Apple's B2B division in the UK and Ireland is run by enterprise director Matt Key. The new hire will report to him. He has been in situ for less than a year.
The job ad for the enterprise strategic partner manager for HPE, Dimension Data and GE was listed in late May and according to LinkedIn – at last count – 21 people had viewed it.
It is not clear which HPE products Apple wants to use but will likely include the Aruba edge kit, an area that HPE is set to invest in further with $4bn of R&D spend lined up for the next four years.
The HPE alliance manager isn't the only enterprise role up for grabs at Apple UK. Others include an SMB leader for EMEIA, strategic partner manager for IBM, and Apple Premium Reseller business manager.
However, the list doesn't end there: others range from business development manager for finance and leasing, strategic partner technical consultant EMEIA, enterprise pre-saes engineer, enterprise financing sales executive, enterprise account exec and a deal desk manager to shape pricing and strategy.
Apple sources – yes, we have a few – told us the firm is in phase one of its Enterprise Accelerator Programme. Apple's enterprise branch was a $25bn global operation at the end of 2015.
The focus of phase one will be the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The push, which will widen to the Nordics and central and Eastern Europe from 2018, has “executive sponsorship” from Apple CEO Tim Cook, we are assured.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's smaller banks are lining up to apply for multi-million pound grants the government hopes will help them compete in the corporate banking market.
For years the government has wanted to reduce the dominance of big banks in the small-to medium-sized business (SME) banking sector. The four largest — HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L), RBS (RBS.L) and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) — control over 70 percent of business current accounts.
Royal Bank of Scotland was directed by the government and the European Commission to set up two funds worth a combined 775 million pounds following its 45.5 billion pound bailout during the financial crisis, seen as an unfair boost to RBS.
“A consequence of the 2008-9 crisis was that there was huge consolidation in financial services,” said Anne Boden, CEO of digital Starling Bank, which launched in 2014.
Applications for grants from the funds open next year. One, worth 350 million pounds, will be used to encourage customers to switch providers, while the other 425 million pound fund will help challenger banks invest in their SME offerings.
The fiercest competition is expected to be over six grants making up the bulk of the second fund and focused on current or soon-to-be business current account providers.
NEW ENTRANTS
At least 12 banks are likely to be eligible for just the first two pools of funding containing the six biggest grants.
Virgin Money (VM.L) and Starling Bank have set out plans to enter business banking in recent months while the CEO of app-based bank Monzo told Reuters it was now also tempted to move into the sector, having previously ruled this out.
Virgin Money will be able to bid for a pool of grants including one worth 15 million pounds and two worth 15 million pounds and open to firms new to the sector.
Its Chief Commercial Officer Hugh Chater recently told investors that its proposition, offering customers access to partners' services, would provide a “compelling case” for funding.
Starling plans to have its service off the ground before it applies, allowing it to bid for one of the three biggest grants ranging from 60-120 million pounds and earmarked for firms already up and running. Unsuccessful firms will be considered for other pools of grants.
“We are very uniquely placed in this... and confident of our ability to win,” said Starling's Boden, while agreeing competition was heating up.
“I think that (the funds) are probably not enough. It could have been much more.”
Another digital player Tandem is set to acquire a banking license and business banking unit if its takeover of Harrods Bank is approved and plans to apply for all four pools of funds on offer.
“It (competition) is kicking off now,” said Ricky Knox, CEO of Tandem.
“It's not reached a scale where there is serious acknowledgement of it, but we're going to see a really interesting 2-3 years.”
Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank (CYBG) (CYBGC.L), TSB and Metro Bank (MTRO.L) are also in the running.
CYBG is currently piloting a business e-lending service and expanding in Birmingham and the West Midlands, moves that set it up to apply for the three biggest grants.
TSB also has plans to expand. Its CEO Paul Pester said in November it will be at the “front of the queue” for funding.
SANTANDER IN THE MIX
Santander fits the criteria, but its eligibility has drawn criticism given its parent, Spain's Banco Santander (SAN.MC), is one of the world's biggest banks.
Santander UK CEO Nathan Bostock said the bank has the reputation and proven capability required to convince customers to switch.
“We will create some things we feel will help customers make that choice,” he added, referring to new products or services the bank will offer as part of its application.
Bostock noted that it has historically been very difficult to win market share from the big four banks. They have dominated the market since 1970, according to a 2016 government report, and suffered relatively little erosion of their market share despite numerous entrants to the market.
Switching rates remain low, at about 4 percent in 2014 according to the Competition and Markets Authority, despite thousands of firms being mistreated by major lenders in the past. Some accuse RBS of pushing them into bankruptcy to pick up assets on the cheap during and after the financial crisis.
The grant scheme was set up as an alternative way to boost competition after RBS found it was unable to sell its business banking unit Williams & Glyn.
The plan targets a transfer of 3 percent market share from RBS to challenger banks. The unit has around 220,000 SME customers.

COX'S BAZAR/DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh is deploying thousands of extra police to Rohingya refugee camps in the south, officials said, after a series of mostly unexplained killings that have sown fear among hundreds of thousands of people who have fled from neighbouring Myanmar.

Since August, when a military crackdown in Myanmar forced many of the Muslim minority to cross the border into Bangladesh and seek shelter in the crowded camps, 19 people, some of them community leaders, have been killed.
Police have made a number of arrests in connection with some of the killings, but say the motives often remain unclear.
Conducted after dark and often by groups of men wielding pistols, knives, and sticks, the killings have sent a chill through the camps, which are guarded by the Bangladesh army during the day but manned by fewer police officers at night.
A.K.M. Iqbal Hossain, police superintendent of the coastal town of Cox's Bazar under whose jurisdiction the camps fall, said a special force of roughly 2,400 men was being formed to guard the refugees.
A second senior officer, Superintendent Afrujul Haque Tutul, said police numbers were already being increased.
“We have 1,000 police officers right now for a million people, so you can imagine,” he said.
More than 700,000 Rohingya have taken shelter in Cox's Bazar district since August, joining thousands who were already living there, making it the world's largest and fastest growing refugee camp.
Even before the August exodus, there had been violence in the camps, which Bangladesh police and aid workers have previously blamed on a struggle for control of supplies to the camps.
STABBED 25 TIMES
The latest killing, of 35-year-old Arifullah, took place last month on a busy road outside the Balukhali camp, where he had been appointed a leader of thousands of refugees.
A group of men surrounded him on the evening of June 18, stabbing him at least 25 times, police said. A pool of blood stained the spot the next morning, and a crowd of refugees could be seen gathered around.

Police said three Rohingya men had been arrested over the killing of Arifullah, who spoke English, had worked for international agencies in Myanmar, and often met foreign delegates who visited the camps.
His wife, who did not want to be named and asked Reuters not to disclose the location where she was interviewed because she feared attack, said Arifullah was a critic of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) – a militant group whose assaults on Myanmar security posts in August triggered the crackdown by the military.
The group says it is fighting for the rights of the Rohingya. Police said investigations into the murder were ongoing and they had not found links to ARSA.
A spokesman for ARSA referred Reuters to its Jan. 31 statement that said other armed groups were responsible for “activities” at refugee camps and were using its name to malign its image.
The group said it did not attack civilians and would never carry out killings in the camps because its was thankful for Bangladesh's generosity in sheltering the refugees.
That statement was issued after the Jan. 19 killing of Yusuf, another English-speaking camp leader. Sitting on the mud floor of her shelter, Yusuf's wife Jamila said her husband had been watching a football match on his phone with his two sons when around a dozen men barged into their shelter in the Taingkhali camp carrying knives and pistols, shooting him twice.
She said police had urged her to file a case and name suspects, but she had refused, fearing retaliation, and because she did not want to leave her shelter for hours to go to court. “I'm scared for my children,” she said.
Details of Yusuf's killing were confirmed by police superintendent Tutul at the Cox's Bazar police station. He said the police investigation was hampered because the refugees were afraid to name suspects.
He said intelligence received so far suggested several of the killings, including those of Yusuf and Arifullah, were due to personal disputes refugees had brought from Myanmar.
Police have arrested about 300 Rohingya in cases involving killings, robberies and abductions in the camps since the August influx, Tutul said.
Camp leaders at Balukhali and Taingkhali said the army had appointed Rohingya volunteers to keep guard at night, but most had stopped working because they were not being paid.
Foreign officials said security inside the teeming camps was a worry. “What I hear from my colleagues is that is obviously a big concern,” Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said on a visit to the camps on Sunday.
“It is obvious that it is a big challenge when you have big numbers, poor conditions, cramped situations.”

It's time for everyone to stock up on experts to turn to for guidance. I'll recommend several political scientists who write publicly -- bloggers, tweeters, columnists -- to help explain the political system in 2017.
Julia Azari blogs at Mischiefs of Faction and elsewhere and tweets about the presidency, parties and plenty of other topics. I've linked to her often in my Early Returns newsletter (you do subscribe, right?) and I highlight her here especially because of her work on presidential mandates, in which she explains why mandates aren't quite the fictional things clever pundits tend to think they are.
A greater-than-usual number of people are going to want to know about obscure House and Senate procedure in 2017, and Josh Huder, who tweets and blogs at Rule22 and elsewhere, is an excellent source for everything from party leadership to changes in the filibuster. See for example this quick explainer on reconciliation.
The “A Few Reasonable Words” podcast from Casey Dominguez and two colleagues would be the absolute top of my listening list -- although, full disclosure, I'm not much of a listener to podcasts. She studies the presidency and parties. The podcast is wide-ranging across US politics.
Elizabeth Saunders blogs at the Monkey Cage and tweets about international relations and how foreign policy gets made within the US government. Excellent on the intersection between elected officials, political appointees and the permanent bureaucracy -- which is going to be a critical topic going forward.
Matt Glassman used to blog, but now he tweets, often in elongated threads. He's an expert on Congress, on democracy and on American political development -- which means he knows about 19th-century stuff and how examples from history can illuminate the present.
David Karol is one of the co-authors of “The Party Decides,” and he's a scholar of parties and American political institutions. Plus he just has an enormous amount of obscure knowledge about American politics. He blogs occasionally at the Monkey Cage. Here's hoping this post will egg him on to write publicly more often.
I agree strongly with Lee Drutman, who writes at Polyarchy and other locations and tweets, about congressional capacity. He's also an expert on lobbying and money in politics. It's going to be an important topic for the next couple of years, and he's well-equipped to explain what's happening.
Sarah Binder is an expert on Congress, and she's also invaluable on the history and current structure of the Federal Reserve. Which makes her invaluable for those interested in how the new administration and a Republican Congress will affect the economy. She tweets, and she blogs at the Monkey Cage and Brookings.
And I'll leave you with a few more. On the presidency: Andrew Rudalevige, who blogs at the Monkey Cage; Matthew Dickinson, who has his own blog. On Congress: Molly Reynolds writes at Brookings, and Greg Koger writes at the Monkey Cage and Mischiefs of Faction.

Virat Kohli speaks about India's clinical series win in Sri Lanka
The Indian captain addressed the media in the post-match press-conference.
@Rupinzel by Rupin Kale News 14 Aug 2017, 20:08 IST
India won the series 3-0
What's the story?
Virat Kohli has been on a victorious run as the Indian skipper ever since taking over the reigns of captaincy from MS Dhoni. His team just whitewashed Sri Lanka in a Test series in their own backyard, in a completely dominant fashion.
Talking about the one-sided result, Kohli said, "The one-sided result is good for us, if it goes against us, we will definitely think about the same. But we are winning and the momentum is with the team. When playing, we don't think where Test cricket is headed and what the future will be.
"As I said before, we have great pride in the intensity with which we play the game. We consider it a privilege that we are able to play Test cricket for the country. Our mindset hasn't changed one bit till now," he added.
India looked comfortable throughout the series and pulled off clinical, ruthless victories in all the three Tests. Kohli is the first Indian captain to complete an overseas whitewash. This is his 8th straight Test series victory as a captain, a record that's second only to the nine won by Australian Ricky Ponting.
In case you didn't know...
India won the third and final Test against Sri Lanka in Pallekele by an innings and 171 runs today (August 14). Hardik Pandya was declared the Man of the Match for his outstanding hundred and Shikhar Dhawan was named the Man of the Series for his consistent exploits at the top of the order.
Each player chipped in at some point in the series, and India conducted themselves like the World No. 1 Test side that they are in all the three games.
The details
Kohli believes that the 3-0 result is not an indication of how strong the Indian unit is, but just a result of the good cricket that his team played.
He added that winning all three tosses worked in his team's favour and conceded that it was a major factor in the second Test especially.
The 28-year-old did not shy away from praising his team though. He said that the team put constant pressure on the opposition to win more sessions during the Test matches, which in turn helped them clinch the series.
What's next?
India will host Australia for a limited-overs tour next month
Kohli will now lead the team in the limited overs series against the hosts. They will play five ODIs and a one-off T20I before heading back home to host Australia for five ODIs and three T20I games.
Their next Test match will be in November when Sri Lanka travel to India for a full-fledged tour.
Author's take
While the Indian team have performed brilliantly in the past 12 months, they are yet to face the toughest teams in testing conditions. However, it does look like they have it in them to make things go their way in alien conditions as well.
Al Seddiqi, who is also the chief executive officer of ADFG, plans to rebuild the legacy of the company as the leading investment house in the region. He says Shuaa will aim to double its assets under management from its current Dh1.8 billion, and is actively looking at acquisitions, as it seeks to leverage balance sheet, and exit some legacy investments and redeploy resources.
“I'm very confident that we will achieve our target of raising our assets under management (AuM) at Shuaa by the end of 2017 to Dh5 billion,” Al Seddiqi told journalists on Monday. Shuaa targets an AuM of Dh9 billion by 2020. And the company wants to become profitable in the first quarter of 2017. “We are confident that the first quarter of 2017 would be a profitable one for Shuaa. This will reinforce our intentions to make Shuaa a profitable business again,” Al Seddiqi said. Shuaa reported a narrow loss of Dh132.5 million in 2016, continuing its streak. Total revenues came in at Dh173.8 million compared to Dh178.2 million in 2015. For the fourth quarter to December, the company registered a significant reduction in losses. The company reported a loss of Dh18.9 million compared to Dh161.8 million in the same period last year. The company reported revenues of Dh35.1 million down from Dh40.1 million quarter on quarter. Shuaa's balance sheet and total assets at year-end stood at Dh1.3 billion. The company has Dh346.6 million in cash. Profitability The profitability, according to the new ceo, would be driven by all subsidiaries, like financing body, asset management, investment banking, capital markets division. “Most of the profitability would be driven by the GFC [Gulf Finance Corporation] this year,” Al Seddiqi said. Shuaa wants to switch gears in the Gulf Finance Corporation, which is a unit of Shuaa, to asset backed lending, and wants double digit returns. Going ahead, in addition to the UAE market, Shuaa plans to focus on Saudi Arabia in addition to Egyptian markets. Shuaa wants to acquire companies for growth in which they see synergy, Al Seddiqi said, declining to give any concrete details. The company is expecting to get atleast one initial public offering in the UAE markets. “Hopefully we want to list them at the end of year. We are confident we would be doing atleast two companies this year,” he added. On challenges, Al Seddiqi said “market situation is a challenge, talent acquisition is a challenge. Nothing is easy.” But despite all the challenges, in all, Al Seddiqi wants Shuaa to be “the same way as it was in good old days.” “We want to be top 5 retail broker in the UAE, we want to be the best house for providing investment advice, and we want to be leading regional market maker,” Al Seddiqi said.

Over the next five years the County will need to dip less into its rainy day fund and will have a balanced budget by 2022. Thats according to L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland Countys executive as outlined in his five-year budget plan distributed to the countys leadership.
A growing tax base means the county will collect more money and wont rely as much on other county resources to balance the budget.
Property values are rising and the taxes collected are rising as a result. Thats true even as expenses, such as those in the Circuit Court and Economic Development/Community Affairs, increase. The difference between the two means the county doesnt need to rely on the General Fund Balance to make ends meet.

The Pattersons plan serves as the foundation of the countys budget for fiscal years 2018 through 2020, which will be presented to the Board of Commissioners by July 1.
The Long-Range Fiscal Plan Summary report identifies and discusses potential financial issues facing the county and proposes means to resolve those issues, said Patterson in an email to county officials April 10. Our challenge is not yet over.
Given our proven track record as a team of committed leaders and our focus on long-range proactive planning, I am confident that together we will achieve structural balance within the next few years, he said.
In 2018, according to Patterson, the county will need $28.5 million from the General Fund Balance. That shrinks to $18.6 million in 2020, the end of three-year budget cycle. Currently, there is roughly $204 million in the countys rainy day fund. That shrinks to $118 million in 2020.
Patterson has proposed budget increases of two to three percent a year from 2018 to 2020.

2019 - $454.9 million
2020 - $459.3 million

2022 - $464.7 million
Patterson said that, overall, there is a decreasing reliance on planned use of available General Fund balance for ongoing operations.
Use of fund balance should be considered to be a one-time resource that once spent is no longer available and is only replenished when there is an annual operating surplus, he said. It is projected that fund balance will be available to fund some limited one-time projects, primarily capital in nature.
The county determined its five-year plan using:
 2016 fiscal year financials records;
 2017 fiscal year first quarter forecasts;
 2016 fiscal year property valuations;
 2018 fiscal year state budget recommendations;
 Recent economic reports;
 And other county budget data

LondoN - The federal government has expressed its concern over the activities of proscribed outfit, Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), in Sindh, reported BBC on Wednesday.
National Counter-Terrorism Authority (Nacta), through a letter, has informed the Sindh home department about its concerns.
The National Counter-Terrorism Authority says that Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat is continuing its activities in interior Sindh under the manifesto, platform and leadership of Sunni Raabta Committee.
The Nacta has also pointed out the operational leadership of the banned outfit. It has been said in the letter that ASWJ's provincial president, Maulana Manzoor Solangi, is leading the proscribed outfit in Qambar Shahdadkot, whereas Hafiz Muhammad Riaz Memon, Ashraf Memon and Ilyas Farooqi are working in district Sajawal as organisers.
Maulana Ahmad Solangi belongs to Balochistan. He shifted to Qambar Shahdadkot about 20 years ago. He is also administrator of some seminaries in Qambar Shahdadkot. One of these has been constructed on the land of a government building. Similarly, another seminary has been constructed on a graveyard. Sindhi and Baloch students are getting education there. In Sajawal, Hafiz Muhammad Riaz Memon, Ashraf Memon and Ilyas Farooqi are active in local politics.
National Action Plan (NAP) was formed to curb militancy in the country after the attack on Army Public School in Peshawar. The provincial government has been informed that Sunni Rabita Committee's activities are a violation of NAP. As per Section 7 of the NAP, proscribed outfits are not allowed to continue their activities under other names.
Defence analyst Dr Aysha Siddiqua said that former ISI chief Gen Rizwan Akhtar believed in bringing these people into the national mainstream and politics.
“In this process the government should have full control, which it does not have right now. Because when you will bring them into politics they will have more impact on the society. This is the Army's plan, which can raise several questions and needs to be analysed,” she maintained.
ASWJ is active to take part in next polls. Maulana Ludhianvi says that they have at least seven to eight thousand votes in each constituency of the country. “There is no restriction on us to contest elections because the Constitution of Pakistan allows us. And, with the help of Constitution, we will participate in the 2018 elections with full preparations and will choose any new organisational name.”
Maulana Masroor Nawaz Jhangvi, who won PP-78 constituency of Jhang, joined Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Fazl) which Dr Aysha Siddiqua declared as the ‘mother' organisation of Sipah-e-Sahaba.
MONITORING DESK
KATHMANDU : Three former Nepalese soldiers have each been sentenced in absentia to 20 years in jail for killing a teenage girl, only the second conviction for crimes committed during a decade-long civil war which ended in 2006.
Fifteen-year-old Maina Sunuwar was tortured and killed after she was detained by the army in 2004 for alleged links to Maoist rebels.
But a military tribunal the following year ruled that her death was accidental and charged the three soldiers involved in the case with only minor offences.
Maina's mother brought a case in a civilian court which delivered its verdict on Sunday, a court official told AFP.
But none of the three convicted are currently in custody, and rights groups have raised concerns they may never serve their sentences.
A fourth soldier, the most senior of all those accused, was acquitted.
"We have fought for justice for so many years, I'm glad the court has understood our plight," Sunuwar's mother Devi told AFP. "But our fight is not over. I'm worried the decision might be limited to paper. The state must implement the court's decision."
Devi campaigned for years for justice for her daughter, who was arrested when soldiers came to their home looking for her mother.
Devi had days earlier publicly accused government forces of raping and murdering her niece. "We believed that Maina had been taken, and perhaps killed, only to punish her mother," said Advocacy Forum Nepal, a legal rights group, in a report about the long-running case.
A military tribunal in 2005 found that Sunuwar had been repeatedly held underwater and given electric shocks to her feet and wrists during interrogation.
But it ruled that her death was accidental and the three soldiers named in the case were only charged with minor offences, including using improper interrogation techniques and failing to follow procedure.
They were sentenced to six months in detention but released immediately because the tribunal ruled they had already served their time while confined to barracks.
In 2007 the case was taken to the Supreme Court and an arrest warrant was issued the following year for the three soldiers and a major.
The major, Niranjan Basnet, who was found innocent on Sunday, is the only one of the accused still serving in the army, which has been repeatedly accused by activists of sheltering its men from prosecution.
"There is a worry, despite winning the case after so many years, the convicted might still not go behind bars," said Mandira Sharma, a human rights lawyer and activist who worked on the case.
"But we are hopeful that it won't happen... if the army as a public institution helps in arresting them and allowing them to serve their sentences, it will help increase confidence of the (other) victims."
More than 17,000 people were killed during the civil war, which ended with a peace deal between Maoist insurgents and government forces.
Both sides stand accused of committing rights abuses during the conflict, but rights groups say little has been done to hold the perpetrators - many of whom still hold senior positions in the military and government - to account.
In December 2014 five former Maoist rebels were jailed for two years for torturing and killing a journalist, a sentence many criticised for being too lenient.
Nepal set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission on the Disappeared in 2015, but investigations have made little progress due to a lack of funds and political inertia.
Another sickening mass shooting, and another dispiriting round of debates about the place of guns in American life. And, just as many of the gun-control measures proposed are not germane to the events people wish to see stopped, neither are many of the arguments about gun rights generally. Charles Cooke has taken on Bret Stephens. Rich Lowry has also examined the “passionate non sequiturs.” And, I suppose it falls to me to take on the assertion, made in the New York Times by Michael Schermer, that guns in the hands of citizens aren't a bulwark against tyranny.
But, of course, they are.
Alert readers (and listeners) will know that on a philosophical level, I'm a squish on the gun stuff. I find it embarrassing that the United States is “exceptional” in the amount of violence its people inflict on one another, and themselves, with handguns. And I'm skeptical about the utility of an unqualified right to acquire weapons of such lethality. My colleague Kevin Williamson says that the right to bear arms makes us citizens and not subjects. And I agree, up to a point. I just wouldn't assume that any adult U.S. national is a good citizen. .In an ideal world, a man like Stephen Paddock, who spent his time and money getting perks at Vegas casinos would be disqualified from this burden of citizenship, on account of his manifestly dissolute and aimless life.
To call him a citizen is to reduce the term to a legal fiction, a kind of wish about what Americans should be, rather than a recognition of what we are. A man who turns large sums of his worldly wealth over to the algorithmic swings of video poker, in order to get comps, is a man who remains subject to his own appetites, and vulnerable to some tough creditors. The ornaments of a free man do not suit him.
But let's put my useless doubts to one side.
Schermer writes:
Gun-rights advocates also make the grandiose claim that gun ownership is a deterrent against tyrannical governments. Indeed, the wording of the Second Amendment makes this point explicitly: “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” That may have made sense in the 1770s, when breech-loading flintlock muskets were the primary weapons tyrants used to conquer other peoples and subdue their own citizens who could, in turn, equalize the power equation by arming themselves with equivalent firepower. But that is no longer true. If you think stock piling firearms from the local Guns and Guitars store, where the Las Vegas shooter purchased some of his many weapons, and dressing up in camouflage and body armor is going to protect you from an American military capable of delivering tanks and armored vehicles full of Navy SEALs to your door, you're delusional.
Schermer invokes the massacres at Ruby Ridge and at Waco, Texas, as further evidence that guns are not sufficient to protect you from a determined government. He offers instead for protection the rule of law, and a good lawyer to defend you. He concludes that these are far superior defenses against the government than guns.
The concluding note is obviously correct. Everyone here much prefers to have a functioning civil society, and a government that honors our God-given rights. But, Schermer has avoided the real argument. The “defense against tyranny” claim does not hold that any one individual, or a tiny group, can defend any claim against the government with the force of arms. And, of course, equal firepower was never the issue. Even in the 1770s, an American government could raise a larger and better-outfitted force than what was present at Ruby Ridge or Waco Texas. Civil society and good lawyers are all the defense you need against a non-tyrannical government. But a tyranny, an invader, or a pretender-government are more effectively resisted with guns.
Sometimes people put Schermer's argument more baldly. They ask something like this: “Do you really think Bubba in camo gear hiding in the forest is going to take on the U.S. military? The U.S. military has nuclear weapons!”
Who exactly do you think has stymied the U.S. in Afghanistan for 16 years? The Taliban is made up of Afghan Bubbas. The Taliban doesn't need to defeat nuclear weapons, though they are humiliating a nuclear power for the second time in history. They use a mix of Kalashnikovs and WWII-era bolt-action rifles. Determined insurgencies are really difficult to fight, even if they are only armed with Enfield rifles and you can target them with a TOW missiles system that can spot a cat in the dark from two miles away. In Iraq, expensive tanks were destroyed with simple improvised explosives.
If the U.S. government (and the American people behind them) doesn't want to use nuclear weapons on foreign fundamentalists in Afghanistan, why does anyone presume they'd use them against Americans in Idaho?
It is not just our fecklessness. All great powers take into account the moral and manpower costs of implementing their rules and laws on a people. And an armed citizenry, especially if they seem to have a just cause to rally around, will dramatically raise the price of ruling them. The British Empire controlled one quarter of the world's territory and ruled one quarter of the earth's population in 1922. In that very year, they were forced to make an effective exit from the main part of their oldest colony, Ireland. Why? Because a determined group of Irish men with guns made the country ungovernable. The British technically could have deployed their entire navy, blockading the restive island, and starving any rebellion into submission. But they were unwilling to pay the moral price, or the price in blood. It was precisely this foreseeable event that had caused the British to ban Irish Catholics from possessing firearms hundreds of years earlier.
And just as in the 1770s or the 1920s, governments in similar positions today or in the future would have a difficult time maintaining military morale while trying to impose rule on a people who resist it manfully.
You can acknowledge this and still deplore America's gun violence, as I do. You can wish and even work for an American future where there are fewer weapons in untrained and unsteady American hands. And, we all should wish to maintain a law-governed and orderly society that doesn't inspire thousands or millions of Americans to resist its government in an insurgency. But in the meantime, don't do violence to history itself. With just the moral support of the society they are living in, and a number of rifles, a small group of men can make it impossible for tyrants to rule.

LONDON (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair is calling on British airports to curb alcohol sales following sharp increases in the number of incidents involving disruptive passengers.
The carrier issued a statement Monday calling for a ban on alcohol sales before 10 a.m. and for limiting the number of drinks in bars and restaurants to a maximum of two.
The airline cited Civil Aviation Authority statistics showing a 600 percent increase in disruptive incidents between 2012-2016 and said most involved alcohol.
Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs says it's unfair “that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences.”
The airline says it has taken steps to prevent disruptive behavior on its flights, including preventing consumption of duty-free alcohol purchases on board.

In today's International Newswire, Variety asks if animation could be a growth sector for the independent movie business, as “Paddington 2” outperforms the original in China and France, as the U.K. before them. Also, homegirl-made-good Alicia Vikander bids fair to be a major presence at late January's Göteborg Festival, Enders Analysis looks at the vertiginously changing world of children's media, and a snapshot of politician and media-culture activist Xavier Bertrand, as he places Lille and Hauts-de-France on the international film-TV radar.
ANIMATION: AN INDIE GROWTH INDUSTRY?
Watch animation. As theatrical returns and even openings worldwide on U.S. and foreign independent movies come under ever more pressure from Hollywood and local blockbusters, animation looks like one part of the independent movie industry which can put in a claim to have arresting growth prospects. The explosion of Latin American animation feature titles coming onto the market helped make the 9th Ventana Sur, which wrapped Dec. 1, the strongest edition ever with Latin America's biggest movie market firing on at least four movie cylinders: New acclaimed art films, such as Mexico's “La Camarista”; Latin American auteur genre; a swathe of pristine titles from Argentina, such as “Animal,” from Oscar winning screenwriter Armando Bo (“Birdman”), Viacom's biggest movie bet ever in Latin America; and animation, with “Escape to India” and “Noah Ark,” whose producers include Juan José Campanella and Walter Salles, proving two of the biggest titles at the market. Just a week later, Europe's animation community pulled off a successful first European Animation Awards, with “The Book of Kells'” Tom Moore announcing on stage at the prize ceremony “a golden age” of European animation. The awards come as the E.U., via its MEDIA Program, discuss preferential funding for its animation companies, animated feature “Loving Vincent” blasts past $20 million, and “Paddington 2” looks set to outperform the original in China. Animation certainly isn't a license to print money. Its trad 2D and stop-motion forms in Europe are challenged by a audience equation of gold-standard movie toons with big CGI VFX fare, producer Didier Brunner observed before the EAAs. But its conversation is at least about how to secure a better future, not if the industry has a future outside digital platforms.
‘PADDINGTON 2' OUTPERFORMS ORIGINAL IN CHINA, U.K.
A case to point, regarding animation: “Paddington 2.” Produced by “Harry Potter” and “Gravity's” David Heyman and financed, distributed and sold by Studiocanal, “Paddington 2” opened last weekend in China, placing No.2 behind “Coco,” for a first frame $15.7 million – more than the original took on the whole of its run there. In France, it bowed No. 1 last Wednesday, 6% up in admissions, though it remains to be seen how Saturday's national mourning for Johnny Hallyday may affect weekend figures. In the U.K, “Paddington 2” is just shy of the original's box office gross of £30 million ($40.2 million), and still performing strongly with school vacations as yet to kick in. The real decider of “Paddington 2's” final trawl will be its performance in the U.S., where Warner Bros. Pictures opens the family comedy on Jan. 12. The original over-performed for The Weinstein Company in 2015 with $76 million domestically: A big but not impossible ask to beat.
ALICIA VIKANDER TO BE HONORED AT GÖTEBORG
Hailed as “one of the major Swedish actors in film history” by Göteborg Festival artistic director Jonas Holmberg, Alicia Vikander, a Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner for “The Danish Girl,” will receive the 2018 Nordic Honorary Dragon Award from Sweden's Goteborg Festival, Scandinavia's biggest industry event, which runs Jan. 26 to Feb. 5. This is a coup, though a logical one at that. Priming their coming-live factor, festivals are increasingly driven and defined by events within events: Mexico's Morelia was energized by its world premiere of “Coco” and extraordinarily generous presence of Guillermo del Toro. Vikander will present “Euphoria,” her third movie with Lisa Langseth after the acclaimed “Pure” and “Hotell.” Though critics' reactions to “Euphoria” don't quite measure up to its title, Vikander can bring a lot to the table as not only a considerable Hollywood star and acclaimed actress but also budding producer – “Euphoria” is her first film at her production label, Vicarious Productions -whose presence on a movie can raise its profile to another level. Her masterclass looks already like one of Göteborg's highlights.
CHILDREN: MORE OPTIONS, MORE CHALLENGES
Children's media use and attitudes have dramatically changed over the last few years, thanks to rapid take-up of smartphones and tablets, according to an Enders Analysis report published Friday, Children Changing Video Habits and Implications for the Content Market, which was published Friday. Among the report's stats, which ficus on the U.K.: 43% of children aged 8-15 prefer YouTube videos to TV programs; 65% of 3-4s own tablets; since 2012, traditional TV viewing has fallen about 45% among 8-15s; the most-watched TV shows by children are not children0's shows but family events, such as “Britain's Got Talent” and “Strictly Come Dancing.” That said, the TV set still accounts for over 75% of children's video viewing in the U.K., and “developments have arguably shifted the balance of power in favor of content producers who have a wider variety of options when it comes to exploiting rights.”

XAVIER BERTRAND HELPS PUT LILLE ON THE MAP
Also, and it's another takeaway from the European Animation Awards, watch Lille and the Hauts-de-France region. The latter, comprising Picardy, Lille, the mining basin to the south, and Calais, is hardly a household name, but then it was only created in September last year, merging Calais and Picardy. Now, its president, Xavier Bertrand, a center-right former labor minister under Nicolas Sarkozy, is helping to put it on the map. It was Bertrand who famously turned back the tide against Marine Le Pin beating her in her north France stronghold in regional elections in December 2015 by appealing across the political divide to socialist voters. Allied with Martine Aubry, Lille's socialist mayor, earlier this year Bertrand wrestled French governmental backing for a French TV festival, now the Lille-located Series Mania, launching next April. He also fought tooth-and-claw to attract the first European Animation Awards, which took place in Lille on Friday. Attendees were impressed by its spacious but centralized locales, such as the Nouveau Siecle, where the ceremony took place. 50 minutes by train from Charles de Gaulle, Lille is closer time-wise to Paris' biggest airport than many parts of Paris. Like much of Hollywood, Bertrand insists culture can battle both unemployment and extremism. Hauts-de-France will prove an interesting test case for the future.
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has said he feels ready to return home from medical leave in Britain, and is awaiting his doctor's permission, a presidency statement said on Saturday.
Buhari's extended absence for an undisclosed ailment, his second this year, left many in Nigeria questioning whether he was well enough to run the country. The president has spent more time since the beginning of 2017 in Britain than in Nigeria.
That has sparked numerous protests, including demands that Buhari should resign, as well as calls for more transparency about the president's condition.
"I feel I could go home, but the doctors are in charge," Buhari said, according to Saturday's statement, adding that there has been a "tremendous improvement" in his health.
Photos released by the presidency show Buhari standing outdoors, grinning and wearing sunglasses while holding a large "Get well soon" card, with a handful of officials around him in a leafy, residential area.
The 74-year-old president had already been in London from January to March for sick leave before returning to Britain in May for further treatment.
Both times, the president appointed his deputy, Yemi Osinbajo, to act in his stead.
Buhari's lengthy illness has sparked speculation about his ability to seek a second term in 2019. Politicians and diplomats have started privately discussing potential candidates should the current president not run.
If Buhari does not stand, it could also lead to greater ethnic and religious tensions in Nigeria, long riven by divisions between the largely Muslim north and the mostly Christian south.
Members of both the Muslim north and Christian south feel that a representative from either side should hold the presidency for the maximum two terms, eight years, before the opposite faction's candidate can then lead the nation.
Yet Buhari's appointment of Osinbajo, a southern Christian, as acting president did help allay fears of the intense political infighting of 2010 after then-president Umaru Yar'Adua fell ill and failed to nominate someone to run the country.
It was only when Yar'Adua, a northern Muslim, died in May that year that his vice president Goodluck Jonathan became Nigeria's leader, resolving the constitutional crisis.
When Jonathan successfully won the presidential election in 2011, one that many viewed as a vote that should have given the Muslim north its second term in the presidency, hundreds died in riots protesting against that victory.

December 14, 2016, witnessed a surprising unfolding of events in Syria, with the Assad forces declaring a victory over the rebel groups in Eastern Aleppo. There were mixed scenes of misery and jubilation on the social and electronic media, with the majority of the social media focused on the alleged brutality of Russian and Assad forces killing innocent women and children in the city. On the global front, the US and Russian envoys to the UN also traded barbs at each other. The US tried to shame Russia for supporting Assad and killing Syrians, whereas Russia accused the US of supporting and nourishing non state actors, such as ISIS and the Free Syrian Army. With the complicated war fronts and intra-state conflicts in modern times, especially in South Asia and Middle East, there remains a void on defining violent fringe groups, commonly known as Violent Non State Actors, or VNSAs.
Where Afghanistan's commonly known VNSAs are the Taliban, Pakistan's NSAs include Tehrik i Taliban and armed groups based in FATA, Balochistan and South Punjab. In international arena, Al Qaeda and ISIS (or ISIL) are the most talked-about VNSAs currently. Now what makes the whole concept of NSAs interesting is how one party can see them as illegitimate groups, whereas the other party see them more on the lines of having a legitimate right to take up arms against the state. For the sake of understanding, one can assume that VNSAs, irrespective of the circumstances, are never to be backed by a legitimate state. Yet, there remains a major dilemma on who defines the legitimacy of VNSAs in current global politics.
The VNSA dilemma has taken to the fore since the Syrian war started, with countless groups, all claiming to be legitimate representatives of Syrian people, aiming to overthrow Bashar al-Assad and his regime. The US government, over the course of Obama presidency, has openly supported most of these groups calling for Assad to leave. The Free Syrian Army, which clearly falls under the category of VNSAs, was the prime beneficiary of America's political and financial support over the past few years. Where on one hand the US government has called for “respect for humanitarian values” and asked the Assad regime not to kill its own people, the same US government has provided the means for groups like ISIS and FSA to flourish.
US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard - who is also a member of Obama's Democratic Party - recently called on the US government to cease its support for Al Qaeda, ISIS and other affiliated groups. Gabbard also blamed America's Gulf allies, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, of supporting ISIS and fuelling the raging spiral of militancy in the Middle East. Gabbard's revelations didn't come as surprise to many, especially those who remembered the June 2015 collapse of a terrorism trial against Bherlin Gildo, a Swedish national, in London. Gildo's lawyers had then claimed that he was fighting for the same group that was supported by the west, especially the UK and USA. It was revealed that the British government was providing active lethal and non-lethal support to the VNSAs in Syria.
The irony of the matter is that both the UK and USA have criticised countries trying to bring VNSAs on the table in Afghanistan. In a recent development in neighbouring Afghanistan, the government in Kabul tried to take the Russian ambassador, Alexander Mantytskiy, to the task for his country's alleged reaching out to the Afghan Taliban. The Afghan media, as well as the government, called Russian transgression a deadly game for the region. With the US still controlling most of the policy affairs in Kabul, such a backlash for Russian actions was expected. Yet, the situation presented the same dilemma of who defines which VNSAs are to be negotiated with?
The western media discourse is also helping little when it comes to solving the complex puzzle of understanding the VNSAs. The FSA, and other anti-Assad groups, even with their evident attacks against the Syrians, have been commonly tagged as “moderate rebels”. On the other hand, any group, which is even remotely associated with Iran and Iran, and supports the Assad regime comes under scrutiny and criticism. Both the warring sides in Syria have had their fair share in inflicting misery upon the Syrians. Yet, the one-sidedness of the western media, when it comes to branding these groups, is an epitome of misinformation and partisan reporting of events.
If countries like China, Russia, Iran or even Pakistan try reaching out to VNSAs, it is only seen as an implicit support for militant groups and militancy. Whereas countries supporting groups such as the FSA use the argument of aiding the “moderate rebels” against a tyrant. This dichotomy points towards the root of security problems currently faced by the South Asian and Middle Eastern regions. Until and unless there is a consensus on the form, function and agenda of VNSAs, establishing peace would always remain a distant and unassailable proposition.
A stray kitten that was found with two broken legs has been given a second chance, thanks to tender, loving care and a creative mode of transportation.
“Champ” was rescued by Cat Rescue Maritimes (CARMA) after he was found in a farmer's barn in Sussex, N.B., just over a week ago.
“We agreed to take him fully planning on having to have him euthanized,” said Terry Peck, founding member of the Sussex chapter of CARMA.

But after connecting with their new furry friend, Peck says they were unable to part ways. Peck says Champ has a powerful will to live.
“He can wag his tail, he can use the washroom and we just fell in love with him and had to give him a chance,” she said.
Champ is forced to scoot around powered only by his front limbs.
“(Champ) does have hind legs, but they are kind of twisted around and they are not usable. But other than that, he seemed to be in good health,” said veterinarian Dr. Stephen Justason, who was the first to examine Champ.
With that in mind, Champ's foster parents got creative. Just like a scene out of The Lego Movie, Champ's foster became a master builder.
“It was actually her husband who took her son's Lego and built him a little wheelchair out of Lego,” said Peck.
WATCH: Why is the practice of declawing cats banned?
The ingenious idea has allowed Champ to get around alongside his littermate – like a champ – with a red sock cut into a tiny sweater so the harness doesn't chafe his body.
Champ is better able to scoot around and interact with the other rescues.
“They just fell in love with him and accept him just the way he is,” said Peck. “Humans could learn a lot from animals.”

Champ is outgrowing his Lego wheelchair, so CARMA is raising money to buy him an adjustable one that will grow with him. Now the little guy may face a few more challenges as he grows.
Justason says there's also the potential for Champ to develop additional health problems down the road, such as kidney problems and digestive issues. But Peck says his foster parents are more than ready to look after any health concerns that pop up.

SAMAWIYA JAVED,
Karachi, April 2.

LAHORE - PTI Chairman Imran Khan Tuesday dashed to Lahore to meet the rain-stricken people here after the heavy downpour caused innumerable problems to the public at large.
It was his unscheduled visit to the City as he was to be in Karachi on Tuesday morning to run his party's election campaign. But the unusual rains brought him to Lahore apparently with the intent to listen to the people's grievances and concerns about the inadequate drainage system and the resultant problems they faced after the rain.
Accompanied by senior party leaders including Jahangir Khan Tareen, Aleem Khan and Dr Yasmin Rashid, Khan visited rain-affected parts of the City and blasted the previous Punjab rulers for their misplaced priorities and penchant for erecting huge structures ignoring the basic needs of citizens.
Lahore received over 230 millimeters of rains early Tuesday in three hours. It was a record downpour in decades that resulted in the killing of six persons, besides inundating most parts of the metropolis.
Addressing his supporters at the GPO and the Lakshmi crossings, Khan said that rains had exposed the false claims of the PML-N leaders about making Lahore just like Paris, the capital city of France. He emphasised that the streets of Paris would not sink due to heavy rain fall. While making such a statement, Khan was unmindful of the fact that had it rained so heavily in Paris and that too in a short span of three hours, the situation would not have been much different there as well.
Not long ago, the streets of Paris were presenting the scene of ponds in January this year after record-breaking rainfall paralyzed life in the City. For days, parts of Paris submerged due to an unrelenting downpour that also caused the River Seine to overflow. While the past rulers may rightly be criticized for not investing in projects of public utility like the drainage and sewerage systems, Imran's utterance on this occasion was clearly an attempt at political point scoring in a situation when the people were facing hardships due to inundated streets. He seemed more to be on a mission to ‘fish in the troubled waters' of Lahore than sympathizing with the people in distress. His unscheduled presence here on a rainy day was only reflective of his motive to fuel his party's election campaign over people's agonies.
In his address, Imran also stressed that his party did not believe in executing ornamental projects but the Sharif brothers focused more on receiving kickbacks and looting the national wealth heedless of the national priorities and public sentiments. He also took jibes at ex-chief minister Shehbaz Sharif, saying that a few hours of rainfall had washed away the so-called development mantra of Sharifs, thereby exposing their true face to the people. “A person who ruled over Punjab for 10 consecutive years could not give a reliable sewerage system to its capital city,” he said, adding that Shehbaz was directly responsible for the damage caused to the infrastructure and property since his arrogance and pride preceded the ground realities.
SLUGGISH CAMPAIGN AMID HEAVY RAIN
Though the electioneering was largely marred by the heavy downpour on Tuesday, candidates belonging to the PML-N and the PTI continued their election campaign in areas the least affected by the rain.
PTI's Aleem Khan addressed two corner meetings in NA-131, the National Assembly constituency from where party chief Imran Khan is contesting against Khawaja Saad Rafique of the PML-N. He also had door-to-door campaign in areas along Walton Road.
PTI's candidate from NA-125, Dr Yasmin Rashid was also seen campaigning in her constituency. She did canvassing while standing in knee-deep water in various streets.
Senior PML-N leader Hamza Shehbaz Sharif had meetings with party candidates from Lahore to chalk out strategy for the election campaign. Hamza also reiterated that he would be running the election campaign of his cousin Maryam Nawaz in NA-127 since she was taking care of her ailing mother in London. Former provincial minister Imran Nazir visited a few rain-hit localities in his constituency and pledged his cooperation to redress their grievances.
PTI SEEKS QADRI'S SUPPORT IN NA-133
PTI's candidate from NA-133 Ejaz Ahmad Ch went to see PAT Secretary General Khurram Nawaz Gandapur to seek his party's support for the coming elections. Though PAT has announced not to contest the July 25 elections, Allama Qadri's party has a significant vote bank in NA-133 which comprises the localities of Township, Kot Lakhpat and parts of Johar Town.
Gundapur reportedly told Ejaz Ch that he would consult Dr Tahirul Qadri and then inform him about PAT's decision about supporting any party in the elections.
PPP's Aslam Gill and PML-N's Pervaiz Malik are also in the run from this constituency where the vote bank of Dr Qadri's supporters may prove decisive in case there is a close contest among the three candidates.

Las Vegas — Stephen Paddock kept a cigar at hand, even though he didn't smoke. But he was quick to notice those who did.
Then Paddock, a denizen of hazy casinos, would light his cigar and aim the smoke into the faces of those whose puffing annoyed him.
"He was the king of microaggression," his brother, Eric, said.
Last week, Stephen Paddock returned to The Strip, where he spent countless hours playing high-limit video poker, and eyed the fun-seekers crowding his oasis. But this time he did so from a 32nd floor casino hotel suite. Then he smashed open a pair of windows with a hammer and opened fire with a carefully assembled arsenal, killing 58 fans gathered at an outdoor concert and injuring 500 more before killing himself.
Investigators and those who knew the 64-year-old say they cannot fathom what drove him to slaughter or point to any specific grievance that might have set him off.
But details that have surfaced so far about him are clues, at least, to his mindset. Most mass shooters are younger. But Paddock — a one-time IRS agent and the son of a notorious bank robber — was the product of decades of experience and rumination.
Paddock was the oldest of four brothers. When he was 7, his father, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, tried to run down an FBI agent during a pursuit in Las Vegas. After the elder Paddock was caught and charged with a string of Phoenix bank robberies, agents searched the family's home in Tucson, Arizona. A neighbor took little Stephen swimming while agents looked for evidence.
Benjamin Paddock was sentenced to 20 years in prison. But he escaped and spent a decade on the run.
"He reportedly has suicidal tendencies and should be considered armed and dangerous," the FBI warned.
Paddock's mother moved with her sons to Southern California, where she worked as a secretary and raised the boys on her own.
At John H. Francis Polytechnic High School, Paddock was a brainy kid with an "irreverence toward authority," said Richard Alarcon, a former classmate who later served on the Los Angeles City Council.
For a school contest, Paddock and other students were assigned to design bridges without using glue.
Paddock's bridge "was like a brick, he put so much glue in it," Alarcon said. "He didn't care ... It was like he just wanted to build the best bridge ever, regardless of what the rules were."
Paddock earned a degree in business administration from California State University, Northridge, in 1977, then spent a decade working for the federal government, including six years as an IRS agent. He married and divorced twice, remaining on good terms with both former wives, family member say, and left government for a defense contractor.
Around the same time, he began investing in real estate. Eric Paddock said that together with his gambling exploits, the investments made his brother a multimillionaire.
At Reno's Atlantis Casino, Paddock met Marilou Danley, a high-limit hostess there from 2010 to 2013, and they became a couple. In a statement released by her lawyer, Danley said Paddock sent her to the Philippines weeks before the shooting and described him as "a kind, caring, quiet man ... I hoped for a quiet future together with him."
Danley said Paddock wired her $100,000 and told her to buy a house for her family in the Philippines.
But workers at a casino Starbucks that the couple frequented say Paddock often scolded his girlfriend in public. Others who crossed paths with Paddock in recent months described him as despondent.
When Paddock came into a Reno car dealership late this summer, he told salesman Scott Armstrong he was depressed and had relationship troubles.
"When's the last time somebody told you their life was miserable? It sticks with you," Armstrong said.
Still, investigators said they are finding little to explain what drove him to mass murder. He had no known criminal record, and investigators have not disclosed any evidence that he struggled financially or otherwise.
Paddock could sit for hours in front of video poker machines, often placing bets of $100 or more, rarely talking with anyone else but clearly conscious of his surroundings, said John Weinreich, a former executive casino host at Reno's Atlantis.
He said Paddock had a habit of staring at other people, as if silently challenging them to a contest.
"It was just his demeanor. It was like, 'I'm here. Don't cross me. Don't look at me too long,'" Weinreich said.
Eric Paddock said his brother was generous with the privileges the casinos bestowed. He recalled how during one trip to Las Vegas, Stephen ordered them a sushi meal that must've been worth $1,000, but was paid for by a casino. Soon after, though, Stephen Paddock turned abruptly and demanded that his brother go get him a sandwich.
"That's the cost of being with Steve," he said.
Eric Paddock said he knew his brother owned a few handguns. But investigators say Paddock had bought 33 firearms in the last year alone, mostly rifles.
When Paddock visited B&S Guns in Garland, Texas, last year he asked about ways to modify a gun to make it easier to pull the trigger, owner Paul Peddle said.
When Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino last week, he requested a room on a higher floor, but was told nothing was available. Then a room freed up and managers moved him to a suite on the 32nd floor.
But as a big bettor, Paddock got it on the house.

ISLAMABAD:- Afghan President Ashraf Ghani Tuesday telephoned Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and offered condolences over the loss of life in Monday's Lahore terrorist attack. The prime minister said terrorism was a common enemy of the both states and such cowardly acts could not deter their resolve, a statement issued by the PM's media office here said.–APP
Dhaka - Rescue workers battled Wednesday to reach victims of landslides, described as the worst in Bangladesh's history, as the death toll from the disaster rose to 152.
Villagers in some of the worst-hit areas used shovels to try to dig bodies out of the mud that engulfed their settlements as they slept.
Authorities say hundreds of homes were buried by mud and rubble sent cascading down hillsides after monsoon rains dumped 343 millimetres (13.5 inches) of water on the southeast of the country in just 24 hours. Disaster Management Department chief Reaz Ahmed said the landslides were the worst in the country's history and warned the death toll would rise as rescuers reached cut-off areas. Khodeza Begum narrowly survived the disaster, which destroyed her home and killed 11 people in her village.
She told a local news website how she emerged from her home just after dawn on Tuesday to see the mountainside collapsing in front of her.
“As I came out, I saw a huge slab of earth rolling down from the hill. Instantly I got all my relatives out of their homes,” she said. “My house was buried under mud within moments. I have never seen a disaster like this in my life.”
Firefighters in the worst-hit district of Rangamati recovered six more bodies on Wednesday after clearing mud with shovels and water pumps. “The bodies were three to five feet deep in mud. We pumped water at a force to clear the mud,” said Didarul Alam, fire services chief for Rangamati district
The firefighters had pulled 18 people out from under the mud on Tuesday, but did not have the manpower to reach all the affected areas. Alam said his team had been able to reach more areas on Wednesday after 60 reinforcements arrived from neighbouring Chittagong. Authorities have opened 18 shelters in the worst-hit hill districts, where 4,500 people have been evacuated, a minister said.
The monsoon rains came two weeks after Cyclone Mora smashed into Bangladesh's southeast, killing at least eight people and damaging tens of thousands of homes. South Asia is frequently hit by flooding and landslides in the summer with the arrival of the annual monsoon rains.
Extreme weather in the far north-eastern Indian state of Mizoram along the border with Bangladesh left 12 people dead, an official there said Wednesday.
“Many people are reported missing. Hundreds of houses, roads and some mobile towers have been damaged in the flooding and landslides in the region,” N Chakhai, the state's head of disaster management, told AFP.
More than 200 people were killed in Sri Lanka last month when the monsoon triggered landslides and the worst flooding the island has seen in well over a decade.
Experts in Bangladesh said unplanned development in vulnerable areas was making the annual rains more deadly. “There is a backlash effect. These things accelerate the pace of the disaster and make it more fatal,” S.M.A. Fayez, an environmental science professor at Dhaka University, told AFP.
Rescue work has been hobbled by heavy rains, which have cut transport links to some remote areas.
The army said thousands of troops stationed in the affected districts as part of efforts to quell a long-running tribal insurgency had joined the rescue efforts.
“Our soldiers based in all parts of the Chittagong Hill Tracts have participated in the rescue operations,” armed forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Rashidul Hasan told AFP.
Rangamati district chief Manzurul Mannan told AFP 104 people had been killed there and 200 injured, some of them seriously. At least 37 people died in Chittagong, scene of a major landslide in 2007 that killed 127 people.
Among the victims in the latest disaster were two fishermen who drowned off the coast of Cox's Bazar after their boat apparently capsized. Other trawlers and their sailors were still missing.
As rain pounded Cox's Bazar for a third day, police confirmed that a father and daughter had been killed when a landslide buried their home.
You've been knocked out for a week and a half. You wake up and the Washington Capitals have won their second-round series against the Pittsburgh Penguins. How did it happen?
Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer: Whoa, how crazy is it that the Penguins had their NHL franchise charter revoked in the middle of the playoffs, as that's clearly the only way they could possibly lose a series to the Capitals? Wait, they didn't?
Well, look at that: Washington's recipe for success in its first-round series against the Columbus Blue Jackets series somehow cooked up a win over the Penguins. The Capitals scored a power-play goal in each game, and shut down the Pittsburgh power play in each win. Goalie Braden Holtby was the best player on the ice for a couple of games. Rivalry newbies Devante Smith-Pelly, Jakub Vrana and Chandler Stephenson scored key goals, because they didn't know any better. Alex Ovechkin had eight points in six games. Operative phrase: Six games. No sphincter-clenching, "how-does-it-all-go-to-hell" Game 7 pressure in D.C. Because if the series went that deep, obviously we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Emily Kaplan, national NHL reporter: The Capitals were in a precarious situation. Unburdened by outside expectations (no Presidents' Trophy) the team actually felt more pressure than ever. They knew their coach, Barry Trotz, was without a contract for next season and likely wouldn't be back save for winning a Stanley Cup -- and even then it wasn't a given. The Caps also knew that GM Brian MacLellan would drastically shake up the roster if they fell to the Penguins yet again.
So they put up one heck of a performance to win this series in six games. Of course, it helped that the Pens had played the equivalent of an extra half-season of hockey over their past two Stanley Cup runs. Washington also took advantage of Evgeni Malkin and Patric Hornqvist missing games with lingering injuries. The Penguins' power play was uncharacteristically tame -- oh, sorry this is Capitals fan fiction. I meant to say that Washington extended its strong penalty killing from the Blue Jackets series. Also, I'm happy to report, no beer cans were chucked onto the ice. The Capitals will need for Braden Holtby to be stellar in net against Crosby and Co. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports
Chris Peters, NHL prospects writer: First, I'd have to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. After that, I'd probably learn that Holtby, with some restored confidence after four consecutive victories against the Columbus Blue Jackets, was at the top of his game. His .932 career save percentage in the postseason hasn't necessarily helped a ton against Pittsburgh in previous years, but this time it's enough, especially if Penguins goalie Matt Murray's numbers continued to dip.
The Capitals would also need big performances from their depth players to bolster the expected production from their top guys like Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom, Evgeny Kuznetsov and John Carlson, who had been so strong against Columbus and continued to be threatening against Pittsburgh. The Caps got a little help from depth guys like Stephenson and Jay Beagle, among others, against Columbus. They will need even more against the Pens. The top lines will be expected to carry their respective teams, but the depth can provide the separation. And you know what? I think there's a decent chance this happens in real life, too.

Sachin Chandan, ESPN the Magazine researcher: Three things had to have happened. One, the Capitals won the high-leverage scoring chances. They are already on a strong track, as they lead all playoff teams with 66 high-danger scoring chances, per Natural Stat Trick. Two, Holtby was obviously stellar in net, but he needed the defense in front of him to help him out. This year, Holtby has been more susceptible to shots from the center of the zone, and he would need his top defense pairs, Michal Kempny-Carlson and Orlov-Matt Niskanen, to shut down those vulnerable lanes. Three, they kept up their power-play success while not taking penalties. Washington leads all teams with a 33.3 percent rate on the power play, while having the most chances, and didn't commit penalties of their own. It was a struggle, but anything is possible.
E-book sales may be declining in the U.S. and U.K., but in South Korea, many people still enjoy swiping instead of leafing through their reading material. E-book sales there are growing steadily each year, driven in part by the popularity of web comics. Ridibooks, which claims to be Korea's largest e-book provider, has raised a $20 million Series C to take advantage of the market.
Investors in the round include Praxis Capital Partners, ShinHan Finance Investment, and Company K Partners. The capital will be used to improve the user experience of Ridibooks' products, which now include Ridibooks, its main bookstore, an e-reader called Ridipaper, and Ridistory, a platform it launched in January for serialized novels and web comics.
TaeWoo Kim, Ridibooks' business manager, says e-book sales in Korea are increasing about 25 percent to 30 percent every year. Ridistory was launched in response to user demand for serialized novels and comics and its top-selling title, a romance novel called “Under the Oak Tree,” has already hit one million views.
Ridibooks made $50 million in revenue last year and currently has more than 2.5 million users who have downloaded a total of 175 million e-books. Its stores have 784,000 titles from 2,000 publishers. Along with its previous rounds, including an $8 million Series B closed at the end of 2014, Ridibooks has raised $35 million to date.
In Charlottesville, Religious Leaders Try To Comfort Residents
In Virginia, religious leaders are trying to comfort their congregations and address the complicated racial tensions facing the city.
STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:
This morning, political and religious leaders tried to comfort residents after yesterday's deadly attack in Charlottesville. Church leaders are also trying to address the complicated racial tensions facing the city. NPR's Sarah McCammon visited two churches this morning, one predominantly black and another predominantly white.
SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: The mood was somber as church goers filled the sanctuary at Mount Zion First African Baptist Church.
DONNA CHURCHMAN: I'm just - I'm just - I'm sad.
MCCAMMON: Donna Churchman had just finished putting on the delicate white gloves that mark her as an usher in this mostly black church, when she paused from greeting people coming through the doors.
CHURCHMAN: It's really sad that We have to go through things like this because somebody Doesn't Like a person because of the color of their skin.
MCCAMMON: Joann Jamison said she's lived in Charlottesville for decades and racism is nothing new here, but she's been distressed by the violence that broke out after the city made plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.
JOANN JAMISON: It's deja vu when you look at it. I mean, think about what went on when General Lee was actually in command. This is what happened yesterday. And who was fighting when General Lee was in command? That's who was fighting yesterday. So, you know, it's history repeating itself.
MCCAMMON: The heaviness of the moment was reflected throughout the service, including this prayer.
JAMISON: God, we need help. Satan is busy, but we know we're in your hands.
MCCAMMON: A few church members expressed surprise and frustration to see reporters and politicians in the room on a day when many had come to grieve. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe was there with Charlottesville's mayor and others. McAuliffe made a speech condemning the white supremacists whose rally sparked the violence this weekend. Then, standing a few feet from the pastor, the governor called for hope and quoted the words of Jesus.
TERRY MCAULIFFE: In this world, we will have trouble. He also said, Reverand Edwards, as you know, take hope, for I have overcome the world.
(APPLAUSE)
MCCAMMON: A short drive away, the mostly white members of First Baptist Church Charlottesville on Park Street were also gathering later in the morning.
UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine...
MCCAMMON: Church members denounced the racism, though some were hesitant to point a finger solely at any one group. Cherilyn White said she wished everyone could get along. Asked if President Trump was pointed enough in his delayed condemnation of the alt-right movement, White said racism has been a problem for all presidents, not just Trump.
CHERILYN WHITE: I think it's just - it's all through history. It's on everybody's shoulders to come together, not just the president or whoever's in charge of our country.
MCCAMMON: Pastor Rob Pochek framed his own denunciation of white supremacy in theological terms.
ROB POCHEK: Let me be clear. The white supremacy espoused by the like of David Duke, Richard Spencer and others is a lie straight from the pit of hell that cannot coexist with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
(APPLAUSE)
MCCAMMON: Pochek says since the violence broke out, he and other pastors here have been talking about what to say from their pulpits and how to lead their congregations through the healing that they hope will come. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Charlottesville.

In case you needed more proof that dogs are some of the most loyal, loving creatures on the planet, here you go.
Actor and filmmaker Easton Dufur used to have two yellow Labradors — Cookie and Stitch.
For those of you who wanna see my dogs here they are
(Stitch is on top, Cookie is on bottom) pic.twitter.com/zDK89IP18s — EasyBreasyBeautiful (@_EasyBreasy_) June 13, 2017
The dogs had always shared one food bowl, Easton said in a statement posted on Twitter.
“My dog Stitch trained my other dog Cookie to only eat half the food that's in the bowl. So ever since she was young she knew to leave half the food so Stitch can have some (he liked to make sure she would eat,)” Easton wrote.
Easton explained that Stitch recently passed away and Cookie is alone for the first time.
“So since Stitch is gone, I've been feeding Cookie less food,” Easton wrote.
“Well before I went to bed, I wanted to check to see if she ate. And so I did, and she still left half of her food there so Stitch can eat,” Easton said.
His tweet sparked a flood of emotions.
i'm crying so hard ugh oh my gosh poor Cookie missing her best friend ugh she doesn't deserve this https://t.co/B8Rw8VfRtQ — aly🖤 (@aly3hunna) June 13, 2017
cookie is too good for this world https://t.co/AmMWgB8cpW — hadia (@haahdia) June 13, 2017
Maybe because he knew his tweet broke hearts all over the world, Easton later shared a video of Cookie and Stitch enjoying a snack together during happier times.
The network known for airing “This Is Us” hopes to harness the power of “This Is Me.”

A single vehicle crash near Erwinville took the life of 64-year-old Billy Bookman, of Opelousas, on Sunday, Dec. 3, at 4:30 p.m., according to the Louisiana State Police.
State Police troopers revealed that the crash occured as Bookman was traveling eastbound on 190 in a 2003 Jaguar S-Type. For reasons still under investigation, the Jaguar ran off the roadway to the right and struck several trees, police said.
Bookman was unrestrained at the time of the crash and suffered fatal injuries as a result, police said. Impairment is unknown at this time, but a toxicology sample was taken from Bookman to be submitted to the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab for analysis.
This crash remains under investigation.
Louisiana State Troopers wish to remind motorists that all occupants in a vehicle must be restrained, regardless of seating position. While not all crashes are survivable, statistics show that the chances of surviving a crash rise significantly when properly restrained, police said.
LISBON): A small airplane crashed near a supermarket in a residential area outside Lisbon on Monday, killing five people, rescue workers said.
The private airplane crashed after taking off from the small Tires airport, which is located near the resort town of Cascais about 20km west of Lisbon and used mainly by private aircraft. Andre Fernandes, a spokesman for the local emergency services, said the plane was headed for Marseilles in France.
Everyone on board the plane, three French and one Swiss, died. Another person on the ground died when the plane crashed into a truck, setting off a fire, Fernandes said. The cause of the accident was not yet known. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa went to the site of the crash. There were more than 50 rescue workers at the site. "There are four dead, the pilot and his three passengers," a spokesman for Portugal's Office of Prevention and Investigation of Aeronautical Accidents told AFP.
, saying further details about the incident and the fatalities were not immediately known.
The warehouse is located close to an aerodrome at Tires, in the district of Cascais. There was no immediate information as to whether there were any casualties in the building itself.
“We all know that art, music and nature are beautiful. They command the senses and incite emotion. Their impact is swift and visceral. How can a mathematical idea inspire the same feelings? Well, for one thing, there is something very appealing about the notion of universal truth — especially at a time when people entertain the absurd idea of alternative facts.”
Srinagar
In occupied Kashmir, Dukhtaran-e-Millat (DeM) has condemned the re-arrest of party Chairperson, Aasiya Andrabi, and her associates, Nahida Nasreen and Fehmeeda Sofi in Srinagar.
The DeM spokesperson, Rifat Fatima, in a statement in Srinagar said that after a Srinagar court issued orders of interim bail on Monday in favour of Aasiya Andrabi, Nahida Nasreen and Fehmeeda Sofi, the police took them to Soura Police Station where another fake case was registered against them. “From there, the women leaders were taken to Rambagh Women's Police Station and have been kept in police remand till June 02,” she said.
Rifat Fatima said it is the worst human rights violation that since April 20, false cases are being registered against the three women leaders one after another. The party leaders were arrested from Islamabad district on April 20 on false charges of instigating students to protest and were sent to Srinagar Central Jail, she said.
Rifat said that it took a month to get bail in that case as it was only issued on May 19. “Since May 19, Aasiya Andrabi, Nahida Nasreen and Fehmeeda Sofi are being illegally kept under detention at Rambagh Police Station. This is political vengeance against the party leaders,” she added.
On May 28, an interim bail order was issued by a court and police were asked to immediately release the DeM leaders but instead of releasing them, this Indian terrorist force came up with yet another fake case against them and has detained them under remand until June 2, Rifat said. She said that this is inhuman act and mockery of their own law. “Isn't it funny that police mocks the judgments that have been issued by its own courts?” she asked.
Denying release to the three women despite a bail order is a glaring example of how Indian police disrespect the orders of courts in the territory, she added.
Rifat also expressed concern over the deteriorating health of Aasiya Andrabi inside the police station.—KMS
We've seen ASUS take an aggressive stance in India's budget segment with the ZenFone Max Pro M1 , and the Taiwanese manufacturer is now doing the same in the mid-range category with the launch of the ZenFone 5Z. The ZenFone 5Z sits at the top of the ZenFone lineup, and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset.
The phone also features a 6.2-inch 19:9 FHD+ display, dual 12MP + 8MP cameras at the back with OIS and EIS, 8MP front shooter, 3300mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0, Wi-Fi ac, FM radio, Bluetooth 5.0, 3.5mm jack, and a high-fidelity DAC.
On the software side of things, the ZenFone 5Z is running ZenUI based on Android 8.0 Oreo, and ASUS has committed to rolling out the Android P update shortly after it becomes available. ASUS significantly dialed back on the customizations with ZenUI, and the interface doesn't feel as bloated as before.
I've been using the device for just over a week, and the interface feels much more polished from even a year ago. ASUS is heavily touting the AI capabilities of ZenUI, with the phone featuring an AI-assisted screen calibration tool that adjusts the color balance of the panel, an AI ringtone mode that automatically adjusts the ringtone volume based on ambient noise, and a host of camera tweaks. I'll delve into the AI features in the review next week, so stay tuned.
The ZenFone 5Z isn't the first device to feature the Snapdragon 845 in India — the OnePlus 6 has that distinction — but ASUS is effectively undercutting OnePlus by launching the ZenFone 5Z for ₹29,999 ($440). By contrast, the OnePlus 6 retails for ₹34,999 ($510) in the country. ASUS undertook a similar strategy with the M1 in the budget segment, and it's clear that the manufacturer is looking to regain momentum in the country, and isn't willing to lose out on short-term profits to do so.
ASUS is selling the ZenFone 5Z in two color options — Midnight Blue and Meteor Silver — and the base variant with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage will be available for ₹29,999 ($440), and a version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage will retail for ₹32,999 ($480). The high-end variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage will be available for ₹36,999 ($540). The ZenFone 5Z will go up for sale exclusively on Flipkart starting July 9.
OnePlus went unchallenged in India's mid-range segment for the last two years, but we finally have an alternative in the ZenFone 5Z.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations officials have found that missiles fired at Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels appear to have a “common origin,” but they are still investigating U.S. and Saudi claims that Iran supplied them, according to a confidential report.
The officials traveled to Saudi Arabia to examine the debris of missiles fired on July 22 and Nov. 4, wrote U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in the fourth biannual report on the implementation of U.N. sanctions and restrictions on Iran.
They found “that the missiles had similar structural and manufacturing features which suggest a common origin,” said Guterres in the Friday report to the U.N. Security Council, seen by Reuters on Saturday.
The report comes amid calls by the United States for Iran to be held accountable for violating U.N. Security Council resolutions on Yemen and Iran by supplying weapons to the Houthis.
Saudi-led forces, which back the Yemeni government, have fought the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen's more than two-year-long civil war. Saudi Arabia's crown prince has described Iran's supply of rockets to the Houthis as “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.
Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with weapons, saying the U.S. and Saudi allegations are “baseless and unfounded.”
Guterre's report said the U.N. officials saw three components, which Saudi authorities said came from the missile fired on Nov. 4. The components “bore the castings of a logo similar to that of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group” - a U.N.-blacklisted company.
The officials are “still analyzing the information collected and will report back to the Security Council,” wrote Guterres.
NUCLEAR DEAL
The Saudi-led coalition used the Nov. 4 missile attack to justify a blockade of Yemen for several weeks, saying it was needed to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran.
Although the blockade later eased, Yemen's situation has remained dire. About 8 million people are on the brink of famine, with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria.
A separate report to the Security Council last month by a panel of independent experts monitoring sanctions imposed in Yemen found that four missiles fired this year into Saudi Arabia appear to have been designed and manufactured by Iran.
However, the panel said it “as yet has no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier” of the missiles, which were likely shipped to the Houthis in violation of a targeted U.N. arms embargo imposed on Houthi leaders in April 2015.
Most U.N. sanctions on Iran were lifted in January last year when the U.N. nuclear watchdog confirmed that Tehran fulfilled commitments under a nuclear deal with Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and the United States. But Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions.
U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a blow to the nuclear deal in October by refusing to certify that Tehran was complying with the accord and warning that he might ultimately terminate it. International inspectors have said Iran is in compliance.
“I encourage the United States to maintain its commitments to the plan and to consider the broader implications for the region and beyond before taking any further steps,” Guterres wrote.
“Similarly, I encourage the Islamic Republic of Iran to carefully consider the concerns raised by other participants in the plan,” he said.
JavaOne Microsoft has announced Java support for Azure Functions, the serverless cloud platform which competes with AWS Lambda. The announcement was made at the JavaOne event under way in San Francisco this week.
The service is now in public preview. Java is the latest language to be added following Microsoft's redesign of the Azure Functions runtime to improve support for different programming languages.
Azure Functions can be triggered in a variety of ways, including a direct call over HTTP, scheduled execution, Azure Service Bus messages, changes to files in Azure storage, or in response to events managed by Event Grid, an Azure event routing service announced in August.
Azure Functions is billed per execution and scales automatically. Other supported languages are C#, F#, Node.js, Python, PHP and Bash.
Oracle VP: 'We want the next decade to be Java first, Java always' READ MORE
Microsoft also has tools for running an Azure Functions host locally, for development and test. The Azure Functions Core Tools use NodeJS and .NET Core, and run on Windows, Linux and Mac.
Java developers also have a plugin for Apache Maven which manages build and deployment.
Why Java in Azure Functions? Java remains the top language for enterprise development, even though it trails JavaScript in overall popularity. If Microsoft hopes to attract developers to Azure beyond the usual Redmond platform community, Java support is essential.
Note that Amazon's AWS has offered Java support in its similar Lambda service since June 2015. Lambda also has a local development option, called AWS SAM – that's Serverless Application Model – Local, so Microsoft's offering is not all that distinctive.
That said, there is good reason to build on Microsoft's cloud if you are integrating with other Microsoft services such as Office 365 or Dynamics 365, or an Azure database such as CosmosDB.
Microsoft already supports Java on Azure in various other services, including App Service, or running in containers. The advantage of serverless is that is a pure cloud model, in which developers only need to supply the code, which talks to the underlying platform via APIs. Obviously, it still ultimately all runs on actual servers. Serverless means you don't have to worry about deploying, maintaining, scheduling and tearing down host systems or virtual machines – you just supply the code and Azure (or AWS or whoever) takes care of the hosting automatically, fingers crossed.

Gabriel Sherman: “As Fox News moves further into the post–Roger Ailes era, the network is shedding one of its most iconic elements. According to network executives, Fox News has abandoned the marketing slogan ‘Fair & Balanced.' The decision was made last August after Ailes's ouster by Fox News co-president Jack Abernethy, because the phrase had ‘been mocked,' one insider said. Another executive explained that the tagline was ‘too closely associated with Roger.' Fox executives have been instructed by management to market the network by its other tagline: ‘Most Watched. Most Trusted.'”
“It is hard to overstate the significance of what shedding ‘Fair & Balanced' means for Fox News. (It would be like the New York Times giving up ‘All the News That's Fit to Print.') Ailes invented the slogan when he launched the network in 1996, and over the years it became a quasi-religious doctrine among Fox's anchors and viewers.”
The Citadel baseball's left-handed pitcher JP Sears was drafted 333rd overall by the Seattle Mariners in the 11th round of the 2017 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft on Wednesday.
Sears becomes the 50th Bulldog to be drafted since 1965 and the first since 2015 when The Citadel had three players drafted. He is the 14th Bulldog to be drafted in the first 11 rounds. Sears is the second player in program history drafted by the Mariners after T.A. Fulmer was selected by Seattle in the 13th round in 2002.
The Citadel southpaw has had one of the best pitching seasons in program history, receiving numerous national awards. Sears has already been selected a second-team All-American by Collegiate Baseball, a third-team member by Baseball American and a member of the fourth team by College Sports Madness with more awards potentially to come.
Sears is The Citadel baseball's first All-American since 2013 when Joe Jackson was named a third-team member by Collegiate Baseball and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association. Sears is the fifth player to be selected to the second team by Collegiate Baseball with the last by Asher Wojciechowski in 2010.
Sears was also named a semifinalist for USA Baseball's Golden Spikes award on May 31. He is just one of 25 players across the country in all levels of collegiate baseball to be named a semifinalist for the prestigious award and is the lone Southern Conference representative. Past winners of the award include MLB stars Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg, Buster Posey and Kris Bryant.
Sears continues to lead the nation in strikeouts with 142 and ranks third in strikeouts per nine innings with 13.41 despite not having pitched in three weeks. He was selected the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year after finishing the regular season with a 7-2 record and 2.03 earned run average.
The southpaw had arguably the most dominant start in college baseball this season when he struck out 20 batters in a two-hit, complete game shutout of VMI on March 24. The 20 strikeouts are tied for the most in program history and the most by a single pitcher in Division I this season.
Sears' 20-strikeout game came 364 days after he struck out 19 batters at VMI last season. After the record performance, Sears owns two of the top-six strikeout totals in Southern Conference history.
The Sumter, South Carolina, native posted seven double-digit strikeout games in 14 starts, including reaching 15 strikeouts on three occasions. Sears struck out at least 11 batters in his final three regular season starts, all victories.
Sears' season ranks among the best in The Citadel history, finishing with the fifth most strikeouts in a season, despite pitching just the 22nd most innings.

As the number of undocumented migrants in Algeria increases, a rights-based approach to migration becomes imperative. By Jihane Ben Yahia
First published by ISS Today
Since the end of 2017, thousands of undocumented migrants from Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal, Mali and Guinea have been repatriated – or forcibly deported – from Algeria to Niger and Mali. At least 3,000 people, including asylum seekers, have reportedly been expelled from Algeria since the beginning of the year and more than 6,500 have been deported since 2017.
Algeria argues that the Algerian-Nigerien agreement concluded in 2014 enabling undocumented Nigeriens to return to their home country is part of a voluntary programme. So far, 28,000 Nigeriens have been repatriated. But Nigerien Prime Minister Mohamed Bazoum told the media that this agreement applied to Nigerians only, and urged Algeria to stop evicting other sub-Saharan Africans to Niger.
Algeria's decision to send sub-Saharan Africans to Niger and Mali has led to diplomatic tensions with the migrants' countries of origin. Guinean President Alpha Condé has recalled the country's ambassador to Algiers, and that position has remained vacant since January this year. Mali has also reportedly recalled its ambassador and consul.
It is estimated that between 25,000 and 100,000 undocumented migrants, mainly from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, live in Algeria. Most work in the agriculture and construction industries where the demand for labour is particularly high.
But when Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune announced the regularisation of migrant workers in July 2017, the local population saw their presence as a threat in a country with a 30% unemployment rate.
Shortly afterwards, the president's chief of staff Ahmed Ouyahia discredited Tebboune, accusing migrants of bringing “crime, drugs and several other plagues”, and ruled out any regularisation.
Algerian law criminalises the illegal entry into, residency in and exit from the country, but allows those who might be subject to a court's expulsion decision, to appeal. This process is welcomed.
But the interior ministry can also unilaterally decide to evict foreigners who might “violate the security of the state, public order, morality and organised crime legislation”. The absence of an asylum law shows the lack of political vision on the issue.
And while Algeria ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families in 2004, several aspects need to be strengthened in domestic law. Currently, Algerian law addresses undocumented migration as a security concern, which appears in repatriation operations.
Amnesty International found that after migrants were arrested in northern cities, they were transferred by bus to detention centres (the existence of which Algeria denied) and to Tamanrasset – the southern Algerian hotspot – and finally to In Guezzam or In Khalil. From there they walked through the desert to Niger or Mali.
No humanitarian organisation took part in these operations – with the exception of the Algeria Red Crescent (which did not react to allegations of mistreatment). The involvement of such organisations could have helped ensure that the needs of migrants were adequately catered for.
Algeria's neighbours also need sustainable and rights-based migrant policies. Tunisia, for example, lacks an adequate legal framework on migration and asylum. Confronted with instability in Libya, Tunisian authorities have long tolerated the presence of undocumented sub-Saharan African migrants in the country.
But recent reports of vessels carrying undocumented Tunisian and sub-Saharan migrants sinking after leaving the Tunisian coast have raised new concerns.
Libya's situation, despite a decrease in the flow of migrants trying to reach Europe, is still critical. International pressure that saw controversial assistance to Libyan law enforcement agencies has translated into stricter border control measures to contain the migration flow. This means that alternative routes are likely to become busier. This, in turn, could increase pressure on Libya's neighbours.
In 2013, Morocco introduced a new migration strategy that authorities said was “more comprehensive, humanist and responsible”. In 2014 and 2016, some 50 000 migrants were allowed to legalise their presence in the country with a one-year residence permit, which was extended to three years in 2017.
The issuing of residence permits in Morocco is strict, so this was a significant development that could be strengthened even further with the adoption of a law on asylum and migration.
The international community should try to anticipate shifts in migration flows in the region and provide technical support so countries can pass adequate laws. At the same time, relevant government officials – especially law enforcement, customs agents, magistrates and social workers – need training on international best practices for protecting undocumented migrants.
Algeria plays a major role in regulating migration flow between sub-Saharan Africa and Europe but is faced with increasing numbers of undocumented migrants. This raises legitimate concerns for the country.
Algeria has the opportunity to lead the way on peace and security efforts in Africa. To do so, it needs to resolve its policy conundrum by adopting a rights-based approach to migration. This should include applying the principle of non-refoulement in the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, which Algeria has signed and ratified. DM

Wysten Hugh Auden is remembered as one of the best American poets of the 20th century. Even much before the time that the World War II broke out, Auden was engaged in highlighting various loopholes in the political systems of the world which engendered flaws in the social apparatus as well as the economic paraphernalia of any country. This article carries out an exegesis into some of the ideas in W.H. Auden's poetry, based on his social analysis of the world.
The “Oxford Coterie”of young poets that included Stephen Spenders and W.H. Auden together catalyzed the process of introducing themes that are now archetypal to the modernist poetry of the 20th century. One sees Auden's poetry as beautiful and at times surreal on a normative vision, but upon a deeper level of study, his poetry unravels its underlying explanations to the problems that the world is confronted with. Not only does Auden talk about the social and political problems but the problems of identity, reclamation of space, and the herculean difficulties associated with war-affected nations that breathe perpetual pessimism and existential crises.
At Oxford in the late 1920s, Auden read the work of Eliot and was inspired majorly by the latter. Auden's earliest verse was also influenced by Thomas Hardy and Wilfred Owens. His poems are fragmented, hinging on substantial images and colloquial concerns to convey Auden's political and psychological fears.
In the 1930s his poems mirrored his travels as well as his obsession with the work of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. Journey to War, written with Christopher Isherwood, a regular collaborator, featured short sonnets and a verse interpretation. The famous Spain, dealing with the Spanish Civil War, is from this period.
One of the chief factors that sets Auden different from his lot is his ability to explain matters and topics of sheer intellect with use of the simplest linguistic facility, easily graspable and pragmatically structured.
A terse description to define Auden as a poet could be taken from one of his own very brief poems, Epitaph on a Tyrant:
Perfection, of a kind, was what he was after,
And the poetry he invented was easy to understand;
He knew human folly like the back of his hand,
And was greatly interested in armies and fleets;
When he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter,
And when he cried the little children died in the streets
The More Loving Oneis a poem by Auden that talks about him looking up at the stars and while examining these, it can be understood that the poet makes significant allusions. The “stars” in the poem could allude to the ruling hierarchy, the upper tiers that rule over masses. It is a substantial interpretation to the poem that the poet hinges his idea upon; Auden, being the social analyst that he was, through this poem placed emphasis on the discordance between the government tiers and the ordinary masses—drawing people's attention towards the asymmetrical society—the widening of the gyre between the bases and the superstructures. It is this ever-widening gap between the proletariat and the bourgeois class that engenders a social conflict between the two, which ultimately becomes a cause of the struggle that the proletariat class undergoes in order to eventually bring a revolution.
The poet refers to himself as the more loving entity, a kind of proverbial glue that would keep the bases together by forging unity of purpose. This particular notion is inclined towards critiquing capitalism in which cleavages are formed within a society,
If equal affection there cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.
The Marxist idea in the poem is brought under perspective by highlighting what capitalism is capable of doing to a society, creating factions and divisions within it and polarizing it to a lethal extent. It is this idea that is mirrored in the tone of the third stanza:
Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn
I cannot, now I see them, say
I missed one terribly all day
When the working classes and middle classes of a country feel alienated and realize that they have been brutally left on their own, downtrodden and disenfranchised, they stop relying on their elected representatives, the ones that they bestowed their trust upon—their so-called support-systems and the ones that they admired.
This paves way for a pro-Marxist ideology to set in, which for the most part, is a revolution brought about by the toiling bases.
The poem is partly pessimistic and partly optimistic. The pessimistic part of the poem manifests itself in the last stanza whereby the poet says,
Were all stars to disappear or die,
I should learn to look at an empty sky
It needs to be understood that the poet here is trying to establish the idea that all ‘big stars' that one admires and deems as his savior and protector are petty in themselves, their shine is transient and short-lived, which is why one should be prepared to open his eyes to witness an empty sky. The empty sky could allude to a society without social hierarchies and class structures.
The optimistic approach, however, is closely linked to the very idea of a silver silhouette seen being engendered by an impeccable belief in revolution which would dissolve the anxieties and pressures endured by the working class.
Auden is famous for highlighting contemporary issues that were prevalent under totalitarianism under the veneer of lyrical pieces of beauty.
In The Unknown Citizen, Auden describes an individual who is robed off his individuality in such a way that he has been displayed as an entity recognizable by the various external agencies that keep a track of his life:
For in everything he did he served the greater Community.
Except for the War till the day he retired
He worked in a factory and never got fired,
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.
Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,
For his Union reports that he paid his dues
One could argue over the nature of the title of this poem, it is essential to bear in mind the reality that the readership is made to imbibe by the poet rightly pointing out that an individual is nothing but a cog in the social machinery—and this mechanical existence fosters nothing evolutionary, rather paves way for a life punctuated by stagnation. As the individual grows older he becomes emotionally sterilized, transposed into a robot. What the poet means to willfully state is the abstract notion that any individual, towards the later years of his life in any society, does not remain the person he was born as.
The Press are convinced that he brought a paper every day
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way
The names of all the agencies begin with capitalized letters, this shows that the poet is hinting at the idea that in societies, from a bird's eye view, the individual himself coupled with all his obstinate pursuits of individuality, is dwarfed by the system that runs the society and affects the major stakeholders. The major stakeholders could be the mega institutions, institutionalized norms and major private owners in the managerial, working apparatus of any country.
This again makes the idea of Marxism very prominent in Auden's work as it is inexorably this very situation that results in demarcations and cornering of individuals who are constructive citizens of the society, demeaned and dwarfed by the big fishes in the game who not only use their well-established image and infrastructure to crush these individuals but also use art, religion and politics to exert their influence.
Was he happy? Was he free? The question is absurd
The absurdity about the question arises straight from the time when one looks up at the title of the poem, The Unknown Citizen, ideally the citizen is the state's responsibility but in the poem, Auden explains how the state treats the citizen as nothing more than a duty that needs to be kept a check upon with the help of a few external sources- ensuring the veritable happiness of the citizen has never been on the state's list of priorities.
In his poem, In Time of War, Auden gives an in-depth analysis of the complete process of proto-industrial capitalism. He talks about the various aspects of capitalism affecting the natural fabric of any country which is responsible for instilling unity within individuals.
In the Engines bear them through the sky: they're free
And isolated like the very rich;/ Here war is simple like a monument:
A telephone is speaking to a man;
Flags on a map assert that troops were sent;
A boy brings milk in bowls. There is a plan For living men in terror of their lives,
Who thirsts at nine who were to thirst at noon,
And can be lost and are, and miss their wives,
And, unlike an idea, can die too soon.
The effects of capitalism as we see it, the machines and the mechanical devices are what have reduced the ‘human” in man. Man has become a prey to dejection feeling strangulated by man-made social orders, the poet describes how war is itself the biggest of human follies and the biggest of human failures in essence. It is important to note here that Auden relates war and the “journey to war” directly with the idea of capitalism. Marxism, being a binary to capitalism, is what Auden, socially, propagates in this poem. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, being the hallmark of an asymmetrical society is what Auden has carried out a spoken battle against.
But ideas can be true although men die/ Requires their skill; will never see how flying
Is the creation of ideas they hate,
Auden points out here that the valiant skill with the art of soldering is what the higher authorities require from the individuals, the citizens, but the ideas dwelling within these mindsets might be true, Auden throws light at the fact that it is easier to see men dying in a war but an ideology cannot be buried so plainly. The perplexity of war is what Auden has talked about as failure and a futile exercise but at the same time the motivation that these men have, that provides the impetus for such an exercise in the first place, is what bears significance in Auden's eyes and it is this motivation that Auden defends and revels in. The poet says that it is this motivation that would make the people actualize their true potential as veritable individuals, cognizant of the fact that they should not waste their energies on activities like war, but ought to channelize their energies to bring essential changes to the very system that creates room for war.
In a nutshell, Auden worked not only as a beautiful poet but as one whose poetry did not do away with creating an impeccable balance between reasonable excess and required reality, beautiful in its form, yet practical and poignant in its message.
Acting Honolulu chief of police Cary Okimoto is retiring.
Okimoto made the announcement in a letter sent to the entire Honolulu Police Department Friday.
He became acting police chief last December after former chief Louis Kealoha placed himself on restricted duty due to a federal investigation over conspiracy allegations, then retired in January.
The Honolulu Police Commission says it's on track to pick a new chief by the end of the month.
Okimoto's letter follows:
To the men and women of HPD,
After 33 years of service in the Honolulu Police Department, I will be retiring at the end of this month. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the honor of serving with you.
It has been a privilege to have worked alongside the courageous officers and dedicated civilians who are the backbone of the department. Over the span of my career, I have witnessed the endless sacrifices that you have made to ensure our community's safety and the deep commitment each of you have to serving the people of Honolulu.
Sometimes, it is easy to forget the outstanding work our employees do to protect our community on a daily basis. However, remember, that we did not take this job for glory or credit. We are all about doing the right thing for the right reason. I have strived to do this throughout my career, and I ask all of you to do the same. Aim for the highest level of professionalism and continue to work hard and make decisions that will benefit the entire community.
Again, it has been a privilege being your acting chief. Thank you for your support, and I look forward to the great things that the future holds for HPD.
Take care and be safe.

* Dollar index sags, not far from three-year low
* Strong manufacturing survey underpins euro
* U.S. jobs report in focus later on Friday
By Lisa Twaronite
TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against a basket of currencies on Friday, on track for a weekly fall as investors focused on renewed economic strength in the eurozone.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly flat on the day at 88.659 , holding above a three-year low of 88.429 set one week ago but still down 0.4 percent for the week.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries reached a high of 2.797 percent early on Friday, probing its highest levels since April 2014.
“It's kind of counterintuitive. You'd think that with rates up, the dollar would be up, but investors are focusing their interest elsewhere,” such as further evidence that the European economy is picking up, said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
A survey on Thursday showed eurozone manufacturing continued to boom last month, supporting expectations that the European Central Bank is on track to normalise monetary policy.
The euro edged down 0.1 percent on the day to $1.2500 , but remained within sight of last week's 3-year high of $1.2538. For the week, it was up 0.5 percent.
Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar was slightly lower on the day at 109.38, holding above a four-month nadir of 108.28 hit a week ago.
Later on Friday, investors will be watching the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January, for the latest clues on the strength of the U.S. labour market.
Nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing 148,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.
The U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, though many market participants expect a rate hike in March. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year after hiking interest rates three times last year.
Question: “What do you think of Gaston Browne?”
Response: “I think he is crass, I think he is immature.”
The question was posed to the Leader of the United Progressive Party Harold Lovell back in mid-January, ahead of Prime Minister Browne's UNDP controversy that appears to have left many Antiguans and Barbudans embarrassed and pointing to what is being described as Gaston Browne's “lack of diplomacy”.
Browne last week Friday accused a team from the United Nations Development Programme of “taking all the credit” for repair work to homes in Barbuda after only contributing “a few sheets of plywood”.
The incident occurred in Barbuda when Browne was there for a tour of homes, the roofs of which were repaired, and for a launch ceremony.
During the tour he saw ‘UNDP-China Aid' stickers on homes on which the government had worked. The stickers bore two logos; one logo was that of the UNDP and the other said ‘China Aid.
“You come and plaster UNDP stickers all ‘round de place like you did some big large amount of work? That is totally unacceptable,” the prime minister declared there.
A former Parliamentarian for Barbuda has since urged Browne to “show some decorum”, describing the statement as “totally unacceptable”.
That kind of approach by the Antigua and Barbuda prime minister doesn't surprise his main rival Lovell, who wants to unseat Browne and his Antigua Labour Party at the next general election.
“I think his style of governance has set Antigua back, he has not been able to distinguish between a politician on the corner and a statesman leading an entire country,” Lovell said in an interview on January 18 made available to DNO.
Harold Lovell also quoted comments about Browne made by a former CEO who spoke of “juvenile temper tantrums that the prime minister was wont to engage in. He also referred to the fact that the prime minister at the last meeting of CARICOM heads – he stormed out and left the day the conference was due to start”.
“I don't think those are the actions of a mature prime minister who has the necessary statesmanship or the qualities of a statesman to really lead Antigua forward,” Lovell concluded.
Asked if he is aware of what Gaston Browne thinks of him, Lovell responded curtly: “I don't care”.

Steve Earle & The Dukes
So You Wanna Be An Outlaw
(Warner Bros.)
Rating: 4 out of 5 stars
The title of Steve Earle's latest album seems to suggest that younger artists trying to cultivate the “outlaw” brand might not have what it takes. A closer listen reveals that So You Wanna Be An Outlaw has a kind of double meaning: “Everybody reckons that they want to be free/ Ain't nobody wants to be alone,” Earle sings on the title track, and he then gets Willie Nelson to croon with him on the song to second the notion that outlaw life isn't always what it's mythologized to be.
Earle has always understood that sometimes subverting traditions is as important as upholding them to make an impact like the Waylons and Willies of the world. Consider the heartbreaking ballad “News From Colorado”: Instead of espousing classic country music values of home and family, the narrator here finds himself unable to truly break away from his ne'er-do-well brethren, causing him no small amount of anguish. Earle's worldview also occasionally leaves the home base far behind, as on the wry “Walkin' In LA,” where he gets vocal assistance from Johnny Bush.
After his 2015 release Terraplane skewed heavily toward the blues, Earle and his crack band the Dukes take a few more trips back to that genre with excellent results, particularly on the prison lament “If Mama Coulda Seen Me” and “Fixin' To Die,” which manages a Zeppelinesque crunch. Earle also shows off his facility for detailing romantic woes, via the slick pop songcraft of “This Is It How It Ends,” a duet with Miranda Lambert.
The closing track, “Goodbye Michelangelo,” is Earle's tribute to Guy Clark. “I'm bound to follow you someday/ Because you have always shown the way,” he sings about the legendary songwriter. Albums like this one continue to burnish a musical legacy that is every bit as imposing as the ones to which Earle pays homage in these songs.
Trump Administration Reverses Obama-Era Affirmative Action In Schools The White House is withdrawing Obama-era guidance documents that encouraged schools and colleges to promote racial diversity through their admissions process.
Executive Director of the Dominica Employers' Federation and Governor with the Dominica Business Forum, Achille Chris Joseph, has ascribed “questionable motives” to a recent statement by the Labour Commissioner which he says was very likely driven by a certain complaint made by an employee at a medical facility.
“The Commissioner takes employers to task for allegedly using Hurricane Maria as a reason to sever the employment of employees in a manner which is inconsistent with the law. But the Commissioner, in the next sentence, obligates the employer to inquire into an absent employee's whereabouts. This is also inconsistent with the law. It may be good HR practice, but there is no such legislated obligation on an employer,” Joseph stated in a DEF release. “So, it does not come across as genuine when the Labour Commissioner chides employers for taking action which is inconsistent with the law, and at the same time he recommends a certain alternative action which itself is inconsistent with the law.”
Joseph noted that it is the responsibility of every employee to show up for work at the time and place designated and, if he cannot do so, he has to provide an acceptable explanation to his employer or send in a certificate of ill health.
“Where neither is done, the employment relationship becomes ‘frustrated', and ‘frustration' is a ground for termination of a contract. An employee can, therefore, terminate his own employment by ‘frustration'. This doctrine is also known as ‘prolonged absenteeism' or ‘constructive resignation'. It is not the responsibility of an employer to make phone calls every time an employee does not show up for work”, the DEF official argued.
“Following the Hurricane, there were massive cleaning, restoration and recovery to be done at all business places. Many employers utilised their workers in the cleaning rather than lay them off and hire a cleaning crew,” Joseph said. “It would be ill-advised for an employer who had his goods looted and his property destroyed, and with no income, to keep his workers on payroll and still hire a cleaning crew.”
Joseph described “outburst” of the Labour Commissioner is the most recent in a trend of hostile posturing by the public sector. He said the local private sector continues to note the hostility of the public sector toward business, industry and enterprise.
“The Police failed us; the Government refuses to acknowledge and respond to our communications, and now, the Division of Labour is looking for a fight with us. Once again, the public sector declares war on enterprise,” Joseph declared.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump tweeted a photo of what he described as a “great meeting” with Kim Kardashian to talk about prison reform and sentencing.
White House reporters spotted Kardashian entering and exiting the West Wing on Wednesday afternoon, after White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the visit.
Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. pic.twitter.com/uOy4UJ41JF — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018
Kardashian has been advocating for the commutation of the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who is in prison for a low-level drug offense. “Today is for you,” Kardashian tweeted on Wednesday, which is Johnson's birthday.
Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you 🙏🏼✨ — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018
Kardashian also reportedly met with Jared Kushner, senior adviser and Trump's son-in-law, who has made criminal justice reform one of his policy goals. Kushner has advocated for prison reform and the First Step Act, legislation to help inmates re-enter society. It is currently pending before Congress.
Her visit drew some mixed reactions from groups that have been involved in the issue.
Jessica Jackson Sloan, national director of #cut50, an advocacy group calling for a reduction of the prison population, said in a statement, “We commend Ms. Kardashian-West for putting people over politics today. Ms. Alice Johnson's case demonstrates just how broken our federal criminal justice system is. And just like hundreds of people who have come to know Ms. Alice Johnson or the injustice of her case, Kim is calling on President Trump to exercise his clemency power to right this wrong.”
Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was critical of Trump's decision to meet with Kardashian.
“President Trump's reported meeting with Kim Kardashian West to discuss prison reform makes light of one of the biggest crises that we face in our country today,” she said in a statement issued earlier on Wednesday. “Prison reform is a complex issue that requires expertise and knowledge of where some of the greatest racial disparities lie. I am not aware that Ms. Kardashian West brings the requisite record of experience to tackle these issues on a national scale. In short, this proposed meeting is outrageous and makes clear that this administration does not deem prison reform a real priority.”
Much-travelled Quagliarella wants to extend Sampdoria stay

REUTERS - Sampdoria forward Fabio Quagliarella would like to settle down and end his career at the Genoa-based club after switching teams several times in his career, he told Sky Sport on Monday.
The former Italy international, capped 25 times, joined Sampdoria in February after 18 months at Torino. He previously had a one-year spell at the club in 2006-07.
"I hope, first of all, to extend my contract with Sampdoria because it expires in June ... I don't think that there should be problems for the renewal," the 33-year-old said.
"For superstition though I will not say the words 'end of career' because in the past I have changed many shirts," he added.
Quagliarella, who spent four years with Juventus from 2010-14, has scored 100 goals in Italy's top division.

A popular video game chat service with over 25 million users announced today that it had shut down "a number of accounts" following violence instigated by white supremacists over the weekend. Discord, the service "which lets users chat with voice and text, was being used by proponents of Nazi ideology both before and after the attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia," reports The Verge. "We will continue to take action against Nazi ideology, and all forms of hate," the company said in a tweet . From the report:

Charlottesville, Va. — Clergy in robes. A woman handing out flowers. Black Lives Matter activists. Armed militia members. Students. Angry anti-fascist protesters.
The diverse group of people who came to oppose a weekend gathering of white nationalists in this Virginia college town seemed to outnumber the rally-goers. The counter-protesting groups didn't organize collectively. Instead, it was a largely organic effort among groups who shared the same mission: showing that hate wasn't welcome.
“They just wanted to come out and say no. They wanted to come out and show a robust love for community and what America is meant to stand for,” said Lisa Woolfork, a University of Virginia professor and 17-year Charlottesville resident. “And I find that very heartening, very encouraging.”
Officials have not provided a crowd estimate, but there appeared to be at least 500 people supporting the rally sparked by Charlottesville's decision to remove a Confederate monument. At least twice as many appeared to be there to oppose them.
The violence between the groups erupted well before the event was supposed to start.
Neo-Nazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members other white supremacists made their way to the park at the same time as counter-protesters, and the two sides clashed. People threw punches, screamed, set off smoke bombs, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Some came prepared for a fight, with body armor and helmets. Others darted around, trying to avoid the chaos.
“I've never seen that kind of hatred up front. It was pretty raw, pretty coarse,” scholar and activist Cornel West, one of the most high-profile counter-protesters, told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday.
There were pockets of peaceful resistance, too. One woman quietly handed out flowers. A group stood in a circle, hands uplifted, singing hymns. One man toted a tuba.
Volunteer medics bobbed in and out of the fray, helping people who had been sprayed with chemicals, and others passed out water and snacks.
Walt Heinecke, another University of Virginia professor, obtained city permits for events in two nearby parks, and counter-protesters used the sites as a place of respite.
Heinecke said he was surprised to see members of an armed leftist group who stationed themselves nearby, providing protection for people there.
Meanwhile, many of the rally attendees stood behind barriers officials had put up, waiting for the event to get underway. But the speakers never got the chance.
As the chaos grew, authorities declared it an unlawful assembly and forced the crowd to disperse. The rally leaders, including organizer Jason Kessler — a local right-wing blogger and activist — urged supporters to go home.
Kessler blamed the violence on police, saying they didn't do enough to maintain order and protect his group's right to free speech.
About two hours later, pockets of counter-protesters who had been marching through town converged on a downtown street. Hundreds were streaming along, cheering, and waving flags.
“There was a real feeling like we had driven them out of the town,” said Ross Mittiga, a UVA researcher who recently ran an unsuccessful campaign for the state House of Delegates.
That was quickly shattered when a car plowed into the crowd, hurling people into the air. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed and 19 others were injured. Just hours later, a state police helicopter that had been deployed as part of the response crashed in a field outside of town, killing two.
In blog posts after the violence, the Daily Stormer, a leading white nationalist website that promoted the Charlottesville event, pledged to hold more events “soon.”
Opponents said they'd be ready.
“We have got to keep fighting, keep the love in it, keep sacrificing for justice,” West said. “We have no choice at this point.”

TORONTO (Reuters) - The heads of a joint bid from the United States, Mexico and Canada to host the 2026 World Cup trumpeted a winning plan on Saturday that technically ticks most if not all the boxes FIFA wants, but could miss the mark when it comes to winning friends.

On the surface the fight to stage the expanded 2026 tournament, the first to involve 48 nations, would appear a David and Goliath struggle with Morocco, the only other bidder, up against the commercial and organisational might of the North and Central Americans.
Already possessing all the necessary infrastructure and stadiums to host a massive 48-team tournament, United 2026 executive director John Kristick boasted the bid was able to “focus on building the game not stadiums”.
While the United 2026 bid may be technically impressive, it comes at a time when the United States' globally popularity is on the decline.
Bids must be submitted to FIFA by March 16 and the awarding announcement set for June 13 in Moscow before the Russian World Cup leaves little time to mend strained relationships.
United 2026 bid members conceded their efforts have not been helped by the sight of disgraced FIFA officials being paraded in front of U.S. judges on corruption charges almost daily and the escalation of tensions in the Arab world over President Donald Trump's decision last week to move their embassy to Jerusalem.
“These issues down the road people are certainly going to be confronted with (them),” John Kristick, executive director of United 2026, said ahead of Major League Soccer's championship game on Saturday.
“But they (FIFA) are going to have to make a decision of what is in the best interest of football, what's in the best interest of the World Cup and as long as our bid gets delivered the way I think it will, we will be OK.”
If the United 2026 officials need to understand how important good relationships are, they need look no further than efforts to host an Olympic game in the U.S.
After stunning rebukes to New York to host the 2012 Olympics and Chicago's failed bid for the 2016 Games, the United States Olympic Committee spent years repairing fences and were finally rewarded for their efforts earlier this year with Los Angeles landing the 2028 summer Games.
“An important part of what we are doing has got very little to do with the sport frankly, it's a lot to do with the countries and given what is going on in the world we have always had a special relationship with these two federations,” said Sunil Gulati, head of the U.S. Soccer Federation.
“The countries have been partners and there are some ongoing discussions that everybody in the room is familiar with about that so hopefully the message this sends about relationships and international relationships is extraordinarily important.”
COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES
One thing that could help smooth over rocky relationships is the commercial viability of the United 2026 plan which could help replenish FIFA coffers.
“We believe between the size of stadiums, which obviously impacts attendance, the level of hospitality available at stadiums that affects revenue and the commercial opportunities that will be available to FIFA, this will be by far the most successful financial World Cup and this is probably a pretty good time for that to happen for FIFA,” said Gulati.
“It is part of the score card FIFA looks at... it's not lost on us and we will make sure it is not lost on 207 voters, many of them whom rely on FIFA for their financial stability.”
A woman and her two children were injured allegedly in an acid attack in the limits of Chuhng police on Friday. College teacher Aneela, her 12-year-old daughter Ayesha, and eight-year-old son Salman were rushed to Jinnah Hospital with minor injuries on their faces and eyes in the afternoon. The woman told the police that her ex-husband Afzaal threw acid on them when the family was travelling on a car. She said Afzaal had a dispute with her over property. Hospital sources said all the three victims were discharged from the emergency ward after being provided initial medical treatment. Police say they were investigating the incident. –Staff Reporter
Defense, defense, defense.
If there were ever a question which group leads this Broncos team for the last four years, it's been answered time and time again. On Sunday, the defense put together arguably their most dominant performance ever, shutting out the New York Jets 23-0 and holding them under 100 yards. It was the first time in seven years that happened in a game in the entire NFL — talk about dominant.
So, we have to highlight three defenders that stood out for Denver. Stats and grades provided courtesy of Pro Football Focus:
1. Von Miller, 85.9 overall grade
Miller enjoyed four tackles, two tackles for losses, a sack and a QB hit as he continued to prove he's a once-in-a-generation defender. He also enjoyed two hurries, which helped push his pass-rush grade to an 81.3. His three tackles outside the sack were run stops on only 21 run snaps — Miller shows week-in, week-out he can't be stopped in either facet of the game.
2. Brandon Marshall, 94.7 run defense grade
Marshall played one of his best games of the year — he led the team with seven total tackles (including three tackles for losses) and a sack. His 94.7 run defense grade was out of this world good, even if he did struggle in pass coverage. That's been the reality for Marshall, who's proven to be a stout run-stopper and a bit deficient in the pass defense game.
3. Zach Kerr, 86.0 overall grade
Kerr had one tackle and one pass defended, but that doesn't explain his entire game. He was graded out as an 84.7 in the pass-rush department, which was great for him, although he didn't register a hurry because of quick passes. He did, however, beat multiple offensive linemen of the Jets and did bat one ball away.
Not everyone who stood out made this week's list (shout out to Shelby Harris), but that's because the Broncos continue to be one of the deepest teams in the league on defense.
The BC Lions crashed an aquafit class in Kamloops this week
If you like their moves on the field you'll be delighted with what they bring to the pool.
The BC Lions held their annual training camp in Kamloops this past week, but what was different about this year was an impromptu team workout session.
The football players piled into the pool at the Canadian Games Aquatic Centre for a little aquafit workout.
Several members of the Lions were filmed splashing about after taking a break from their training at Hillside Stadium.
Players also invited members of the public to attend their club's 2018 FanFest, last weekend, where those big and small had a chance to watch a practice and meet the Lions.
The team will be in Kamloops until June 7 for training.

Utah has hired Eastern Washington co-offensive coordinator Troy Taylor as its new offensive coordinator, the school announced Monday.
Taylor spent one season at the FCS school after a four-year run at Folsom High in Northern California, where he engineered some of the most prolific offenses in high school football history.
"I have watched Troy Taylor closely over the years when he was coaching innovative high school offenses in California and was eager to see how that translated to college coaching. He achieved the same results at Eastern Washington and we are fortunate that Troy was interested in bringing that style of offense here to Utah," Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said in a statement. "Troy has trained a prolific number of record-setting quarterbacks in high school, at his academy and now in college."

Taylor was the play-caller in his lone season at EWU and the Eagles ranked No. 2 nationally in total offense (529.6 yards per game) and No. 3 in scoring (42.4 points per game). The Eagles' 45 points in their win against Washington State to open the season was tied with Washington for the most points the Cougars, who went 7-2 in the Pac-12, allowed all season.
"We will have an attacking style of offense that stretches the field and the defense in every way," Taylor said in a statement. "Creating success for the quarterback will be our utmost priority. If your QB plays well, you have a great chance of winning. Therefore, the development of his fundamentals and skill set are vital."
Taylor played quarterback at Cal from 1986-89, where he finished as the school's all-time leading passer. He later served as a graduate assistant at Colorado (1995) and as an assistant coach at Cal from 1996-99 before spending the next decade-plus in the high school ranks.
From 2012-15, Folsom went 58-3 and won the California Division I state bowl game in 2014. Among the players he coached was Washington quarterback Jake Browning, who was the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year this season. In his final high school season, Browning threw a national-record 91 touchdown passes.

Q: I am the second owner of a 2003 Ford Explorer. The first owner was a little old lady who drove it only on weekends. Seriously, she said she was a geologist who went into the Colorado wilderness to collect rock and soil samples. She took good care of the car, which is why I have had it longer than any I have previously owned.
It has been a great vehicle for six years, but I have noticed a distinct loss of highway mpg in the past eight months: Where I once eked out 20 mpg, it seems the best I can do now is just short of 16.
One service representative suggested a fuel line problem and put a new filter and some kind of “booster” in the line, but it didn't seem to help. I don't want to sell or trade it, and it's too old to be worth much.
Will you name some possible causes, solutions and costs? Thanks.
— STEVE
A: Well, let's go from least expensive to most expensive, Steve, so you'll be completely depressed by the time you finish reading this.
The least expensive possibility is that you've lost compression in your cylinders. You may have had 150 pounds of pressure in each cylinder six years ago, and now, through wear and tear, you're down to 110. That would require an engine rebuild to fix. But since this is a 2003 Explorer, you're not going to bother rebuilding the engine, so this is going to cost you nothing. You'll just keep driving and fill up more often.
Also cheap would be a slipping transmission, because again, you wouldn't bother fixing that either.
The next-most-expensive possibility is really low tire pressure. If that's what's causing your low mileage, that'll cost you a handful of quarters at the gas station air pump. That'd be pretty good, huh?
Next on the list, and it may be the most likely, is a bad thermostat. If the thermostat is stuck open or partially open, the engine is never getting to full operating temperature, where it operates most efficiently. That could explain a 20 percent drop in mileage, especially in the winter. Getting the thermostat replaced is going to cost you about $75.
Continuing upscale, you could have a sticking brake caliper. You can imagine that driving around with your brakes on all the time will take a bite out of your gas mileage. That might cost you a few hundred bucks to fix.
You also could have a partially plugged up catalytic converter, or an obstruction in your muffler or some other part of your exhaust system. A muffler is a few hundred bucks; a converter probably is $500 or more.
Finally, there's one problem whose fix could actually earn you money: You could have a teenage son who's stealing a gallon here and a gallon there to go out and drive around with his friends.
If that's the cause of your diminished mileage, you can punish him by not paying for his cellphone anymore. That'll net you at least $50 a month, Steve. Good luck.
There they were on a late November afternoon, seemingly headed in opposite directions: Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers were 4-6 and losers of four games in a row; Kirk Cousins and the Washington Redskins were 6-3-1 and winners of six of eight.
Right after the Packers were beaten by the Redskins by 18 points in Week 11, Rodgers insisted, bereft of much supporting evidence, “I'm very optimistic.”
Turned out he knew what he was talking about.
And Cousins declared, “It's great to be playing the way we're playing.”
Turned out it didn't last.
Since then? The Packers (10-6) reeled off six consecutive victories, with Rodgers throwing 15 TD passes and zero interceptions, capped by a 31-24 win at the Detroit Lions on Sunday night to win the NFC North. The Redskins (8-7-1) lost four of their last six games, capped by an inexplicably listless 19-10 defeat against the visiting, nothing-at-stake-for-them New York Giants to blow a playoff berth.
“Just have to find a way to get it done. That's what good teams do,” Washington defensive end Chris Baker said in a quiet locker room. “We just weren't good enough this year.”
With so much at stake, the Redskins were flat as can be against the Giants, who already were locked into the NFC's No. 5 seed. Washington looked like the team with nothing to play for, trailing 10-0 at halftime. After tying it at 10-all, then falling behind 13-10, the Redskins let their last real chance slip away when Cousins was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie for the second time.
“I'm going to go into this offseason with a hunger that has always been there,” Cousins vowed after throwing two picks against New York, “but certainly, when the season ends this way, it will be there and it will be strong.”
The playoffs begin next weekend without the Redskins:
— Saturday: Raiders at Texans, Lions at Seahawks.
— Sunday: Dolphins at Steelers, Giants at Packers.
Awaiting the winners of those games will be the top seeds: No. 1 Patriots and No. 2 Chiefs in the AFC, No. 1 Cowboys and No. 2 Falcons in the NFC.
In case you missed it, here are the other top topics after the NFL season's last regular-season Sunday:
MVP?
Rodgers could wind up as the MVP, as could Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott or Falcons QB Matt Ryan. But given that the main story line heading into the season involved Tom Brady's four-game “Deflategate” suspension, it somehow would be fitting for him to wind up with the honor. He finished off the best TD-INT rate for a season in NFL history — 28-2 — as the Patriots (14-2) beat Miami 35-14 . Plus, Brady tied Peyton Manning's career record of 51 games with three or more touchdown passes and zero interceptions.
SEE YA
More coaches on the way out: Chip Kelly (San Francisco) and Mike McCoy (San Diego) were fired, while Gary Kubiak resigned because of health concerns one year after leading Denver to a Super Bowl championship. Adds those openings to earlier exits of Jeff Fisher in Los Angeles, Gus Bradley in Jacksonville, and Rex Ryan in Buffalo.
ROMO RETURNS
Playing in the regular season for the first time in more than a year, Tony Romo threw a TD pass in limited duty in place of the man who replaced him as Dallas' QB, Dak Prescott. The Cowboys lost 27-13 to the Eagles in a completely meaningless game, while Romo got a brief chance to show he could help in the postseason if needed.
QB TROUBLE
Could be quite a quarterback matchup when Oakland plays at Houston in the playoffs. That's because the Raiders, already without Derek Carr because of a broken leg, saw backup Matt McGloin hurt his shoulder injury in Sunday's 24-6 loss at the Broncos, leaving rookie Connor Cook — he of zero NFL starts — under center. And the Texans, who recently benched expensive free agent Brock Osweiler for Tom Savage, aren't sure which will play next week. Savage started Houston's 24-17 loss at Tennessee, left to be evaluated for a concussion after a QB sneak, returned after being cleared, then was held out again in the second half.

There are two ways looking at January.
For the 'glass half-full' people out there, it's a time of fresh resolve, embarking on new endeavours and optimistic re-evaluation.
For the rest of us, it's just layer upon layer of misery.
Our bodies feel the strain of December's booze and chocolate diet , tumbleweeds blow through our bank accounts and there's ages ago till it's light again in the mornings and our vitamin D levels can regenerate.
To add to these stale and disappointing layers is another - the most depressing day of the year.
And it's coming soon.
The previous month may be home to the day you're most likely to be dumped ( December 11 , in case you were wondering), but January contains the most depressing day of the year.

Unsurprisingly, it's a Monday.
The official date for your diary is apparently Monday 16 January.
Book it off work, grab your duvet and hunker down with uplifting Disney classics and a tub of Ben & Jerry's.
So what is it?
Admittedly there's no strict science behind this discovery - although Blue Monday is acknowledged every year.
Instead, what we do have (according to the Metro ) is the word of life coach and happiness consultant, Cliff Arnall.
(Photo: Rex)
Cliff has published a formula stating how factors such as the weather, debt, the amount of time elapsed since Christmas AND since we failed at our New Year's Resolutions as well a general feeling of low motivation are all contributors to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.
Like we say, it may be a day cry quietly into a tub of something with a high sugar and fat content .
What a difference a couple of years can make.
Not long ago, the Harper government was quite clear that they had no intention of legalizing marijuana, and most provincial governments were totally onside with avoiding any kind of debate on such a touchy subject.
But, that was then, and now, have things ever changed.
The Trudeau government has set a course for legalization, which is overwhelmingly supported by public opinion, and support for the pot industry is coming from some unlikely sources.

A couple of former cabinet ministers in the Harper government, who publicly opposed legalization, have now invested in marijuana supply companies and the moral debate about legalization is becoming a distant memory.
To be clear, there is still a huge debate about pot, but it's switched from the moral debate about legalization to the much more pragmatic discussion about who gets the money.
Finance ministers from across the country are meeting this week to implore the federal government to give the provinces a greater share of the revenue from the soon-to-be-created marijuana industry in Canada.
It's a surreal scenario for a lot of people; government ministers arguing about who gets the proceeds from marijuana sales.
How things have changed. I guess you could say that this joint meeting of finance ministers is a potluck affair.

In 2008 I had the privilege to travel to Istanbul to check out the tech scene. I'd arranged a tech startups meet-up with Arda Kutsal, a local blogger who'd started Webrazzi, a tech blog. I landed at the airport and caught a taxi to the hotel we'd agreed to meet at, thinking the meet-up would be in the bar. “No sir,” said the lady on reception, “your event is in the ballroom”. So, I trundled by carry-on luggage down the hall until I opened a huge door, only to find around 800 people listening to speeches. From the stage, Arda pointed to me said “Welcome Mike!” into the microphone, whereupon the whole ballroom swung around to see me standing there with my luggage.
Now, I'm telling you this story not merely to reminisce, but to illustrate how hungry the tech scene in Turkey was to develop. And develop it did. l
In the intervening years Webrazzi has grown to become, ‘effectively' the TechCrunch of Turkey, operating its own conferences, while others have sprung up. Turkish startups like Trendyol appeared, started by Demet Mutlo, one of the many taking advantages of Turkey's booming economy. With a population of 80 million, most of them under 30, Turkey looked like it had a bright future. Even as the dark clouds of political unrest started to appear a few years ago, those seemed like a side-show to the wider boom that was taking place.
But when riot police started brutally evicting protesters from the last central city park not to be taken over by yet another shopping mall linked to the ruling elite, the overall signs were not good.
And so, to the present. President Erdoğan has declared victory in Turkey's historic referendum on a new constitution that will turn the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential one. But unlike in the US, the president will be handed sweeping powers, with few checks and balances. Turkey, it seems, is suddenly going backwards.
Just as with Brexit, the referendum has divided the country right down the middle. And in sophisticated, urbanite Istanbul, the people there dismissed what they saw as a grab for power by the President.
Barring an unforeseen and unlikely challenge, Erdoğan will now be in power until 2029 — longer than Kemal Ataturk, the nation's founder. Since last year's coup attempt, he has cast his opponents as terrorists, jailed opposition leaders and journalists, dominated the airwaves and shut down almost all opposition media.
He will now have to win an election in 2019 to acquire these new executive powers, so everything is at stake for him, and Turkey isn't about to get any calmer. As David L. Phillips, of the Institute for the Study of Human Rights at Columbia University, says: “Turkey's western orientation is finished.”
So where does this leave Turkey's tech startup industry?
The major concerns are two-fold: what will venture capital do and will the talent stay?
A significant global investor told me off the record that he thinks this will play out as “a Russia story.” The referendum result, he says, adds a significant risk factor for foreign capital going into the country, when there will be uncertainty around property rights and exit opportunities. Russia has had its entrepreneurial successes, but there was always a massive political overhang. That scenario is now far more likely in Turkey.
Depending on what companies are concerned, you might of course be able to minimise exposure to the political environment. Some might even benefit from the situation, as Yandex did in Russia, which effectively ‘played ball' with the Putin-controlled Kremlin.
So far, investors are playing it cool.
Cem Sertoglu of Early Bird Capital commented to me: “Interest from non-committed VCs has been very low recently, so I can't imagine this getting worse. Local Turkish startups continue to grow with the massive market opportunity. I don't think the referendum will play a big part. Talent wars are global these days, and those at the high-end have global demand.”
Oddly enough the referendum may make Turkish startups think more globally. Those that want to will start finding ways of finding an exit route through moving their HQ to the EU or US and keeping their engineering base in the country.
And Turkish entrepreneurs and investors are used to instability and political uncertainty.
Journalist, author and Turkey expert Elmira Bayrasli says: “If there is any hope left in Turkey, it is among the entrepreneurs and startups. The good news is that Turkish entrepreneurs are used to this. The challenge is the unpredictability of the government. It has to focus on the economy now — but I fear it won't. It's a rough, rough road ahead. But startups will continue… In the short term capital won't go in. If the political situation manages to stabilize – and the state of emergency is lifted, investors might come back, but with weariness.”
My old friend Arda Kutsal says: “As long as there are good startups, VCs will keep an eye on Turkey. Last week iyzico, a Turkish fintech startup closed $15M funding from foreign investors. I believe investors don't care about politics as long as there is a good business potential. The good thing is, the referendum is now over. There is no ‘uncertainty' anymore. So, I guess as everyday business gets back to normal in Turkey, foreign investors' interest will increase in the short term.”
Demet Mutlu, foundef of Trendyol says: “Turkey is still a massive market opportunity, with 50% of the population under 30. Good startups will continue to do well, and scale, weak ones might have more challenge for funding.”
But, given Erdoğan will now effectively fight another campaign for the election to come in the next 2 years, it hardly seems like the atmosphere is going to become less shrill.
The bigger risk to Turkey's tech future is from the flight of talent. The problems come when the engineers and entrepreneurs themselves want to leave.
Reliable sources attest to this already happening and the pace is likely to quicken, at least for those 48% of the population that don't support Erdoğan, so divided has the country become.
Turkish entrepreneur Honor Gunday tells me: “You should see the number of applicants to our European offices from Turkish candidates. The most snobbish, qualified high wage earning candidates are now looking for an escape. It is sad.”
Corporates have also left. Hipster hotel chain Mama Shelter has already shut down their brand-new hotel; Citibank exited two years ago and HSBC stopped half of its business. Paypal and Skrill had to leave due to new regulation. Booking.com was banned last week.
Turkey can of course try to fall back on is its momentum as a nexus between Europe and the East, as it always has throughout history. But despite a stable lira, the macro economic outlook does not look great. Tourism makes up 14% of the Turkish economy and it's already plummet by 8% this year. Turkish Airlines is not doing well, Turkish construction companies are banned in Russia. The list goes on.
The world of tech is likely to find Turkey blowing hot and cold. Erdoğan will probably get around to cutting off Twitter and YouTube as he has done sporadically already. And he will find it much easier to do now.
Burak Buyukdemir, cofounder of founder Startups Istanbul, says: “There are good and bad scenarios. Good one is we will grow like South Korea did in the 1960's the other bad scenario is we will stick with inner politics & next elections which will trigger more brain drain. Capitalist economy always looks for the opportunities. Risk versus returns. Turkey will be always a great market for investing. Our risk premium may increase but still be attractive country to invest.”
The country could of course promote startup culture to try to attract inward investment. But does Erdoğan remind you of a tech-friendly Obama?
Not really.
Episode 78 of BevNET's Taste Radio podcast features a conversation with Chris Hunter, the co-founder of plant-based protein drink brand Koia. Hunter is also a co-founder of Phusion Projects, the Chicago-based alcoholic beverage company best known as the maker of controversial malternative Four Loko. In our interview, recorded at Natural Products Expo East 2017, Hunter discussed the remarkable rise (and notorious reputation) of Four Loko and explained why a focus on branding and merchandising led to its success.
Hunter also explained his interest in the natural food and beverage industry, calling it “the most exciting space out there.” He discussed his role in reframing and re-positioning Koia as a brand, and expressed a belief that entrepreneurs should look to align themselves with experienced, value-added investors and advisors.
Also included in this episode: A discussion with Project NOSH senior staff reporter Meagan McGinnes about the FDA's new health claim guideline regarding peanut allergies and how food brands are reacting, innovating and commercializing as a result. We chat with the folks behind Shackleton Whisky, a brand inspired by famed explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.

The Sierra Nevada Conservancy Governing Board approved $3.1 million in grants for ten projects that will decrease wildfire risk, lessen tree mortality, and restore forest and watershed health in the Sierra Nevada region. Funding for these projects comes from Proposition 1, The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. This is the fifth set of awards made under the SNC's Proposition 1 grant program.
In addition to meeting the requirements of Proposition 1, the projects awarded support the goals and objectives of the Sierra Nevada Watershed Improvement Program, a large‑scale restoration program designed to address ecosystem health in the Sierra Nevada. This program is being coordinated by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy and the U.S. Forest Service, and is working to increase the pace and scale of restoration across the Sierra by increasing funding, addressing policy barriers, and increasing infrastructure needed to support restoration.
Sierra Nevada forests are facing a variety of challenges, and the need to increase the pace and scale of restoration across the Sierra Nevada region is more urgent than ever. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 102 million trees have died statewide since 2010. Ninety-five percent of those dead trees are in the Sierra Nevada region.
“Sierra forests are the source of more than sixty percent of California's developed water supply, but these forests have experienced rapid and significant change,” says Jim Branham, Executive Officer for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. “The grants that were awarded by our board today are great examples of the kind of work we need to be encouraging across the entire Sierra to protect the source of California's water.”
“It is important that we invest in projects like these through the Sierra Nevada Watershed Improvement Program because they help make our forests more resilient to insects, drought, large, damaging wildfires, and disease,” says Randy Moore, U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Regional Forester.
The projects approved for funding include:
•El Dorado County – Caples Creek Watershed Ecological Restoration Project, $476,709
This grant to the El Dorado Irrigation District will complete forest management and restoration activities on 6,800 acres within the larger South Fork American River Watershed, which is the primary water supply for more than 110,000 people and businesses served by the EID. Project work will include prescribed fire, meadow restoration, and aspen enhancement, and will be implemented in partnership with the USFS, Eldorado National Forest over a four-year period.
•Lassen County – Lassen Creek Watershed Restoration Project, $250,000
This grant to the Honey Lake Valley Resource Conservation District will complete mechanical harvesting of small trees, hand thinning, pruning, mastication, and slash disposal on 250 acres across two privately owned properties located just north of the Lassen National Forest and within the Wildland-Urban Interface zone for the City of Susanville. This work is part of a larger 325-acre project, and will enhance past Honey Lake Valley RCD projects and projects that are planned or underway by the Lassen National Forest and Lassen County Fire Safe Council. Lassen Creek, the main drainage within this watershed and located within the project boundary, is a tributary to the Susan River, an important supply of agricultural water that drains into the 7,667-acre Honey Lake Wildlife Area wetland.
•Madera County – Eastern Madera Wildfire Restoration Project, $488,320
This grant to the Yosemite-Sequoia Resource Conservation and Development Council will complete high-priority conifer reforestation on 350 acres burned in the 2014 French Fire in Madera County. Activities will include removal of fire-killed trees, piling or burning of dead standing trees, and herbicide treatments on 225 acres. Following completion of this work, 350 acres will be replanted in accordance with U.S. Forest Service Region 5 guidelines. Reforestation will improve watershed conditions by restoring severely burned areas to forested conditions, thereby reducing sedimentation and turbidity within the headwaters and improving water quality for downstream users. This is a joint project between the Yosemite Sequoia Resource Conservation and Development Council and the Sierra National Forest Bass Lake Ranger District, has been identified as a Sierra National Forest priority, and is associated with a number of collaborative efforts including the Sustainable Forests and Communities Collaborative and Willow Creek Landscape Assessment.
•Mariposa County – Gentry Creek Watershed Restoration Project, $498,985
This grant to the Yosemite-Sequoia Resource Conservation and Development Council will treat approximately 300 acres of mixed-conifer timberland owned by 23 separate property owners, and is surrounded by U.S. Forest Service- and Bureau of Land Management-managed lands. The project area has suffered 80 percent visible bark beetle mortality, a figure that is expected to rise to 90 percent by 2017. The project will fall and remove all dead trees, and remaining slash will be masticated and spread on the forest floor. These activities will return the project area, which serves as the headwaters for Gentry Creek, a major tributary of the North Fork of the Merced River, to functional forestland that will aid in the protection of the downstream water supply.
•Nevada County – Rice's Crossing Preserve Nonindustrial Timber Management Planning Project, $74,550
This grant to the Bear Yuba Land Trust will complete a Nonindustrial Timber Management Plan for a 2,000-acre portion of the Rice's Crossing Preserve, a 2,706 acre property owned by the Bear Yuba Land Trust. This project will guide future management actions that will reduce the threat of high-intensity wildfires, promote resilient and growing forests, and reduce the threat of watershed damage from erosion and large-scale tree mortality. The Preserve is located within both the North and Middle Yuba River watersheds, which eventually feed into the Feather River and eventually the Sacramento River to the Delta.
•Placer County – Post-Fire Restoration in the Rubicon Watershed, $359,838
This grant to the Placer County Resource Conservation District will remove fire-killed trees and brush, restore approximately five acres of timber landings, and stabilize watershed slopes along a 13-mile stretch of the Rubicon River drainage between Hellhole Reservoir and the Placer County Water Agency facilities at Ralston Afterbay. The entire project area burned at high severity in the 2014 King Fire. The project will be completed in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service and a private landowner on 208.5 acres.
•Plumas County – Genesee Valley Watershed Improvement Project, $74,576
This grant to the Plumas Audubon Society will complete wildlife and botanical surveys, a cultural resource inventory, and soils and hydrological analyses that will support the completion of environmental documentation on 618 acres on the Plumas National Forest and 221 acres on the privately owned Heart K Ranch. The work completed under this grant will support the next phase of forest thinning and underburning, which will incorporate Traditional Ecological Knowledge recommendations from the local Maidu people. Both properties are identified as priority project areas in the recently completed Genesee Valley Wildfire Restoration Plan. The project location is within Genesee Valley on Indian Creek, a significant tributary to the north fork of the Feather River.
•Plumas County – Tásmam Kojóm Restoration Management Plan, $73,312
This grant to the Maidu Summit Consortium and Conservancy will help complete an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to support future implementation of the Tásmam Kojóm Land Management Plan on Tásmam Kojóm, a 2,326-acre parcel that includes a meadow, streams, springs, and overstocked mixed conifer forest, and is a culturally important place to the Mountain Maidu.
•Sierra and Nevada Counties – Forest Health and Watershed Improvement through Noxious Weed Management, $362,538: This grant to the Truckee River Watershed Council will survey 18,000 acres for high-priority noxious weeds, remove infestations of weeds on 1,500 acres, and revegetate native grasses, forbs, and shrubs on 450 acres on U.S. Forest Service- and California Department of Fish and Wildlife-managed lands in Sierra and Nevada counties. The project area was designated as high-priority due to the habitat values and threat from potential wildfire to the municipal water supply at Prosser, Boca, and Stampede Reservoirs.
•Tuolumne County – The Lyons-South Fork Watershed Forest Resiliency Project, $496,000: This grant to the Tuolumne Utilities District will complete forest thinning and fuel reduction treatments on 200 acres within the Stanislaus National Forest in Tuolumne County. These treatments will enhance forest health and resiliency, reduce fire hazards, allow for this forest to better withstand ongoing drought and bark beetle attacks, and protect critical ditch and flume infrastructure which act as the primary drinking water conveyance system for 90 percent of the residents of Tuolumne County. This grant will complete a portion of a larger project covering 733 acres of forestland across multiple landowners within the South Fork of the Stanislaus River watershed.
To date, the Sierra Nevada Conservancy has funded 32 Proposition 1 projects totaling $9,881,830 that support the restoration goals of the Sierra Nevada Watershed Improvement Program.
Created in 2004, the Sierra Nevada Conservancy is a state agency whose mission is to improve the environmental, economic, and social wellbeing of the Sierra Nevada Region. The SNC has awarded nearly $60 million in grants for projects that protect and enhance the health of California's primary watersheds by improving forest health, remediating mercury contamination from abandoned mines, protecting critical natural resources, and reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Funding for these projects came from Proposition 84 passed by voters in 2006 and Proposition 1 passed by voters in 2014.
Gwen Stefani is setting big goals for 2017. With her romance with Blake Shelton stronger than ever, the No Doubt alum wants to expand her family in the New Year. Will they have kids before the wedding? Celeb Dirty Laundry is reporting that Stefani wants to get pregnant soon. Not only is Stefani pressuring Shelton to tie the knot, but she's also urging him to start a family. Stefani is rushing the process because she is tired of how the media portrays their romance and believes they have been dating long enough. For now, Stefani is reportedly waiting for Shelton to pop the big question. Unfortunately, sources close to the country crooner revealed that Shelton isn't in a hurry to get hitched. Instead, Shelton likes the ways things have been going and enjoys spending time with Stefani and her three boys, Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo. Gwen Stefani with Zuma (L) and Kingston (R). [Image by Rich Polk/Getty Images] With Shelton content, Stefani might have to wait a bit longer for a wedding. After all, they are both only a year out from getting divorces, so it's understandable that they would take things slowly. Of course, Shelton and Stefani have been dating for over a year and things are looking very good. According to Enstarz, Shelton is struggling to win over Stefani's boys. The country star has been spending a lot of time with the kids over the holidays, but inside source claims that they blame him for their mom's divorce. Despite the bad blood, Gwen Stefani has been doing her best to get the boys to like Shelton. This past Christmas, People revealed that Stefani invited Shelton over for a private music show with two of his friends. The singer shared the heartwarming Christmas tunes with fans on social media. The video features Shelton singing holiday hits such as “Holly Jolly Christmas.” Along with the three boys, Stefani's dad, Dennis, watched the show. The kids were seen in the video wearing matching red flannel shirts, Shelton's favorite style. After spending Christmas Eve with Shelton, the three boys headed over to their father's home to spend Christmas Day. Gavin Rossdale shared a photo of the festivities on social media, which included a pic of the boys sitting on Santa's lap. “MERRY XMAS EVERYONE,” he wrote alongside the image. Based on Shelton's interactions with the kids, it doesn't look like he is having any problems getting them to like him. Although there's no telling what is going on behind the scenes, it appears as though Shelton is on the right track to becoming a great step-father. But does that mean he's ready to start a family of his own? Gwen Stefani And Blake Shelton talk to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo at a state dinner for Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi [Image by Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images] On whether or not Stefani wants to have another baby, Gossip Cop is reporting that the pregnancy rumors are not true. Sources revealed that Stefani wanted to have more babies because of her age. She also thinks the wedding could happen at a later date. “Gwen knows that, with her age, time is ticking and a baby should come first — they can marry whenever. Blake agrees,” an insider shared, adding that Stefani is “already undergoing IVF” and has started picking out baby names. The source even stated that Stefani's boys “won't stop talking about how they are going to be big brothers. They keep begging Mom to have the baby already.” This isn't the first time Stefani has fought pregnancy rumors. Back in October, similar reports surfaced that she was pregnant and ready to wed. It's now January and neither of those things have happened. Instead, the couple seems to be enjoying their time together and making the most out of their heated romance. Tell us! Do you think Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani will expand their family before they wed? Let us know in the comments below. [Featured Image by Larry Busacca/Getty Images]

Learning can come from books. And then there's the internet, and phone apps, and podcasts, and this, and that, and the other thing. But all those genuinely wonderful ways to increase one's knowledge are pretty much second nature to today's teenagers.
To learn in a new way, teens may want to try embracing a few old ways.
Their grandparents (and other folks of their generation) remember what life was like before Google and YouTube. And most know how to cook without a microwave, manage a budget and drive a car with a manual transmission. (If your teens can learn those last three things, they'll be in better shape than most 30-year-olds.)
While helping teens master standardized tests over the past two decades, I've seen how they increasingly rely on technology to learn. It's time to switch things up. Here are five valuable skills for college — and for life — that teens can learn by spending some quality time with their elders.
Storytelling: For college admission, your high schooler will need to write an essay. An essay is a story, and a teen's grandparents, or grandparents of one of their friends, will have many of them. Encourage your teen to talk with them, learn about your family and learn how to tell a story. Teens should pay attention to the start of the story, what details are included, what reactions they feel and whether the storyteller offered any facts or strong opinions during the telling. Those same skills can be used when writing an essay on a standardized test or a class final.
Formality: We live in a casual world, and it's getting more and more laid back by the day. There are still plenty of folks who once lived in a time of decorum when women wore hats and gloves when out and people communicated by writing letters. Encourage your teen to ask their grandparents to share letters they've written and received, and to ask what practices were standard. For instance, when writing an old-fashioned letter, salutations were important, especially in professional settings. One addressed a doctor, professor or prospective employer, "Dear Dr. Winward," rather than "Hey Jennifer." Teens should use these respectful salutations when asking for a letter of recommendation, when thanking someone for an interview, or when communicating with a professor, teacher or adviser.
The personal touch: Technology can have an isolating effect. Encourage teens to learn about how people interacted before smartphones. They can ask their grandparents about how they stayed in touch with friends. Grandparents will probably describe greeting people with smiles and eye contact and planning get-togethers.
Good penmanship: Writing by hand — and ensuring it is legible — takes concentration, practice and patience. Those are all important skills to hone. Plus, research indicates writing in cursive is still an important skill. When writing in cursive, students activate different parts of their brains, ones not typically developed by basic reading and writing, and they refine their fine motor skills. Despite the rumours of cursive's imminent demise, this skill gives students an advantage in reading and spelling, perhaps due to the feedback from writing words as a whole instead of as individual letters through texting or typing.
Preserving a family history: Consider all the knowledge grandparents have to impart: their personal histories, their tastes in music, their thoughts on the world events they witnessed. Have your teen speak to them, record the conversations and make it personal. How did they perceive life-changing elections, wars and accomplishments that young people today can only read about? What was it like to see a person walk on the moon for the first time? Where were they when they heard President John F. Kennedy had been shot? What was it like to fly in an airplane for the first time? They can chat about whatever comes to mind. Maybe have your teen record a video or a series of audio recordings, or perhaps even start his or her own podcast. Your teen's future self — and maybe even future generations — will thank you.
In short, technology is a wonderful thing, no doubt, and it can absolutely help prepare teens for college. But sometimes the best teacher is somebody who's already been there. These are little things, but taken together, grandparents may get students out of their comfort zones and excited to see the world in a new-for-you kind of way. And, in the process, teens might also find kindness, comfort and excellent cookies.

LAHORE - At least 10 people were killed and more than 20 injured in rain-related incidents in parts of the metropolis on Tuesday.
Rescuers said at least six people including two policemen were electrocuted and two others buried alive in building collapse incidents which took place in the city's downtown during the downpour.
A rescue official last night confirmed that at least 12 building or wall collapse incidents were reported by the provincial emergency service in Lahore. He said that at least 21 people were shifted to different public hospitals with serious injuries.
According to police sources, two policemen were electrocuted when they were on patrol near MAO College in Rewarz Garden. A rescue official said the police shifted the bodies to a hospital. They were named as police driver Amanat and volunteer Shahzeb.
A 50-year-old man identified as Ishtiaq Ali died of electrocution at his house in China Scheme in Gujjarpura. An unidentified man was found electrocuted outside a house in Garden Town. A 38-year-old later identified as Muhammad Adnan was electrocuted near Abid Market and a 25-year-old man identified as Akbar was electrocuted in the street in Mozang. A 30-year-old man identified as Ghulam Abbas was electrocuted on the Main Boulevard in Gulberg.
Two people were buried alive when a dilapidated building collapsed on them in the Said Mitha Bazaar on early Tuesday. The victims were identified by rescuers as 24-year-old Omar and 32-year-old Abbas. The bodies were shifted to the Mayo hospital.
Six persons of a family were wounded seriously when the roof of a dilapidated house collapsed on them in Johar Town due to heavy rains. The injured were shifted to hospital. The condition of three of the injured was said to be serious till late Tuesday.
Three people were injured when the boundary wall of a house collapsed near Azam Chowk on College Road in Township. Similarly, two persons were injured near Pakka Meel on Multan Road.
A 70-year-old man and a teen boy were wounded critically when the roof of a dilapidated house collapsed on them near Murtaza Chowk in Sanda. The injured identified as Afzal and Yasir were shifted to Mayo hospital. A man and his son were killed as roof of their house collapsed in Johar Town.
Rain started Monday night and continued intermittently throughout the day.
Breakdown
The power supply remained suspended for a long duration in majority areas of the city when more than 250 feeders were tripped due to rainstorm Tuesday night. Around 30 percent localities of Lahore are without electricity due to different issues like cables or transformer damages. According to Lesco officials, electricity supply to around 200 feeders was restored while repair work was underway on rest of the feeders.
Emergency
The city district government declared emergency in all the public hospitals after heavy rains which continued for several hours. The downpour also disrupted flight operations at the Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore. According to an official, four international flights, which were scheduled to land at the Lahore airport, got delayed and another flight from Saudi Arabia was diverted to Multan.
Grief
Punjab Caretaker Chief Minister Hassan Askari expressed grief over the loss of lives and directed the authorities to provide relief to rain-hit people. He announced bereaved families will be given Rs800,000 each.

Adani is fighting the Queensland Environment Department, rather than pay a $12,000 fine for polluting the Great Barrier Reef - a breach the mining giant reported itself.
The Mackay Conservation group is calling for Adani to instead start engineering works on its Abbot Point port facility in North Queensland to make sure it doesn't happen again.
"The Queensland government has granted Adani free, unlimited water, it has amended water laws to stop objections by farmers and granted Adani a secret royalties deal," says Mackay Conservation Group coordinator, Peter McCallum - who visited Abbot Point with department officials in April to inspect the pollution.
McCallum claims Adani is being given privileged treatment by the Queensland government, a prime example being this $12,000 "slap on the wrist".
Adani admitted to the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection that it released more than eight times its licenced concentration of pollution in March.
"Rather than considering challenging the measly $12,000 fine for polluting the Great Barrier Reef coast Adani should begin work immediately to secure its coal terminal from storms and cyclones to avoid repeat pollution of the Reef coast and the Caley Valley Wetlands," McCallum says.
"The Department handed Adani a license to pollute before Cyclone Debbie hit which placed no limit on the volume of polluted water Adani could let flow into the wetlands."
A day later this license was retrospectively amended to protect Adani from liability for releasing coal polluted water at several other locations including the sea, McCallum claims.
"It took over a week for the Department of the Environment to begin even the most basic survey and five months later we still have no report on the pollution of the Caley Valley wetlands," says McCallum, who visited the site with Department officials a month after the Cyclone, and there was still coal present in the Caley Valley wetlands.
"We saw sediments which appear to be laden with coal within the wetlands adjacent to Adani's storm water system outlet," Mccallum says.
Mccallum says that with Adani's environmental record overseas, and this incident, it can't be trusted to construct a new coal terminal, build a massive coal mine or ship its coal out through the Great Barrier Reef.
Mackay Conservation Group exposed aerial photography of Adani's pollution of the Caley Valley wetlands in April which led to the company admitting to releasing 806mg/L of coal and other pollutants from its port at Abbot Point.
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Highlights of the third round of the 99th PGA Championship at Quail Hollow on Saturday:
Kisner hangs on despite bogey at last
Kevin Kisner bogeys the last but clings to a one-stroke lead on seven under par after posting a one-over-par 72. Hideki Matsuyama nearly ties for the lead but his birdie putt stops one roll short of the cup and he stands on six-under along with Chris Stroud.
Jason Day, the 2015 winner and third player in the final threesome, suffers a quadruple-bogey eight to stumble in with a 77 to tumble back to even par for the tournament.
Kisner drops back with double-bogey
Kisner made an unwanted splash at Quail Hollow, dunking his second shot on the par-four 16th in the water and spinning out his bogey putt that seemed headed for the bottom of the cup, leaving him with a double-bogey.
That dropped Kisner from 10-under, following birdies in his previous two holes, to eight-under and a temporary tie with Chris Stroud. Stroud promptly bogeyed the par-three 17th to leave Kisner on top by one stroke.
DeLaet makes two consecutive eagles
Canadian Graham DeLaet eagles the par-four 14th and par-five 15th to surge to the edge of contention.
His drive at the 301-yard 14th hits the hole for what would have been a rare albatross at a par-four. He settles for the eagle, and then sinks a 12-footer to also eagle the 15th.
It is the first time a player on the PGA Tour has recorded back-to-back eagles since Marc Leishman last November.
With his eagles book-ended by birdies at the 13th and 16th, DeLaet is six-under over his past four holes, two-under for the championship.
Day struggling off tee
Jason Day has a case of the hooks, missing a series of drives to the left. A double-bogey at the 12th leaves him five back.
Oosthuizen hurts arm in awkward swing
Louis Oosthuizen shakes his right arm in discomfort after hitting a shot at the second hole while standing awkwardly against a tree.
The South African, who began the round three shots off the pace, is attended by a physio as he walks down the fairway, but continues playing solidly.
Eagles fly in third round
Robert Streb holes out for eagle from 156 yards at the par-four 12th hole.
Next year maybe for Spieth
Jordan Spieth's quest to complete the grand slam will have to wait 12 months.
After a double-bogey at the last ruined a late hat-trick of birdies, he signed for a 71 for three-over 216, 10 strokes behind. (Reporting by Andrew Both and Larry Fine; Editing by Toby Davis and Ken Ferris)
HYDERABAD - Adviser to Sindh Chief Minister on Information Moula Bakhsh Chandio said on Sunday that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan was 'unnecessarily' criticising the leadership of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).
Talking to the media outside the Sindh Museum here, Chandio alleged that the PTI was not adopting serious approach on national issues. He said that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari would address a rally on January 5.
Earlier addressing a condolence reference for late Syed Qamar Zaman Shah, he said the late Shah was one of the contemporaries of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and he supported the party during its formative phase.
MNA Syed Navid Qamar, son of late Syed Qamar Zaman Shah, former federal secretary Mazharul Haq Siddiqi and others also addressed the reference.
NEW YORK-Scarlett Johansson has dismissed suggestions her new film ‘Rough Night' is a chick flick, and argued critics should look past the female cast
The 32-year-old actress is joined in the ‘'saucy'' comedy by Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer and Zoe Kravitz and she is frustrated that people are not seeing anything beyond the fact the cast are largely female.
Speaking to E! News, she said: ‘'What's been really funny is that I have had a lot of people saying things to me as we have been doing press for this film that it's a ‘ladies movie' about...'four ladies' and I am like ‘Well, not necessarily.'
‘'It seems almost sort of passé that to say that is a ‘ladies movie.' Once we can accept that women are funny and that we allow ourselves to talk about taboo subjects and take the stigma off of them, then I see it's a lot more inclusive environment.'' Scarlett insists the movie is more funny than ‘'raunchy'' and says it's the first script she's ever received that made her laugh out loud.
She added: ‘'It's funny I don't even think about this film as being raunchy, but I guess it's a little salty...
‘'What really appealed to me is that the script is so damn funny and it made me laugh out loud and I don't think that's ever really happened to me before.''
Meanwhile, ‘Saturday Night Live' star Kate praised Scarlett for her improvisation skills.
She said of her co-star: ‘'She's hilarious. She was just instantly so funny and was so great at improvising and it was just really exciting to watch her do comedy, as well as be so grounded. I just love being in the room watching her act. She's a master class.''

ALBANY (AP/Hamodia) - Gov. Andrew Cuomo is putting together a proposal to charge motorists more for entering the most congested parts of Manhattan, a plan suggested by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg which fell apart several years ago under opposition in Albany.
The proposal would impose congestion pricing, an idea increasingly popular around the globe that aims to discourage vehicular traffic in dense urban areas while also raising money for mass transit.
The Democrat hasn't released any details yet, but said it would be substantially different from Bloomberg's proposal. Any congestion pricing plan will likely face big political challenges, especially from representatives of the city's outer boroughs and the suburbs.
“Congestion pricing is an idea whose time has come,” Cuomo told The New York Times.
City and state officials are considering several approaches to fixing the city's beleaguered transit system, now beset by mounting delays, outages and other problems. Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed taxing the wealthy and transferring the money to poor people to afford the fare.
The mayor has pushed back when asked about congestion pricing, adding last week that “these proposals to-date never had any political viability.”
“I've never been in favor of those proposals because I haven't seen one that I thought was fair particularly to folks in the outer boroughs,” he said.
Cuomo's plan is likely to be rolled out on January of next year.
One of Ohio's largest full-service independent marketing and advertising agencies— Hart Inc. — began a new chapter in downtown Toledo this month. With the big move back to their original home downtown, CEO/President Mike Hart plans on helping the city's revitalization through the agency's investment in the Hylant building. The new 20,000 square-foot, two-floor office is home to around 60 Toledo employees. Floor-to-ceiling windows, a 360-degree view of the city, and a sleek industrial look gives visitors the feeling that they've escaped to a bigger city.
One thing you'll notice inside this spacious location is the use of unique textures and fun, collaborative rooms for brainstorming. From phone booths to comfy meeting rooms for copywriters and strategist, the agency's space is a representation of the work that they produce.
A mix of modern woodwork from The Collaborative, a local group of architects, interior designers and planners, and innovative lighting from the Toledo's Rudolph Libbe group further emphasizes their commitment to local.
Other special touches include a full suit of armor for a knight, which can be seen in an Ohio Lottery commercial and a quote that Mike's father, the late Thomas R. Hart, wrote on a piece of paper and gave him to keep in his desk 30 years ago now hangs on the wall: “The easiest way to lose success is to believe you are successful.”
“It's so true. It's really who I am,” explains Mike Hart. “I know it's who he was and I believe it's what we live by today— every day greater. Don't be arrogant, be lowkey. Work hard, be humble. That's what we're all about.”
As for their big move, Hart Inc. hopes their new home and the fresh identity will continue their growth. For more information, visit them at hartinc.com or find them on Facebook at Hart Inc.

Over the last few days, The Knife have shared cryptic photos and videos teasing a new project. Now, the mystery has finally been revealed: The electronic outfit will release a new live album and concert film on September 1st.
Titled Live at Terminal 5, it was recorded/filmed at New York City's Terminal 5 venue during The Knife's 2013-2014 Shaking the Habitual tour, just a little more than a year before announcing their breakup. Additionally, the Gothenburg natives are releasing a limited-edition book filled with photos from that tour.
In a new Pitchfork interview about the live album and film, The Knife's Karin Dreijer spoke about the Shaking the Habitual concerts and what they learned from it:
“It was the first time for me being in a work process with so many people involved in the actual making of what we were about to do. We strived to have a collective process where everyone's input mattered. It of course was a very slow way of working. We rehearsed for weeks and weeks, discussed, tried out things over and over. It was a great contrast to the studio work making the music. I think I was more focused on my body performance than the musical performance; I had never danced before so it took a lot of time for me to learn.”
For more information on Live at Terminal 5, including pre-order details, head here. Check out a trailer below, followed by corresponding artwork. To coincide with the release, The Knife are auctioning off instruments used during the trek. All proceeds will benefit the No One is Illegal Network, which supports undocumented refugees in Sweden.
Elsewhere in the interview with Pitchfork, when asked about The Knife's future, the band's Olof Dreijer left the door open for possible releases. “I don't really know. We just continue like we always have. The Knife is one of our projects that we work with, and when we feel like it, we make music. It's a very luxurious situation.”

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Wednesday he regretted naming Jeff Sessions as attorney general, as pressure on the White House grows from a special counsel's probe into possible campaign collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice.
After The New York Times reported that Trump pressured Sessions to reverse his recusal from overseeing the Russia probe in March 2017, the US president confirmed his unhappiness over that decision in a tweet. He quoted a Republican lawmaker as criticizing Sessions for not telling the president before becoming attorney general that he would have to recuse himself from the investigation. “There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!” the lawmaker, Trey Gowdy, said. “I wish I did!” Trump said in his tweet. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Sessions, who he hand-picked last year as the country's top law enforcement official, as the probe into Russian election meddling, and possible obstruction, bores in on the White House.
On Sunday Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said the investigation could ultimately result in an impeachment effort in Congress over alleged obstruction by the president.
“Eventually the decision here is going to be impeached, not impeach,” Giuliani told CNN in an interview.
The president has made clear he believes Sessions, a former senator who was active in the Trump campaign, should be helping him fight the probe, rather than standing to the side.
The Times reported Wednesday that Trump's push for Sessions to reverse his recusal has become a focus of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.
The episode could put Sessions, whom Mueller's investigators interviewed in January, in the position of being a witness against the president in the obstruction side of Mueller's investigation, according to the Times.
Trump has gone on the offensive, seeking to paint the Mueller investigation, the Justice Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as biased against him, and is now calling the Mueller probe “illegitimate” and “rigged.”
Last weekend he tweeted 14 times about the investigation, alleging that Democrats were behind what he called the “plant” of a law enforcement informant in his campaign.
Giuliani said Trump and his team have to take the fight to the public with an eye to a possible impeachment fight.
“”Members of Congress, Democrat and Republican, are going to be informed a lot by their constituents. So, our jury is the American - as it should be - is the American people,” he said on CNN.
I'm middle-aged, with a much older husband and teenage child. My husband and I lived and worked on opposite sides of the globe when we met. We split our time in each other's country after we married. Once schooling began, our child and I stopped commuting overseas. My husband soon chose to live with us full-time.He did this without discussing it with me beforehand. He said he took a leave of absence from his job, which deferred his pension until his retirement age.He spent the next ten years surfing the Internet and playing at being Mr. Mom, despite my clear requests that he get a job.Article Continued BelowHe gave me no clear answer as to what's considered retirement age by his country/employer. I waited. And took temporary postings overseas, working 12 hours, seven days a week for months. Then I got cancer and had to take medical leave for years during chemo and radiation. The result was a huge income loss.

DENVER (Reuters) - Pop star Taylor Swift on Friday won an important ruling in the trial stemming from her allegation that she was groped by a Colorado disc jockey, with the judge dismissing the DJ's rival claim accusing the singer of wrongfully getting him fired.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Martinez left intact Swift's assault and battery countersuit against David Mueller, who asserts he was falsely accused by the recording star and ousted from his $150,000-a-year job at radio station KYGO-FM under pressure from her.
The Grammy-winning artist known for such hits as "Fearless" and "I Knew Your Were Trouble" reacted to the decision with tears of joy, embracing members of her legal team and family members with bear hugs in the courtroom.
Mueller sat alone at the plaintiff's table, appearing somber as he sipped a glass of water.
Friday's decision capped the fifth day of a trial highlighted by vivid testimony from Swift charging that Mueller clutched her bare buttocks during a pre-concert fan reception in 2013 against Mueller's assertion under oath that he did no such thing.
The judge had tossed out Mueller's defamation-of-character claim against Swift before the trial, ruling that the former Denver DJ had waited too long to file suit under the statute of limitations.
Earlier on Friday, Swift's former bodyguard corroborated her account of being groped by Mueller, testifying that he saw the radio personality slip his hand under the singer's skirt as they posed together for a photo with Mueller's then-girlfriend.
Lawyers for both sides rested their respective cases after the ex-girlfriend, Shannon Melcher, took the stand as the final witness to deny seeing Mueller inappropriately touch Swift during the picture-taking session. But she added, "I don't have eyes in the back of my head."
After jurors were excused for the day, Swift's lawyer, J. Douglas Baldridge, asked the judge to throw out Mueller's two remaining legal claims in the trial - disruption of his $150,000-a-year employment contract and interference with his future earnings.
Swift has said her representatives lodged a complaint with KYGO management about the alleged groping but insisted she never demanded Mueller be fired.
Although Martinez agreed to dismiss both claims as they related to Swift, he kept the contract claim intact for Swift's two co-defendants - her mother, Andrea, and her radio station liaison Frank Bell.

The eight-member jury also will be left to decide whether Mueller is liable for assault and battery, for which Swift is seeking a symbolic $1 in damages.
Swift, known for baring her soul and her grudges in her music, by all accounts was the undisputed star witness of her own trial, giving an unflinching account of the incident in question on Thursday.
In unvarnished language that occasionally drew titters in the courtroom, even from some jurors, Swift testified that she was the victim of a "devious and sneaky act."
Slideshow (2 Images)
"Your client grabbed my ass," she told Mueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland. "He stayed latched onto my bare ass cheek. I felt him grab onto my ass cheek under my skirt."
Greg Dent, Swift's bodyguard and a former police officer who said he has provided security for many other celebrities, bolstered her narrative when he took the stand on Friday.
"I saw his hand under her skirt. ... Her skirt went up. ... She jumped," Dent testified, adding that Swift then moved closer to Mueller's girlfriend, who was standing on Swift's other side.
"I was definitely sure that he had been drinking," Dent said of Mueller. "I don't know what level. He wasn't staggering or falling down."
The photo, repeatedly displayed in court, shows Swift flanked by Mueller and Melcher, all three smiling for the camera. Mueller has his right hand concealed behind Swift's backside, and she appears to have shifted her hip away from him.
Dent said he did not immediately intervene because he took his cues from Swift, who continued with the meet-and-greet session. When she finished meeting her fans, Dent said, Swift told her staff about the groping.
Following Dent to the stand was Mueller's longtime friend and former co-host at KYGO-FM, Ryan Kliesch. He repeatedly answered "no" when asked by McFarland if he had ever seen Mueller disrespect, demean, condescend or act inappropriately toward women.
The jury was due to return on Monday for closing arguments in the case.

Charleston City Council members are expected to discuss whether to approve the new budget for 2018 during the council meeting on Monday night.
The 2018 budget includes approximately a five percent increase compared to 2017. Officials said that is an all-natural growth in revenue.
City officials said they are pushing for two main things in this budget.
The first is a firefighter pay plan which is approximately $340,000.
The other is the city-wide employee cost of living adjustment – approximately $2.6 million.
The mayor and council members have been working to approve this budget without raising taxes.
The mayor and council have identified approximately $2 million in cuts -- from delaying bond issuances to cutting administrative overhead in a number of departments.
There have been some members of the community upset this budget does not include any funds allocated for stormwater issues.
Those funds will not be included in the general fund - they have their own budget. That budget will also be brought up in Monday night's City Council meeting.
The city had less money to work with for the 2018 general budget because it has to fund $4 million extra in employee benefits.
City officials said that was an unfunded state mandate for retirement and increases in retiree healthcare.
Officials said their "magic number" is a budget that is balanced against revenue projections, which is where they are now at $210,305,555.
The City Council meeting will get underway at 5 p.m. at City Hall downtown.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry last week called out a little-known energy technology incubator as one of the reasons the department has had and is having such a profound impact on American lives.
At the annual summit for the departments Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy last Wednesday, Perry said the technology born in the nursery for energy startups is impressive and simply a preview of our possibilities. Based on that review of ARPA-E, who would think the Trump administration is trying to shut it down?
For two years in a row, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating ARPA-E, an agency tasked with promoting and funding breakthroughs in energy technology. (Its famous cousin DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, funds research for new weapons for the Pentagon.)
In its latest budget request to Congress, the White Houses Office of Management and Budget said the private sector - not the government - should play the primary role in funding research into new ways of generating electricity and powering vehicles.

Yet both publicly and privately last week, political leaders at the Energy Department indicated they stand behind the program. (Continued below.)

----------
Congressional Democrats, along with several powerful Republicans, are keen to keep the agency funded. And Perry, himself a former appropriator when he served in the Texas House of Representatives, appears more receptive to lobbying from Democrats than some of the more adamant members of President Donald Trumps Cabinet. The back-and-forth between him and lawmakers is a throwback to how budgets in Washington used to be written.
And ARPA-E has proven to be resilient in the face of the broad budget cuts sought by the OMB and its director, Mick Mulvaney, a small-government advocate who rode the tea-party wave into Congress in 2010. The agency was born out a bipartisan agreement in 2007 and funded as part of the economic stimulus in 2009.
Despite the administrations budget, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told APRA-E summit attendees Wednesday, weve been assured from the Department of Energy that the secretary fully supports this program. Before the speech, a political appointee at the department briefed Bennets staff on Perrys views on ARPA-E, the senators office said.
Perry was scheduled to deliver the remarks in person at the summit before he was called away to testify Wednesday before a Senate panel on Trumps infrastructure plan.
Delivering his remarks remotely, Perry said: I deeply regret I couldnt join you in person. . . . However, while youre here I hope you will enjoy the many high-potential, high-impact technologies ARPA-E has moved out of the lab and towards deployment.
One day later, Perry was on Capitol Hill to defend the presidents proposed budget in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water issues. Yet Perry reassured Democratic lawmakers he still values the work of some offices for which the Trump administration proposed to cut funding.
This subcommittee is extremely interested in any proposed changes to ARPA-E, said Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, the top Democrat on the energy appropriations subcommittee. Thats kind of like the gold star. Its where we invent the future. Kaptur has privately lobbied DOE officials about ARPA-E, her office said, in addition to penning an editorial in the largest newspaper in her district, the Plain Dealer in Cleveland.
Ms. Kaptur, Perry responded, you have my commitment that Im going to work with this committee. . . . Were going to honor and follow instructions.
Perry added, If its the will of this committee for ARPA-E to exist going forward in some form or fashion, I hope that you will have confidence that not only have I done this before as a governor, but that well have good successes and that we can stand up together and say, this is how its supposed to work. This is a good return on investment for the American taxpayers dollars.
Renewable-energy advocates took Perrys words as a sign of encouragement.
Greg Wetstone, head of the lobbying group American Council on Renewable Energy, said Perry is not obviously disowning the administrations budget proposal but hes certainly showing a willingness to go along with what clearly is going to be Congresss intent.
Wetstone continued, There is an underlying theme here: Dont take the administrations budget request very seriously.
The prospect that ARPA-E could survive the budget knives were grimmer a year ago.
Last May, Trump unveiled his budget proposal that called for killing ARPA-E. Funding was put on pause and, a month later, the House energy appropriations panel voted to advance a bill formally eliminating the agency.
Quickly, though, firms and land-grant universities receiving ARPA-E grants, many in red states, made noise about losing a source of funding. By July, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, chairman of the subcommittee, made a point of publicly supporting the program.
I think ARPA-E is a good program myself, as Ive said earlier, and Ill say it again so that maybe its heard all the way down at the Forrestal Building, Simpson said at a subcommittee hearing, referring to DOEs headquarters.
That summer, ARPA-E was back to announcing new funding opportunities. In December, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, determined the Trump administration violated the law by withholding ARPA-E funds earlier that year.
Created by a law signed by former President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by former President Barack Obama two years later, ARPA-E is freestanding office within DOE designed to operate nimbly to fund breakthrough energy innovations.
Last year, a congressionally mandated National Academies of Sciences assessment concluded ARPA-E is a success story so far, one that is making progress toward achieving its statutory mission and goals.
Among the achievements so far according to the report: 581 scientific journal studies published, 74 patents granted and, perhaps most importantly for a businessman like Trump, 36 new companies founded, all based on ARPA-E funded research.

LONDON - Ravi Ashwin and Cheteshwar Pujara will play English county cricket this year ahead of India's tour next summer, India's chairman of selectors MSK Prasad said Monday. Spinner Ashwin, who has not previously played in England, has been cleared by the BCCI to play for Worcestershire while batsman Pujara is expected to return to Nottinghamshire. "Pujara and Ashwin will be playing county cricket. Ashwin is part of other formats too, so it is a blessing in disguise for both of them because we will have a full-fledged tour of five Tests in England next year," Prasad said.
Some of Manatee County's local high schools participated in the Bradenton Area River Regatta for the first time ever. They marched along the Green Bridge and stopped in the middle, taking turns performing their own sets before coming together for a joint cadence.
Chris Lattner, one of the key creators behind the Apple programming language Swift, is on the move again. After a short six-month stay at Tesla, which he joined last year from Apple to act as VP of Autopilot Software, Lattner announced on Twitter today that his next stop is Google Brain.
Lattner, who worked for more than a decade on low-level software and systems at Apple, revealed in June that he wasn't going to be staying on at Tesla after finding that it wasn't “a good fit.” Lattner then joked that his resume was “easy to find online,” and noted his top qualification: Seven years of Swift experience, which is the longest anyone not on his immediate team at Apple can reasonably claim without outright lying.
I'm super excited to join Google Brain next week: AI can't democratize itself (yet?) so I'll help make it more accessible to everyone! — Chris Lattner (@clattner_llvm) August 14, 2017
Swift isn't Lattner's only major contribution to the world of programming: Prior to his helping hand with Apple's latest coding language, he created the Land compiler and LLVM. In other words, you'd be hard-pressed to find a modern developer whose work hasn't been touched at a fundamental level by something Lattner has created in the past.
Google Brain is the search giant's team focused on deep learning and artificial intelligence. It focused on helping to use AI across a range of products, tackling both research and product integration, working together with teams across Alphabet, including at DeepMind. Its ultimate stated motivation is to advance the field with open source projects, academic collaboration and publication.

LAHORE - The Lahore High Court Wednesday came down hard on Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal for his “contemptuous statement, he gave in reaction to the remarks of Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar about his (minister's) role in appointment of a woman teacher as vice chancellor of a university for women.
The three-member bench led by Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi also directed the minister to submit written reply rather than the oral explanation about his “contemptuous statement”. The court also directed screening of “controversial clip” of the minister in open court on the next hearing.
“We just want to see it for our own knowledge,” Justice Naqvi, the head of the bench observed while rejecting the plea of Advocate Azam Nazir Tarar, the counsel of the minister, about not showing the video in the courtroom.
The bench snubbed the minister, and referred to Article 68 of the Constitution that when “the conduct of a superior court judge could not be discussed even in the parliament then how did you do that before the public,”.
“I can't even think about disgracing the courts and I just said so in a way of “Shikwa”(complaint). CJP has also said so. He is a CJP of every citizen. Being a citizen, I just did a complaint,” Ahsan Iqbal explained his position, standing there with his fractured arm. At this, one member of the bench observed that “It's because of your motivation that Kasur incident took place wherein the derogatory language was used against the judiciary,”. The minister said: “No, We can't even think about that,”. At this, the judge asked him: “ You are a minister and have you taken any action against these Kasur people? ,”. “It's in the provincial domain. We had taken strict action if such incident had happened in Islamabad. And yes, we took action against a group of protestors who gathered outside the Supreme Court and they were booked,” the minister replied. “Then what happened?” Justice Naqvi asked him who replied: “They would have been caught,” . “Oh! They would have been caught. You are a minister and you don't know,” the judge expressed the anger.
Referring to the minster's explanation that he came to Pakistan to serve the country after getting education in the US, the judge said: “You used to study in the US. Do you know what Article 19 is?,” . The minister replied: “I studied engineering. I wish I would have been a lawyer,”.
“Tone down your voice !,” Justice Naqvi reprimanded the minister when he spoke to explain his position.
“You are a politician and don't you know the ‘expression'?” the judge further said and asked Advocate Azhar Siddique, the petitioner's counsel, to read Article 19 of the Constitution before the minister, so that he could know the respect of the state institutions. The minister said: “I reiterate that I hold the judiciary in high esteem and don't have any such intention and also could never think about disgracing the courts and state institutions,”.
He also narrated the whole incident of attack and how he escaped and also about performing Umra last week. However, the bench gave direction for screening of the “contemptuous clip” in the open court by the next hearing. Tarar, the respondent's counsel, pleaded the court not to allow clip's screening on the next hearing. “My lord, nothing is in it; I have seen it, please, your kindness, don't order for it,” Tarar kept pleading the bench. He also tried to seek sufficient time, saying that “I'll be engaged in the Supreme Court next week, schedule is very tight; kindly give me more time,”. However, the court observed that why the previous order was not complied with so far, directed the counsel to come up with written reply and adjourned the hearing until June 5.
The same court had been hearing six other cases including the anti-judiciary speeches of former PM Nawa Sharif, his daughter Maryam Safdar, the case against Pemra, the Kasur rally case and also the cases against MQM London Chief.
A jump shot from Leonard cut New York's lead to 88-86 with 1:43 to play, but Anthony responded with two straight baskets that rebuilt the Knicks's lead to 92-86 with 33 seconds remaining and the Spurs wouldn't get the deficit below four points the rest of the way.
Days after Dolan banned Oakley from Madison Square Garden — where the fan favourite was arrested on Wednesday for resisting security personnel who tried to toss him from the arena — support for Oakley was evident among fans, including filmmaker Spike Lee who sat courtside in an Oakley jersey. Dolan sat Sunday next to Latrell Sprewell, another ex-Knick with whom he's feuded. Sprewell called the Oakley incident “disappointing” in a courtside TV interview, saying it was time to “iron out” the situation “and get past it.” Pistons fight back In Toronto, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored five of his 21 points in the final minute as the Detroit Pistons erased a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Raptors 102-101. Caldwell-Pope made a 16-foot jumper and followed it with a three-pointer with 13.2 seconds left to give the Pistons a one-point lead. Toronto's DeMar DeRozan missed a fadeaway jumpshot as time expired. The Raptors, fourth in the Eastern Conference, lost for the 10th time in 14 games. Andrew Wiggins scored 27 points and Karl-Anthony Towns contributed 22 as the Minnesota Timberwolves rolled past the injury-depleted Chicago Bulls 117-89 in Minneapolis. The Bulls were without starters Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade as well as backups Nikola Mirotic and Paul Zipser. The Timberwolves, who had lost five of their previous six games, took full advantage to give coach Tom Thibodeau a sweep of the season series against his former team. In Sacramento, DeMarcus Cousins scored 28 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and handed out 17 assists in the Kings's 105-99 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Cousins was also whistled for his 17th technical foul of the season, for an elbow thrown in the first quarter that appeared to be inadvertent. Cousins, who has already served a one-game ban for amassing 16 technicals, will be suspended another game for an 18th tech. Pelicans rookie Buddy Hield was ejected for the first time in his NBA career after he was assessed a flagrant foul for hitting Cousins in the groin in the second quarter. — AFP More from Basketball Wizards conjure magic as Spurs maintain streak

NEW DELHI
Consultation process in both the BJP and the Opposition camps shifted into high gear on Wednesday as filing of nominations for the presidential election began.
The ruling party's three-member panel reached out to its allies as well as rivals while the Congress-led Opposition parties, too, held a meeting but maintained that no names were discussed for the presidential poll. They will meet again, most likely after the BJP discloses the name of its candidate.
BJP sources have said the NDA candidate for the top constitutional post is likely to file nomination before Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for the US on June 25. The last date for filing of nomination is June 28.
Union ministers Venkaiah Naidu and Rajnath Singh, two members of the panel apart from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, will meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday as part of efforts to evolve a broad consensus on the presidential candidate.
Naidu on Wednesday spoke to TDP chief and BJP ally N Chandrababu Naidu and leaders of some regional outfits in southern India. He also called up Satish Mishra of the Mayawati-led BSP and Praful Patel of the NCP, headed by Sharad Pawar.
Mishra and Patel represented their parties later in the Opposition's meeting.
No names were discussed in the meeting as Opposition leaders met to chalk out their strategy for the presidential election scheduled for July 17, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said.
He said the 10-member Opposition panel would meet again to decide on a suitable presidential nominee. He, however, did not give any timeframe.
Sources said the leaders would discuss names, but await a government initiative in this regard.
Opposition leaders like Sharad Yadav have made it clear that they will put up a joint candidate if the saffron party picks a nominee with strong Hindutva leanings.
On the first day, six persons, including a man and his wife, filed nominations.
All the nominations filed are liable to be rejected as none had the mandatory 50 proposers and as many seconders from among the electors.
GENEVA — Muslim Rohingya continue to flee Myanmar‘s Rakhine state, many testifying about violence, persecution, killings and burning of their homes by soldiers and Buddhists, the United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, in his final remarks to the Human Rights Council before stepping down on Aug 31, questioned a top Myanmar official's assertion that the government was committed to defending the rights of all, not those of any one community.

“In my four years as High Commissioner I have heard many preposterous claims. That claim is almost in its own category of absurdity,” Zeid said. “Have you no shame, sir, have you no shame? We are not fools.”
The Myanmar official, Kyaw Moe Tun, director-general of its foreign ministry, did not reply to Zeid's comments which closed the two-hour debate. After the session he could not be reached for comment.
WATCH: Life inside Rohingya refugee camps
Earlier, Kyaw said during the debate that Zeid's report contained information that was “distorted or exaggerated.” He blamed the violence on militants who attacked Myanmar government forces.
“The root cause of the tragedy was terrorism and terrorism cannot be condoned under any circumstance,” Kyaw said.
So far this year, 11,432 Rohingya have reached Bangladesh, where more than 700,000 have fled since an August military crackdown in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state, Zeid said.

“No amount of rhetoric can whitewash these facts. People are still fleeing persecution in Rakhine — and are even willing to risk dying at sea to escape,” he said.
Many Rohingya refugees also report being pressured by Myanmar authorities to accept a national verification card that says they need to apply for citizenship, he added.
The citizenship issue is at the core of discussions on their status, Zeid said, adding that the cards “mark the Rohingya as non-citizens, in keeping with the government's characterisation of them as foreigners in their own homeland.”
WATCH: Rohingya women tell of Myanmar military's alleged rape
Authorities in mainly Buddhist Myanmar deny carrying out large scale human rights abuses, which the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing. Authorities say a crackdown in Rakhine is a necessary response to violence by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) militant group, which attacked Myanmar security posts.
Kyaw said a top priority for his government was to find a “sustainable solution” in Rakhine. It had agreed with Bangladesh in January 2018 that repatriation of refugees would be completed within two years, he said.
After eking out a thrilling 2-1 opening win over Dallas, the Seoul Dynasty found their footing in the Overwatch League and started rolling; in the last couple weeks, they've seemed basically unbeatable. The Dynasty is the rebranded iteration of Lunatic-Hai, long considered one of the best Overwatch teams in the world, so it makes sense that they entered the League as favorites. And last night, they got fucking rolled.
It's not necessarily surprising that the London Spitfire beat Seoul yesterday. New York had just taken a 3-2 thriller against the Dynasty and London is also the reconstituted bones of a pair of elite Korean Overwatch teams. What made their win such a shock was the ruthlessness of it all. London notched a 4-0 sweep, didn't let Seoul take a single map objective until the fourth round, and dictated the terms of every fight. It was comprehensive, and Seoul looked hesitant and scared. This dude's face says it all.
Bafflingly, Seoul opted to replace captain and Zenyatta wizard Ryujehong with less experienced support player Gido. While their desire to stay unpredictable and resist stagnation is admirable in a vacuum, Gido and Tobi never synced up, and moving your star player and lynchpin out of the lineup isn't innovative—it's outthinking yourself. Seoul's probably wary of other teams figuring out their strategies, but if you're a top team, playing your style is more important than overreacting before other teams have even figured out your shit.
Seoul has looked terrifying over the back halves of games this season, but their inability to pivot last night was worrisome. Not only did Ryujehong not make an appearance, the Dynasty stuck with the same lineup on all four futile maps, without trotting out Munchkin, Wekeed, or Xepher in an effort to shake things up.
London was better in every phase of the match. Their tanks were coordinated, their specialized control map squad cleaned up on Ilios, and they maintained an aggression that Seoul simply couldn't match. Birdring and Hooreg outsniping Fleta, whose Widowmaker play dominated the first three weeks, pretty much says it all.

If last week's slate of games revealed that there's more parity between the top and bottom of the league than initially appeared, then this London beatdown showed that the top of the table is also less settled than it seemed when Seoul was racking up sweeps and London and New York were losing to middling American teams. An even more interesting prospect presents itself tonight, when Seoul will face another 5-2 team, the Houston Outlaws, who are on an unholy hot streak. They can either reassert themselves, or lose even more ground and legitimize Houston as the best non-Korean team. Either way, London looks like OWL's top dog at the moment.

Goa on Friday requested the Goods and Services Tax Council to rethink on the reverse charge mechanism of the GST, with suspension of a Section as related to this mechanism existing in the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, which has been creating a problem to the dealers in the state.
The reverse charge mechanism in the GST is one wherein the recipient of the goods and/ or services is liable to pay GST instead of the supplier.
Coming out with this information, Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, who attended the 22nd meeting of the GST Council in New Delhi on Friday, as chaired by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told ‘The Navhind Times' that he has also suggested to the council that GST on the mining sector should be such that it should not create problems for the smaller traders and dealers involved in this sector.
The mining companies may attract service tax for the services relevant to the mining industry such as exploration, mineral production, handling, transportation and so on. Furthermore, under GST regime, there would be output taxes at the time of supply of output of the mines but at the same time the input tax cost incurred by the miners would be allowed as credit.
Parrikar, who also holds the finance portfolio, said that he has supported quarterly filing of returns by the dealers under the GST system, while the payment would be on the monthly basis. “In general, Goa government has suggested to the council that the GST regime should be non-problematic to the smaller dealers, traders and entrepreneurs,” he informed, expressing confidence that the recommendations of the state government to the GST Council would be honoured, and after that almost all the GST-related problems here would be taken care of.
Minister for Panchayati Raj Mauvin Godinho was also present at the meeting. He observed that several household items have seen a rate cut, further adding that yarn, clips and pins have been brought down to the 5 per cent slab after the rate revision.
The Chief Minister had attended a meeting of the state-based dealers on October 4 in the city, trying to understand the difficulties faced by them under the GST regime.
Parrikar had also maintained that during the first quarter of the GST regime, Goa had not earned as much revenue as it would have earned under the value added tax regime. He had further hoped that all the GST-related problems in Goa would be sorted out by December 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -
Thursday, May 31, 2018 at 2:27 am |
North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol arrives for a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York, Wednesday. (Reuters/Lucas Jackson)
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol enter a second day of meetings in New York on Thursday as they try to settle nuclear weapons disagreements and set the stage for an historic summit between their two leaders.
The two men left a 90-minute private dinner at a New York apartment on Wednesday night without providing details about their conversation. Another round of talks was scheduled for Thursday, with Pompeo expected to leave New York that afternoon.
The United States has been demanding that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program amid reports that it is close to being able to launch a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.
Pyongyang has long argued that it needs nuclear weapons for its security.
There were reports earlier on Wednesday that South Korean officials were noting “quite significant” differences between the United States and North Korea over denuclearization.
The New York meetings follow high-level conversations Pompeo held in North Korea in April and earlier in May and are intended to get negotiations between the two long-time adversaries back on track.
President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had been scheduled to hold an unprecedented summit in Singapore on June 12. Disputes between Washington and Pyongyang led Trump to cancel the meeting, only to see a renewal of diplomatic efforts in recent days.
Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of Kim Jong-un and vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee, is the most senior North Korean official to meet top U.S. officials for talks in the United States in nearly two decades.
In return for giving up its nuclear weapons, Washington could potentially loosen sanctions on Pyongyang, leading to possible food and other aid to impoverished North Korea and improved ties with South Korea.
A senior State Department official briefed reporters separately as Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol met late on Wednesday. The official, who asked not to be identified, said North Korea is “going to have to make clear what they are willing to do” in response to Washington's demands.
Trump, the official said, “can make a fly or no-fly decision anytime he wants,” referring to the possible Singapore summit.
If not enough progress is made to lead to a productive meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the official said, “we will ramp up the pressure on them and we'll be ready for the day that hopefully they are ready.”
The two Koreas have technically been at war for decades, even though the Korean War's military combat ended in 1953, because a peace agreement was never signed.
The age of information and technology is at its peak and many are resorting to emerging technological advances to improve the quality of their lives and ease their work process. One of such people are teacher, lecturers and the like, who are steadily taking advantage of technology to enhance their teaching processes and lighten their workload. Jumia Travel, the leading online travel agency, shares 4 smart ways to use tech in the classroom.
Using Videos For Mini Lessons
This is a smart way to resonate effectively with visual learners. Teachers, lecturers and the like can add videos to your lesson plans to shake things up in a positive and interesting way for your students. They can also find or make relevant videos on specific topics or study areas, and play for students to listen to and learn from. This helps to further improve the students' understanding of the topic or subject being taught. There are many websites that host teacher-made video content, which can help teachers with getting videos for mini lessons. TeacherTube, is an example of such websites, it's like an education only version of YouTube.
Organizing Live Videos
As a teacher or lecturer, you can actually co-ordinate live videos for your students and invite guest lecturers or industry experts to deliver lessons to your students using conferencing technology. What make this method so great for the learning is that, it makes it easier for guest lecturers or industry experts to help educate your students on related subjects, with little or no stress. It can really help to expose students to new ideas and lighten your workload as a teacher or lecturer. Additionally, you can ask your students to prepare questions while listening to the live lecture, and ask the guest lecturer about them afterwards to make the process more interactive. Skype and Google Hangouts are great conferencing technologies to use for organizing live videos, and Skype even has a list of guest speakers who are willing to voluntarily speak out about their topics of expertise.
Set Up Student Blogs
Blogging can be a great creative outlet for students, especially for those in language arts classes and other writing-centric subjects or courses. WordPress is a great blogging platform to consider using and it can be used to host each student's blog. Some of the products that students can create on the blog include: poems, short essays, movie or book reviews, diary entries from perspectives of historical figures or characters in a book or novel etc. Once you set up a blog for your students, blogging can easily become one of the easiest ways to introduce and use technology in the classroom.
Infographics
Infographics are graphic visual representations of information, data or knowledge that is intended to present information in a quick, clear and easy to understand way. It is a great way to summarize your lessons to your students in a visual, colourful and concise way. There are many free online infographic makers that teachers can take advantage of to create infographics to use as teaching tools in the classroom.
The chairman of Toshiba has resigned following the release of figures showing a projected $6.3bn loss from the company's nuclear business – a loss that may continue to grow and threaten its other businesses.
Following a rollercoaster few weeks in which the electronics and energy giant said it would sell off 20 per cent of its memory division to cover the revenue hole, Shigenori Shiga said he will leave the board but stay on as an executive.
But that may only be the start of the problems: the Japanese giant missed its quarterly earnings reporting deadline on the Tokyo Stock Exchange early on Tuesday and asked for a month's extension.
The figures released are unaudited and the company implied that the loss may grow even larger. In a statement, it acknowledged that it may now have to sell more than 20 per cent of its memory business – the company's crown jewel – to raise sufficient capital to continue operating.
The company said last week it had received offers of up to $3.6bn for the 20 per cent stake it put out. If the losses grow much bigger, it may end up having to sell its majority holding and possibly look at selling stakes in its PC business as well.
Toshiba's stock price has, unsurprisingly, dived and is half what it was at the start of the year. It fell 20 per cent on Tuesday.
Why and how
The massive losses are a result of Toshiba's US subsidiary Westinghouse. Back in 2015, the company admitted that the nuclear company had falsely inflated its earnings by $1.2bn, and blamed project managers for having hidden falling revenue and rising costs.
Last month, Toshiba warned losses would stretch to the billions, giving an initial estimate of between $4bn and $7bn, later revising it to $5-6bn. Tuesday's $6.3bn figure, complete with a statement that implied the true figure may be even larger, has shocked investors and put the company into emergency mode.
Asked to explain the request to delay the earnings release, the company said its lawyers were looking into the acquisition of construction company CB&I Stone & Webster by Westinghouse, which is at the heart of the problems.
Toshiba said its auditors had looked into the 2015 deal and determined that Westinghouse had massively overpaid and not accounted for its liabilities. Westinghouse thought that by purchasing the construction company it would be able to achieve big cost savings.
Toshiba's lawyers are now looking at whether "inappropriate pressure" had been exerted by senior Westinghouse managers on people below them who were responsible for reviewing the deal.
The main cause of the massive losses is two nuclear power stations being built in the US – one in South Carolina and another in Georgia. They are more than three years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. ®

Canada and its G7 partners are saying “enough is enough” to attacks by Russia and other authoritarian countries in their democratic institutions, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Monday.
Freeland concluded talks with her G7 counterparts by affirming an organized effort to respond to foreign meddling and the spreading of false information — mainly by Russia. Exactly what that means is a work in progress, but Freeland said the ministers will give their leaders recommendations on how to respond in a forceful, co-ordinated manner when they meet in Charlevoix, Que. in June.
There is a concern in the G7 countries that “authoritarian states are actively working to undermine the democratic systems in our countries and elsewhere,” she said.
“Today we said, ‘Enough is enough.'”
Freeland said there was unanimity among G7 ministers for a concerted effort to tackle Russian disinformation and meddling in the world's democracies.
Related: G7 warned of Russian threats to western democracy
While she and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson displayed enthusiasm for the G7 effort to take Russia to task for what they are calling a broad range of “malign” behaviour, their American counterpart sounded a less effusive note.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan didn't bother mentioning the initiative in his closing public remarks.
Sullivan was pinch-hitting for U.S. President Donald Trump's new pick for secretary of state, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who faces strong opposition to his confirmation, and could not represent his country during the overlapping meeting of G7 foreign and interior ministers, which continues Tuesday.
Sullivan opted instead to highlight the North Korea nuclear crisis in his closing summit remarks, following Pompeo's secret mission to the Hermit Kingdom two weeks ago to pave the way for a Trump meeting with its leader, Kim Jong-un.
Freeland pushed Russia to the top of a packed agenda that included North Korea, Iran, the ongoing Syrian crisis, and the Venezuela and Rohingya Muslim unrest.
Russia is, of course, a politically charged issue for Trump, with special counsel Robert Mueller investigating allegations of possible collusion between Russia and the campaign that brought the president to power in 2016.
The G7 ministers agreed in their Sunday discussion about the need to address the disruptive influence of Russia, including its interference in foreign elections and its dissemination of fake news.
“What we decided … was that we were going to set up a G7 group that would look at Russian malign behaviour in all its manifestations, whether it's cyberwar, whether it's disinformation, assassination attempts, whatever it happens to be and collectively try and call it out,” Johnson said.
“Russia is so unbelievably clever at kind of sowing doubt and confusion and spreading all this fake news and trying to muddy the waters. We think there's a role for the G7 in just trying to provide some clarity.”
Freeland said she and her fellow ministers talked about “democracy being under attack, and in particular about Russian efforts to destabilize some democracies.”
Sullivan didn't mention the Russia initiative in his summary of the talks or single out the Kremlin's use disinformation, but he said the U.S. remains committed to the G7's endeavour.
He called on Russia to be a “constructive partner” in Syria, where it continues to back the regime of Bashar Assad. He blasted it for the chemical weapon attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in the British town of Salisbury. And he called on the Kremlin to give Crimea back to Ukraine and get out of its eastern region.
Sullivan also said co-operation with Russia on a variety of topics is necessary, including fighting terrorism “but that will not prevent us from standing up and confronting and taking action against Russian behaviour that's contrary to international norms and all that we stand for in the G7.”
Afterwards, a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, added additional comment: “The U.S. will support its allies to combat state sponsored disinformation from Russia and other countries. This remains a priority.”
Freeland has framed the clash between democracy and authoritarianism as a defining theme of our time, with Russia as the West's main foe on that front.
She said all citizens in democratic countries, as well as their governments have a duty to be vigilant against the disruption. She said one of her fellow ministers “pointed out that making the case for democracy can be hard sometimes … because facts can be very boring” and don't always lead to an interesting narrative.
“Lurid conspiracy theories, on the other hand, are lurid, and exciting. Part of our job, I think, is a collective one of being aware of that fact.”

PESHAWAR - Qaumi Watan Party Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao on Monday said that the QWP in principal supported former premier Nawaz Sharif's demand for having a new social contract in the country, adding that it would serve as a goodwill gesture from the centre to the people of the smaller province and would help promote social and democratic freedom.
He said while speaking at a public meeting at Tilaband village in outskirts of the provincial metropolis that the proposed new social contract would ensure the rights and economic opportunities to the oppressed people. He said that a new social contract was one of the QWP demands. On this occasion, scores of people from different political parties along with their family members and supporters announced to join the QWP. He said that they really appreciated the demand made by Nawaz Sharif, which he said was also a demand of Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao.
He said that the QWP believed in democratic and peaceful struggle to achieve rights of the people through constitutional and democratic means. He further said that in spite of aggression and violent measures taken against the QWP, its leaders and workers rendered great sacrifices and made peaceful endeavours for their political goals.
Sikandar said that the federal government should realise importance of maintaining a strong federation by ensuring provision of rights to smaller federating units and added that the provinces should be given complete control over their natural resources.
He said that Pakhtuns had rendered matchless sacrifices for creation and stability of this country, but their sacrifices had been ignored and they were deprived of their rights and resources in the country despite the passage of 70 long years.
The QWP, he said, is the real representative of Pakhtuns and we have to work hard for securing the rights of Pakhtuns. The QWP will leave no stone unturned for the rights of Pakhtuns, he added.

Kyle Whitehill, currently CEO of Liquid Telecom and previously CEO of Vodafone Qatar, will take up the role from April 3.

Air Canada (AC.TO) has apologized and offered compensation for bumping a 10-year-old off a flight, the boy's father said on Monday, after the Canadian family's story sparked headlines following a high-profile incident involving overbooking by U.S. carrier United Airlines.
Brett Doyle said his family, who first tried unsuccessfully to check in his older son online, was told at the airport there was no seat available for the boy on an oversold flight from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, to Montreal, where they were connecting to a flight to a Costa Rica vacation last month.
The entrepreneur from Prince Edward Island said the family of four then drove to Moncton, New Brunswick, to catch a different flight to Montreal only to discover at the airport that it had been canceled.
"I thought it was a joke, that there were hidden cameras or something," he recalled by phone from Charlottetown.
Doyle said the family contacted Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, in March, but only received an apology and the offer of a C$2,500 trip vouchers after the story was published by a Canadian newspaper on Saturday.
Air Canada could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment. An airline spokeswoman told the Canadian Press: “We are currently following up to understand what went wrong and have apologized to Mr. Doyle and his family as well as offered a very generous compensation to the family for their inconvenience.”
Doyle, whose family finally arrived in Montreal and was able to connect to Costa Rica, said he understood the public outcry after a 69-year-old passenger was dragged from his seat on a United plane in Chicago on April 9 to make space for crew members.
"People are fed up," he said of airline overbooking. "You shouldn't be able to sell something twice."
United's parent company, United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), which is still recovering from the public relations debacle, apologized again on Monday for the passenger's forceful removal, while reporting quarterly earnings.
Doyle said the incident on United Flight 3411, which spread rapidly on social media after being shot on video by passengers, resonated with his family. "I ... said things could always be worse," he said after hearing about the United incident. "At least we weren't thrown off the plane."

Bristol remains implacably divided in its opinions of cycling and cyclists.
So when Bristol Post editor Mike Norton joined the conversation, writing about why he thought change in favour of cyclists is needed, we didn't expect the city to agree, be it uniting in praise or in condemnation.
And, true to form, Mike's article, published on Wednesday, January 31, sparked a huge response from readers on both sides of the debate, being shared over 300 times and attracting hundreds more comments.
While some agreed with the argument that cycling needs to be made safer, others took issue with the behaviour of individual cyclists they say they see breaking the rules and risking their own and other people's lives daily.
Here is a small collection of some of those comments:
Ruth Andrews commented on Facebook: “Many cyclists are a danger - they should have to pass a test, pay road tax and have insurance like motorists. I frequently see them going through traffic lights on red - no lights at night - weaving dangerously among cars and pedestrians and wizzing over zebra crossings to name a few.”
It's worth mentioning that road tax was abolished in 1937 and drivers instead pay vehicle tax which is based on CO2 emissions of the car.
Phil Stenner said: “Cyclists already pay tax towards the roads, as it comes from general taxation. Why should they pay more? Cyclists aren't damaging roads... Maybe there should be an extra tax based on wear and tear whacked onto drivers? As for the licensing reducing theft... it doesn't seem to have stopped motorbike theft, which is rife right now so I can't see why it would be any more preventative for pushbikes.”
Ian Johnston said: “I travel along the ring road pretty much every day through the roadworks on the [Bromley Heath] viaduct. At each end of the cycle path next to the busy road works is a huge sign that tell cyclists to dismount, never once have I seen one do so, instead they balance along a narrow path risking their lives and others. I also witness on a daily basis cyclists undertaking cars at roundabouts and then are surprised when they end up hanging off someone's wing mirror!! I also see cyclists weaving through traffic at red lights!”
Chris Davies said: “Why some cyclists think they have the right to cycle on the pavement when there is a cycle road opposite (by the Polish church is a favourite - only room for one walker) is beyond me. As a non-driver I don't appreciate having to jump into traffic because apparently I have no rights to walk on a pavement”
Michael Biggins said: “Cycle lanes aren't the answer in this city. Too often shared with bus lanes, junctions and parked vehicles, so they're completely unsafe to use.
"Bike routes should be completely separate and should join the areas where people live and work. From where I am it's basically impossible to sensibly cycle to work but it's a 10 minute drive.”
The article also sparked discussion in the Bristol Cyclists Facebook page, which has over 4,000 members.
Some raised concerns about segregated cycle lanes, suggesting that instead a combination of cycle lanes and shared roads would be better.

A 21-year-old man who caused a collision last year, which left a woman dead in north Edmonton, has been sentenced to four years and three months in prison.
Last month, Eric Lestar pleaded guilty to impaired driving causing death in the crash that killed 50-year-old Joann Christou. She was a wife, mother of four and grandmother of three when she died.
The Crown had asked for a five-year prison sentence with a five-year driving prohibition. The defence sought a three-year prison sentence.
The judge ruled there weren't enough aggravating factors to warrant a full five-year prison sentence but did ban Lestar from driving for five years, during Monday's sentencing.

Provincial court Judge Larry Anderson said he chose a higher sentence to send a message and deter other people from committing the same mistake Lestar did.
“All things considered, I think it was a just sentence,” defence lawyer James Raworth said outside the Edmonton Law Courts Monday morning.
“I think he took into consideration all the various factors that made this case unique, and as well as properly applying the law and Judge Anderson is a highly experienced judge, and I'll say that I'm confident that he came with the right conclusion — a just decision was rendered today.”
Raworth said his client was resigned to his fate, adding he was a “normal, nice, 21-year-old kid” who made a horrible mistake.
“That's what makes it so tragic is the victim and the accused person are just normal people. They aren't criminals. They aren't people that spend their life in the criminal world.”
Family reacts to sentence
Christou's son Ian Harris said the family was quite pleased with the sentence.
“For most of us, this is what we needed to carry on. This puts an end to waiting to hear and the stresses of dealing with the judicial system,” Harris said, adding personally this is what he needed to finish his healing and carry on with his life.
“My journey has been rough,” Harris said, adding after his mom's death, he developed severe depression, severe anxiety, a mood disorder, and was diagnosed with PTSD from watching some of the witness videos taken at the scene of the crash.
“I attempted suicide in May — thankfully I failed. And right now I'm doing actually pretty good. I did the therapy — it works, it helped, and I'm taking care of myself.”
Harris said while the family accepts Monday's outcome, he would like to see minimum sentencing for impaired driving causing death.
“Why we don't have minimum sentencing and why it's not harsher is beyond me. It's illogical and it doesn't make sense,” he said, adding there's no excuse for drunk driving because the dangers are so well known.
“Until the public makes statements and goes to their MPs to say, ‘Hey, we need to raise the minimum sentence,' unfortunately this stuff is going to keep happening. Four years is a drop in the bucket for taking someone's life.”
What happened on the day of the crash
On Oct. 24, 2016, Christou's blue Nissan Xterra SUV was heading north on 97 Street near 160 Avenue, when it was struck from behind by a white Infiniti G37 being driven by Lestar.

Before the crash, Lestar had been at a pub a few blocks south of the collision scene, where he had been served three pints of beer. He drank two and a half of them before leaving, according to the agreed statement of facts.
The Crown said the beer contributed to some, but not all of the alcohol in Lestar's system. The statement of facts said the bar — Jox's Taphouse and Grill — was not able to provide police with any business records or surveillance video showing how much he drank there.
After leaving the bar, Lestar drove north on 97 Street, cutting off vehicles in the afternoon rush hour traffic as he merged from the left to the right side of the three-lane road.
He had just passed the 160 Avenue intersection when his speeding car came up behind Christou's SUV. He attempted to swerve around her, but other vehicles were in the way. At that point, the two vehicles collided.
The speed limit on the section of road where the crash happened is 70 km/h. The Crown said witnesses estimate Lestar's vehicle was driving between 100km/h and 120 km/h.
The Crown said Lestar never slowed down before the collision, as there were no skid or tire marks on the pavement and witnesses never saw his brake lights turn on.
After colliding, the Nissan caught fire and both vehicles veered into the ditch, where Christou became trapped as the vehicle caught on fire. Several witnesses said the injured woman was on fire and screaming for help as the flames spread through the vehicle.

Several bystanders and an Edmonton police officer who came upon the scene attempted to save her. They tried to use fire extinguishers, but the flames were too fierce. One person even tried to use a knife to cut the vehicle open, but it was too late.
Christou was pronounced dead at the scene. The medical examiner determined Christou suffered a serious neck injury in the crash and her death was attributed to multiple injuries, not the fire.
It's believed the significant second- and third-degree burns found on her body happened after she died, which the medical examiner believes happened shortly after the fire broke out.
Paramedics arrived on scene to find Lestar sprawled across the front seats of his car, with his feet on the driver side and his head on the passenger seat.
The Crown said paramedics and police could smell alcohol on Lestar's breath from several feet away and noticed he had bloodshot eyes. They described him as being in good spirits and laughing as he was being treated.
Lestar was taken to Royal Alexandra Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. He had fractured ribs, a broken left foot, a bruised lung, and some cuts on his wrist and head.
While in hospital, Lestar initially agreed to give a blood sample, but later refused the police order when the physician showed up. Samples had been taken while he was being treated though, and police obtained a warrant to seize those.
Lestar's blood alcohol level between 179 to 211 milligrams of alcohol/100 mL of blood — almost three times the legal limit. The Crown says his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol and was the cause of the collision that killed Christou.

Airbnb CEO said company will ‘be ready to IPO next year' but might not
Airbnb brings in billions of dollars of revenue annually and is profitable on an EBITDA basis, so many wonders if and when the home-sharing company will go public. At the Code Conference today, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said the company will “be ready to IPO next year, but I don't know if we will.”
He added that he wants to make sure it's a major benefit to the company when Airbnb does go public. Following some more probing, Chesky said he has “no issues with [going public] at all. It could happen.”
Meanwhile, Airbnb has been struggling from a regulatory standpoint since at least 2010. Specifically, San Francisco and New York are two of the most difficult cities from a regulatory standpoint, Chesky said.
In New York, for example, there has been a standstill since 2010. At this point, Chesky said he expects it to take a few more years to overcome the challenge in New York.
“It doesn't seem like the end is in sight with that challenge,” Chesky said. That challenge, Chesky said, involves the hotel industry and unions that “have galvanized people in these perpetual battles.”
Another general critique of Airbnb is its effect on rising rent costs and displacement. Chesky added that if it was simply a business decision, “it probably wouldn't be worth it to stay there” in New York. But Chesky said there are hosts who have come to rely on Airbnb to earn income.
At Code, Chesky also touted Airbnb's experiences product and how it's growing 10x faster than its homes product. Airbnb Experiences sees 1.5 million bookings a year, Chesky said. Experiences, which Airbnb started testing in 2014 and officially launched in 2016, is Airbnb's product that helps travelers find things to do in cities throughout the world.
When it first launched, Airbnb didn't verify the experiences, but after some bad experiences, Airbnb has started verifying them.
“They're doing incredibly well,” Chesky said. He added that the “experience economy” is growing and “there will probably be a massive economy around experiences.”

PONDA
Believe it or not! Two government primary schools at Shiroda in Ponda taluka function without any teacher, while one school in Bandora in the same taluka is looked after by a part-time teacher for only three days a week as per information provided by Assistant District Education Inspector (ADEI) Ponda under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
When this reporter visited these schools, it was revealed that both the schools in Shiroda function under part-time English teachers unofficially; these teachers are actually appointed in other primary schools on a daily basis. In the Bandora school, a Kannada section teacher teaches Marathi medium students for three days a week.
As per information provided by the ADEI Ponda, all together, 162 full-time teachers and 41 part-time English teachers are appointed in various government primary schools of Ponda taluka for the current academic year.
Out of 111 functioning government primary schools in Ponda, no teachers are appointed in two primary schools – one located at Barbhat and the other at Tariwada in Shiroda, while the government primary school at Chirpute in Bandora (Marathi medium) functions with one part-time teacher deputed for three days a week. The government primary school at Barbhat in Shiroda has five students, while the government primary school at Tariwada in Shiroda has seven students. The government primary school at Chirpute in Bandora has four students, as per information provided under the RTI Act.
During a reality check done by this daily, it was revealed that both the government primary schools in Shiroda function under part-time English teachers unofficially (without any appointment) and these trained English teachers teach all the subjects to the students. Subjects taught by these teachers other than English include Marathi, math and science.
As per the information, the trained English teachers looking after the two government primary schools of Shiroda are officially appointed in some other schools on a daily basis (3 or 2 days a week in each primary) to teach English. But without any appointment and training, the ADEI has given them the responsibility of all primary schools in Shiroda. Interestingly, one of the teachers in these schools has difficulty in understanding Marathi herself, she is a student of English medium school. With this move of ADEI, five primary schools in Shiroda are deprived of trained English teachers, as the teachers appointed are diverted to the two primary schools at Shiroda which have no teachers.
In the case of the government primary school at Chirpute in Bandora, No full-time teacher is appointed in the Marathi section of the school, which has a Kannada section too. So the four students in the school are taught by a part-time English teacher for three days a week, while the other three days are managed by the Kannada teacher from the other section of the school.
It is also learnt from the sources that there are two more government primary schools in Ganjem and Kundaim which are run by English teachers, as the full-time teachers appointed in these schools are on maternity leave.
Information under the RTI Act has also revealed that out of the 111 government primary schools in Ponda, 32 schools have only one teacher teaching all the subjects, while 33 other schools have only one full-time teacher and one part-time teacher (only for 2 or 3 days a week).
When contacted, ADEI Pushpa Borkar said that the ADEI Ponda has a shortage of teachers and to avoid closure of schools, these adjustments are being made. “Otherwise, more schools would have closed down,” she said. She also confirmed that with regard to the adjustments, the teachers are not officially appointed but that the adjustments are done with mutual understanding.
It should be noted that at present around 3,158 students are studying in the 111 government primary schools of Ponda. Out of these, 784 students are studying in Class 1, 756 in Class 2, 780 in Class 3 and 838 in Class 4.
Iowa farmers are seeing soybean prices drop to the lowest level in a year, after China threatened a 25% tariff in response to threatened U.S. tariffs.
Purdue University Agricultural Economics Professor Wally Tyner says his research shows any tariff imposed by the Chinese would have only a minimal impact on producers in Iowa and elsewhere for at least a year.
“They buy their soybeans from us after our harvest in the fall through spring and then they buy from Brazil after the Brazil harvest in the spring until fall,” Tyner says. “So, they're going to buying Brazilian soybeans anyway between now and fall.”
The end result, he says, would be a very small impact between now into 2019 because Brazil wouldn't have time to react and increase its supplies.
Soybean prices as spiraling downward and Tyner has an explanation.
“Psychologically, markets overreact,” he says. “You've seen it over and over again, but they'll come back.”
Tyner says if the tariffs last for more than two years, producers would feel a much larger impact.

(Reuters Health) - Kids in daycare may not always learn about sun safety because their teachers are more focused on lessons about healthy food choices, brushing teeth and getting plenty of exercise, a U.S. study suggests.
Researchers surveyed 202 administrators, managers and teachers at Head Start and other daycare centers in Illinois in July, a time of year when kids are apt to be exposed to harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Overall, when participants ranked their top priorities for teaching toddlers and preschoolers healthy habits, good nutrition came first, followed by exercise, and brushing teeth. Less than one in five respondents listed bike helmets, vaccinations or sun protection as top priorities.
“The seasonal shift in sun intensity in Illinois means that sun safety receives less attention than health promotion activities that apply all year such as good nutrition, adequate exercise and brushing teeth,” said senior study author Dr. June Robinson of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
While about half of the daycare programs did provide sunscreen for students, 77 percent of these programs didn't allow kids to apply the sunscreen themselves, researchers report in JAMA Dermatology.
It's possible some daycare centers were following state regulations that apply to students starting in elementary school, which classify sunscreen as an over-the-counter medication that can only be applied by a school nurse with a doctor's prescription, Robinson said by email. Daycare centers aren't bound by these regulations, but it might still influence their decisions, Robinson said.
About half of the programs, however, used spray sunscreens to avoid unnecessarily touching children. This may be one way to help more children get protection, Robinson said by email.
“In the past, touching children, which is prohibited out of concerns about child abuse, prevented the application of the lotion type of sunscreen,” Robinson said.
Head Start programs were more likely to use spray sunscreen than other daycare centers, the study found. Often, programs that did use sprays failed to avoid spraying sunscreen directly on kids' faces, which can cause children to inhale it or get it in their eyes and isn't the correct way to apply this product.
Most programs did not report children having any sunburns, and most also followed guidelines for keeping kids out of the sun during when the heat index is too high.
One limitation of the study is that it only examined daycare centers in Illinois, and it's possible the results would be different in places with other regulations regarding sunblock application in schools or different seasonal weather, the authors note.
Still, the results highlight a need to raise awareness about the need for sun protection for kids in early childhood programs, said Dr. Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology and senior vice president for academic affairs at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan.
“It is totally appropriate and understandable that top concerns were good nutrition, adequate exercise, brushing teeth and wearing seat belts, but teachers need to be educated about the long term side effects of sun exposure,” Lim, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. “Aside from sunburn, teachers obviously would not observe the skin aging and skin cancers in their students; therefore, education is needed.”
Parents can also help make sun safety a priority, said Mary Tripp of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
“Parents can apply sunscreen lotion to children before they go to school and provide sunscreen for teachers to use at school,” Tripp, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.
“Parents also can provide wide-brimmed hats and other protective clothing such as shirts with longer sleeves for their children to use at school,” Tripp added. “By practicing sun protection themselves, parents can role model these behaviors for their children, which is critical in helping children develop these healthy habits at a young age.”

Police in Red Deer have laid charges against four people, including a man police had been investigating for about three weeks.
On March 14 at around 11 p.m., RCMP and members of the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Team (ALERT) stopped a black Jeep Patriot on Kerry Wood Drive near Bower Ponds in Red Deer.
Police said they set up tire deflation devices and were prepared for a high-risk takedown, should the vehicle attempt to flee police. Parts of the surrounding neighbourhood were also cordoned off, said RCMP Staff Sgt. Rob Marsollier.
However, the vehicle came to a stop after a short distance and the occupants were arrested without incident.
During the arrests, police said they found a loaded sawed-off shotgun under the driver's seat and a small amount of drugs including cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine and fentanyl.
One of the occupants of the vehicle was known to police and there were some safety concerns, Marsollier said.
“We wanted to be prepared for it,” said Marsollier. “There was definitely that concern they were not going to [stop].”
About 15 RCMP officers were used for the operation and tied up resources for that time period, Marsollier added.
Four people are now facing charges.
Quentin Lee Strawberry, 36, had warrants out for his arrest, including assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, weapons possession and failing to comply with conditions.
He now faces additional charges of:
Identity fraud;
Possession of weapon for a dangerous purpose;
Unauthorized possession of a firearm;
Possession of an unauthorized firearm while knowing possession was unauthorized;
Possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle;
Possession of a loaded prohibited firearm;
Two counts of weapons possession contrary to order;
Failing to comply with an undertaking;
Dustin Charles Miller Dumais, 26, was wanted on warrants including possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose, two counts of resisting/obstructing a peace officer, possession of stolen property, mischief, impaired operation of a motor vehicle, failing to comply with a demand, and three counts of failing to comply with conditions.
He now faces the following additional charges:
Possession of a weapon for dangerous purpose;
Unauthorized possession of a firearm;
Possession of an unauthorized firearm while knowing possession was unauthorized;
Possession of a firearm in a motor vehicle;
Possession of a loaded prohibited firearm;
Eight counts of failing to comply with conditions.
Dumais will appear in court on March 23, police said.
Megan Latter, 18, was also wanted on warrants.
Latter's warrants were issued for possessing identity documents, two-counts of failing to comply with conditions and failing to appear in court.
Latter now faces two additional charges of failing to comply with court-imposed conditions, police said.
Latter's next court appearance is on Tuesday, police said.
The fourth person, Shane Lee Milton Last, 27, was wanted by police on a warrant for allegedly using a forged document.

Veteran placekicker Robbie Gould is a free agent and the New York Giants have a decision to make. Bring him back because he is a reliable field goal kicker even if his range might be limited, and live with his woefully short kickoffs, or try to upgrade.
We recently debated the pros and cons of signing Los Angeles Rams‘ placekicker Greg Zuerlein. Arizona State's Zane Gonzalez might be a possibility if the Giants wanted to use a late-round draft pick on him.
Let's add another name to the list of potential Gould replacements. What about Steven Hauschka, who appears to be headed to free agency after the Seattle Seahawks signed former Minnesota Vikings kicker Blair Walsh?

“The California Department of Motor Vehicles has officially added Apple to its list of participants in its Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program,” Mark Hibben writes for Seeking Alpha. “Apple joins 29 other companies that include Google, Tesla, GM's Cruise LLC subsidiary, and Nvidia.”
“Participants are required to register with the DMV and comply with a special set of rules in order to perform testing on California public roads,” Hibben writes. “The fact that Apple was added to the list is seen as confirmation that Apple really is serious at least about developing an autonomous vehicle solution. But of course, we already knew that from Apple's letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) which at the time I saw as a sure sign that Project Titan was far from dead.”
“There may still be some argument about whether this indicates interest in a full-up Apple Car or merely that Apple intends to offer an autonomous vehicle solution to some other manufacturer. I continue to maintain the latter option is completely contrary to Apple's corporate culture,” Hibben writes. “Apple is not about software licensing… Apple is about providing beautifully integrated hardware/software solutions, and I believe that's what Apple Car will be.”

Four players scored in double digits to lead Coastal Carolina to an 85-73 win over Appalachian State and in the process, Head Coach Cliff Ellisrecorded his 800th career win.
Jaylen Shaw continues his torrid pace as he led the Chants in scoring with 20 points, including six straight free throws in the final seconds of the game.
Shaw only played 21 minutes due to foul trouble as he finished the game with four fouls. After picking up his fourth foul with 11:31 left in the game, he sat out the next seven minutes as the visitors cut a CCU 12 point lead to seven points and the first thing he did was pick up an assist and hit back-to-back baskets to help push the lead by out to 10 at 78-68.
Elijah Wilson scored 19 points, and moved into third place among the all-time leading scorers at CCU. He now has 1,636, only trailing Jack Leasure (1,893) and Tony Dunkin (2,151).
Shivaughn Wiggins continues to make an impact for the Chants finishing the game with 15 points, three assists, and five rebounds. Amidou Bamba was inserted into the starting lineup and finished with 12 points and six rebounds to go along with his three blocked shots.
CCU (9-9, 4-1 Sun Belt) shot 44 percent from the field and 32 percent of their threes. CCU struggled early from the free throw line, but rebounded to hit 24 of their 34 attempts for 71 percent.
Coastal Carolina also won the rebounding battle, but only by on 43-42.Demario Beck did his thing with a team-leading seven while Bamba and Wilson finished with six each.
The Coastal defense held Appalachian State (6-10, 1-4 Sun Belt) to 38 percent shooting. While they did manage to hit nine three point field goals, they only shot 29 percent as the Chants made them work hard to get those shots off.
Ronshad Shabazz led the visitors with 17 points, but was only one-of-seven on his three point attempts. Griffin Kinney and Emarius Logan also hit double digits with 11 points each.
The Chants carried a 44-33 lead into the locker room at halftime despite only hitting one of its last eight field goals. Wilson led the way with 15 points, which moved him into third place on the all-time scoring list.
Bamba, who moved into the starting lineup had eight first half points as the Chanticleers ended the half shooting 46 percent from the field and 39 from the three point line.
The visitors shot 38 percent from the field with Tyrell Johnson leading the way with eight and Shabazz with seven.
The Chanticleers are off Monday, but will be back in action next weekend when they make their first Sun Belt Conference trip into Georgia. They will face Georgia State Saturday Jan. 21 and Georgia Southern Monday Jan. 23 at 7 p.m.

Review: A good horror movie makes your heart leap out of your chest while simultaneously tugging at your heartstrings. And we're happy to report that Annabelle: Creation, the fourth installment in The Conjuring franchise, is emotionally potent and downright scary.
In pre-Barbie America, dollmaker Samuel Mullins (LaPaglia) lives on a ranch with wife Esther (Otto) and daughter Bee (Lee). The Mullins's happiness is short-lived; they're desolated by Bee's sudden death. Twelve years pass, and Samuel decides to turn his empty home into an orphanage for six girls. Even before the girls can settle in and play house, the house starts throwing new horrors at them every night. Best friends Janice (Bateman) and Linda (Wilson) become the first victims of Samuel's strange-looking locked-away doll, Annabelle.
The Conjuring movie universe grows inward and outward with prequels and sequels, each one delivering a terrifying new nightmare. The makers stick to old-school tactics of haunted houses, little-girl ghosts and jump-scares, but deliver coherent and effective movies.
Director David F. Sandberg, a master of anticipatory horror (you must see Lights Out), builds a tense atmosphere even while working with a banal plot. The formula is so plain that you'd think you know the movie, but Sandberg infuses jumps and starts so creatively that it becomes a dangerous game of peek-a-boo. With a huge house and six girls in the forefront, there's an unmissable The Conjuring vibe; a great reference to the previous (and undoubtedly inferior) Annabelle movie connects the universes perfectly. There are several sub-plots worthy of a spin-off.
The story of Janice could be especially interesting. Talitha Bateman is a scene-stealer; her cold stares and measured madness make you wary of Janice. As helpless parents, Otto and LaPaglia bring a tenderness to this terror-fest.
Having watched the previous films will help, but the movie is a legitimate standalone chiller. If there were a Horror For Dummies guidebook, Annabelle: Creation would make for a good chapter in it.

It's only when you're clear on your destination that you can plan a scale strategy to get there.
This year, BestSelf.Co was among the winners of Shopify's first Build a BIGGER Business competition. Singled-out for our innovative marketing of the SELF Journal (our flagship product and bestselling success tool), our prize included a week of mentoring with a few big names on Tony Robbins' Fiji hideaway.

This is what Tim Ferriss taught us about rapid, sustainable scaling during our one-to-one session.

1. Confirm your endgame.
Ferriss started out by telling us that because he didn't know a lot about our business, he was going to ask questions and then pull on the threads to extract the information he needed to advise us. We loved this approach because his sharp questions got us thinking, helped us get clarity and unlocked new trains of thought.
Just like in our one-to-one with Robbins, we talked with Ferriss about the importance of our big picture scale strategy -- in particular figuring out our endgame. Ferriss stressed the importance of understanding the ultimate goal for our business, and in particular, understanding what company we need to be if we want to do an exit.
It's only when you're clear on your destination that you can plan a scale strategy to get there. For example, building a company to sell requires a different approach to growing a business that supports a lifestyle.

2. Learn how businesses grow extremely quickly.
Once you've identified your endgame, the next step is to figure out what strategy will help you get there.
We talked with Ferriss about how many entrepreneurs see investment as the perfect solution. However, Ferriss warned us to be cautious about seeking early investment. He told us that investors often expect a 10-fold return, which makes investment the most expensive cash. What's more, not only will you give up equity (and therefore control over your business), but you'll feel more pressure because of the expectation to deliver. It's why you pay a very high price for the cash that you secure -- especially when you consider the other options that you have.

Instead, Ferriss suggests exploring alternatives to investment first so you can grow your business the way you want.
He also revealed the three stages that companies can go through to secure rapid growth.
Bootstrapping
This is where most of us start. You have an idea that you want to bring to market quickly so you can test it and see if it's got potential. For this stage of growth, crowdfunding is the perfect scale strategy because it allows you to prove an idea rapidly without taking a big financial risk.
Strategic advice
A fast-growing business will soon exceed the point where the founders can grow it alone. When you reach this point, strategic advisors can help you push through this growth hurdle and get to the next step. That's because the right strategic advice will shortcut your learning curve and become a catalyst for growth.
Ferriss explained that advisory needs will vary by business, but the type of advice you can leverage includes financial expertise, growth hacking, product development or logistics experience.
Related: Tim Ferriss: If You Have to Cut Your Sleep to Be Effective, Your Priorities Are Out of Order
Strategic advice can be informal too. For example, Ferriss emphasized the benefit of finding people who already have the results you want and then arrange to meet for coffee. Use this opportunity to not only discover the strategies used, but find out whether they'd do it the same way again -- or if they'd take a different approach. This, Ferriss explained, is a brilliant way to fast-track your growth.
Outside investment
Once advisors have fueled growth, the next step is to find an outside company to get to the next stage. For example, this might involve a venture capital company to fund with cash and resources or to help secure a merger with another company.
3. Overcome cash constraints creatively.
Regardless of your scale strategy, you will need cash to fund your growth and help you implement the actions necessary to take you to the next step.
Lack of cash can be a big hurdle for growing businesses, but fortunately, there are plenty of creative options you can explore before seeking investment and sacrificing equity.
Related: Tim Ferriss Says You Have the Wrong Idea About Fear, and It's Killing Your Dreams
Here's a summary of the ideas that Ferriss suggested to us:
Kickstarter and crowdfunding
This cash strategy launched BestSelf.Co. In fact, Kickstarter was a game-changer for us. Not only did we have proof of concept, but we secured over $320,000 to help create our first delivery of SELF Journals.
Creating a new revenue stream
Introducing a monthly subscription model is a smart strategy for any growing business. It's a long-term strategy too. That's because as well as creating a regular, predictable income stream, this model can help you secure a higher multiple should you wish to sell in the future.
Joint ventures
Working with someone else (who already serves your ideal client) is a quick and effective way to build your audience and create a greater pool of potential customers.

Selling your invoices
Financing your invoices is a flexible way to generate cash now. It can be useful if you want to boost cash flow immediately so you have the money you need to get your scale strategy moving.
Bank loans
Interest rates are relatively low right now, which means you could secure the cash you need without sacrificing any equity.
Apply Ferriss's advice to your business:
Our one-to-one with Ferriss was invaluable for helping us to figure out our plan of action for our next stage of growth. In terms of Ferriss's three scale strategies, we're currently at the stage where we need strategic advice. So, since returning from Fiji we've been figuring out what help we need to help accelerate us to the next step.
Here's an overview of how Ferriss's advice to us could help you, too:
Firstly, get clear on your endgame. You need to understand your desired destination before you can craft the scale strategy that will get you there. Next, figure out whether you need to bootstrap, hire advisors or build relationships with outside parties to get to the next stage of growth. Finally, get creative with your financing options. Remember, investment may look attractive, but there's a good chance other creative cash routes will serve you better at this moment in time.

The general perception is that dams are not a priority for the rulers who are busy making money in construction of roads and flyovers through kickbacks, surely there will be much more money to be made in construction of a mega structure like a dam.
It is a case of votes being more important than money, those opposing Kalabagh dam are minting votes by playing upon the fears of the voters, scaring them of floods at one end and desertification at the other end.
With anti Kalabagh dam sentiments running very high, any unilateral move by the PML-N government will cost it its vote bank in KP, Sindh and Balochistan, where support for PML-N is conditional to Kalabagh dam not being built without consensus.
Instead of blaming the government we should be blaming the politicians who have made the dam a bone of contention, the dam cannot even be mentioned, leave alone discussed, in the national assembly.
It is for the intelligentsia and the experts, with the help of the media, to debunk the falsehood that the dams have depleted the Indus river and reduced water supply to Sindh, when in fact the two dams have increased canal supplies by 20 maf, Sindh alone got an increase of 8.
9 maf (35.
6 to 44.
5) with which Sindh was able to cultivate an additional 20 lakh acres.
Until the time that good sense prevails no political party, in or out of govt, will want to commit political suicide.

The French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in France, and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes.
Modern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost; beginning during the 1950s; his work resulted in his first successful flight, on October 22, 1960. Today air balloons festivals are held everywhere. Festivals are arranged where people take flight of air balloons. One of the most famous air balloon festivals today is the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.
From a small gathering of 13 balloons in 1972, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta has grown to become the largest balloon event in the world. The festival is held in the first week of October and attracts almost 600 balloons and 1000 pilots.

Posted to: Election 2018
HARTFORD, CT — He fell short of the Republican Party's endorsement and believes the other Republican candidates running for governor are afraid to debate him.
Tim Herbst, the former first selectman of Trumbull, challenged his Republican colleagues to 10 debates before the primary.
“When I challenged the rest of the GOP field to 10 debates, I heard only crickets,” Herbst said Tuesday in a letter to the five other candidates who may appear on the ballot Aug. 14.
“That suggests my opponents intend to hide behind their checkbooks or a bold line on the ballot because they have no confidence in their ability to answer tough questions about their record, values or vision for restoring prosperity to Connecticut,” Herbst continued. “Their collective reluctance to debate betrays a lack of confidence and should sow doubt over their ability to win in November.”
Herbst is one of three candidates to automatically qualify for the Aug. 14 primary ballot. Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton received the party's endorsement and Westport businessman Steve Obsitnik received enough delegate support to qualify. There are three others — Bob Stefanowski, David Stemerman, and Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti — who are petitioning their way onto the ballot.
The Connecticut Republican Party scheduled one debate in all of the five congressional districts leading up to the party's nominating convention earlier this month. But the party has no plans to host any debates before the primary.
“It is no surprise that on the heels of losing the Connecticut GOP convention, and having not yet even apparently completed fundraising, that the Herbst campaign would clumsily try to deploy this time-honored campaign tactic of asking for so many debates in a vain effort to get some sort of recognition,” Marc Dillon, Boughton's campaign manager, said. “Connecticut needs a proven leader with a track record and temperament to get our state back on track. Mark Boughton will remain focused on bringing his message of fiscal conservatism and pro-economic growth directly to the people of Connecticut.”
Obsitnik's campaign didn't respond directly to Herbst's challenge for 10 debates, but said they welcomed the dialogue with voters.
“With less than 90 days to the August 14th primary, I think we can all agree that Republican voters deserve the chance to meet and hear from all of us,” Obsitnik said. “With this in mind, I propose that we as GOP candidates designate a town or city each week where we can bring in the local media to help moderate a series of debates where we as Republicans engage on the critical issues facing the next governor of Connecticut.”
The Stefanowski, Stemerman, and Lauretti campaigns did not respond or declined requests for comment.
There are already several gubernatorial debates scheduled before the primary.
At 7 p.m., June 11 the Connecticut Association of Realtors will host a debate at the Shubert in New Haven and WFSB Channel 3 will host one at 7 p.m., June 13, in their Rocky Hill studios.
There's another Republican debate sponsored by the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges at 6 p.m., Aug. 6, at Fairfield University, and a handful more that will include the Democratic gubernatorial candidates, including one on June 7 at the University of Hartford that will be broadcast on CPTV. The Connecticut Technology Council will host a forum starting at 9:30 a.m., June 13, at the Trumbull Marriott, and Trinity College will host a forum on climate change at 6 p.m., July 12.
It's unclear if the petitioning candidates will be allowed to participate in all of the debates and forums.
Stefanowski refused to participate in all five of the Republican Party's debates leading up to the convention. Stemerman participated in the last two and Lauretti participated in four of the five.

With 10 days left for members to vote, SAG-AFTRA's national election is seeing plenty of attacks as the union's two major factions denounce each other in a bid to sway the 144,000 performer members.
The minority Membership First group, headed by Esai Morales, has accused the dominant Unite for Strength of bungling the recent negotiations for a new contract, which was ratified by membership on Aug. 7 by a 76-24 margin. The union's negotiating committee was led by president Gabrielle Carteris, who's seeking re-election.
“There are over 450 scripted television programs — yet it's harder than ever for working actors to make a living or get pension and health credits … Because the contracts haven't kept up with the marketplace,” Membership First said. “We do not support the new travel provisions. It's a huge give-away that obliterates decades long negotiated travel provisions that benefited performers.”
Membership First is also accusing Carteris and her allies of selling out to SAG-AFTRA's staff. “Above all we want our union to actually be governed by the membership,” the faction said. “Not board members who accede to every staff whim and want.”
Unite for Strength has hit back by accusing Morales of being negligent in his role as first VP of the union's Los Angeles local by not attending 33 of the 35 board meetings over the past five years. “Leaders show up. #SAGAFTRA President @TheGabrielle_C shows up.. and then some,” the faction tweeeted.
Leaders show up. #SAGAFTRA President @TheGabrielle_C shows up.. and then some. Vote like your union depends on it: https://t.co/aO2oivPeZL pic.twitter.com/439WNBENSh — Unite for Strength (@unite4strength) August 12, 2017
Independents Pete Antico, Robert Martin Jr., and Marilyn Monrovia are also running for the office. Carteris pushed for members to ratify the union's three-year deal with production companies covering film and primetime TV work. Morales and Antico campaigned against ratification, saying the contract falls particularly short in travel provisions, basic cable, and residuals. The two sides have also been touting their endorsements. Unite for Strength has received backing from George Clooney, Octavia Spencer, Ron Perlman, Betty White, Bryan Cranston, Josh Gad, Rhea Perlman, S. Epatha Merkerson, Katie Barberi, and Bertila Damas; Membership First has been endorsed by Rosanna Arquette, Ed Asner, Jason Bateman, Mireille Enos, Elliott Gould, Ed Harris, Laraine Newman, Nancy Sinatra, and Cindy Williams. The union election also covers election of many of the members of the 80-seat national board. Unite for Strength and its allies control the board while Membership First has about a dozen seats.
SAG-AFTRA has about 160,000 members but ballots went out only to the 144,000 members who were paid up on their dues. The film-TV deal, reached on July 4, covers more than $1 billion in annual earnings by members.
As per the alleged reports, Bajaj will build a 400cc addiction to the Avenger lineage and might soon unveil the brand new mid-capacity engine motorcycle in India.
The current Bajaj Avenger range includes Avenger Street 150, 220 and Cruise 220 and the upcoming Bajaj model might share its engine with the Dominar 400 and the KTM 390 Duke.
The Dominar 400 is powered by a 373.3 cc, triple spark four-valve DTS-i fuel injection, liquid cooled engine with 33 hp and 35 Nm of torque.
The Bajaj's upcoming new motorcycle, on the other hand, is expected to be powered by a mid-capacity engine that will compete with a Royal Enfield motorcycle.
The company might also offer the motorcycle with ABS (Antilock Braking System) as an option along with telescopic forks at the front and conventional twin shock absorbers at the rear.
Loading... Monitoring solar activity Access the video
Where no mission has gone before
Living near a star is risky business, and positioning a spacecraft near the Sun is a very good way to observe rapidly changing solar activity and deliver early warning of possibly harmful space weather. ESA is now looking at doing just that. On most days, our normally calm Sun goes about its business, delivering a steady and predictable amount of heat and light that keeps planet Earth and its humans ticking. But just as the Sun drives weather on Earth, solar activity is responsible for disturbances in our space environment, dubbed ‘space weather'. Besides emitting a continuous stream of electrically charged atomic particles, the Sun periodically sneezes out billions of tonnes of material threaded with magnetic fields in colossal-scale ‘coronal mass ejections'. These immense clouds of matter usually miss Earth, but if one reaches us it can disrupt Earth's protective magnetic bubble and upper atmosphere, affecting satellites in orbit, navigation, terrestrial power grids, and data and communication networks, among other effects.
Getting a view of the action Solar loops after eruption Obtaining warnings of such events would be immensely helpful: a recent ESA study estimated the potential impact in Europe from a single, extreme space weather event could be about €15 billion. As just one example, even moderate space weather events can affect electrical power grids that supply electricity to homes, hospitals and schools. Improved warning times for larger events would allow grid operators to take measures to protect their networks and ensure continued power delivery. “One of the best ways to observe rapidly changing solar activity is to position a dedicated spacecraft slightly away from our direct line to the Sun, so that it can observe the ‘side' of our star before it rotates into view,” says Juha-Pekka Luntama, responsible for space weather at ESA's mission control centre, Darmstadt, Germany.
Virtual points in space One of these, the 5th Lagrange point, lags 60º degrees behind Earth in its orbit – an ideal location for monitoring mass ejections from the ‘side' so as to give early warning and better estimates of the speed and direction.
The Lagrange points associated with the Sun–Earth system “L5 is an excellent spot for a future ESA space weather mission because it gives advance views of what's happening at the Sun,” says Juha-Pekka. “The spacecraft would provide crucial data that will help us spot Earth-arriving ejections, improve our forecasts of the arrival time at Earth and provide advance knowledge of active regions on the Sun as they rotate into view.” First-ever mission to L5 Today, ESA began studies to examine exactly this concept. Four European industrial and scientific consortiums including leading experts on space systems and instrument design will develop concepts for flying a mission to L5. Based on the results, ESA will select a final design in about 18 months.
Proba-2 This space weather mission would provide data for operational applications such as forecasts and nowcasts of solar activity. These are part of ESA's Space Weather Service Network, which will issue warnings and alerts to scientific, commercial and civil customers when solar activity poses any risk to critical civil and economic activities.
The Caru Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is the plaintiff in a lawsuit against a Vallejo woman they are accusing of operating a puppy mill on Carolina Street.
The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 5, claims that Susan Anthony, owner and operator of California Carolina Dogs on the 900 block of Carolina Street, has held “as many as 50 dogs” on her property in an illegal kennel and “has generated numerous complaints of strong odors, flies, dog bites, unsanitary breeding conditions, and dogs running at large,” according to the filing.
The lawsuit notes that Anthony has been given several warnings over the years, the most recent in May, when she was ordered to cease operation of her dog kennel by the city of Vallejo.
An inspector noted that “no less than five dogs” were seen in the front yard area, and that they “could hear additional dogs on the site.”
Vallejo limits the number of dogs a property can hold to four, unless they are in a licensed kennel.
In January of 2016, an officer reported seeing “about 20 dogs through the fence,” according to the lawsuit, and that the dogs were unlicensed and unvaccinated. In May of that same year an officer reported seeing “at least 50” dogs on her property.
One inspection appears to be in reaction to a letter sent to the city alleging that Anthony's business needed to be examined. “It's time to put an end to the nasty illegal dog breeding business going on,” reads a letter on the public record (name redacted).
Complaints against her business go back to at least 2015. The lawsuit alleges that Anthony agreed to surrender the dogs at one point but failed to do so.
Despite being warned by the city, Vallejo has yet to have attempted to shut down Anthony's business. It's for this reason that the suit has been brought, according to Christopher Berry, an attorney for The Animal Legal Defense Fund, an organization also involved in the lawsuit.
“There just aren't enough resources to shut all of the puppy mills down,” said Berry. “We hope that by filing this lawsuit we will make an impact.”
The suit was filed with the aim of getting a court order to shut down California Carolina Dogs, said Berry. They are not asking for damages.
Anthony did not respond to a request for comment by press time, but she told a television news agency that she has undergone a “history of harassment” and that both her dogs and neighbors are “happy.”
“Allegations of unsanitary conditions are unfounded,” she is quoted as saying.
Opponents of the coal-fired power plant project in Krabi province were told by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha to not come to Bangkok to hold a protest, but to wait for a decision from the Energy Ministry about the project on Friday.

LOS ANGELES—A Bachelor in Paradise contestant says she's a “victim” of events that put the reality show's production on hold.
In a statement Wednesday, Corinne Olympios said she has hired a lawyer to “obtain justice,” in her words.
She also said she's seeking therapy to deal with what she called the physical and emotional trauma she experienced June 4.
Olympios said she has little memory of what occurred.
The company behind ABC's Bachelor in Paradise suspended production and sent contestants home while looking into allegations of misconduct on the set in Mexico.
On March 27, 88-year-old Bob Tallinger was working as a greeter when a wild turkey entered the Waukesha, Wisconsin, Walmart store he'd been employed for 8-years.
According to ABC Affiliate WISN, Tallinger described the event as follows: “It starts, and it goes back around, and then it walks out.”
Mark Hess, an official with the Humane Animal Welfare Society, was called out to the scene.
“They were able to shoo the bird out, but they said he wouldn't leave. So, I drove out to Walmart and I saw two ladies playing with a turkey in the patio section of the Walmart,” Hess said.
Hess caught the bird, and Tallinger went about his work day.
Anyone who received a parking ticket in Saskatoon on July 2, or paid for parking, will be getting a refund.

COEBURN, Va. -- Tracy Stallard, the pitcher who gave up Roger Maris' record 61st home run in 1961, has died. He was 80.
The Sturgill Funeral Home in Coeburn, Virginia, said Monday that Stallard died Wednesday at the Holston Valley Medical Center in Kingsport, Tennessee.
He was on the mound for Boston in 1961 when Maris broke the single-season record that Babe Ruth had held since 1927. The record stayed until 1998.
Stallard went 30-57 with a 4.17 career ERA while pitching for the Red Sox (1960-62), New York Mets (1963-64) and St. Louis Cardinals (1965-66).
His funeral was Sunday at the Sturgill Funeral Home.
“The green idyll of the village of Snape and its environs is under threat, menaced by the prospect of a giant car park to serve the increasing number of visitors to the area.

Max Pacioretty is one of several names being floated around the NHL as possible trade bait. Before Thursday night's game between the visiting Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes, I pondered the colossal impact of Pacioretty telling his teammates “See ‘ya later” and donning a Hurricanes sweater. Like Phil Kessel going to the Pittsburgh Penguins a couple of years ago, the benefits to the Hurricanes if they could get a player like Pacioretty are huge.
Hurricanes Need a Scorer
The fact that the Hurricanes need a scoring forward is no great revelation. In fact, at last year's postseason press conference, head coach, Bill Peters made it known to general manager Ron Francis that he really hoped Francis would get a scoring forward during the offseason.
Peters made his point-blank plea first by acknowledging that if they had to, Elias Lindholm and Sebastian Aho could play at center (emphasis on if they had to). But, he clearly noted that this was not the best scenario and summarized the point by saying:
So, those are the conversations we have to have. We might agree, we might disagree. But, I don't want to put a guy in a situation hoping without knowing. I want to know that when a person plays a position, that he's capable of playing that position.” Translation: Francis, for a second time, was pleading, “Get me a center.”
Francis instead concentrated on trying to upgrade the goalie position, bringing in Scott Darling to replace Cam Ward as the starter. As hindsight is 20/20, perhaps Francis should have heeded Peters' request and addressed the scoring needs of the team. Darling, much like Eddie Lack before him, has not been what Francis hoped for in goal.
Of course, Darling could press the reset button and still play up to his potential but, at this point in the season, the goalie situation is at least manageable with Ward, particularly with a February home-heavy schedule. But, the Hurricanes still desperately need a player to give them an offensive boost. Pacioretty could be that player.
A Case for Pacioretty
Pacioretty is a proven scorer. He has multiple 30-goal seasons under his belt during his 10 years in the NHL, all with the Canadiens. He is a steady, reliable piece of the Habs' puzzle, but still, there are rumors he might be available. In fact, Omar White wrote at Fansided a couple of days ago that a deal for Pacioretty might be happening within a few days. White wrote:
The Montreal Canadiens have had trade talks around Max Pacioretty for a while, and apparently, a move involving him is coming within the next few days.
That he is available would be good for the Hurricanes. But, White also wrote that the Habs and the St. Louis Blues have been rumored to be trying to get a deal done involving Pacioretty. Obviously, that would not be so good for the Hurricanes.
The Habs are supposedly hoping to replace Pacioretty with a young center or defenseman. At least part of their wishlist is realistic where the Hurricanes are concerned. The team has good depth at the defensive position, and could fairly easily offer up a defenseman in exchange for Pacioretty. Even so, Connor Lapalme wrote at Last Word on Hockey, that it's time to start a bidding war for Pacioretty.
Lapalme's reasoning is that Pacioretty's slump earlier this season, combined with being extremely hot right now scoring in eight of his last 10 games, makes him a valuable commodity and therefore the Habs should not wait until the trade deadline to deal him. Lapalme wrote:
Teams may have been hoping to get him on the cheap because of his poor play but Pacioretty has found his game. Max finding his game will only help his trade value heading towards the deadline.
It is true that the closer we get to the deadline the crazier things will be, so my thought here is that Lapalme has a valid point. The Canadiens should deal him while he is hot – if they are going to deal him.
The bottom line is that the Hurricanes need a player like Pacioretty to help boost their goal scoring and he might be available to pick up before the trade deadline.
The Habs may have already set in motion a deal with another team but, if there is still time, Francis should throw the Hurricanes' hat in the ring and go hard after Pacioretty. He represents a piece of the puzzle that has been missing for some time for the ‘Canes and could make their hopes of getting into the playoffs a lot more realistic.
OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- The Baltimore Ravens dealt with a strange trend two years ago, when five players went on injured reserve in the exact order their lockers stood next to each other.
That terrible run of luck has now taken its toll on the Ravens' 2016 draft class.
Seven of the 11 players taken in that draft by Baltimore either spent last season on injured reserve or will go on IR to start this year. On Friday, starting left guard Alex Lewis became the third player from that draft class to get declared out for this season -- and the Ravens are only one game into the preseason.
Feel the pain Here is a look at how injuries have impacted the Ravens' 2016 draft class. Pos. Round Injury Ronnie Stanley OT First Missed four games last season (foot) Kamalei Correa LB Second Placed on IR in Week 16 last season (ribs) Bronson Kaufusi DE Third Spent all of last season on IR (ankle) Tavon Young CB Fourth Will spend this season on IR (ACL) Chris Moore WR Fourth Missed two weeks of last year's training camp (foot) Alex Lewis OL Fourth Will spend this year on IR (shoulder) Willie Henry DL Fourth Placed on IR in Week 11 last season (thigh) Kenneth Dixon RB Fourth Will spend this season on IR (knee) Matt Judon LB Fifth Did not miss any games last year due to injury Keenan Reynolds WR Sixth Was not injured last season when he was member of practice squad Maurice Canady CB Sixth Placed on IR in Week 5 last season (thigh)
"I would say maybe I'm superstitious," said offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley, the No. 6 overall pick in 2016. "Definitely have to find the cause of that. That'd be a good thing to be fixed."
Stanley is one of four players from the 2016 draft class not to suffer a season-ending injury last year or this year.
In their rookie seasons, linebacker Kamalei Correa (ribs), defensive end Bronson Kaufusi (ankle), defensive lineman Willie Henry (thigh) and cornerback Maurice Canady (thigh) spent a combined 37 games on injured reserve.
Injuries have been just as relentless on this class this year, when cornerback Tavon Young (torn ACL), running back Kennth Dixon (knee) and Lewis all went down with season-ending injuries. Canady also will miss significant time this season with a knee injury.
"It's just part of the game," Reynolds said. "I don't really think about it. You can't worry about it. You have to play fast and let everything else take care of itself."
This draft class has the potential to stand out beyond the injury bug. Stanley, Lewis and Young all started last season, and Correa and Judon started the preseason opener at linebacker. Kaufusi, Dixon, Moore and Canady can develop into impact players, as well.
The key is to stay healthy.
"You notice [the injuries] and you pray for your teammates and hope they get better," Moore said. "When you're out there, you just have to ignore it and try to keep playing the best you can and not worry about it."
CLEVELAND -- The Indians are working on a treatment plan for All-Star reliever Andrew Miller's sore right knee.
Miller, on the disabled list for the second time this season, visited a specialist Wednesday in New York. Manager Terry Francona said Thursday he intends to meet with Miller, the team's medical staff, and president Chris Antonetti to "map out what we want to do."
Francona anticipates the team releasing more information Thursday, when the club opens a four-game series in Minnesota.
Antonetti said Wednesday that surgery is not currently an option.
Miller, 33, played catch in the outfield before Thursday's game against the Chicago White Sox. He was on the DL twice last season with patella tendinitis.
One of baseball's most dominant relievers, Miller hasn't been effective since coming off the DL on May 11. He opened the season with 10 scoreless innings before hurting his left hamstring.
He is 1-3 with a 4.40 ERA in 17 appearances.
Work Can Be Stressful, Dangerous And Sometimes Great

If you think your job is more stressful than it should be, you're not alone.
Americans work hard, and it takes a physical and mental toll, not to mention that it frequently cuts into personal time, according to a comprehensive survey on working conditions the nonpartisan RAND Corporation published Monday. But having a good boss and good friends on the job can make work feel less taxing.
In 2015, RAND researchers, along with Harvard Medical School and the University of California, Los Angeles, began collecting data from over 3,000 people from all income and education levels who work or have worked in all types of jobs. What they discovered about how we work may help inform policymakers looking to grow the economy and employers looking to retain the best workers.
This kind of data, examining workplace conditions in the U.S., has not been collected for decades. "We have excellent data on wages, on training ... but we don't know much about the conditions of work," says Nicole Maestas, an economist and associate health care policy professor at Harvard Medical School who is the lead researcher on this study.
What the researchers found was that more than 1 in 4 Americans surveyed say they don't have enough time to do their jobs, with about half of Americans reporting that they do some work in their free time. This was most prevalent among white-collar workers. Two-thirds of all workers say they frequently work under tight deadlines or at high speed.
In addition, 1 in 5 reported experiencing verbal abuse, threats, humiliating behavior or unwanted sexual attention at work in the past month; or they experienced bullying, harassment or sexual harassment in the past year.
"One thing that really struck me was the high prevalence of hostile social interactions at work," says Maestas. Her survey found that while such interactions were seen across the board, verbal abuse was much more common in customer service jobs and experienced at the highest rates among men who did not graduate from college. Younger women and women of "prime age," defined in the survey as ages 35-49, experienced the most unwanted sexual attention.
But people who have "good" bosses — or bosses who respect them, praise them, work with them and give feedback — were less likely to have workers who reported verbal or physical threats, Maestra notes.
"Maybe bad bosses are part of the problem," she says, when it comes to a hostile work environment.
American workers feel, by and large, that they have a reasonable amount of autonomy on the job and are confident in their skills. Still, many workers, particularly those in service jobs and without a college degree, have little control over their work schedules. Some experience schedule changes the day of work or the day before.
New York and San Francisco have passed laws requiring employers to make schedules more predictable, and Oregon may become the first state to require at least a week's notice of duty hours for certain service jobs so employees can plan doctors' appointments and child care and get to their second jobs.
Despite multiple studies showing the benefits of telecommuting, it is still a rare option for many workers. The RAND survey found that 78 percent of employees are required to show up at their workplaces during regular business hours.
No matter where we work, friendships play an important role in how we perceive our jobs. Sixty-one percent of women agree with the statement "I have very good friends at work," while 53 percent of men agreed.
While the emotional support helps, many jobs are simply tough on the body. Seventy-five percent of people surveyed report intense or repetitive physical exertion on the job at least 25 percent of the time. While workers who don't have a college education report greater physical challenges on the job — think health care aides and construction workers — college-educated and older workers face significant physical challenges as well, particularly in the medical and sales fields where they are lifting heavy items and on their feet most of the day.
The physical exertion of their jobs may be why some older Americans retire early. It's also a prime consideration for many seniors who say they would consider going back to work for the "right" job, Maestas says.
"We've got more people retiring than ever, and there just aren't enough younger workers to both release retirees and grow the economy," she says, so employers should take notice of workplace conditions if they want to retain older, experienced workers.
Additionally, 55 percent of workers report they are exposed to physical risks like smoke, fumes, infectious materials, extreme temperatures and vibrations from hand tools about 25 percent of the time. "That was strikingly high," Maestas says.
Saba Waheed, the research director at UCLA's Labor Center who was not involved in the study, says she was also surprised by the extent of the health and safety challenges revealed in the survey.
"We have a lot of great laws, but we need better enforcement," she says.
While she largely praises the survey's comprehensiveness, Waheed says she would have like to see how workers fared along hourly versus non-hourly lines, as well as the experiences reported by part-time versus full-time workers. "I would really love to see race in here," she says, as well.
Maestas says that the survey did not break down workers by race because doing so would have resulted in numbers too small to be statistically significant.
The American Working Conditions Survey is based on a European workplace survey conducted every five years. Maestas and her team plan to compare the U.S. data with European data in 2018.
The survey was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Social Security Administration.

SADIQABAD - A man threw acid in her sister-in-law's face over suspicion that she had cast a spell on him in Sadiqabad City police precincts.
Khalida Parveen, resident of Tibba Zahir Peer, told the police that her husband Asghar Ali was on work when his brother Sarwar came and threw acid in her face, alleging that she had cast a spell on him. She said that on her hue and cry, people gathered at their house at which the accused fled away. "The acid burnt my arm and legs," she added. The police registered a case against the accused and started investigation.
The owner of a device with a suspicious battery that prompted an evacuation of portions of the Charleston International Airport early Friday morning was questioned, released and was rebooked on his flight.
"We found a suspicious device this morning around 5 a.m. It was suspicious enough that we called in EOD to look at it. We took all the precautions in the world," Charleston County Aviation Authority Executive Director and CEO Paul Campbell said. "Everything went off exactly as the protocol called for."
TSA agents determined an iPad in a screening machine appeared suspicious, according to a statement from the airport. As a result, screening operations were halted and passengers waiting to go through the checkpoint were asked to evacuate the building while airport police and the Charleston County Sheriff's Office Bomb Squad were called in to investigate.
The iPad was removed and its owner was detained for questioning.
After an investigation by the TSA, the FBI and the Charleston County Sheriff's Office, the bomb squad determined the device was not a threat.
The owner of the device, who was held for questioning, was released and rebooked on his flight, Campbell said.
After a nearly two-hour delay, the airport resumed operations at approximately 7 a.m.
Campbell released the following statement on the incident:
"Safety is always our first priority. We are not going to sacrifice safety for any reason. I am pleased with how everything was handled this morning. I applaud the passengers who responded appropriately. No one panicked and they evacuated in an orderly fashion. Our police responded quickly and did a great job assisting our passengers and securing the area so the Bomb Squad could do its work. TSA and CHS did a terrific job responding to the incident and afterward worked efficiently to screen passengers so they could resume their travels."
After the scare, the entrance to the airport reopened and traffic that backed up past Boeing because of the incident has begun to move again.
Passengers reported that they were taken back out through security with many waiting on a parking deck while authorities investigated the package.
Airport operations are resuming. Expect lines as we work to get you travels under way today. Please check your flight status with your airline. Thank you for your patience. — CharlestonSC Airport (@iflyCHS) February 2, 2018
The entrance to the Airport is now open. We are able to get up to the passenger drop off. @Live5News #chsnews pic.twitter.com/GYN6dfT41T — Alissa Holmes (@AlissaLive5) February 2, 2018
TSA lines moved quickly as passengers re-entered.
A witness on-scene, Sandy Messer, said she was getting ready to go through security Friday morning when she saw people coming out.
"We just moved outside to the parking deck," she said.
Another viewer, Chris, said he was dropping off his cousin at the airport.
"Basically all the sudden we just heard 'code black' come over an intercom," he said. "Then all the sudden the shops started closing down. Security started pushing people outside."
He said while passengers were forced to wait outside, some gave their jackets to others waiting in the cold.
Charleston County dispatchers said the call came in at 5:23 a.m. Multiple Charleston County deputies were headed toward the airport on International Boulevard as well.

Cristiano Ronaldo could be hit with a 12-match ban after being sent off for shoving the referee during Real Madrid's 3-1 win over Barcelona.
Portugal captain Ronaldo received two bookings in the space of three minutes, with the second coming for a dive which the referee took exception to.
Frustrated with the decision, Ronaldo turned round to protest to the referee, pushing the official in the back before storming off to the sidelines.
Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea did not seem fazed by the incident but he did mention it in his report and Ronaldo now faces further action.
"Once the red card was shown, the player pushed me slightly in a sign of disagreement," Bengoetxea wrote in his report.

The Spanish Footballer Federation's regulations state that any "slight violence" towards officials in the form of a "grab, push or shake" should be punished with a ban of between four and 12 matches.
Ronaldo was initially booked for his trademark celebration where he ripped off his shirt and posed in front of the Barcelona fans.
But it proved a costly celebration when he went down in the area, trying to win a penalty.
The referee felt that he threw himself to the ground in a challenge with Samuel Umtiti and quickly brandished a second yellow card.
Ronaldo will now definitely miss the second leg of the Super Cup against Real, but could face further action for his reaction when he shoved the referee in anger.

The referee did not appear fazed by the incident, with Lucas Vazquez's protestations appearing to take his attention away from the incident.
Ronaldo's red card did not affect the game for Real, with Marco Asensio scoring in the closing stages to secure a 3-1 win.
Gerard Pique's own goal had given Real the lead before Lionel Messi equalised from the penalty spot.
A 46-year-old man, who was wanted by police for the death of Hoden Said, has been found deceased in the Town of Shelburne, Peel police said on Friday.
At around 7:20 p.m. on Jan. 27, investigators received a call from the homeowner of a basement apartment in the Kennedy Rd. and Rutherford Rd. in Brampton, Peel police said.
Hoden Said, 30, was found suffering from obvious trauma and was pronounced dead at the scene. Witnesses reported a disturbance within the residence at approximately 2:30 p.m. that day, a news release by homicide investigators stated.
A man was seen leaving the area on foot.
On Thursday, Peel police issued a Canada-wide warrant for Nicholas Anthony Young who was wanted for the second-degree murder of Said. On Friday night, investigators said they had located Young deceased in the Town of Shelburne. Police said his death is not suspicious.
The Comcast bid throws a wrench into what was already a fraught process, and is bound to raise a number of issues. Among the most pressing:
Would senior Fox executives have any potential role at Comcast?
Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group, and Peter Rice, president of 21st Century Fox and CEO of its Fox Networks Group, have been the subject of much speculation since the Disney pact was unveiled. Could these executives potentially find a place at Disney? And what might happen at Comcast, where NBCUniversal is already staffed with executives ranging from CEO Steve Burke to Universal Filmed Entertainment chairman Jeff Shell, NBC Entertainment chief Bob Greenblatt, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment topper Bonnie Hammer and NBC Sports chief Mark Lazarus?
Would Comcast face new regulatory scrutiny?
The company has already tripped regulatory wires at least once, with its bid for Time Warner Cable. Would it do so again? A person familiar with the company's process suggested Comcast feels its current studio and sports assets are far smaller than Disney's (though NBCU does control rights to both the Olympics and “Sunday Night Football”). This person suggested Disney would have bigger assets in these areas even if Comcast were to win the Fox properties.

Whither Hulu?
The streaming-video hub was founded by Comcast and 21st Century Fox, who were subsequently joined by Walt Disney and Time Warner. Comcast had to take a back seat to Hulu's other owners in exchange for getting approval to buy NBCUniversal. In September, those limits are slated to end, prompting questions about Hulu's next steps. By snaring Fox, Comcast could control a 60% stake in the outlet and assert far more control than ever.
Who will ultimately reach for Sky?
Comcast has launched a separate bid to buy 61% of European satellite broadcaster Sky. Fox, which owns 39% of the entity, is in the midst of trying to buy the remaining shares of the company. Presumably, Disney would inherit those holdings, depending on Fox's success. Comcast's higher offer comes as British regulators have dithered over the idea of Fox ownership, raising the prospect that Disney might not be able to gain full control of the entity.
The Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre was forced to cancel a performance for the first time in 17 years Friday night after an actor was the victim of an attempted mugging.
According to a release from the Royal MTC, an actor from the show Outside Mullingar was treated by paramedics after the incident.
It was announced to a crowd of 200 just after 7 p.m. Friday that the show was canceled.

The Royal MTC said the injuries to the actor, who wishes to remain anonymous, were minor and the show is slated to continue on its regular schedule starting Saturday.
The box office has already been in contact with those who were in attendance to refund or re-book tickets.
The centre is filing a police report.
Outside Mullingar runs until Feb. 17.
Hours after his release from prison on Tuesday, rapper Meek Mill arrived at the Philadelphia 76ers' playoff game.
Mill entered the arena about 45 minutes before tipoff and greeted some Sixers players in the home locker room, according to ESPN's Sal Paolantonio.
Editor's Picks Meek Mill's first post-prison public appearance could be Sixers-Heat Game 5 Sixers owner says via Instagram that he's en route to pick up Mill.
The Philadelphia-born rapper, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, had been fighting for his release while appealing a two- to four-year sentence for a probation violation.
His controversial incarceration has drawn response from the sports community.
Sixers co-owner Michael Rubin has been one of Mill's biggest supporters. He tweeted Tuesday that he was on his way to pick up the rapper from prison. The Sixers host the Miami Heat on Tuesday night in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series.
Sixers spokesman Rob King told Paolantonio that "if they get to the arena in time, Meek will ring the bell" for tonight's Game 5.
Said Mill on Twitter:
"I'd like to thank God, my family, and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time. While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive.
"To the Philly District Attorney's office, I'm grateful for your commitment to justice. I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues.
"In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career."
Rubin had organized visits to Mill's prison with Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz.
Members of the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles also championed Mill's cause. Some players declared Mill's song "Dreams and Nightmares" as the club's unofficial anthem prior to and during their run to the Super Bowl.
Mill, a South Philadelphia native, had attended Sixers games regularly before going to prison.
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft visited Mill at a state prison in Pennsylvania earlier this month and later called for criminal justice reform.
"It's really bad. I know some of our players in the NFL have talked about this. I see it firsthand. It's just wrong," Kraft said then. "We have to find a way to correct it and also help the community help themselves. It's just sad. This guy is a great guy. Shouldn't be here. And then think of all the taxpayers here paying for people like this to be in jail and not out being productive."
The Patriots tweeted reaction to the news.
Mill was jailed in November 2017 for violating his probation by failing a drug test, traveling out of the region and getting arrested for fighting and other related offenses. A team of lawyers and public relations consultants had waged a battle to get Mill freed on bail ever since.
Prosecutors say they believe Mill should get a new trial because of questions raised about the credibility of the officer in his 2007 arrest.
Call of Duty: WWII is one of the most anticipated titles of the year, after three years of jet-packing the franchise returns to its roots of boots-on-the-ground action.

The fourth-ranked University of Hawai'i men's volleyball team continued its weeklong road trip with its third straight 3-0 victory, defeating McKendree, 25-16, 25-19, 25-18 for its eighth-consecutive win Tuesday at the Melvin Price Convocation Center.
In the first-ever meeting between the schools, the Rainbow Warriors (13-2) displayed their dominance at the net with 10.5 total blocks, including five by freshman Patrick Gasman. Sophomore opposite Stijn van Tilburg led all attackers with 17 kills, hitting .667 with only one error in 24 attempts.
The Bearcats (5-11) were led by Wyatt Patterson's eight kills, hitting .429
UH hit .329 for the match while holding McKendree to .045. The Warriors also recorded four service aces. Van Tilburg was the only UH player in double figures with the next closest with five kills (Kupono Fey and Brett Rosenmeier). Rosenmeier and Larry Tuileta each had eight digs.
The Warriors scored four straight points, including a kill and block by van Tilburg, for a 14-11 lead. UH pushed its lead to 21-14 after another four-point spurt capped by a van Tilburg ace. Two Gasman blocks got Hawai'i to set point as the Warriors took the opening set 25-16. UH tallied six blocks in the frame holding the Bearcats to -.094 hitting.
With a slim 9-8 lead in Set 2, the Warriors scored five straight with the help of a pair of Bearcat miscues and an overpass smash by Hendrik Mol for a 14-8 lead. McKendree closed to within three but UH responded with three straight including van Tilburg's seventh kill of the set pushing the lead to 21-15 as the Warriors rolled to a 25-19 win and 2-0 lead in the match.
The Warriors built a 9-4 lead in Set 3 following a kill by Rosenmeier and block by Mol. It was all Hawai'i from there. UH reeled off five straight, including three vans Tilburg kills, for a 14-6 lead and the Warriors cruised to the straight-set win.
UH concludes its four-match road trip with another non-conference match at Lindenwood in St. Charles, Mo., Tuesday, Feb. 15. Match time is 3:00 p.m. HT.
Iowa turkey hunters took home 11,700 birds this season which ran from April 7th to May 20th. DNR wildlife biologist Jim Coffee says that was down just 78 turkeys from last year.
The total is good considering the weather conditions when things got started. “It had a lot of people concerned,” Coffee says, “we had some very cool weather to begin with and we ended up with some pretty warm weather at the end. What it shows you is that turkey hunters are pretty consistent. As long as we get out there and get after them, we are going to be successful.” He says the snowy weather early may've hurt the hunters more than the turkeys by making it tougher for them to sneak up on the birds.
“Those extreme conditions can kind of shut them down as they look for food or maybe the hens aren't quite as receptive because of the weather conditions. But overall it's still going to be the same type of turkey spring, you're still going to be out in those areas where turkeys are going to be visible and be heard,” Coffee says. “What makes it a little harder for us is that we just don't blend in as well with our camouflage typically.” Blending into the woods is important as turkeys are one of the toughest animals to hunt and only about one quarter of those who buy a license are successful.
“You know a 20 to 25 percent success rate is considered pretty good across the country. And our successful hunters some years aren't successful. So overall, it's just a matter of how much time you put into it and some good old fashioned luck,” according to Coffee. Turkey hunting hit is peak for participation around 10 years ago and since then Coffee says they've seen some decline.
“We have what we call churn — which is people who get in and get out of turkey hunting,” Coffee says. “We see some people trying it again and people falling out. And then we have our avid turkey hunters which are just hose who go every year and potentially get multiple tags — because you are allowed two tags in the springtime.” He says deer hunters are often the ones involved in the “churn.”
He says deer hunters often see a lot of turkeys in the fall decide to try turkey hunting in the spring. “And then they don't realize that there is a little bit different skill set involved and those people may get in and get out a little bit more frequently,” Coffee says. There were nearly 50-thousand tags purchased for the recent turkey season.
Peter Dinklage will be in Avengers: Infinity War
Reports seeped out last year that Peter Dinklage was in talks to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Avengers: Infinity War. Marvel/Disney still haven't said a word about the casting, but the latest poster for the film confirms that the Game of Thrones star indeed has a role in the blockbuster.
Released over the weekend, the new poster finds Dinklage's name placed between Idris Elba's (another pleasant surprise confirmation) and Benedict Wong's. Here's a closeup:
The only question that remains is who exactly he'll be playing. Images of Dinklage getting his hair dyed a fiery red appeared last year, leading many fans to believe he was joining Infinity War as Pip the Troll. The character is a hard-drinking bit of comic relief who frequently hangs around Adam Warlock, a major player in the comic book Infinity stories who was teased at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
Having the actor play a character so similar to GoT's Tyrion Lannister may be a bit on the nose for Marvel, though. Other possibilities batted around by fans include Starfox, Thanos' brother and frequent Avengers member; or maybe even Mephisto, Marvel's Devil, whom Thanos tries to make a lackey in his plans to kill off half of the universe. Or who knows, maybe he voices one of Thanos' Black Order, as we still don't know any casting related to the four henchmen.
(Read: A Complete Guide to Comic Book Movies in 2018)
Whomever he ends up playing, Dinklage is joining an absolutely massive cast that also includes Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Evans (Captain America), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), Don Cheadle (War Machine), Anthony Mackie (Falcon), Paul Bettany (Vision), Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Tom Holland (Spider-Man), Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange), Josh Brolin (Thans), Benedict Wong (Wong), Chadwich Boseman (Black Panther), Letitia Wright (Shuri), Chris Pratt (Star-Lord), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot), Bradley Cooper (Rocket Racoon), Pom Klementieff (Mantis), Karen Gillan (Nebula), and Benicio Del Toro (The Collector).
Jeremy Renner and Paul Rudd are expected to return as Hawkeye and Ant-Man, respectively, but have been noticeably absent from any of the film's promotional material. Well, maybe Ant-Man's been there all along and we just can't see him. We'll find out for sure when Avengers: Infinity War opens on April 27th.

Most of Argentina's game is in the mind, the coach said, as he prepared the Pumas for their sixth campaign in the southern hemisphere championship, which begins against South Africa in Port Elizabeth on Aug. 19.
"Eighty per cent (of the game) is in the mind, there's no doubt," Hourcade told Reuters in an interview.
"Being good in the head is not enough, nor is only technique, the two combined is ideal but in rugby and because of our way of experiencing rugby, getting our heads right is of tremendous importance."
The Pumas have often let themselves down by not staying focused for a full match, but on the other hand they can be very good when they are in the right frame of mind.
"It can lift us a lot, especially ... when we are the underdogs," he said.
The confidence in the squad might sound strange after two defeats by a second string England side in June left them with one win in 10 tests since they beat South Africa a year ago.
A subsequent 45-29 win over Georgia followed by two Super Rugby victories in Australia in their other guise as the Jaguares, however, have given Argentina's players a boost in confidence.
"They played some very good rugby, especially against the Waratahs, and came home in a good frame of mind, enthusiastic and with confidence," Hourcade said.
"Everyone is available, we have no injuries, a complete squad, a nice, very strong internal competition (for places) with the lovely problem of whom to leave out.
"It had been a while since that happened to us."
Hourcade, known to everyone as "Huevo" , or egg, the unusual nickname his brother gave him because of the shape of his head, is in his fourth year as Pumas coach where he has tried to develop a more expansive game.
It took them to fourth place at the 2015 World Cup but there has been a cost in other areas and Hourcade has been putting an emphasis on defence and scrummaging this year.
Despite the 38-34 and 35-25 defeats to an England side without its British and Irish Lions players in June, Hourcade was satisfied the work done on defence as the Jaguares in Super Rugby was bearing fruit.
While the scrum once provided Argentina with a point of difference, the modern game has placed more varied demands on tight forwards, however, and it was taking time for them to adapt, Hourcade said.
"All teams in Argentina try to play like the Pumas, who set the trend," he said.
"There was great dedication to the scrum by all teams at every level and the emergence of great props, well trained with a lot of technique, it was our DNA.
"But you can't have props who only play in the scrum. Even seeking greater mobility, we still have difficulties achieving the dynamics we need, especially in defence. It's very difficult if they can't move about fast.
"Increasingly, the scrum is a launching platform more than a lethal weapon as it was in another era."

A teacher has been charged with cruelty to children in connection with an incident in December at E.B. Ellington Elementary School.
Avriel Taylor, 24, placed clear packing tape over the mouth of a student, 7, while he was sitting at his desk, according to the affidavit.
Taylor moved the victim's desk near the door to a hallway for being disruptive before the incident occurred, the affidavit stated.
Interviews with three other students corroborated the claim of the victim, the affidavit said. The Charleston County Sheriff's office previously said they were looking into the incident.
The Charleston County School District issued a statement Friday morning:
Charleston County School District is aware of the charge facing Avriel Taylor, who remains on administrative leave.
We do not have any further comments at this time on this matter.
A parent of the child said she was alerted about the incident from other parents who have children in her son's class who recounted what happened.
"I was really in shock. I honestly didn't know how to feel," Shayla Randall said."I was angry. I was hurt. But more so, I was disappointed in the safety of our children at the school."
Taylor told other students that other students would also have tape placed on their mouths if they weren't quiet, according to the incident report.

LONDON-Britain's Prince Harry sought counselling in his late twenties to help deal with the grief of losing his mother more than a decade earlier, he told the Telegraph newspaper.
Harry, whose mother Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 when he was just 12, said he had come “very close to a complete breakdown” on several occasions after shutting down his emotions, impacting both his work and his personal life. “My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help? It's only going to make you sad, it's not going to bring her back,” he said in an interview published on Monday. “So from an emotional side, I was like ‘right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything'.”
He said his older brother Prince William had encouraged him to seek help and he had been to see “a shrink” several times. He also took up boxing to help deal with aggression after feeling he was “on the verge of punching someone”.
“(I) started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with,” he said, adding that he had experienced two years of “total chaos”.
The princes' mother Diana was married to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles between 1981 and 1996, when the couple divorced. She was killed when the car she was in crashed while being chased by paparazzi on motorbikes. Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, described at times facing anxiety during royal engagements but said he was now in a “good place”. He served in the British Army for 10 years, including two stints in Afghanistan, and now works with several charities including supporting wounded soldiers. Along with William and William's wife Catherine, he also set up a mental health charity.
“Because of the process I have been through over the past two and a half years, I've now been able to take my work seriously, been able to take my private life seriously as well, and been able to put blood, sweat and tears into the things that really make a difference and things that I think will make a difference to everybody else,” he said.
Google's always-listening smart home speaker is finally in Australia. But do you need one?
What Is It?
The $199 Google Home is the long-awaited smart home speaker from the world's best-known search-and-everything-else-on-the-internet brand. If you want to boil it down, it's essentially the Google Assistant tech straight out of the Google Pixel and other top-of-the-line Android phones, plus a sprinkling of Chromecast Audio.
As what is basically an oversized, room-scale, always-listening microphone and speaker, the Google Home can pick up your voice from the other side of a medium-sized living space whenever you say the words "OK Google" or "Hey Google"; and, without any visible buttons on its body, you'll be talking to it almost exclusively. After triggering it with that catchphrase, you're then able to ask it a question or issue a command in natural language and, with the power of the internet, Google Home will respond.
Ask Google Home If Drop Bears Are Real Google Home is out in Australia today, and it's properly ocker. You can ask it what kookaburras sound like, you can ask it how to spell Goondiwindi. Read more
There is a touch-sensitive panel on the top of the Google Home which you can tap to activate the mics — if you're sick of saying "OK Google" over and over. You can also run your finger around in a clockwise or counterclockwise motion to change the speaker's volume. Beyond that, there's only a power jack for the Home's DC electricity input; you can use the Google Chromecast Ethernet adapter if you really want hard-wired internet on the speaker.
Google Home packs in a set of surprisingly gutsy full-range speakers in its base, arranged in a pattern to fire outwards over 360 degrees for omnidirectional audio. That means you're able to put it on a coffee table in the middle of your room as easily as on a bookcase or side table, but you've still got that power jack to deal with — it's not a battery powered unit.
What's It Good At?
Throw it a request like "OK Google, play me any music" will work, but then you can also follow up with "Hey Google, what is this?" and have it understand you. This is the huge power of Google Assistant — it's not just a voice assistant, but a contextual voice assistant. That means you can have more of a proper conversation with it, without having to repeat your initial request over and over — "what is this" instead of "what is this music", for example. Contextual responses are what make smart devices smart.
And it's so good at picking up your voice, even if you're talking at a normal volume in a medium-sized room. If you raise your voice even slightly to talk to it, it's almost a certainty that it'll be able to hear you and hear you clearly enough to interact. Having the combination of voice controls and touch panel controls is great, actually. Without that touch panel, Google Home would be much harder to interact with; if you've got it anywhere in the middle of your room, it's still the easiest thing to do to tap the top to stop or play music, ask a question or swipe to change the volume.
Here's All The Cool Stuff Google Home Can Do Google just announced new updates to Assistant and Google Home. The smart speaker leans on Assistant to offer voice controls and artificially intelligent, well, assistance. But until now, the gadget hasn't really been able to do that much. Thanks to some updates, however, that might change very soon. Read more
As a single, smart speaker living in your apartment or small home, a Google Home will give you surprisingly good music or podcast listening given its relatively small size. It won't have the outright audio power of a Sonos PLAY:1, but the smarts it adds are probably enough to make up for that audio deficit. You can hook up multiple Homes, just like Sonos, but it's not a music-only, music-focused speaker — it has other talents, so you can forgive its slight audio quality deficit.
Because Google Home is essentially just like a Chromecast Audio, you can cast audio from so many apps on your phone straight to it. Want to play a podcast from Pocket Casts? Done. Want to flick audio from Google Play Music to your Home? Done. A future update will also enable Bluetooth direct connections from phone to Home, for all those apps that don't support casting. As a speaker connected to your phone goes, Google Home is world class; better still, it doesn't all live in a single app like Sonos's music services do. This way is much more convenient, plus you have the ability to just talk to the Home itself when you don't have your phone nearby.
What's It Not Good At?
There are plenty of questions that Google Home can't answer for you. I'm not talking about deep, existential am I just a grain in the sands of time stuff, but questions about live footy or cricket scores. Live data works to some extent on desktop Google, but the Home doesn't seem to have the same granular access. These will likely be added in time as Google's local engineers work to add in partner data and enable it for the Aussie voice, but for the time being, it's better to assume that the only up-to-date info Google Home can give you is on travel times and the weather.
At the same time, just like Google's chief rival Siri, you can pretty easily stump Home with a poorly worded question; its natural language processing isn't exactly perfect. You'll often get "I don't know how to help you with that just yet. But I'm learning every day" whenever you deliver it a corker, and as lovely as Ms Google is, it can get a little frustrating when you've tried to ask the same question three different ways before giving up. I quickly learned to try once and then just go and find my phone or sit down at the PC where a keyboard and desktop Google was always close to hand.
There's definitely a learning curve with Google Home, and the voice-only responses limit the feedback that your Google Home can give you. That often leaves you just a bit confused as to what you've said wrong, which is probably my chief complaint with Google Home. There are more than a few times where I've just wanted to shout "WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND ME, GOOGLE LADY" at the Home speaker. If you don't mind a bit of trial and error you can learn the best way to ask common questions, but it takes patience and practice. To its credit, simple commands — "volume up", "stop", "turn it up", "next track" — are all straightforward and trouble-free. One other caveat: whenever Google Home is belting out a certified banger, you'll need to speak that "OK Google" a lot louder to be clearly picked up and interpreted.
A lot of this boils down to the fact that, at least for the time being, Google Home is just new. Especially in Australia. It'll get better with time, just like Google Assistant did on the Google Pixel when it first launched. You can't make hands-free voice calls over Wi-Fi yet, for example. It's new, and if you don't like being a beta tester for something, maybe the Home isn't for you just yet.
Should You Buy It?
I don't think there are too many people out there that need a $199 Google Home in their life. Especially those that are already living in the Google ecosystem with a recent Android smartphone, for one, and especially moreso a smartphone that can do "OK Google" with the screen locked. But there's value in the Home's always-on microphone, because you always know where it is in your house, so you always know when you can ask it questions where a phone is far less reliable.
For picking up your voice accurately, there's no other smart speaker or smart home device I've tried that does as good a job as the Google Home. It's my new benchmark for room-sized voice assistant conversations; you can ask it a Google-able question and it'll probably come back with an answer, or at least a close approximation of one. You can ask it to do things, too — I've taken to asking it to turn off my Philips Hue lights off rather than ducking into the app. Once you learn those habits, they stick.
Google Home has a few killer features — your daily agenda, the ability to kickstart video on your Chromecast, voice-activated music and voice-activated smart home controls. If you want or need any of these, and if you learn to use them as part of your daily routine, you'll love Google Home. If you don't, then it'll just be a $200 contrivance sitting on your side table lonely and unloved.
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): Various ceremonies were arranged to mark the
70th Independence Day of Pakistan across the country with traditional fervor, but the icing on the cake was a breathtaking air show by Pakistan Air Force (PAF).
The largest air show in the history of Pakistan was held at Islamabad
and Karachi at different intervals. The first air show was held at Fatima Jinnah Park, Islamabad. President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan Mamnoon Hussain was the chief guest on the occasion, said a statement issued here by media department of PAF.
Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir and Air Chief Marshal, Sohail Aman,
Chief of the Air Staff, Pakistan Air Force also witnessed the magnificent event. Ambassadors of friendly countries, former Air Chiefs and high-ranking civil and military officers were also present on the occassion.
PAF's fighter and training aircraft including Mirage, SAAB-2000, and
Augusta-139 from PAF; while, MI-17 and PUMA helicopters from Army Aviation participated in the show. Besides PAF aircraft, world renowned aerobatic teams from brotherly countries Turkey and Saudi Arabia also performed in the mega event.
The huge crowd gathered in the lush green F-9 Park was ecstatic to see
“Solo Turk” flying overhead in a thundering sound. The stunning maneuvers of this world famous aerobatics team of Turkish Air Force left the spectators spell bound. The next event was a spectacular aerobatics display of “Saudi Hawks”, 07 ship formation aerobatics team of Royal Saudi Air Force. The blue skies of Islamabad were filled with colours as this acclaimed aerobatic team displayed eye-catching drills. The spectators thoroughly enjoyed the breathtaking maneuvers of these aircraft and showed appreciation by clapping and chanting slogans.
After the thrilling performance of Saudi Hawks, the indigenously-built
JF-17 Thunder aircraft entered the arena. The spectators cheered with joy to see the spectacular maneuvers of the aircraft, rightfully called the pride of the nation. Moments after the departure of the roaring JF-17 Thunder, Augusta helicopters appeared on the horizon for solo aerobatics display. The show was rounded off with the Tri-Services free fall display in which the commandos from the Special Services Wings jumped from a C-130 aircraft flying at the height of 10,000 feet and safely landed at the designated places.
Another air show was held at Sea View Karachi in which Chief Minister
Sindh Murad Ali Shah was the chief guest. F-16, P-3C Orion, Z-9, Alouette-III and Sea King helicopters presented the fly past at the venue. Afterwards JF-17 Thunder and PAF aerobatics team Sherdil presented a mesmerizing aerial display.
Joel DeBellefeuille has been embroiled in a longstanding battle with the Longueuil police for almost a decade and on Tuesday, he announced yet another victory.
“The Quebec Human Rights Commission recommended that the city pay $12,000, as well as fix their action plan from 2015-2017 and train their officers [on racial profiling],” he said.
In March 2012, DeBellefeuille was driving his son to daycare in his BMW when he was pulled over by police and asked for his identification.
The officers told him it was a random traffic stop, but the Longueuil resident argued that those kinds of stops happen to him all the time.
He mandated the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR) to help him file a complaint.

“It's a form of official recognition that a lot of things still need to be done and that the city needs to show results,” said CRARR executive director Fo Niemi. “Processes are important, documents are important, statements are important, but there doesn't seem to be any concrete results in terms of institutional actions or institutional change in Longueuil, and that's what the human rights committee is saying today.”
This is the third favourable ruling for DeBellefeuille.
He first filed a complaint about police discrimination back in 2009, after he was pulled over by two officers who have since been reprimanded by the police ethics commission.
Then last year, charges were dropped in Longueuil municipal court after DeBellefeuille contested a ticket he got in 2015 for not wearing a seatbelt.

He argued he was wearing one and that police had racially profiled him.
“It's still happening – not only with me, but other people. Maybe if the city showed some results on their action plan that they created, maybe the city, maybe myself, maybe CRARR will actually believe that something's being done about it,” said DeBellefeuille.
The city of Longueuil has until Friday to comply with the commission's recommendations. If they fail to do so, the case will go to the human rights tribunal.
Global News reached out to the city, but they declined to comment on the case, saying they were still analyzing the decision.
A bathhouse at Ala Moana Regional Park closed for major renovations Monday.
The facility is located on the Diamond Head end of the park, near the L&L concession stand.
Planned improvements include the installation of skylights, re-roofing, repairing the tile floor, improving ADA compliance within the restrooms, adding security gates and screens, and replacing the exterior drinking fountain.
The project is expected to finish by summer 2018. No portable toilets will be provided during this time since other bathrooms are located nearby.
The $668,000 contract for the project construction was awarded to Amethyst Builder, Inc.
OSLO - Nuclear disarmament campaign group ICAN won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for its efforts to consign the atomic bomb to history, firing off a warning that Donald Trump's presidency showed the true extent of the risk posed by weapons of mass destruction.
More than 70 years since atomic bombs were used on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Nobel committee praised ICAN's non-proliferation efforts as nuclear-related crises swirl around North Korea and Iran.
The decision sent a clear message at a time when Trump has threatened to tear up a 2015 deal curbing Iran's nuclear abilities. And the US president alarmed delegates at the UN General Assembly last month by warning he might be forced to "totally destroy" North Korea because of its atomic weapons programme.
"We live in a world where the risk of nuclear weapons being used is greater than it has been for a long time," Norwegian Nobel committee president Berit Reiss-Andersen said in announcing the prize in Oslo. Founded in Vienna in 2007, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) comprises more than 400 NGOs and has mobilised supporters and celebrities alike in its cause. It was a key player in the adoption of a historic nuclear weapons ban treaty, signed by 122 countries at the UN in July.
But the accord was largely symbolic because none of the nine countries known or suspected of having nuclear weapons put their names down. It also still needs to be ratified before entering into force.
The United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea are all thought to possess nuclear weapons.
Speaking to reporters in Geneva, ICAN's head Beatrice Fihn said Trump's movements over North Korea and Iran showed the clear danger posed by nuclear arms.
"The election of President Donald Trump has made a lot of people feel very uncomfortable with the fact that he alone can authorise the use of nuclear weapons," she said, adding that the US leader had a track record of "not listening to expertise".
Days before the Nobel announcement, Fihn had tweeted simply: "Donald Trump is a moron", a remark she said Friday that she regretted.
Although global atomic stockpiles have plummeted -- from around 64,000 weapons in 1986 at the height of the Cold War to about 9,000 in 2017, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists (BAS) -- they remain a global concern.
NATO, which has three of the world's nuclear powers in its ranks and which opposed the weapons ban treaty, welcomed "the attention given to the issue" by ICAN's win.
But the alliance's secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that "the conditions for achieving nuclear disarmament are not favourable today".
The survivors of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, however, congratulated ICAN. "We want to work together so that the nuclear disarmament treaty can be signed as soon as possible," said Shigemitsu Tanaka, head of the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Survivors Council. Friday's award comes as a global nuclear deal with Iran is under increasing pressure from Trump.
The agreement struck in 2015 between Iran and world powers drastically curbed Tehran's nuclear enrichment capability in return for a lifting of punishing economic sanctions. Iran denies ever pursuing a bomb, insisting its nuclear programme is for peaceful energy production only.
But Trump has threatened to bin the accord, and on Thursday criticised Iran's behaviour, telling military leaders in Washington that Tehran has "not lived up to the spirit of the agreement".
Trump is planning to decertify the deal, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Friday, potentially paving the way for renewed sanctions on Tehran. Tensions have also soared between the US and North Korea, which has test-fired two missiles over Japan and conducted a string of apparent underground nuclear tests.
"This is a time of great global tension, when fiery rhetoric could all too easily lead us, inexorably, to unspeakable horror," ICAN said on Friday.
The Nobel committee has rewarded anti-nuclear weapons drives on several previous occasions, honouring Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov in 1975, the international non-proliferation group IPPNW in 1985, and Mohamed ElBaradei, then the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, twenty years later.
UN chief Antonio Guterres praised ICAN's win, tweeting: "Now more than ever we need a world without nuclear weapons." But Russia, which according to some counts has the world's largest atomic stockpile, said there was no alternative to "nuclear parity" in guaranteeing world peace.
More than 300 people and organisations were thought to have been nominated for this year's Peace Prize, including the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, Syria's White Helmets rescue service and Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
The Peace Prize, which comes with a gold medal and a cheque for nine million Swedish kronor (943,000 euros, $1.1 million), will be presented in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the death of its founder, Swedish philanthropist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel.

In a headline that will feel like a flashback to 2016 for St. Louis Blues fans, David Perron has once again signed a contract with the team that drafted him. Perron's infatuation with playing in St. Louis is well documented, but fans are split on the decision to return to this well. Given the way this summer has played out so far, though, Blues fans should be thankful for players like Perron, who love St. Louis and are eager to play there.
Draft Day for David
It was a pleasant day in Columbus, OH when Perron was drafted in 2007. Like most of the players in that room, Perron was only a teenager, waiting to hear what franchise he would call home for the foreseeable future. The Sherbrooke, Quebec native heard his name called 26th overall. The Franchise? The St. Louis Blues, a team Perron would become very fond of over the course of his career.
He quickly emerged as the centerpiece of the core of the rebuilding Blues. Along with fellow prospects like David Backes, T.J. Oshie, and Patrik Berglund, Perron blossomed and was part of the squad that returned the Blues to relevance, and to the playoffs. In his first stint with St. Louis, Perron recorded 198 points in 340 games.
A Crumbling Core
Over time, Blues fans became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of production from this young group. Perron, in particular, was labeled a player who took silly penalties and disappeared in the playoffs. Despite having signed a four-year extension the summer before, the Blues traded Perron to the Edmonton Oilers in the summer of 2013, receiving in exchange Magnus Paajarvi and a 2014 second-round pick (which became Ivan Barbashev).
Perron took off in Edmonton, scoring 57 points in his first season. But the Oilers were still rebuilding at the time, and as sellers, Perron was traded once again to the Pittsburgh Penguins at the 2014-15 deadline. Despite some early success, Perron never really caught on with the Penguins and a season later, at the 2015-16 trade deadline, he was dealt to the Anaheim Ducks. In 28 games to finish the season there, he recorded 20 points, and after stints with four different teams in four years, he would finally get to choose his own destination as an unrestricted free agent.
Home Away from Home
Perrons had plenty of options as a free agent. Among them was an extremely compelling offer: a chance to return to his home province and play with his childhood team, the Montreal Canadiens.
But Perron did not take a hometown discount, at least, not to play with the Canadiens. Reports at the time suggested that he not only rejected an offer from his dream team but rejected an offer for more money than the one he took. For Perron, the most compelling opportunity was not the chance to return to his childhood team but to return to the team that raised him, the St. Louis Blues.
Finally coming home! Missed you guys dearly! Cannot wait to see all of you again! Back to my 1st love @StLouisBlues pic.twitter.com/gbjJsse3oP — David Perron (@DP_57) July 1, 2016
Calling St. Louis “home” and referring to the team as “my 1st love” made clear how Perron felt. No other offer appealed to him more and he signed a two-year deal with an AAV of $3.750 million.
“He was very excited about the opportunity to come back to St. Louis,” Blues GM Doug Armstrong said in an interview with NHL.com. “He certainly has a warm spot for the fans and the city. When you have players that have been here and are looking to come back, it was nice to hear the excitement in David's voice about returning to the team that drafted him.”
Perron's year with the Blues was a successful one. One of the few players on the team who did not miss a game in the 2016-17 season, Perron recorded 46 points in 82 games. When the playoffs rolled around, however, Perron was once again a non-factor, tallying only one point in eleven games.
What Happens in Vegas…
After the season, the Blues were faced with a difficult decision: who to protect in the Expansion Draft? With just a year left on his deal and without a No Movement Clause forcing protection, Perron was left unprotected and, unsurprisingly, he became a Vegas Golden Knight shortly thereafter.
Perron would go on to have a career year with the Golden Knights, who had a magical season as one of the most successful expansion teams in the history of sports. Perron recorded 66 points in 70 games with the Knights, including 50 assists. In 15 playoff games, he recorded 9 points. Both totals were career highs and Perron had positioned himself to demand a big contract as a returning UFA.
…Doesn't Stay in Vegas
According to TSN's Darren Dreger, Perron had as many as five offers to consider in 2018, but perhaps the decision was a foregone conclusion. With a 4-year, $16 million contract on the table from the team that, according to an Instagram post he made when he left for Vegas, “made [him] a man in the 7 years I played,” Perron once again signed with the Blues.
The news was met with mixed reviews by fans. Some acknowledged that Perron was a talented top-nine forward coming off a career year and that $4 million is not a lot to pay him per season. Others were annoyed that the Blues had returned again to Perron for help. The initial skepticism was washed away in the aftermath of the Ryan O'Reilly trade but there is little question it will return when Perron makes his first mistake next season.
Perron's Love Affair with St. Louis
Perron deserves a chance to be loved by the fans of St. Louis as much as he loves them. In a summer when the Blues were publicly snubbed by John Tavares, Perron's clear admiration and fondness for the city, its hockey team, and its fans should be appreciated. The fact that he took less money to return to the Blues, twice, should be celebrated.
With the inclusion of Patrik Berglund in the Ryan O'Reilly trade, Perron is now the only member of that young forward core that once had so much promise. And while that core never brought home a Stanley Cup, his return should excite Blues fans nonetheless. Yes, David Perron has signed with the St. Louis Blues again. Yes, it's a story we've heard before but it's one that never gets old.

ISLAMABAD - Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani on the occasion of Independence Day said that the nation will have to forge unity in its ranks to protect, preserve and uphold the dignity of Parliament and the Constitution.
While talking to the media after the wreath laying ceremony at the monument of “Unsung Heroes of Democracy” at the Parliament House, the Senate chairman said that the Parliament reflected the will and aspiration of the people and has a crucial role in strengthening democratic values and foundation of the democracy in the country.
Flanked by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and other senior officers of both the houses of parliament, the Senate chairman observed that the Federation needed to be further strengthened and, in this regard, they have to reiterate their commitment and resolve to work for making the democracy strong and avoid confrontational course among institutions of the State.
“The politics of confrontation is not in the interest of the country and we should act sagaciously to work for the socio-economic development of the country and overcoming the challenges on social, political and economic fronts being faced by the country,” he said.
Both the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker also laid a wreath on the monument of “Unsung Heroes of Democracy” in the Parliament Lawn and paid glowing tribute to political workers who faced hardships and sacrificed their lives for upholding of democracy and struggled for supremacy of the Constitution.

ISLAMABAD, Jan 2 (APP): At least seven people including six
women were killed and 20 others were injured when four vehicles
collided at a tool plaza near Kandhkot on Monday.
According to details, two passenger coaches collided head-on
at a tool plaza near Kandhkot after which a car and a truck which
were coming behind also collided with the coaches, killing seven
people, a private news channel reported.
Rescue teams shifted the injured to Civil Hospital.
Most of the dead and injured passengers were from Peshawar.
HONOLULU — A Hawaii man accused of killing his mother months ago stuffed her dismembered body parts in seven plastic bags in the kitchen freezer of the Waikiki apartment they shared, according to court documents made public Monday.
Yu Wei Gong has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Liu Yun Gong.
He called 911 on April 11 and said: “'I killed my Mom,”' according to a detective's affidavit supporting an arrest warrant. When officers arrived and could not find the woman, Gong told them she was “in the fridge,” the complaint said.
An officer found what appeared to be body parts.
“Another covered object in the freezer felt to a different officer like a human leg and foot,” the complaint said.
Yu Wei Gong didn't speak or enter a plea during a brief court appearance Monday. Deputy Public Defender Diamond Grace requested a Mandarin interpreter for his preliminary hearing, scheduled for Wednesday. He remained in custody with bail set at US$2 million.
Grace didn't immediately return a phone message seeking comment after the hearing.
Authorities say Yu Wei Gong told officers that he accidentally killed his mother in September after she became angry when the 26-year-old said he wanted to work instead of going to school.
Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Rachel Lange determined Liu Yun Gong had suffered blunt force injuries to the head, the complaint said. Her identity was confirmed by comparing fingerprints to those on file under her Hawaii driver's license.
The manager of the apartment building where they lived told police he had not seen the man's mother since before Christmas, the complaint said.
It said Liu Yun Gong did not show up for work on Aug. 21, 2016. When a supervisor called her phone, it went unanswered. Yu Wei Gong called the supervisor the next day, saying his mother was on another Hawaiian island and had left her phone at home.
Three women watched the hearing and said outside court they wanted to support Gong spiritually because he had attended their church.
Gong and his mother, who they knew by different names, attended Waipahu United Church of Christ, said former pastor Norma Desaegher.
“He has nobody. No family as far as we can tell,” she said, adding that it's been several years since she last saw him. “We wanted to give him that spiritual support.”
Gong moved to Hawaii from China when he was 19, after his mother married an active church parishioner she met online, the women said. Mother and son stopped going to church after the man died in 2014.
The women said Gong took English classes at the church and moved with his mother and stepfather to Waikiki so she could pursue a massage business.
“We just wanted people to know they were a good family,” Desaegher said.
