Making History (1996) is the third novel by Stephen Fry. Its plot involves the creation of an alternative historical timeline in which Adolf Hitler never existed. While most of the book is written in standard prose, a couple of chapters are written in the format of a screenplay. The book won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History.
Plot
Changing history
The story is told in first person by Michael "Puppy" Young, a young history student at Cambridge University on the verge of completing their doctoral thesis on the early life of Adolf Hitler and their mother. They meet Professor Leo Zuckerman, a physicist who has a strong personal interest in Hitler, the rise of Nazism and the Holocaust. Michael assumes this is due to their Jewish heritage. However, it is later revealed that Leo was born Axil Bauer, the son of Dietrich Bauer, a Nazi doctor at Auschwitz who – when the Nazi defeat became certain – gave their son the identity of a Jewish doctor that they murdered. Leo has developed a machine that enables the past to be viewed—but it is of no practical use as the image is not resolvable into details. Together, they hatch a plan to modify the machine such that it can be used to send something back into time. They decide to use a permanent male contraceptive pill, stolen from Michael's girlfriend (a biochemistry researcher), who, due to their continual distraction, has left them to take a position at Princeton University. They decide to send this pill back in time to the well in Braunau am Inn so that Hitler's father will drink from it, become infertile, and Hitler will never be born.
Consequences
When Michael awakens they are completely disoriented. They soon discovers that they are in the United States, at Princeton University. Everyone they encounter is surprised that they are speaking with an English accent. It takes some time for Michael's memory to return. They realise that their plan was successful, history has changed, and for some reason their parents must have moved to America. Initially they are elated and tells their new friend Steve how happy they are because Steve has never heard of Hitler, Braunau am Inn, or the Nazi Party. Steve corrects Michael and reveals that, while never hearing of Hitler, they are all too well aware of the Nazi Party.
Michael begins to discover the history of this new world. It turns out that without Hitler, a new leader emerged, Rudolf Gloder, who was equally ruthless. In fact, Michael and Zuckerman have replaced Hitler with a Nazi leader who was even more charming, patient, and effective, and as committed to the Final Solution as Hitler had been.
In this alternative timeline, the Nazis won a mandate in the Reichstag in 1932 and built up an electronics industry of their own. Unlike Hitler, Gloder proceeded with stealth, ensuring peaceful unification with Austria in 1937. More alarmingly, Gloder's Nazis also had a head start on the research and development of nuclear weapons, which led to the destruction of Moscow and Leningrad, eliminating Joseph Stalin and their Politburo in this alternative 1938. The Greater German Reich annexes Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Turkey, and invades the remnants of the former Soviet Union. In 1939, France, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations capitulate, although Britain rebels in 1941, leading to the execution of several dissidents, among them the Duke of York (the historical King George VI) and George Orwell. Jews are exiled to a "Jewish Free State" within the former Yugoslavia, where most of this world's Holocaust occurs. The United States develops nuclear weapons in 1941, leading to a Cold War between Nazi Germany, its satellites, and the United States. The latter has never gone to war against the Japanese Empire in the Pacific.
As a result, this United States has become far more socially conservative. Because there was no sixties upsurge of social liberalism and decriminalisation of homosexuality in (Nazi-occupied) Western Europe in this world, the latter is still a felony, while racial segregation is still active. Students at Princeton are purely white, the only blacks on campus being manual workers—and students feel free to harass them and call them "nigger".
Steve turns out to be homosexual, and when they discover Michael's background, they marvel at their talk of gay pride marches, urban gay communities, and a mass social movement in Michael's world of origin, regarding it as "utopian". Much to their own surprise, Michael reciprocates Steve's feelings.
Michael is apprehended by the authorities, who believe that they are a possible spy—since Britain had been under Nazi rule for nearly half a century, anyone speaking like a Briton is suspect. Michael learns that the water from the well in Hitler's home town was used to create "Braunau Water", which was the instrument to sterilise the European Jews, wiping them out in one generation. In a cruel twist of fate, the person who perfected the synthesis was Dietrich Bauer. Once more their physicist son, Axel, is wracked with guilt and has developed a Temporal Imager. With Michael and Steve's help, they plan to send a dead rat to poison the well so that it will be pumped clean of the sterilising water. As they begin to do this, they are interrupted by the federal agents that apprehended Michael earlier and they end up shooting Steve, who dies in Michael's arms just as the time alteration occurs.
Changing history again
Time changes again. Expecting the disorientation, Michael comes to their senses faster now and discovers that almost everything is back to how it was, except that their favourite band, Oily-Moily, never existed. They give up their career in academia, figuring they can at least make some money "writing" the songs that they remember from the previous reality. Finally, Michael is reunited with Steve, who also remembers the previous reality. Their gay relationship is no longer criminal.
Structure of the book
Every chapter told by the first-person narrator in the (changing) late 20th century reality is followed by one in the German past. These early such chapters depict Hitler's father, an abusive husband and father and a petty tyrant in their job as a customs inspector; Hitler's mother, a gentle and sensitive woman escaping into fantasy from the harsh reality of their life; the 10-year old Adolf Hitler standing up to their father... Later chapters take place in the trenches of WWI, told from the point of view of Hitler's comrades in arms: ordinary German combat soldiers, completely unaware of the hidden power struggle going on around them between the two potential leaders of the future Nazi Germany—Adolf Hitler and the charismatic officer Rudi Gloder. In one scene, Hitler tricks Gloder into a foolhardy heroic act and getting themselves killed; but in the changed history, where Hitler was never born, it is Gloder who tricks another soldier into this act, and gets decorated for recovering their body. Later on, the ruthless Gloder murders a fellow soldier who discovered their opportunist machinations, followed by the past-war scene where Gloder joins the budding Nazi Party in 1919 Munchen and becomes its star demagogue. The significance of some details in these past scenes only becomes clear much later. For example, there is an early scene where Hitler's mother's vomits when trying to draw water and getting out of the pump a stinking maggot-filled mass; this turns out at the book's end to be the result of the protagonist sending back in time the rotting bodies of dead rats in order to prevent Hitler's father from drinking the sterilizing water.
Reception
Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times found the comic tone of the book "shockingly tasteless" and "deeply offensive" given the subject matter.
Israeli researcher Asaf Ben Vered noted that "The protagonist of Making History gets told that "There are no Jews left in Europe". That result could not have been achieved solely by sterilizing Jewish men through the "Braunau Water". In that case, in the 1990s there should have still been a big number of sad old and middle aged Jews with no progeny, and the Nazis could not have kept them completely hidden from the world. Plus, if only Jewish men were sterilized, at least some Jewish women would have let themselves be impregnated by non-Jewish men; in fact, Jewish religious law specifically stipulates that such children would be considered Jewish. (...) Anyway, why would Gloder do it at all? To be sure, they are an anti-semite, like many Germans of their time. But as seen from their cynically frank wartime diary, they are above all a completely ruthless and totally unprincipled opportunist, for whom German Nationalism and wartime heroism are simply tools to be used or discarded. They needed the Jewish nuclear scientists to develop nuclear bombs by 1938. They still need them when entering a nuclear arms race with the US. Were the Jewish scientists and their families exempted from deportation to the "Jewish Free State"? Would they go on working for them when all other Jews were deported? (...) The book avoids the real moral dilemma which it could have easily posed and which would have made it a far more profound and thought-provoking work. Suppose the opportunist Gloder had altogether avoided the Final Solution, and contented themselves with some anti-Jewish rhetoric. Which world would be worse? Our world - or a world with an entrenched Nazi dictatorship in Europe and a racist and homophobic America, but no gas chambers and ovens, six million Jews able to live out their life, even if under Nazi rule? Putting it this way, the protagonist would have needed at least some serious thinking and inner debate before proceeding as they do in the final chapters."

Venus in Furs (, ) is a 1969 Italian supernatural erotic thriller film directed by Jesús Franco and starring James Darren.
The film (also known as Paroxismus and Black Angel) bears only a superficial resemblance to the 1870 Venus in Furs novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The title and character names in Franco's original script were changed to the novel's for commercial reasons. Franco's film is a surreal supernatural erotic thriller about unattainable love and how far one is willing to go for the person they desire. It is not a study in masochism as the novel is.
Premise
James Darren plays a jazz musician who becomes obsessed to the point of madness with the mysterious fur-clad Wanda, then finds their dead body washed up on the beach.

Music
British avantgarde fusion band Manfred Mann Chapter Three wrote and recorded the soundtrack for Venus in Furs. The band had just formed at the time. Excerpts were released in 2019 as part of the album Radio Days, Vol. 3: Manfred Mann Chapter Three (Live Sessions & Studio Rarities). One of the tracks, entitled "At the Party" on the soundtrack, later ended up on Manfred Mann Chapter Three Volume Two as "Jump Before You Think".
Reception
The New York Times gave Venus in Furs a negative review on its initial release, saying that the film "features much inept fancy moviemaking (including echoes of "La Dolce Vita" and even "Vertigo"), some semi-nudity, and virtually endless confusion". Glenn Erickson was more positive.

During the Reign of Terror, the castle was used as a prison for Roman Catholic priests. The castle was restored in 1844–48.
The castle was rented to Henri Carton de Wiart from 1916 onwards, when they were the Belgian Minister of Justice. Guests included Maurice Barrès, Louis Barthou and René Bazin.
The castle is now a luxury hotel.
Architectural significance
It has been listed as an official historical monument since December 22, 1952.

The Sheffield and Hallamshire Football Association is a County Football Association in England. It was formed in Sheffield in 1867 as the Sheffield Football Association, and is the second-oldest football governing body after the Football Association (FA). Its teams adopted the Sheffield Rules of football until 1878, when they were merged with the FA's rules. Its members include the two oldest football clubs in the world, Sheffield and Hallam.
Today, the County FA is responsible for the administration, control, promotion and development of grass-roots football within a 20-mile radius of Sheffield Cathedral. This covers almost all of South Yorkshire (excluding only the area around Askern, Hatfield and Thorne) as well as parts of North Derbyshire (e.g. Dronfield), North Nottinghamshire (e.g. Worksop), and southern parts of West Yorkshire (e.g. Emley, Hemsworth).
History
Organised football started in Sheffield in 1857 with the birth of Sheffield Football Club and the creation of Sheffield Rules. By the early 1860s there were over 15 clubs in the Sheffield area and they were the first to start inter-club games. This was done with no formal body in overall control with Sheffield Rules used by the majority of clubs.
The Sheffield Football Association was founded by the end of January 1867, with Harry Chambers, secretary of Sheffield FC, serving as its first President. It claimed membership of 14 clubs, representing over 1,000 members. The Association issued its first set of rules on 6 March 1867, basing them on the FA's rules which had been formulated in February of the same year.
Although the Youdan Cup took place between February and March 1867, and was competed for by most of the Association's member clubs, it was organized by a separate committee and was unable to use the Sheffield FA's rules, since they were not issued until the day after the Cup's final. A second cup, the Cromwell Cup, was played the next year under the auspices of the Sheffield Association. It was only open to teams under two years old, and was won by The Wednesday.
On 2 December 1871, played the first inter-association game with the London Association, beating them 3–1 at Bramall Lane. Despite losing the game, the London Association (now known as the F.A.) became the primary association which led to the national adoption of the London rules. However, the Sheffield Association continued to have some influence and on 17 February 1872 proposed Rule VII introducing the corner-kick to the Association Rules.
Over the next few years, matches against the associations of Birmingham, Glasgow, North Wales, Manchester and Staffordshire were arranged. Other non-association friendlies were played notably against the Wanderers, the Swifts and the Royal Engineers.
The first annual competition, the Sheffield Association Challenge Cup, was introduced in the 1876–77 season. This was joined by the Wharncliffe Charity Cup two years later. Both were won by Wednesday, who had become the dominant force in local football, in their first year.
The creep of professionalism began in 1876 when Wednesday brought down James Lang from Glasgow. They were officially hired by the club but received a job with no formal duties from one of the members of the club board. The association subsequently had to deal with open professionalism when members of The Zulus received payment for matches. A number of players were banned, so many in fact that it led to the abandonment of the 1882 Sheffield Challenge Cup final. In 1885, professionalism was made legal but the Sheffield Association, led by Charles Clegg and William Peirce Dix remained firm opponents of professionalism in football.
In 1877, a rival association given the name Sheffield New was established in protest of Sheffield FA's decision not to allow any club under two years old to become a member. It later changed its name to Hallamshire Football Association. This situation persisted until the end of the 1886–87 season when a merger of the two associations was negotiated by Clegg who took charge of the new association with Dix employed as secretary.
The clubs of the Sheffield F.A. of 1877 were Albion, Artillery and Hallamshire Rifles, Attercliffe, Brightside, Brincliffe, Broomhall, Crookes, Exchange, Exchange Brewery, Fir Vale, Gleadless, Hallam, Heeley, Kimberworth, Millhouses, Norfolk, Norfolk Works, Owlerton, Oxford, Parkwood Springs, Philadelphia, Rotherham, Sheffield, Surrey, Thursday Wanderers, Wednesday.

Representative teams
The Sheffield & Hallamshire FA formerly ran the Sheffield representative team that was active from the earliest days of the game in the 1860s, playing against select teams from cities such as London and Glasgow, the series against the latter running from 1874 to 1960.
Since 1944 an U18 side has represented the Sheffield & Hallamshire FA in the FA County Youth Cup, winning the competition in 1953 and 1964.

Spinola Redoubt (), also known as Birżebbuġa Redoubt (), was a tour-reduit in Birżebbuġa, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715–1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. It has been demolished.
History
Spinola Redoubt built in 1715–1716 part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included three other redoubts, the large Saint Lucian Tower, two smaller De Redin towers, seven batteries and three entrenchments. The nearest fortifications to Spinola Redoubt were Pinto Battery to the northeast and Birżebbuġa Entrenchments to the south.
Spinola Redoubt was one of four tour-reduits built in Malta, with the other three being Fresnoy Redoubt, Vendôme Tower and Marsalforn Tower. It had a square shape, similar to the surviving Vendôme Tower.
The redoubt has been demolished and its site is now a public garden.

German submarine U-377 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 8 April 1940 at the Howaldtswerke yard in Kiel, launched on 15 August 1941, and commissioned on 2 October 1941 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Otto Köhler.
U-377 was attached to the 6th U-boat Flotilla, and was ready for front-line service from 1 February 1942. They served with the 11th U-boat Flotilla based in Norway from 1 July 1942, and was transferred to the 9th U-boat Flotilla based in France on 1 March 1943. They sailed on 11 war patrols between February 1942 and January 1944, but sank no ships, before they were sunk with the loss of all hands on 17 January 1944 on the position by depth charges from the British destroyer and the frigate .

They had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Garbe, Lahmeyer & Co. RP 137/c double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. They had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, they could travel at . U-377 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.
Service history
Norway
U-377 sailed from Kiel on 14 February 1942 and patrolled along the coast of Norway before arriving at Narvik on 28 February. This was their home port for the rest of the year, they sailed on a series of six patrols in the Barents Sea, without success.
On 30 January 1943 U-377 left Bergen and sailed out into the Atlantic, patrolling south of Greenland, before arriving at Brest in France on 18 March, having been transferred to the 9th U-boat Flotilla.
France
U-377 sailed from Brest on 15 April, out into the mid-Atlantic, and patrolled for 54 days, before returning to base on 7 June.
On 2 August 1943 their commander, Otto Köhler, left the boat and was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Gerhard Kluth. Kluth's first patrol was quite eventful, as their first two attempts were cut short; U-377 sailed from Brest on 26 August 1943, but returned on the 30th; they sailed again on 6 September 1943, returning the next day. Finally they set out again on 9 September, joining other U-boats in mid-Atlantic. On 22 September, the U-boat was attacked by a B-24 Liberator, wounding the commander. The U-boat returned to port under the command of the WO. Leutnant zur See Ernst-August Gerke.
Loss
U-377 departed from Brest on 15 December 1943, with Kluth back in command, sailing out into mid-Atlantic. They made their last radio report on 15 January 1944, claiming to have attacked an unidentified search group with homing torpedoes. The BdU ("U-boat Command") expected the U-boat to head back to France on or about 29 January, so when they had failed to arrive by 10 February, they were listed as missing from 4 February 1944. After the war the Allied Assessment Committee were unable to attribute the loss of U-377 to any known anti-submarine attack, and the U-boat was officially recorded as "lost to unknown cause". The Kriegsmarine had received at least two partially corrupted unsigned coded emergency messages around the time of the U-boat's disappearance, leading to a theory that U-377 had been sunk by one of its own Zaunkoenig T-5 acoustic torpedoes. This explanation has been generally accepted post-war. However, an attack by the British destroyer and frigate at , on 17 January took place two days and about from U-377s last known position (where they would have been, had they been on course and sailing at the most economical speed, as ordered) and recent research suggests that this was the U-boat's fate.
Wolfpacks
U-377 took part in 15 wolfpacks, namely:
Aufnahme (7 – 11 March 1942)
Blücher (11 – 18 March 1942)
Bums (6 – 14 April 1942)

Banjo is a defunct British chocolate bar.
Background
The original Banjo chocolate bar was sold in the Greater London area, UK, but the product was discontinued in 1954. At that time, it was a chocolate wafer bar, with a chocolate filling, covered in milk chocolate, rather similar to Kit Kat.
Banjo was reintroduced with a substantial television advertising campaign in 1976. In this reincarnation, Banjo was a twin bar (similar in shape and size to Twix) and was the same as a Drifter but with a chopped peanut layer and the whole covered in milk chocolate. It was packaged in distinctive navy blue - with the brand name prominently displayed in yellow block text - and was one of the first British snack bars to have a heat-sealed wrapper closure instead of the reverse-side fold common to most domestically-produced chocolate bars at that time. It was available into the 1980s. There was a coconut version also available in a red wrapper with yellow text.

The Big Eight Conference was a high school athletic league in Iowa made up of some of the largest schools in the state.
Members
Ames
Cedar Falls
Fort Dodge
Marshalltown
Mason City
Newton
Waterloo East
Waterloo West
History
The Big Eight Conference was formed in 1963 when Des Moines North and Des Moines East left the old Big Six Conference to compete in the Metropolitan Conference. The league's four remaining members (Fort Dodge, Mason City, and the Waterloo schools) reached out to other large schools in central Iowa to rebuild the conference. Cedar Falls joined from the Northeast Iowa Conference and Ames, Marshalltown, and Newton joined from the Central Iowa Conference. The conference became known as the Big Nine Conference when Waterloo Central opened in 1972. The name would be changed back to the Big Eight Conference in 1988 when Waterloo Central, as part of a school district reorganization, was converted to a junior high school.
From the onset, the league was one of the strongest in the state. In its first year of competition, league schools captured state championships in four of the seven sports the IHSAA conducted championships for at the time. The league also claimed the first two 5-on-5 girls' basketball titles in state history (for many years the IGHSAU only sponsored 6-on-6 basketball). Among other notable achievements, the league also had a stronghold on the boys' cross-country title for 12 years, winning a state title all but one year from 1964 to 1975.
The league was stable until the late 1980s when Newton and Ames left to join the Central Iowa Metro League. Soon after, the other members of the conference began looking for new homes. Marshalltown found a home in the CIML. Cedar Falls, Waterloo East, and Waterloo West then joined the Mississippi Valley Conference and Fort Dodge and Mason City, geographic outliers to among the rest of the state's largest schools, followed Marshalltown, Ames, and Newton to the CIML after being originally being declined membership in the league.

John Peck Rathbun (1746–1782) was an officer in the Continental Navy and in the United States Navy. Rathbun was from Rhode Island with family in Boston. Rathbun served in the Continental Navy from its late 1775 beginning as John Paul Jones First Lieutenant.
Capture of Nassau
Rathbun was promoted to Captain in April 1777 and given command of the sloop-of-war Providence upon which they had participated in an American attack on New Providence in 1776. Rathbun took Providence back to the Bahamas on the night of 27 January 1778. Rathbun approached Nassau disguised as a trading sloop and anchored offshore in darkness. Twenty-six marines under command of Captain John Trevett went ashore by boat with a scaling ladder. They climbed Fort Nassau's 22-foot walls with the ladder and overpowered the two guards before daybreak. The Marines then continued sending the guards' periodic "All is well" call to guards outside of the fort while repositioned the fort's 18-pound cannon to cover parts of the city and harbor from which reinforcements might arrive. Dawn found the American stars and stripes flying over conquered enemy territory for the first time since the Continental Congress approved the flag. While their remaining marines patrolled the wall in full view of the city, Trevett sent three Marines to Fort Montague with a claim that a force of 230 Marines held Fort Nassau. Fort Montague surrendered, and Marines spiked the cannon and poured the gunpowder into the sea. Twenty-four American merchant seamen came forward to assist. The Americans had been stranded in Nassau when their ships had been captured by privateers. The American merchant seamen were sent into the harbor to demand surrender of five ships lying under the guns of Fort Nassau. Rathbun brought Providence into harbor in the early afternoon, and loaded all Fort Nassau's gunpowder and 300 small arms. Rathbun departed on the morning of 30th, with three captured ships manned by the American merchant seamen, after spiking the guns of Fort Nassau and burning the two ships they could not man. No blood had been shed.
Action At Sea
In 1779, they assumed command of the frigate Queen of France and in July cruised off Newfoundland with Providence and Ranger. On the 16th, the ships sighted a convoy bound for Britain. Fog closed in, but when it lifted, Queen of France was next to a merchantman whose crew mistook the American for a British escort vessel. Rathbun took advantage of the situation, exploited the mistake in identity, and captured the ship. Ranger and Providence followed suit. Ten more ships were cut out of the convoy, their total value approaching $1 million.
Defense of Charleston
In 1780, Rathbun took Queen of France south in Commodore Abraham Whipple's force to bolster the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina. There, with smaller ships, they were stationed in the Ashley River to prevent British forces under Cornwallis from crossing and attacking the city. As the American position weakened, Queen of France's guns were removed and they were sunk as a block ship. Them crew then went ashore and Rathbun served as an artilleryman until the city fell in May 1781.
Privateer
Taken prisoner at the fall of Charleston, Rathbun and the other American captains were paroled and allowed to return to New England. There, they found that the Continental Navy had dwindled and no commands were available. Thereupon, Rathbun, a true patriot, secured a commission from Congress on 4 August to command the Massachusetts privateer brig Wexford. About two weeks later, they set sail from Boston bound for St. George's Channel near Britain and, within another six weeks reached the coast of Ireland. There, less than 100 miles from Cape Clear, they ran afoul of the 32-gun frigate HMS Recovery. Following a 24-hour chase during which HMS Recovery fired at least one broadside, Rathbun and their ship were captured by the British warship.
Incarcerated first at Kinsale Prison near Cork, Ireland, Rathbun was later transferred to Mill Prison or Old Mill Prison in Plymouth, England, where they died on 20 June 1782.
Namesakes
Two ships, USS Rathburne, were named for him. Although their name was spelled Rathburne or Rathbourne in official records, including the two warships named after him, this was an error. Their name was Rathbun.

Blantyre is one of the twenty wards used to elect members of the South Lanarkshire Council. Created in 2007, it originally returned four councillors with its territory mirroring the limits of the town of Blantyre (the northern/eastern border is the River Clyde and the western border the Rotten Calder) other than the Hamilton International Technology Park and the modern West Craigs development on its southern periphery; a 2017 national review resulted in a minor change in the boundaries (the loss of the streets around Ballantrae Road) but this led to one seat fewer being allocated. The population in 2018 was 16,101.

The Thomas Nichols Three Deckers are three historic three deckers located at 68, 80 and 88 West Britannia Street in Taunton, Massachusetts. The once-identical buildings were built in 1914 by Thomas Nichols, a real estate speculator. Two of the three (numbers 68 and 80) were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for their external architecture and rarity of form in the city; #68 has since been compromised by alterations.
Description and history
The Thomas Nichols Three Deckers are located north of downtown Taunton, on the south side of West Britannia Street between Hopewell and Thomas Streets. They are located a short walk from the Reed and Barton Complex, historically one of the city's major industrial employers. All three are fairly typical triple deckers, of wood-frame construction with flat roofs. They were all originally sided with wooden shingles, have corner pilasters, and the roofs had extended eaves studded with modillion blocks. Of the three, only #80 retains all of these features: #68 has been refinished in wooden clapboards and synthetic siding, and the eaves no longer have modillions. #88 has been refinished in aluminum siding and has none of these features. All three have three-story porches on one side of the front, and a projecting polygonal bay on the other. Porches and projecting bays are also found on one side of numbers 80 and 88. The front porches have round columns for support, and have a broad entablature at the top of the third floor.
Although quite common in many industrial New England cities, three deckers were historically an uncommon sight in Taunton. These three were estimated to be built about 1914, based on architectural evidence. They were probably built by Thomas Nichols, a prominent local real estate developer of the period.

The 1936 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy saw Norton rider Jimmie Guthrie win the Senior, and come fifth in the Junior. The Junior was won by Freddie Frith in their first year on the Norton team, and the Lightweight was won by Bob Foster on a New Imperial.
Following on from the dramatic win by Stanley Woods in the 1935 Senior TT Race, the 1936 Junior TT Race proved to be highly controversial and was marred by disqualification and protest. As Moto Guzzi were involved in war production for the crisis in Abyssinia, Stanley Woods rode for Velocette in the 1936 Junior TT but retired at Sulby on lap 1 with engine problems. After leading for five laps, Jimmie Guthrie was forced to stop between Hillberry and Signpost Corner to replace the drive chain. Although Jimmie Guthrie continued in 2nd place the lead passed to Norton team-mate Freddie Frith who had joined the team after winning the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix. At Parliament Square in Ramsey on lap 6, Jimmie Guthrie was 'black-flagged' for receiving outside assistance and disqualified. Guthrie denied the charge, however, and continued the race to finish in fifth place which was won by Freddie Frith to record their first Isle of Man TT win at an average race speed of . The Norton race team protested the disqualification and Jimmie Guthrie was posted in 5th place in the final race classification and was awarded 2nd place prize money.
In the Senior TT race Harold Daniell and George Rowley rode supercharged AJS V4s, but despite their high top speed, the bikes lacked acceleration. Both riders retired due to mechanical problems.
The 1936 Lightweight TT Race was held after being delayed for a day because of mist and fog on the Mountain Course. The 1936 Lightweight Race proved to be closely contested by Bob Foster riding for New Imperial and Stanley Woods riding the 3 cylinder supercharged 250 cc DKW who retired on lap 7 after stopping to change a spark-plug. The 1936 Lightweight Race was won by Bob Foster at an average race speed of from Tyrell Smith riding for Excelsior in 2nd place and A.Geiss in 3rd place riding a DKW motor-cycle.

Charles Overton (1805–1889) was a British cleric and writer.
Early life and education
Overton was born in York, the sixth son of John Overton (1763–1838), rector of St. Margaret's and St. Crux. They were brought up to be a civil engineer, and was not sent to university; but in 1829 they were ordained deacon by Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, the Archbishop of York. They were for a short time assistant curate of Christ Church, Harrogate, but in the year of their ordination moved to Romaldkirk near Barnard Castle.
Career
Overton received priest's orders in 1830 from John Bird Sumner, Bishop of Chester, who in 1837 was presented them to the vicarage of Clapham, then in West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1841 Sumner presented them to the vicarage of Cottingham, near Hull, where they spent the remainder of their life. They were an evangelical and active parish priest in a scattered parish, which then included Skidby and Newland. The parish church of Cottingham was restored, a parsonage and schools were built, and the income increased, while schools and vicarage houses were built at Skidby and Newland.
Works
Overton wrote both in prose and verse. The most popular of their works was Cottage Lectures on Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" practically explained (1847 first part, 1849 second part), well received by UK and US evangelicals. A poem Ecclesia Anglicana (London, n.d.) was written at Romaldkirk to celebrate the restoration of York Minster after its partial destruction by the arsonist Jonathan Martin; a later edition appeared in 1853. It was good-humouredly satirised by Thomas Moore in a parody.
Other works were:
Cottage Lectures on the Lord's Prayer practically explained; delivered in the Parish Church of Cottingham (1848).
The Expository Preacher; or St. Matthew's Gospel practically expounded in Cottingham Church (1850, 2 vols.).
A Voice from Yorkshire: a Scene at Goodmanham, in the East Riding, A.D. 627, with Notes (1850), about Godmundingham.
The History of Cottingham (1860).
The Life of Joseph, in twenty-three Expository Lectures (1866).
Later life and death
Overton died on 31 March 1889, and was buried at Cottingham.
Personal life
In 1829 Overton married Amelia Charlesworth; they died in 1885. By them they had a family of four sons and three daughters.

The pungy is a type of schooner developed in and peculiar to the Chesapeake Bay region. The name is believed to derive from the Pungoteague region of Accomack County, Virginia, where the design was developed in the 1840s and 1850s.
In form, the pungy is a two-masted gaff-rigged schooner with a main topsail but no square-rigged sails (as found on the related Baltimore clipper). The masts are tall and raked, and there is a bowsprit on the clipper bow. The deck is flush, with a log rail. The hull is framed and has a vee profile. One peculiar detail of the pungy is its traditional paint scheme of green and pink, the origin of which is unknown.
The pungy, like the Baltimore clipper, evolved from the pilot schooner. Its principal usage was to haul freight, particularly perishables ranging from oysters to farm produce. It was capable of ocean travel and was used, for instance, to ship pineapples to Baltimore from Bermuda. It was also used for a time to dredge for oysters, but its excessive draft and large crew complement led to its being replaced by the bugeye. The last pungies were built in the 1880s, and the type's use died out in the first half of the twentieth century.
A replica, the Lady Maryland, was built in 1985–1986 and continues to serve as a floating classroom for The Living Classrooms Foundation.

In meteorology, the equilibrium level (EL), or level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), or limit of convection (LOC), is the height at which a rising parcel of air is at the same temperature as its environment.
This means that unstable air is now stable when it reaches the equilibrium level and convection stops. This level is often near the tropopause and can be indicated as near where the anvil of a thunderstorm because it is where the thunderstorm updraft is finally cut off, except in the case of overshooting tops where it continues rising to the maximum parcel level (MPL) due to momentum. More precisely, the cumulonimbus will stop rising around a few kilometres prior to reaching the level of neutral buoyancy and on average anvil glaciation occurs at a higher altitude over land than over sea (despite little difference in LNB from land to sea).

The Bahadur Group, or the Special Services Group as it was initially formed, was a Special Forces unit within the Indian National Army that was tasked with frontline intelligence as well as subversion and sabotage operations behind enemy lines. This was the INA's second special forces unit besides the Intelligence group led by Colonel Shaukat Hayat Malikof Bhawalpur Regiment who is credited with raising the flag of Azad Hind in Moirang in 14 April 1944, an event accepted as one of the first instances of the liberation of Indian soil by an independent Indian government.
They were two parts to the organization: the Special Service Group and the Secret Service Group. Both of these groups were trained in commando tactics,sabotage,intelligence collection and deep penetration missions in India while some members received training in Linguistics in order to liaison with local Japanese units. Usually operating in groups of 8 to 10 members of the Bahadur group were attached to local Japanese divisions in order to spread propaganda among Indian troops in the British Indian army and to act as pathfinders.

Clevegen is a new cancer immunotherapy drug under development in Finland by Faron Pharmaceuticals.
The drug is an anti-Clever-1 antibody which can convert immune suppressive type-2 tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immune active type-1 microphages and has the potential for wide use in oncology. It is currently (2019) undergoing trials (codename MATINS) as an innovative treatment for metastatic or inoperable solid tumours such as cutaneous melanoma and hepatobiliary/hepatocellular, pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers, all of which host a significant number of Clever-1-positive TAMs and represent some 2 million cases annually worldwide.
Following encouraging results of early European trials regarding the drugs tolerability and safety the MATINS programme is being extended to the USA. Later trials will study the drug's efficacy in treating patients with high Clever-1 occurrence, who can be readily identified by liquid biopsy using a blood myeloid cell staining technique.

Shimmy Marcus is an Irish filmmaker.
Early life
Marcus was born and raised in the Dublin suburb of Terenure, the son of Louis Marcus (twice Oscar nominated documentary film-maker). They were educated at Stratford College, and studied Business Management and Advertising in Dublin Institute of Technology.
After some years of traveling around the world, Marcus returned to Dublin in the early 1990s to work briefly as a recording and live sound engineer before turning to stage lighting and design. They developed stage lighting for several Irish indie bands at the time, including Engine Alley, LiR, Peach, and The Unbelievable Children.
Career
They wrote their first speculative screenplay Headrush over Christmas 1994 and it was optioned shortly after by Ed Guiney of Element Films. They made their first short film in 1998, 7th Heaven, which won the "Best Short Film" award at the Irish International Film Festival in New York.
In 1999, they won the Miramax Scriptwriting Award for Headrush.
In 2000 they released the feature documentary Aidan Walsh: Master of the Universe which they directed, produced, and co-edited about underground cult performer Aidan Walsh. The film went on to win awards and became the first documentary made on video to receive theatrical and video distribution in Ireland.
In 2003 they completed Headrush. Again Marcus received awards and positive reviews, but despite positive reviews in outlets such as Variety, the film failed to receive wide distribution.
In 2005 they released the film themselves across 10 screens in Ireland, gaining modest box office takings.
Marcus continued experiment with different work, most notably their interpretations of three chapters from James Joyce's Ulysses in the feature documentary Imagining Ulysses and their series of Limelight Shorts commissioned by the Dublin Theatre Festival to celebrate their 50th Anniversary.
Marcus also directed a documentary for RTÉ's U2 Night (25 June 2005), and a music videos for Fun Lovin' Criminals, Snow Patrol, Gavin Friday, Skin (Skunk Anansie), Republic of Loose, and BP Fallon with Jack White.
In 2009 they complete their second feature Soulboy. Set against the backdrop of the Northern Soul scene in the North of England in the mid 1970s, the film came second in the "Audience Award for Best Film" at its premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. The low budget film was well-received by some critics. and was released in the UK in September 2010. The Guardian called it The Comeback Kid for punching above its weight at the box office.
Their second feature documentary, Good Cake, Bad Cake about the Irish band LiR and their quest to make it in the music business, also received strong reviews on its limited release.
Since then, Marcus has made two more award-winning short films, Rhinos and Hannah Cohen's Holy Communion. In 2014 they set up Bow Street Academy for Screen Acting in Smithfield, Dublin, where they are the artistic director.

Johnson, and many others. Beveridge was first noticed as an artist in the US in 1892, when their busts of former President Cleveland and Mr. Jefferson called favorable attention to them
In 1893, they married actor Charles Francis Coghlan, and soon discovered that they had a living common-law wife at the time of their marriage. They obtained a divorce for desertion when Coghlan returned to live with the woman. Before they went to South Africa, Beveridge had executed several commissions for Cecil Rhodes and others living in that region. Beveridge received an Honorable Mention in the Paris Exposition in 1900. With the help of their mother, they also made a statue "The Veiled Venus" for the 1900 Paris Exposition which was awarded a bronze medal at the Paris Salon and was placed in Leeds Museum, England They also made "San Francisco weeping at the Golden Gate" for the San Francisco Golden Gate Park. Beveridge married a second time, August 25, 1903, to an American, Mr. William B. Branson, who resided at Johannesburg, in the Transvaal.
In 1907 they resided in London. In 1910, under their maiden name, they exhibited in Leipzig, Germany, a sculpture of man and woman called "The Vampire" [the exploitation of woman by man]. In 1913, Beveridge was a resident of Mayfair, London England In 1914, their sister Ray Beveridge, an actor, was divorced from their husband Irving Seliger. In February 1916, Beveridge was interviewed in their Munich, Germany studio. In May 1916, they were still at their Munich Studio. They were listed as a surviving child in their father's May 1921 obituary. In June 1930, they were selected as a member of the Illinois Hall of Fame. The 1951 obituary of their step-sister Mrs. Marian (Beveridge) Pringle does not list Kühne Beveridge as a survivor.

Hell House LLC is a 2015 American found-footage horror film written and directed by Stephen Cognetti and produced by Fbi Films. The film, shot as a documentary, follows a group of Halloween haunted house creators as they prepare for the 2009 opening of their popular haunted attraction, Hell House. Tragedy strikes on opening night when an unknown "malfunction" causes the death of 15 tour-goers and staff. The film reveals the lead-up to the tragedy and documenting what exactly went wrong that night which has been a mystery to the public. The film was released on a number of video on-demand platforms, including Amazon Video, Shudder, YouTube, Vudu, and iTunes, on November 1, 2016.
A sequel, Hell House LLC II: The Abaddon Hotel, was released exclusively on Shudder on September 20, 2018. A second sequel, Hell House LLC III: Lake of Fire was released in September 2019.
Plot
On October 8, 2009, Hell House LLC opened its doors to the public for its inaugural Halloween haunted tour, taking place in the small town fictional of Abaddon in Rockland County, New York. The Hell House crew picked a new location, the abandoned Abaddon Hotel for their attraction. The following morning, 15 tour-goers and staff were confirmed dead. What happened was unclear. Authorities have only said that an "unknown malfunction" occurred on that night.
5 years later, a documentary crew led by producer Diane Graves decides to investigate the tragedy further. They interview people familiar with the case, including a journalist who had broken into the abandoned hotel a few years after the incident and snapped controversial photos that led people to believe something more mysterious happened that night than what had been made public. The crew lands a break when the only surviving member of the Hell House staff, Sara Havel, agrees to be interviewed and provides them with never-before-seen footage shot by the members of Hell House themselves leading up to the tragedy.
The Hell House tapes document the full crew and their arrival at the abandoned Abaddon Hotel, where they go to work setting it up for their haunted attraction. Unexplainable paranormal events begin to happen to them but Alex, the CEO of the company, is determined to press on. Despite bitter disagreements between the other members, Alex convinces the group to stay and the opening night goes on as planned. The footage reveals in eerie detail exactly how the tragedy took place and the paranormal forces behind the deaths of all 15 tour-goers and staff. Clues imply that a satanic cult is behind the activity in the house.
Sara asks for a break from filming and tells Diane they will be in their hotel room should the team have more questions for them They say Diane should break into the Abaddon to see for themselves what happened inside the hotel. Mitchell stays behind to catalogue the footage provided to them by Sara, in which they find something deeply disturbing. They try to call Diane to no avail. At the Abaddon hotel, Diane and their cameraman break in and see the aftermath of what unfolded that night, all left as is. They go to the second floor, where they see a room labeled '2C', the same room Sara said they were staying in. When they enter the room, they find Sara sitting with them back to them. Diane and their cameraman try to flee but are attacked by Sara and other ghostly cult followers.
It is revealed that what Mitchell saw while cataloging the tapes was a possessed member of the Hell House staff killing Sara, revealing they have been dead this entire time, and there were in fact no survivors.
Production
In 2011, the film's executive producers asked for a script revolving around a haunted attraction gone wrong. After many rewrites, the script was locked by late 2013. Casting took place in New York City in February 2014, and production took place shortly after, in May. Initially, the filmmakers were in search of an abandoned house to shoot the film in, as the original script had the events taking place in a house. As early as 2012, the director had been visiting many abandoned buildings and homes, including two in the New York county where the story takes place, Rockland County, New York. After not finding anything suitable, they instead began searching for real haunted house attractions to shoot in. They found the haunted attraction called the Haunting at the Waldorf Hotel in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, run by Angie Moyer, who served as the film's set designer. The script had to be changed in a few areas to reflect the change in setting.
After filming wrapped within Lehighton in May, the production then moved to New York City, where most of the interviews were filmed. In mid-June, filming was complete, and the movie went to post-production, where it would be edited for the next five months, before the first private screening of a rough cut would be seen in the Rose Studio at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
After a few more rounds of re-cuts, the film was locked just before its first public screening at the Telluride Horror Show in October 2015. The film would also screen at Fear Fete Film Festival the same week, where it won the best paranormal film award. The worldwide distribution rights for Hell House LLC were acquired by Terror Films, with a North American VOD release date of November 1, 2016.

Reception
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives Hell House LLC a 89% positive rating based on nine critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.75/10. Dread Central gave the film a positive review, awarding it a score of 3.4/5. Found Footage Critic praised the cast, premise, and cinematography, giving the film a rating of 7.8 of 10. The Horror Society gave a score of 8.75 out of 10 and saying the mystery and suspense works for this film.
SlashFilm also gave the film a positive review writing that "Stephen Cognetti's Halloween chiller marries found footage with haunted attractions, channeling a popular and rational fear." Luke Rodriguez of Modern Horror was more critical of the film, saying that "it doesn't quite stick the landing", but otherwise enjoyed the film.
Sequels
In an interview with Geeks of Doom Cognetti has stated that they see the Hell House LLC trilogy as "one movie just divided into three acts and each movie is its own act". They further commented that they found it easy to write the second and third parts, as they knew "where I wanted to go with it from the get-go".
Hell House LLC II: The Abaddon Hotel
Hell House LLC II: The Abaddon Hotel was released on Shudder on September 20, 2018. The film's plot centers around a group of journalists who have gathered to explore the Abaddon Hotel, which has once again been abandoned following the events of the prior film. The movie further fleshes out the character of Andrew Tully, a character introduced in the first film, and their goal of opening a gate to hell. None of the journalists leave the abandoned hotel alive. The sole survivor found by the police is revealed to have been dead all along and sent out to intrigue people into visiting the hotel.
Bloody Disgusting reviewed the film, criticizing it as a "well-intentioned misstep".
Hell House LLC III: Lake of Fire
Hell House LLC III: Lake of Fire was released as a Shudder exclusive on September 19, 2019. The film is styled as a documentary following Russell Wynn, a wealthy and mysterious entrepreneur who wants the Abaddon Hotel to serve as the location for an immersive theater experience called "Insomnia" based on Faust. Although aware of the location's history, they are keen to proceed with the venture despite others warning them of ongoing and frightening supernatural events. This prompts the documentary team to investigate Russell's past and the prior two events, uncovering new footage that implies Russell was involved with or was monitoring events. When opening night arrives chaos ensues, however Russell manages to wrestle Tully and overcome them before they can kill or take any other innocent lives. The following day one of the documentary crew muses that Russell was likely an angel sent back to defeat Tully and bring an end to their evil plans. Before the film ends, Russell manages to bring back the spirits of the original crew who died in the house, telling them that they are free from the evil but that the house still holds them captive. The song "Running Away" by the Pittsburgh based band "Post Traumatik" was used during the bar scene.
Film School Rejects was critical of the movie, stating that it was "an ambitious stab at closing out a horror trilogy, but as much as that's an accomplishment worth celebrating the end result is an unfortunate disappointment. Still, fans of the first two — or even the first one — might find some worthwhile closure in the final swan song of the Abaddon Hotel." The film holds a rating of 14% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 7 reviews.

Hydronephrosis describes hydrostatic dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces as a result of obstruction to urine flow downstream. Alternatively, hydroureter describes the dilation of the ureter, and hydronephroureter describes the dilation of the entire upper urinary tract (both the renal pelvicalyceal system and the ureter).
Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of hydronephrosis depend upon whether the obstruction is acute or chronic, partial or complete, unilateral or bilateral. Hydronephrosis that occurs acutely with sudden onset (as caused by a kidney stone) can cause intense pain in the flank area (between the hips and ribs) known as a renal colic. Historically, this type of pain has been described as "Dietl's crisis". Conversely, hydronephrosis that develops gradually over time will generally cause either a dull discomfort or no pain. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. An obstruction that occurs at the urethra or bladder outlet can cause pain and pressure resulting from distension of the bladder. Blocking the flow of urine will commonly be prone to urinary tract infections which can lead to further development of stones, fever, and blood or pus in the urine. If complete obstruction occurs, a postrenal kidney failure (obstructive nephropathy) may follow.
Blood tests may show impaired kidney function (elevated urea or creatinine) or electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia or hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis may indicate an elevated pH due to the secondary destruction of nephrons within the affected kidney, which impairs acid excretion. Physical examination in a thin patient may detect a palpable abdominal or flank mass caused by the enlarged kidney.
Causes
Hydronephrosis is the result of any of several abnormal pathophysiological occurrences. Structural abnormalities of the junctions between the kidney, ureter and bladder that lead to hydronephrosis can occur during fetal development. Some of these congenital defects have been identified as inherited conditions, however, the benefits of linking genetic testing to early diagnosis have not been determined. Other structural abnormalities could be caused by injury, surgery, or radiation therapy.
The most common causes of hydronephrosis in children are anatomical abnormalities. These include vesicoureteral reflux, urethral stricture, and stenosis. The most common cause of hydronephrosis in young adults is kidney stones. In older adults, the most common cause of hydronephrosis is benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), or intrapelvic neoplasms such as prostate cancer.
Compression of one or both ureters can also be caused by other developmental defects not completely occurring during the fetal stage such as an abnormally placed vein, artery, or tumor. Bilateral compression of the ureters can occur during pregnancy due to enlargement of the uterus. Changes in hormone levels during this time may also affect the muscle contractions of the bladder, further complicating this condition.
Sources of obstruction that can arise from other various causes include kidney stones, blood clots or retroperitoneal fibrosis.
The obstruction may be either partial or complete, and can occur anywhere from the urethral meatus to the renal calyces. Hydronephrosis can also result from the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder back into the kidneys (vesicoureteral reflux), which can be caused by some of the factors listed above as well as compression of the bladder outlet into the urethra by prostate enlargement or fecal impaction in the rectum (which sits immediately behind the prostate), as well as abnormal contractions of bladder detrusor muscles resulting from neurological dysfunction (neurogenic bladder) or other muscular disorders.
Pathophysiology
Hydronephrosis is caused by obstruction of urine before the renal pelvis. The obstruction causes dilation of the nephron tubules and flattening of the lining of the tubules within the kidneys which in turn causes swelling of the renal calyces.
Hydronephrosis can either be acute or chronic. In acute hydronephrosis full recovery of kidney function is seen. However, with chronic hydronephrosis, permanent loss of kidney function is seen even once obstruction is removed.
Obstruction that occurs anywhere along the upper urinary tract will lead to increased pressure within the structures of the kidney due to the inability to pass urine from the kidney to the bladder. Common causes of upper tract obstruction include obstructing stones and ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction caused by intrinsic narrowing of the ureters or an overlying vessel.
Obstruction occurring in the lower urinary tract can also cause this increased pressure through the reflux of urine into the kidney. Common causes include bladder dysfunction (such as neurogenic bladder) and urethral obstruction (such as posterior urethral valves in male infants) or compression (such as from prostatic hypertrophy in older male adults).
In pregnancy, dextrorotation (rotation to the right) of the uterus can cause compression on the right ureter, thus making hydronephrosis more common in right kidney than left kidney. Besides, hormones such as oestrogen, progestrerone, and prostaglandin can cause ureter dilatation, thus causing hydronephrosis despite the absence of visible obstruction along the urinary tract.
Diagnosis
Prenatal diagnosis is possible, and in fact, most cases in pediatric patients are incidentally detected by routine screening ultrasounds obtained during pregnancy. However, approximately half of all prenatally identified hydronephrosis is transient, and resolves by the time the infant is born, and in another 15%, the hydronephrosis persists but is not associated with urinary tract obstruction (so-called non-refluxing, non-obstructive hydronephrosis). For these children, regression of the hydronephrosis occurs spontaneously, usually by age 3. However, in the remaining 35% of cases of prenatal hydronephrosis, a pathological condition can be identified postnatally.
Diagnostic workup depends on the age of the patient, as well as whether the hydronephrosis was detected incidentally or prenatally or is associated with other symptoms. Blood tests (such measurement of creatinine) are typically indicated, though they must be interpreted cautiously. Even in cases of severe unilateral hydronephrosis, the overall kidney function may remain normal since the unaffected kidney will compensate for the obstructed kidney.
Urinalysis is usually performed to determine the presence of blood (which is typical for kidney stones) or signs of infection (such as a positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite). Impaired concentrating ability or elevated urine pH (distal renal tubular acidosis) are also commonly found due to tubular stress and injury.
Imaging studies
Imaging studies, such as an intravenous urogram (IVU), renal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI, are also important investigations in determining the presence and/ or cause of hydronephrosis. Whilst ultrasound allows for visualisation of the ureters and kidneys (and determine the presence of hydronephrosis and / or hydroureter), an IVU is useful for assessing the anatomical location of the obstruction. Antegrade or retrograde pyelography will show similar findings to an IVU but offer a therapeutic option as well. Real-time ultrasounds and Doppler ultrasound tests in association with vascular resistance testing helps determine how a given obstruction is effecting urinary functionality in hydronephrotic patients.
In determining the cause of hydronephrosis, the location of obstruction can be determined with a Whittaker (or pressure perfusion) test, wherein the collecting system of the kidney is accessed percutaneously, and the liquid is introduced at high pressure and constant rate of 10ml/min while measuring the pressure within the renal pelvis. A rise in pressure above 22 cm H2O suggests that the urinary collection system is obstructed. When arriving at this pressure measurement, bladder pressure is subtracted from the initial reading of internal pressure. (The test was first described by Whittaker in 1973 to test the hypothesis that patients whose hydronephrosis persists after the posterior urethral valves have been ablated usually have ureters that are not obstructed, even though they may be dilated.)
Kay recommends that a neonate born with untreated in utero hydronephrosis receive a renal ultrasound within two days of birth. A renal pelvis greater than 12mm in a neonate is considered abnormal and suggests significant dilation and possible abnormalities such as obstruction or morphological abnormalities in the urinary tract.
The choice of imaging depends on the clinical presentation (history, symptoms and examination findings). In the case of renal colic (one sided loin pain usually accompanied by a trace of blood in the urine) the initial investigation is usually a spiral or helical CT scan. This has the advantage of showing whether there is any obstruction of flow of urine causing hydronephrosis as well as demonstrating the function of the other kidney. Many stones are not visible on plain X-ray or IVU but 99% of stones are visible on CT and therefore CT is becoming a common choice of initial investigation. CT is not used, however, when there is a reason to avoid radiation exposure, e.g. in pregnancy.
For incidentally detected prenatal hydronephrosis, the first study to obtain is a postnatal renal ultrasound, since as noted, many cases of prenatal hydronephrosis resolve spontaneously. This is generally done within the first few days after birth, although there is some risk that obtaining an imaging study this early may miss some cases of mild hydronephrosis due to the relative oliguria of a newborn. Thus, some experts recommend obtaining a follow-up ultrasound at 4–6 weeks to reduce the false-negative rate of the initial ultrasound. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is also typically obtained to exclude the possibility of vesicoureteral reflux or anatomical abnormalities such as posterior urethral valves. Finally, if hydronephrosis is significant and obstruction is suspected, such as a ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) or ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction, a nuclear imaging study such as a MAG-3 scan is warranted.
Grading
The Society of Fetal Ultrasound (SFU) has developed a grading system for hydronephrosis, initially intended for use in neonatal and infant hydronephrosis, but it is now used for grading hydronephrosis in adults as well:
Grade 0 – No renal pelvis dilation. This means an anteroposterior diameter of less than 4 mm in fetuses up to 32 weeks of gestational age and 7 mm afterwards. In adults, cutoff values for renal pelvic dilation have been defined differently by different sources, with anteroposterior diameters ranging between 10 and 20 mm. About 13% of normal healthy adults have a transverse pelvic diameter of over 10 mm.
Grade 1 (mild) – Mild renal pelvis dilation (anteroposterior diameter less than 10 mm in fetuses) without dilation of the calyces nor parenchymal atrophy
Grade 2 (mild) – Moderate renal pelvis dilation (between 10 and 15 mm in fetuses), including a few calyces
Grade 3 (moderate) – Renal pelvis dilation with all calyces uniformly dilated. Normal renal parenchyma
Grade 4 (severe) – As grade 3 but with thinning of the renal parenchyma
Treatment
Treatment of hydronephrosis focuses upon the removal of the obstruction and drainage of the urine that has accumulated behind the obstruction. Therefore, the specific treatment depends upon where the obstruction lies.
Acute obstruction of the upper urinary tract is usually treated by the insertion of a nephrostomy tube. Chronic upper urinary tract obstruction is treated by the insertion of a ureteric stent or a pyeloplasty.
Lower urinary tract obstruction (such as that caused by bladder outflow obstruction secondary to prostatic hypertrophy) is usually treated by insertion of a urinary catheter or a suprapubic catheter. Surgery is not required in all prenatally detected cases.
Prognosis
The prognosis of hydronephrosis is extremely variable and depends on the condition leading to hydronephrosis, whether one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) kidneys are affected, the pre-existing kidney function, the duration of hydronephrosis (acute or chronic), and whether hydronephrosis occurred in developing or mature kidneys.
Permanent kidney damage can occur from prolonged hydronephrosis secondary to compression of kidney tissue and ischemia.
For example, unilateral hydronephrosis caused by an obstructing stone will likely resolve when the stone passes, and the likelihood of recovery is excellent. Alternately, severe bilateral prenatal hydronephrosis (such as occurs with posterior urethral valves) will likely carry a poor long-term prognosis, because obstruction while the kidneys are developing causes permanent kidney damage even if the obstruction is relieved postnatal.
Hydronephrosis can be a cause of pyonephrosis, which is a urological emergency.

The RUR-4 "Weapon Alpha" (originally Weapon Able) was an American naval ahead-throwing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) rocket launcher. It was designed between 1946 and 1949, and was installed on warships from 1951 to 1969. Unlike depth charges, it was designed to attack enemy submarines without requiring the attacking ship to be located directly above the submarine being attacked.
Development
Similar to the earlier American Mousetrap, 375mm (14.8") Swedish Bofors, and 250mm (9.8") and 300mm (11.8") Soviet systems, all of which use multiple rockets, Weapon Alpha was developed toward the end of World War II, in response to the German Type XXI U-boat. Begun in a crash program in 1944–5 and put in service before undergoing operational evaluation, it emerged in 1949 as a 227-kg (500 lb) 127mm (5") rocket with a 113-kg (250 lb) warhead that sank at 12 m/s (40 ft/s) (compared to a depth charge, which sank at 2.7–5 m/s (8.9–16.5 ft/s)), an influence or time pistol, and a range of 360–730 m (400–800 yd). Coupled to the new SQG-1 depth-finding sonar (for setting the time fuse, rather than the hydrostatic pistol of a depth charge), it was to be fired from a revolving Mark 108 launcher (with 22 rounds of ready ammunition) at up to twelve rounds per minute. The ready-service magazine could not be reloaded while Weapon Alpha was in use.
It was replaced by the RUR-5 ASROC, which was developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s. Nonetheless, Weapon Alpha remained in service through the 1960s until supplanted by ASROC.

A. Z. Jolicco Cuadra (24 May 1939 in Zamboanga City - 30 April 2013 in Calamba City) was a poet and artist, art critic, essayist, and short story writer. They were known as the "enfant terrible of Philippine art" in the 1960s, and their good looks and writings dubbed them the Byron of Philippine literature.
They wrote poetry, the art form that they held as the highest form of art, although they also painted and even held a one-man show at Cafe Giorgio in Makati in the 1990s. After their death, some of their poet-friends launched a book of poems on October 24, 2013, entitled Companionable Voices as a tribute to him. The book was a special edition commemorative folio dedicated to Cuadra. The group, composed of major Filipino poets in English from the 1960s, selected a long poem written by Cuadra, a poem of not less than 1,000 lines. Joining their poem in the anthology were poems by Cesar Ruiz Aquino, Recah A. Trinidad, Erwin E. Castillo and Wilfredo Pascua Sanchez.
Cuadra was educated at the Ateneo de Manila University, University of the Philippines, University of the East, art schools in Barcelona, Ecole des Beaux-Art and Académie de la Grande Chaumière also in Paris.
Their awards include First Recipient of the Art Critic of the Philippines Award from the Art Association of the Philippines, 1967; recipient of the Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, 1978; and first Filipino recipient of the Southeast Asian Writers Award (SEAWRITE Award) from Queen Sirikit of Thailand, 1979 in Bangkok, Thailand.
Cuadra's other awards include 1983 Cultural Center honorable mention for poetry and 1967 Art Association of the Philippines art criticism award.
Cuadra worked as an Art and Editorial Sections columnist for the Manila Chronicle and the Manila Bulletin, from 1964 to 2010, while writing as an essayist and art critic for various publications.
Cuadra's best known poem was "Dogstar." It was included in the Doveglion, a book of Philippine poetry in English edited by National Artist for Literature poet Jose Garcia Villa.
The poem, "Dogstar," is a short but powerful poem, to quote:
"Dogstar" was anthologized in the iconic Doveglion Book of Philippine Poetry in 1962 and edited by National Artist for Literature poet Jose Garcia Villa.
As a painter, Cuadra held a one-man show of their paintings which they called "Paintings in Joyous Light" at Cafe Giorgio in Makati in 1996.
Personal life
Cuadra has two sons, Christopher Armin and Jason Leander with wife, Joan Edades. Later in 1974, Cuadra fell in love with a fellow poet, Chiqui Gomez, also known as Auggusta de Almeidda who remained their lifetime partner until their death in 2013. They have a daughter Rajnna Jocelyn.

Courtney is an unincorporated community in southeastern Yadkin County, North Carolina, United States.
The area is in the county's South Liberty Township and bounded on the north by Yadkinville and extending south to the Davie County line and community of Wyo. To the east is the community of Huntsville, and west is Lone Hickory. The community is in the Yadkinville ZIP code area (27055).
History
Religion has played an important role in the community from the early days. Cross Roads Baptist Church was organized in 1835 in what was then known as Bryan Settlement. The church was built at an important crossroads along the Great Wagon Road. Early minutes of the church refer to it as Chinquapin Cross Roads. The church held the first Sunday school in Yadkin County. The church, which changed its name to Courtney Baptist in 1952, helped organize several other Baptist churches in the area, including Deep Creek, South Oak Ridge and Turner's Creek.
Courtney is named for a "Mr. Courtney" who taught in a local school.
Gold mines
Gold was mined in the Courtney area from about 1875 until the 1920s. The Groce Gold Mine operated from 1875 until about 1920.
The Dixon Gold Mine on Wyo Road mined gold from 1902-1923. Thomas M. Dixon first discovered gold on the property. They began panning for gold, then they found a vein of gold three feet under the ground.
Both mines have long closed. However, Vulcan Materials owns land for a granite quarry nearby on Speer Bridge Road.
Homegrown businesses
The community is primarily rural and agricultural. However, because of its proximity to Winston-Salem it has become more of a bedroom community.
Several home-grown businesses provide employment for area residents:
Hanover Park Vineyard, the first licensed winery in Yadkin County since Prohibition, opened on Courtney-Huntsville Road in 1999. A farm house built in 1897 was transformed into the vineyard's tasting room.
Yadkin Valley Telecom, based on Courtney-Huntsville Road since 1971, is a telephone cooperative that serves about 32,000 customers in Yadkin County and portions of Davie and Iredell counties.
J.H. Craver and Son began as a maker of hickory tool handles in 1920. The company, which makes and imports wooden chairs and tables, moved to a plant on U.S. Highway 601 in 1960.
Hibco Plastics, a maker of foam packaging, is located on U.S. Highway 601.
Courtney General Store, Courtney Grocery and Hollars General Store offer area residents conveniences such as food and groceries.
Reavis welding & muffler est.1973
Education
Most children in the community attend Courtney Elementary School, a kindergarten through sixth-grade public community school on Courtney-Huntsville Road. The school is an important focal point for the community. Courtney is one of five feeder schools for Forbush High School, which is located north of the community.
Courtney, established in 1927, was the first standard high school in Yadkin County. It became an elementary-only school after school consolidation in 1967. The school was mostly rebuilt after a 1986 countywide bond referendum.

Paul Byrnes in the Sydney Morning Herald said "A Month of Sundays is a small miracle of a film – an odd combination of modesty and ambition."

Trillium rugelii, also known as the southern nodding trillium or illscented wakerobin, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to parts of the southeastern United States. It is found in the Great Smoky Mountains, Fernbank Forest, Steven's Creek Heritage Preserve, and other places of the Piedmont and southern Appalachian Mountains in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee. It prefers to grow near streams in humus-rich soil under the shade of deciduous trees.
Trillium rugelii is a perennial herbaceous plant that blooms mid April to May. Like some other trillium species (such as T. catesbaei, T. cernuum, and T. vaseyi), its flower hangs below the leaves. In the past, many authors incorrectly cited specimens as Trillium cernuum, which has a similar though smaller flower with shorter stamens and thinner petals. Also, T. cernuum grows farther north and is less robust.
Status
As of 2009 the species is endangered in Tennessee, Georgia, and other parts of the United States.

They were elected mayor of Port-au-Prince in the 1990 elections that brought Jean-Bertrand Aristide's National Front for Change and Democracy party to power.

Harrogate Theatre is a Grade II listed performance hall and theatre, located in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. It is a full hemp house theatre that uses a theatrical rigging system to fly components like curtains, lights and scenery on and off the stage. Unusually, however, the theatre does not have stage doors in the usual way. Instead, personnel enter through the main entrance, then a raised set of barn doors at the back of the building is used for the load-in/load-out.
A brown plaque is displayed outside the theatre paying tribute to some of the famous performers who have appeared on Harrogate Theatre's stage, including Sarah Bernhardt, Charlie Chaplin, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, Steve Harley (as a 4-man acoustic set, not as part of Cockney Rebel), Andy Parsons, Trevor Howard, George Robey, Ellen Terry, Fats Waller, Ken Dodd, Ben Kingsley
and Eddie Izzard.
History
The Harrogate Grand Opera House was designed by architect Frank Tugwell, whose other work includes the Futurist Theatre in Scarborough and the Savoy Theatre in London.
The building opened on 13 January 1900 with a charity performance for soldiers fighting in the Boer War. This was followed by a run of Mr J. Tully's pantomime, Dick Whittington.
The theatre still possesses many of its original front of house fixtures and fittings, as well as a modelled plaster frieze by sculptor Frances Darlington in the foyer that depicts the development of arts through the ages.
Harrogate Theatre Scenic Services
As was typical for a repertory theatre at the time, Harrogate Grand Opera house was home to an on-site workshop to build their sets. This was eventually set up as a commercial venture under the name of Harrogate Theatre Scenic Services (HTSS) and it is now a dedicated workshop located in Starbeck, Harrogate. HTSS constructs and delivers bespoke sets for venues and companies, both in the UK and internationally. It operates with an experienced team of woodworkers, metalworkers, scenic artists and sculptors.
Harrogate Youth Theatre
Harrogate Theatre runs a comprehensive program of activities to engage children and young people aged between 3 and 18 in theatre. It offers training in drama, singing and playwriting, with 10-week terms in the autumn, spring and summer.
The Youth Theatre is currently based in HIVE, a dedicated space located next to the Harrogate Theatre building.

Featherbed Nature Reserve is a privately owned nature reserve on the Western Headland of the Knysna River Estuary on South Africa's Garden Route.
It was founded by South African television teacher, William Smith, on land that was bought in the 1950s by their father, the chemist and ichthyologist Professor JLB Smith, with the proceeds of their best selling book, ‘Old Fourlegs The Story of the Coelacanth,' published in 1956.
The reserve opened to visitors in 1984, and is only accessible to the public by ferry. Smith sold the reserve to Eastern-Cape-based business person Kobus Smit in 2008.
Fauna & Flora
Featherbed Nature Reserve is situated within the Cape Floristic Region. Its vegetation is characterised by Knysna Sand Fynbos and coastal dune thicket. Large portions of the fynbos, and large stands of invasive alien vegetation (particularly rooikrans - Acacia cyclops), which once infested the Reserve, were decimated by fires in the 2017 Cape storm and Kynsna fires. Following the fires, the reserve management instituted a systematic eradication programme in an attempt to contain the resurgence of the rooikrans.
Fauna observed on the reserve includes Cape bushbuck, blue duiker, African clawless otter, and many smaller mammals. Birdlife includes the Knysna turaco (Knysna loerie) and African Black Oystercatcher.

The Great or Große Stubber is a stony sandbank that dries out at low water located in the eastern part of the German Baltic Sea lagoon known as the Greifswalder Bodden or Bay of Greifswald. The name Stubber goes back to the Slavic: Stopin for "step".
History
In the Middle Ages the Stubber was an island that became steadily smaller as a result of tree-felling and the excavation of stones. In 1678 the Stubber Bank acted as an assembly area for the entire naval force gathered for the invasion of Rügen which ended with the successful capture of Swedish-ruled island of Rügen by the Allies, Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark.
In the 19th century, gravel was extracted for the construction of roads in Greifswald.
The island first became awash in the first half of the 20th century. The large glacial erratics that remain to this day are a hazard for sports boats. The Stubber is marked with a shallow water buoy.
Since 2004, the Großer Stubber has been used by the Baltic grey seal (H. g. balticus) as a resting area, after this species had completely died out on the German Baltic Sea coast in 1930. From 2006 increasing numbers of seals, from 7 to 25, were counted on the Großer Stubber all year round.
Since 2006 the Round the Stubber (Rund Stubber) regatta has been held annually in mid-August.

Macrosaccus morrisella (hog peanut moth) is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. In North America it is known from Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, south and west to Texas and Colorado.
The wingspan is 6–7 mm.
The larvae feed on Amphicarpaea bracteata, Strophostyles leiosperma, and soybean (Glycine max). They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine begins as an elongated serpentine track on the underside of the leaflet. This enlarges to an elongate-oval, whitish blotch which eventually becomes strongly tentiform.

Joseph Guerino Tripodi (born 25 November 1967), a former Australian politician, was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing the electorate of Fairfield for the Labor Party between 1995 and 2011. They were Minister for Finance, Infrastructure, Regulatory Reform, Ports and Waterways under former Premier Nathan Rees. They were a controversial figure during their time in politics, known as a factional boss, within the NSW Labor Right whose Terrigals sub-faction has twice dumped the sitting Labor Premier during 2007 and 2010. On 11 November 2010, they announced their decision to not contest the 2011 state election. Tripodi had their membership of the Labor Party terminated in June 2014 after the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) found that Tripodi acted in corrupt conduct by deliberately failing to disclose to their Cabinet colleagues their awareness of the Obeid family's financial interests in Circular Quay leases. In 2016 ICAC made a second finding of corruption against Tripodi for leaking confidential Treasury information to benefit Nathan Tinkler's business interests, and recommended charges. In 2017 ICAC made a third finding of corruption against Tripodi for using their ministerial position to try to award a government water contract to benefit the Obeid family.
Early career
Tripodi was born in 1967 and raised in Fairfield, a suburb in south-western Sydney, the eldest of four children to Italian migrants Angelo and Iolanda, receiving their early years of education at Westfields High School, West Fairfield. They graduated with a Bachelor of Economics (Hons) from the University of Sydney and became an economist with the Reserve Bank of Australia from 1989 to 1991. At age 16, Tripodi joined the Labor Party and served as State Secretary of NSW Young Labor, later becoming an official with the NSW Labor Council from 1993 to 1995.
Political career
In 1995, Tripodi was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the western Sydney electorate of Fairfield for Labor.
Prior to entering the ministry Tripodi was the Chairman of the Legislative Assembly Public Accounts Committee. They were the Minister for Housing from February to August 2005, when they became Minister for Roads. In September 2005, they were chased and grabbed on the floor of the Assembly by National Party member Andrew Fraser, apparently in relation to a road funding issue. In February 2006, they became Minister for Energy, Minister for Ports and Waterways and Minister Assisting the Treasurer on Business and Economic Regulatory Reform. In April 2007, they became Minister for Small Business, Regulatory Reform, Ports and Waterways.
In 2007, former premier Bob Carr was critical of Tripodi's performance as waterways minister with regard to their management of harbour development.
In 2009, it was reported that Tripodi had proposed electricity industry reform in NSW that would result in the three state-owned retailers being sold off to private enterprise and the sale of long-term "gentrader" contracts.
Factional boss
Along with Eddie Obeid, Tripodi was seen as a factional leader of a sub-faction known informally as "the Terrigals". They and Obeid have been held responsible for ending the hopes of loyal Terrigal Carl Scully of becoming NSW Premier in 2005 following the resignation of Bob Carr. Tripodi and Obeid reportedly walked into Scully's office and informed them that they had decided to support then Health Minister Morris Iemma instead. This has since been described as "one of the greatest acts of bastardry of all time". Iemma went on to become Premier and win the 2007 NSW elections; however, in 2008 Tripodi and Obeid withdrew their support for Iemma, forcing Iemma to resign from the NSW Premiership.
On 8 September 2008 Iemma's successor Nathan Rees promoted Tripodi to the Finance and Infrastructure portfolios, in addition to their previous responsibilities of Ports and Waterways, and Regulatory Reform. On 15 November 2009 Rees dumped Tripodi from the front bench for allegedly plotting to install former Health Minister John Della Bosca as Premier; Rees used new special powers granted to them at the NSW Labor Party State Conference the day before, which gave them authority to choose who serves on the Labor front bench instead of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. Soon afterwards, Tripodi enacted revenge on Rees by organising a petition calling for a special caucus meeting to enable a leadership challenge. This resulted in Rees on 3 December 2009 stating that "Should I not be Premier by the end of this day, let there be no doubt in the community's mind, no doubt, that any challenger will be a puppet of Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi". Rees that day subsequently lost the leadership and Premiership to Kristina Keneally.
Controversy
Their career from early on until its end, was marked by a series of public allegations about impropriety and corruption. In October 2000, they were accused of sexually assaulting an Australian Democrat staffer at a New South Wales Parliament House function the month before. The complainant made an initial statement to the NSW Police, but withdrew it the following day. It was later alleged that one of the police officers who investigated the original complaint was a member of Tripodi's branch of the ALP.
In 2001, the manager of a committee chaired by Tripodi took out an apprehended violence order (AVO) against the MP after they publicly opposed a development application by their husband for a tavern opposite a primary school in Tripodi's electorate. The AVO was withdrawn shortly afterward.
Tripodi was also accused of branch stacking. In 1996, it was reported that they paid almost $7,000 in cash to the ALP head office to fund a "branch stack".
Tripodi was implicated in the Orange Grove affair, but subsequently cleared by the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption in 2005.
While Minister for Roads, Tripodi was chased and grabbed by Coffs Harbour local member Andrew Fraser on the floor of Parliament in September 2005, apparently in relation to a lack of funding for the main roads, including the Pacific Highway in Coffs Harbour. Fraser apologised to Parliament and Tripodi. It was revealed that alcohol may have influenced Fraser's rage.
Coalition campaign advertising ahead of the 2007 election identified Tripodi—along with Treasurer Michael Costa and Planning Minister Frank Sartor—as one of the government's least popular. Independent MPs indicated that, in the event of a hung parliament, they would not support a minority Labor government in which Tripodi remained a minister.
During an ICAC investigation into Wollongong City Council in 2008, it was revealed that a former Council officer against whom corruption allegations had been made was a personal friend of Tripodi's and had subsequently been appointed to a senior position in a department in their portfolio Tripodi claimed the appointment had been "at arm's length" from him, and on 3 March 2008 the ICAC indicated there was no evidence that would sustain an investigation. This was criticised by Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell who stated that the community would feel let down by the ICAC's decision.
Retirement from Parliament
Tripodi's announcement of their decision to not contest the March 2011 NSW election came as pressure was mounting from the Premier Kristina Keneally to "refresh and renew" Labor politics in NSW. Tripodi was the 15th Labor MP to announce their retirement since the last state election in 2007. Although denying that they were pushed, Keneally praised their contribution to government economic reform, especially in the areas of energy, housing and ports. There was significant media opinion that Tripodi's decision was a major victory for Labor's head office who saw them as a political liability.
Appearing on ABC's Stateline in November 2010 after announcing their retirement, Tripodi stated they regretted entering Parliament at a young age and if they had their time again they would enter politics at the age of 45 or 50.
Federal politics possibility
In 2009 it was reported that Tripodi had approached senior Labor officials in 2008 to seek advice about possible endorsement in the federal seat of Fowler at the 2010 election. In the same unconfirmed report, Karl Bitar, Labor's national secretary, advised Tripodi to get out of politics altogether due to the reputation from various scandals and from being viewed as a factional player and powerbroker. It was also reported that Kevin Rudd, Labor's Prime Minister at that time, would be highly reluctant to accept Tripodi in the federal Labor caucus. Tripodi denied the media report, describing it as "completely false".
Findings of the Independent Commission Against Corruption
In October 2013, the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption commenced investigative hearings surrounding allegations that, between 2000 and 2011, Eddie Obeid misused their position as a Member of Parliament to attempt to influence public officials to exercise their official functions with respect to retail leases at Circular Quay, without disclosing that Obeid, their family or a related entity had an interest in some of those leases. It was also alleged that during the same period, certain public officials improperly exercised their official functions, with respect to retail leases at Circular Quay, to benefit Obeid or their family. Further allegations were also made that alleged that Obeid had attempted to influence public officials to exercise their official functions with respect to the review and grant of water licences at a farm at in the Upper Hunter region, without disclosing that Obeid, their family or a related entity had an interest in the licences. Tripodi and former members of their staff were called as witnesses before the commission. On 6 November 2013, Tripodi requested that their membership of the Labor Party be suspended until such time as the Commission released its findings. The Commission handed down its findings in June 2014, and found that Tripodi engaged in corrupt conduct in 2007 by deliberately failing to disclose to their Cabinet colleagues their awareness of the Obeid family's financial interests in Circular Quay leases. While the ICAC did not recommend any charges be laid against Tripodi, NSW Labor terminated their membership of the Labor Party for bringing the party into disrepute.
In May 2014 in a separate matter before the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption, junior counsel assisting the inquiry, Greg O'Mahoney, told former MP Jodi McKay that "we've got pretty good information" that the three people who distributed leaflets making damaging allegations about them throughout their electorate were: "the Tinkler group (Nathan Tinkler), Miss Anne Wills [an associate of Mr Tripodi and a consultant to Buildev] and Mr Joe Tripodi." In the Inquiry, it was alleged that the leaflets were distributed because McKay refused a bribe from Tinkler.
In 2016 ICAC made a second finding of corruption against Tripodi for leaking confidential Treasury information to benefit Nathan Tinkler's company Buildev, and recommended the Director of Public Prosecutions consider charging Tripodi with misconduct in public office. In 2017 ICAC found Tripodi engaged in "serious corrupt conduct" for using their ministerial position to try to award a lucrative government water contract which would have financially benefited the Obeid family, and again recommended charges of misconduct in public office.
As a state minister, Tripodi was entitled to use the honorific "The Honourable", even in their post-political career. Following findings of corrupt conduct against Tripodi and the announcement of the decision to commence criminal proceedings, at the request of Mike Baird, the Premier of New South Wales, the Department of Premier and Cabinet asked Tripodi to show cause why they should not lose the title of “honourable”. Tripodi chose not to respond and Baird recommended to Governor David Hurley that the honorific be removed; which was authorised with effect from December 2014.

Like most Upper Macedonia, Orestis only became part of Macedon after the early 4th century BC; before that, it had close relations with Epirus. A 6th century BC silver finger ring bearing the frequent Orestian name "Antiochus" was found in the Dodona sanctuary. During the Peloponnesian War, a thousand Orestians led by King Antiochus accompanied the Parauaeans of Epirus. Hecataeus and Strabo identified these mountain kingdoms as being of Epirotic stock. Natives of the region were: Pausanias of Orestis, the lover and murderer of Philip II, and three of Alexander's prominent diadochi: Perdiccas (son of Orontes), Seleucus I Nicator (son of Antiochus) and their uncle Ptolemy, and Craterus and Amphoterus, sons of a noble from Orestis named Alexander.
The region became independent again in 196 BC, when the Romans, after defeating Philip V (r. 221–179 BC), declared the Orestae free because they had supported the Roman cause in the recent war against Macedon. According to Appian, Argos Orestikon (in modern Orestida), rather than Peloponnesian Argos, was the homeland of the Argead dynasty. According to Miltiades Hatzopoulos, the ancient Macedonians wandered from Orestis to Lower Macedonia where they founded the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon.

40 Field Regiment (Asal Uttar), nicknamed the Roaring Forty is part of the Regiment of Artillery of the Indian Army.
Formation
The Regiment was raised at Risalpur (presently in Pakistan) as 8 Indian Field Regiment on 1 February 1943 with the troop nucleus being of South Indian classes. The Regiment was then equipped with 25 Pounder guns.
History
The Regiment became the first medium regiment of the Indian Army on 1 October 1944, when it was re-equipped with 5.5" guns. It was later re-designated as 40 Medium Regiments. The regiment was awarded with the prestigious Asal Uttar honour title for its exemplary display in the Battle of Asal Uttar in the 1965 Indo-Pak War. It acquired the status of a medium self propelled unit, when it was equipped with the M-46 Catapult, which had 130 mm guns mounted on a Vijayanta chassis. The regiment has subsequently converted to a field artillery regiment and is now equipped with Indian Field Guns.
The Regiment also had the honour of carrying Mahatma Gandhi's ashes for immersion in the Damodar River in Ramgarh on one of its guns in 1948.
The regiment had the honour to participate in the Republic Day Parades in 1979 with their 130 mm towed guns and in 1987 and 1989 with their Catapults.
Operations
Some of the major operations undertaken by the Regiment include:
Hyderabad Police Action (1948) 2nd Medium battery moved to Hyderabad in May 1948 in support of Smash Force / 1 Armoured Division to quell an armed insurrection aimed against the formal union of this princely state with the Union of India. Two guns recovered during the action, are exhibited at the unit's Quarter Guard.
Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 1 Medium Battery participated in the J & K Operations to counter the armed incursion into the State. The 5.5" guns were dismantled and air-lifted in Dakotas to Kashmir. Exemplary courage and gallantry was displayed by Capt. Dara Dinshaw Mistri in the Naushera Sector on 15 December 1948. They were posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC) for display of bravery and gallant action. (This was the first MVC in the Regiment of Artillery).
The official citation reads:
Indo-Pak War (1965) In September 1965, the Regiment was located in Meerut, when it received the mobilisation orders. The Regiment was part of Operation Riddle in the Khemkaran-Kasur Sector in which Pakistan's 1 Armoured Division advanced towards East of the Icchogil Canal. The Regiment with its 5.5" guns fired over 13,000 rounds at Kasur town, which halted the Pakistani advance for a day. The regiment lost two officers (2nd Lieutenant IK Gupta and 2nd Lieutenant LS Modi) in this operation.
Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 The Regiment's batteries were located at 3 different places when it received its mobilisation orders. One Battery (403 Medium Battery) stuck to their guns in Sikkim which could not be diverted to participate in the Operations. Without the 403 Medium Battery, 28 Medium Battery headed towards Dacca from Agartala RHQ and 29 Medium Battery entered the then East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh) from Bhajanpur. The Regiment was the first Artillery Regiment to reach Dacca.
1973 Provincial Armed Constabulary revolt On 22 May 1973, the Regiment was deployed for internal security duties at Varanasi to aid the civil authorities to quell the armed insurrection by the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) at Ramnagar and Chunar.

Michael A. Hogg (born 1954) is a British psychologist, and Professor of Social Psychology in the Department of Psychology at Claremont Graduate University in Los Angeles.  They are also an honorary Professor of Social Psychology at the University of Kent in the UK.
Biography
Hogg was born in 1954 in Calcutta, India, where their parents (his father was Scottish, their mother English and Welsh) were employed at the time of their birth. When they were about two their family moved to Colombo in Sri Lanka where they attended the Overseas International School in Colombo and then the Hill School in Nuwara Eliya.
In 1968 the family moved back to England. After one term at Warwick Grammar School the family moved to Bristol where Hogg attended Bristol Grammar School until they graduated in 1973. They then studied Physics for a year at the University of Birmingham, and then transferred to study Psychology and graduated with their BSc in 1977. After a year traveling around south and central America Hogg returned to England in 1978 to embark on their PhD in social psychology at Bristol University. They received their PhD (dated 1983) and taught at Bristol University for 3 years before moving to Australia in 1985 to a postdoctoral fellowship at Macquarie University in Sydney. In 1986 they moved to a faculty position at Melbourne University, and then in 1991 they moved to the University of Queensland where they remained until moving to California in 2006. They currently teach at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California.
Hogg received the Australian Psychological Society's early career award in 1989, and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology's mid-career Carol and Ed Diener award in 2010. In 2013 they served as President of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.  They are also the foundation editor, with Dominic Abrams at the University of Kent, of the journal Group Processes and Intergroup Relations - first published in 1996.
In August 2010 the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin ranked Hogg the 9th most influential social psychologist. Researchers ranked 611 faculty members at 97 universities across the United States and Canada using complex formulas that measured the frequency with which the faculty member published work and how often that work is cited. These formulas included adjustments to account for a researcher's experience in terms of how many years it has been since an individual earned a PhD.
Work
Hogg's research focus is on social identity theory, a theory that was initially developed in the 1970's and first most fully published by Henri Tajfel and John Turner in 1979. Social identity theory was created to explain how and why people identify with particular social groups, and the various ways these identities affect people's perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. It provides a social psychological understanding of group processes and intergroup relations. While at Queensland, Hogg established and directed the Center for Research on Group Processes, and soon after arriving in Claremont set up the Social Identity Lab in the School of Behavioral and Organizational Sciences at Claremont Graduate University.
Research by Hogg and their students in the Social Identity Lab takes a self and social identity perspective on a wide range of topics associated with intergroup relations and the behavior of people in groups. One key focus is on how uncertainty drives people to groups and ideologies that resolve these uncertainties; another is on processes of influence and leadership within and between groups. Current research also seeks to understand radicalization and populism, mechanisms of group integration and disintegration, and how leadership can heal divided groups.

Knezha (, ) is a town in Pleven Province, Northern Bulgaria. It is the administrative center of the homonymous Knezha Municipality.
History
The town's name is most probably derived from the Slavic word knyaz ("prince, duke"), most likely after a local ruler that defended the population in the area during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. Knezha is the third-largest town in the province, after Pleven and Cherven Bryag, and is the administrative centre of a municipality. The town was located in Vratsa province until 2001, when a boundary change shifted the town into Pleven province.
A local landmark is the steel Christian cross constructed on a hill overlooking the town. The cross' construction was financed entirely by donations. It has luminescent lighting bodies attached to it and is illuminated in blue at night. The cross is similar to the larger Millennium Cross above Skopje. Knezha also has a historical museum and an amateur theatre performing in the local community centre (chitalishte). The Institute on Maize of the Agricultural Academy is based in Knezha; it was founded in 1924.
Notable people
Notable natives include weightlifter and Sydney 2000 Olympic gold medalist Galabin Boevski (b. 1974), Bulgaria international footballer Valentin Iliev (b. 1980) and Bulgarian Army general and long-time Chairman of the National Assembly of Bulgaria Ferdinand Kozovski (1892–1965).

Tschanüff Castle is a ruined castle in the former municipality of Ramosch (now Valsot) of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
The Lords of Ramosch first appear in historical records in the 12th century. They were vassals of the Bishop of Chur and the Lords of Tarasp. The oldest part of the castle is the main tower, which was built as a bergfried (a fighting tower without permanent inhabitants) in the 12th century for the Lords of Ramosch. A ring wall was added in the 13th century. On 12 March 1256 Count Meinhard of Tyrol granted the knight Nannes of Ramosch the right to build a castle at Ramosch. Since there was already a fortification, this permission was probably to expand the small tower into a much larger castle. The new castle allowed the Ramosch family to control trade and taxes throughout the Lower Engadine.
On 19 August 1317 Nannes and their brother Johannes split the fief into two shares. The successors of Johannes, Conrad and Schweiker, quarreled with each other over their inheritance. The conflict grew until in 1365 Duke Leopold of Austria was forced to intervene. The agreement between the brothers stated that they both accepted the Dukes of Austria as their overlord, the castle was to remain open to the Dukes and if they quarreled again the castle and surrounding lands would become property of Austria. Despite the severe conditions, Conrad and Schweiker quickly began fighting again and in 1367 Schweiker murdered Conrad and fled Tschanüff. As a sign of appreciation for their service in an Austrian war in Italy, the Duke appointed Ulrich of Matsch as owner of Tschanüff. The Matsch family took possession of the castle on 17 February 1369.
The Bishop of Chur also had a claim on the castle and fearing Austria's growing influence in the region, began reasserting their claim. In 1394 Bishop Hartmann forced the Lords of Matsch to give up the castle. However, in the following year, Matsch attacked and plundered the castle but retreated when the Bishop led an army toward Ramosch. In 1421 a peace treaty gave the castle to the Bishop and the Lords of Matsch were paid 2500 marks for their losses. The Bishops then appointed vogts to rule over the valley for the following centuries. In 1468 the castle was attacked by the League of God's House during a conflict with the Bishop. It may have been besieged during the Hennenkreig in 1475. During the Swabian War of 1499, the Bishop's own troops burned the castle to prevent it from falling into the Emperor's hands. In 1565 rebels against the Bishop attacked, plundered and burned the outer ward. The Lower Engadine residents were found liable for the damage and ordered to pay to rebuild the castle.
Until the 16th century the castle was known as Ramosch or Remüs after the Lords of Ramosch. In the 16th century it began to be known as Tschanüff which was Romansh for Casa nova or New House. This was to distinguish it from the nearby Serviezel Castle.
During the Bündner Wirren in 1622, the castle was captured and burned by troops from Glarus. It was quickly repaired and survived the rest of the tumult without being destroyed. Over the next century and a half the castle was once again used as the residence of the Bishop's appointed representative. In 1780 it was abandoned after part of the castle was destroyed in a landslide.
Castle site
The complex consists of the main castle with its tower, residential tract and secondary buildings surrounded by a ring wall and a southern outer ward which is surrounded by another ring wall in varying thickness. The two parts were connected by the gateway, through which a vaulted passage led into the courtyard of the main castle. Numerous masonry joints and differences in the wall structure indicate that the building must have taken place in several stages. The oldest part is part of the ring wall on the southeast which may date to before 1200. The main tower to the north may be from before 1200 or the early 13th century. In the early 13th century, the ring wall and parts of the southern residential tract were added. The bergfried still has five floors with a high entrance on the fourth floor on the south side. Since the masonry of the tower is not connected to the surrounding walls, these must be more recent.
The building south of the tower could be reached via the high entrance. There are holes for wooden beams at a height of four floors, and towards the south the remains of an unusually thick wall. To the west is the southern tract from the 15th century, a four-storey, cross-divided building. The barrel vaults of the lower storeys are partly collapsed. On the third floor was a hall with a wooden ceiling, above it was a fighting platform with crenelations. The individual rooms were accessible from the courtyard side.
To the north of this wing was a recent building, of which only a few remains of the wall have been preserved. The south wing was completed by an older shield wall with a thickness of , which was probably reinforced in the age of the firearms to twice the thickness. Together, the two walls now form a massive tower-shaped block with no interior divisions.
West of the main tower was a two-storey building dating from around 1500, Erwin Poeschel believed it to have been a kitchen or smithy, on the upper floor living quarters. The remains of a sgraffito decoration have been preserved in exterior plastering. Window openings in the western wall of the enclosure point to an original continuation to the west; However, these parts of the building collapsed during landslides.

Gallocatechol or gallocatechin (GC) is a flavan-3-ol, a type of chemical compound including catechin, with the gallate residue being in an isomeric trans position.
This compound possesses two epimers. The most common, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), CAS number 970-73-0, is found notably in green tea. The other enantiomer is called (-)-gallocatechin or ent-gallocatechin. It was first isolated from green tea by Michiyo Tsujimura in 1934.
Epigallocatechin is another type of catechin, with the gallate residue being in an isomeric cis position. It can be found in St John's wort.

The Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology is a museum and reference collection in Schaumburg, Illinois dedicated to the history of anesthesiology. It was founded in 1933 by Dr Paul Meyer Wood, who was then Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Initially based at a series of temporary locations, it moved to its permanent home in Schaumburg in 2014. Since 1971 it has been a nonprofit educational organization operating as part of the ASA.
History
Founding
Paul M. Wood M.D. joined the American Society of Anesthesiologists in 1925 and was made its Secretary-Treasurer in 1929. However in 1932 they became seriously ill and was unable to work, either as a practicing doctor or for the ASA. While convalescing Wood began to catalogue their personal library, which they had been building since they were a medical student, and told ASA founder Dr. Adolph Frederick Erdmann that they wanted to create a museum dedicated to the history of anesthesiology. Erdmann gave them a collection of books and anesthesiology apparatus to add to their own library as the nucleus of the project. In 1933 Wood donated the entire collection to the ASA. The Society asked them to keep it at their home and appointed them librarian and curator for life. They also named the new collection the Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology. By 1934 Wood was well enough to return to work. One of the first things they did was to approach Robert H. Ferguson, a retired anesthesiologist whom Erdmann had told them owned the largest collection of specialist books and apparatus in the USA. Ferguson was sympathetic but, still being in good health, preferred to keep their collection at home. Wood turned their attention to the minutes of the Society's meetings, which were now being recorded by a stenographer. As well as discussing ASA business these also contained much information about advances in anesthesiology, and Wood thought they would be a useful resource. They began to make copies and distribute them to the members, and began archiving them in the Library-Museum. In 1938 this system was developed into the ASA's official newsletter.
Exhibitions
In 1936 the ASA was approached by the organizers of the 1939 New York World's Fair and asked if they could present an exhibit on anesthesiology. The ASA agreed. The next year they received another invitation, this time to create an exhibit for the American Medical Association's annual meeting in San Francisco in June 1938. Again the invitation was accepted. The Library-Museum, which by now had expanded from its original 70 books to over 160 thanks to donations from ASA members (and had also greatly enlarged its collection of apparatus) provided the core of both exhibits.
Expansion
By 1937 the collection was growing too large for Wood to keep at home and they began looking for a permanent location for it. Still trying to obtain Ferguson's collection they approached a New York City company Ferguson had been associated with, E.R. Squibb and Sons, and suggested that the museum could be located in vacant space in their office building. As bait they proposed that it be called the Robert H. Ferguson Memorial Library. Ferguson didn't take the bait but Squibb did, and the Wood Library-Museum was moved to their building. More books were donated, including 30 from Ferguson, and the collection continued to grow. The larger location had space for more apparatus and members soon started making gifts of their old equipment, including some very early anesthetic delivery systems. The ASA was also now funding the collection through voluntary donations from members.
In 1950 the Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology was officially incorporated in New York as a nonprofit educational institution. It moved to Park Ridge, Illinois in 1963, and again to its permanent home at 1061 American Lane, Schaumburg, IL 60173-4973 in 2014. In 1971 the New York incorporation was dissolved, making the Library-Museum officially part of the ASA, and in 1987 it was incorporated in Illinois as a nonprofit under ASA auspices.
Collection
Library
The main library is both a historical record and an active specialist medical library. The collection has now expanded to around 13,000 books, and the library also contains both US and international medical journals (over 50,) newsletters, biographical material and archives of photos and digital images. A rare book room preserves older titles as well as letters and other material. Many of these are being digitized to allow them to be read without risking the original copies.
The John W. Pender Living History of Archaeology is a multimedia collection containing audio recordings of prominent anesthesiologists.
Museum
The museum houses a large collection of anesthesiology apparatus ranging from 19th century masks and inhalers for administering ether and chloroform to anesthetic machines. and modern electronic monitoring equipment.
Online Resources
The Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology provides a number of online resources for anyone interested in the history of anesthesiology. Out of copyright books are being digitized and made available as free E-books. and the museum also has a YouTube channel with a large collection of anesthesiology-related videos, mostly produced by the museum itself, including demonstrations of apparatus from the collection.

The Wǔdàxiān (五大仙 "Five Great Immortals"), also known as Wǔdàjiā (五大家) and Wǔdàmén (五大门), meaning the "Five Great Genii", are a group of five zoomorphic deities of northeastern Chinese religion, and important to local shamanic practices. They are the localised adaptation of the Five Forms of the Highest Deity (五方上帝 Wǔfāng Shàngdì) of common Chinese theology.
Names and meanings
In some places of Hebei, the cult comprises four instead of five zoomorphic gods, including the Fox, the Weasel, the Hedgehog and the Snake Gods (四大仙 Sìdàxiān, 四大门 Sìdàmén). While the Fox God and the Weasel God always remain the two prominent members of the cult, the other positions vary in some regions including the Tiger, the Wolf, the Hare and the Turtle Gods.
Li Qingchen (?-1897), a scholar of Tianjin, explained the images of the Five Great Immortals as follows:
[...] the Five Immortals [...] are: 狐 Hú is fox, 黄 Huáng is weaseled, 白 Bái is hedgehog, 柳 Liǔ is snake and 灰 Huī is rat. I said these five can be distinguished by five colors. [...] White and yellow are hedgehog's and weasel's original colors, Huī is black and Liǔ is green. [...] The Ode of Songs reads: "Nothing is redder than fox".
As gods of wealth, the Five Immortals are also known by the epithet of "Little Wealth Gods" (小财神 Xiǎocáishén). The Five Immortals have both male and female form, usually represented twosomes.
Huxian—Fox Immortal
Húxiān (狐仙=胡仙 "Fox Immortal"), also called Húshén (狐神=胡神 "Fox God") or Húwáng (狐王=胡王 "Fox Ruler") is possibly the most important of the Five Immortals in northeast China. Nagao Ryuzō, a Japanese sinologist, observed that the Fox Gods "enjoy such popularity to be worshipped by almost every household in north China and Manchuria". Henry Doré documented the worship of the Fox God in the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui. In parts of Hebei, to every newborn is assigned their own běnshén (本神 patron god) manifestation of Huxian, usually a female for a boy and a male for a girl. After these boys and girls get married, their patrons will be represented sitting together. In their survey of popular shrines and temples in Manchuria, Takizawa Shunryō found the number dedicated to Fox Gods overwhelming.
The deity can be represented as either male or female, but is most frequently identified as the female Húxiān Niángniáng (狐仙娘娘 "Fox Immortal Lady") whose animal form is a nine-tailed fox.  They are the Chinese equivalent of the Japanese Shintō cult of Inari Ōkami, both god(desses) of the foxes or collective representations of the fox sprites.
The fox deity is also represented as a couple of gods, male and female, called the Great Lord of the Three Foxes (胡三太爷 Húsān Tàiyé) and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes (胡三太奶 Húsān Tàinǎi). As a goddess, the Fox Immortal is related to Xīwángmǔ (西王母 "Queen Mother of the West"), the great goddess guardian of Mount Kunlun (axis mundi).
Huangxian—Weasel Immortal
Huángxiān (黃仙 literally "Yellow Immortal") is the Weasel God, and is identified as an incarnation of the pan-Chinese Yellow Deity (黄帝 Huángdì) and Huáng Dàxiān (黄大仙 "Great Yellow Immortal"). Another name which indicates the collective personification of weasels is "Great Lord of the Two Yellows" (黄二太爷 Huángèr Tàiyé).
Shexian—Snake Immortal
The Snake God is either called Shéxiān (蛇仙 literally "Snake Immortal"), Liǔxiān (柳仙 "Immortal Liu"), or Chángxiān (常仙 "Viper Immortal"). Alternatively they are Mǎngxiān (蟒仙 "Python (or Boa) Immortal"). Considered an incarnation of the Dragon God, the snake traditionally represents generation and activity (yang). As such, it is also associated to Fuxi and Nüwa, respectively the snake-bodied patron of heaven (天皇 Tiānhuáng) and patroness of earth (地皇 Dehuáng), who represent the two forces who concur in the birth of things.
Baixian—Hedgehog Immortal
The Báixiān (白仙 "White Immortal") is the Hedgehog God.  They are primarily worshipped as a medical deity to prevent and cure diseases. One of their female forms is Báilǎo Tàitài (白老太太 "White Old Lady").
Heixian—Crow Immortal
The Hēixiān (黑仙 "Black Immortal") is a function occupied by different zoomorphic deities. The most common one is the Wūyāxiān (乌鸦仙 "Crow Immortal") and another popular one is the Huīxiān (灰仙 "Rat Immortal"), although the latter is said to be a misinterpretation of the former. The position can be taken also by the Lángshén (狼神 "Wolf God").

Cale J. Bradford is the Chief Judge of the Indiana Court of Appeals. They were appointed to the Court's Second District on August 1, 2007 by Governor Mitch Daniels. They were selected to be Chief Judge on January 1, 2020.
Prior to their service on the Court of Appeals, Bradford served as a judge of the Marion County Superior Court. They were elected on January 1, 1997 and was the presiding judge for the 2005–2006 term, as well as being the juvenile division chair.
Bradford earned a B.S. at Indiana University Bloomington in 1982 and a J.D. at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law in 1986.
Controversy
In a child custody case, Judge Bradford approved a ruling of a magistrate forbidding either parent from instructing their son in their shared religious beliefs. The magistrate questioned how Wicca differed from Satanism and required the parents to shelter their child from "non-mainstream religious beliefs and rituals". This ruling was overturned on appeal.

Nimbaphrynoides is a monotypic genus of true toads from highlands in the Mount Nimba region of the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Côte d'Ivoire. The sole species is Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis. Along with Nectophrynoides, Eleutherodactylus jasperi, and Limnonectes larvaepartus, Nimbaphrynoides is one of the only anurans that combine internal fertilization with ovoviparity.
Taxonomy and systematics
Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis was first described as Nectophrynoides occidentalis by Fernand Angel in 1943. A second species from Mount Nimba, Nectophrynoides liberiensis, was described in 1979. The two were then transferred to a newly erected genus Nimbaphrynoides in 1987. The two species were similar except for the larger size of N. liberiensis compared to N. occidentalis and some small colour differences. However, their calls are similar, and the genetic differences are minor. On this basis, they have been judged to be the same species. However, acknowledging the significant differences in size and that small genetic differences do exist, they are still retained as subspecies:
Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis occidentalis — Western Nimba toad, Mount Nimba viviparous toad
Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis liberiensis — Liberia Nimba toad
Description
Adult males of Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis occidentalis measure on average and adult females on average in snout–vent length. Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis liberiensis are larger at respectively . Adult colouration is variable. The dorsum in most individuals is brown to black backs, without a distinct border between the two colours. It may also be uniform in colouration, or have lighter and darker browns irregularly mixed. There are some lighter areas in the head, at least on the snout and the eye-lids. The legs are light brown with irregularly bordered darker stripes or dots. The venter is typically white, but some Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis liberiensis have small to large light brown dots on their venter. Juveniles had brighter coloured backs than adults.
Reproduction
The male advertisement call is very faint, short, and resembles a metallic "bing". Nimbaphrynoides are viviparous—they have internal fertilisation and the female gives birth to fully developed, tiny toadlets. Eggs are small, ranging from 0.5–0.6 mm in diameter.
Habitat and conservation
Nimbaphrynoides occur in montane grasslands at elevations of above sea level. It is not tolerant to disturbance, and recent observations are from less impacted areas where soil was not compacted or little compacted. It can be locally very common, but the population is severely fragmented. The area has been affected by mining, and the type locality of Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis liberiensis is now an open cast mining pit. Future threats include a proposed iron ore mining concession and the arrival of a large contingent of refugees. Part of the population is protected by the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, although improved management of the site is required.

Firebase Pace is a former U.S. Army firebase near the Vietnam-Cambodia border north-northwest of Tây Ninh, Vietnam.
History
Pace was located approximately 1km from the Cambodian border and 4km northwest of Thien Ngon.
On 26 September People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces conducted rocket and sapper attacks against ten Armies of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) bases and Pace all near the Cambodian border. 230 PAVN and 27 ARVN were killed in the attacks.
On 9 October five U.S. soldiers at the base refused to undertake a patrol outside the perimeter of the firebase. The combat refusal was widely reported by the media as was a letter signed by 65 American soldiers at Pace to Senator Edward Kennedy protesting that they were being ordered to participate in offensive combat operations despite U.S. policy to the contrary.
On 13 October a U.S. AH-1 Cobra gunship was shot down near Pace. By 18 October the PAVN bombardment of Pace had continued for its 23rd consecutive day. On 22 October U.S. forces withdrew from Pace, leaving the base and its four guns to an ARVN Airborne battalion which took over the base. In four separate actions around Pace the ARVN reported killing 47 PAVN. On 23 October ARVN troops found the bodies of 53 PAVN killed by airstrikes south of Pace.

Leon Feinberg (February 6, 1897 – January 22, 1969) was a Ukrainian-born Jewish-American Yiddish poet, writer, and journalist.
Life
Feinberg was born on February 6, 1897 in Kodyma, Russia.
Feinberg attended religious primary school until they were seven. They later moved to Odessa with their parents and attended a high school there. They graduated from Iglitski-Rapoport high school in 1912 at the age of fifteen. Their father moved to America, and Feinberg briefly lived with their father there before returning to Russia. They entered the University of Moscow in 1915, graduating from there in 1919. They were one of the large number of Jewish students who took an officer training course for the army following the outbreak of the February Revolution, and after the October Revolution they joined the Red Guards and fought against the Whites. At one point, they were adjutant for Soviet Commissar Yan Gamarnik (brother-in-law of Hayim Nahman Bialik). In the autumn of 1919, they were captured by Anton Denikin's men, who threatened to shoot him, only to be saved by Bialik's intervention on their behalf. In November 1919, Bialik helped them leave Russia on the Ruslan and travelled to Palestine. They stayed there for a year and was a founder of the kibbutz Kiryat Anavim near Jerusalem. They then spent a year traveling the world as a sailor, and in 1921 they came to America and reunited with their father.
Feinberg's first volume of Russian poetry was published in 1914 and was influenced by symbolism. They wrote other volumes of Russian poems in 1919, 1923, and 1947. They wrote their poems under the pen name Leonid Grebniov. They began writing primarily in Yiddish after they immigrated to America, although they continued to write in Russian as well. In the 1920s, their poems combined Russian mystic revolutionary strains, American Imagism, and the Yiddish In-Zikh movement, and alternated between warm reminiscences of their pious past and a desire to help the forward march of the future. In the 1930s, they wrote proletarian poetry and remained supportive of the Soviet Union in their poems until the Hitler–Stalin Pact in 1939. They then became disillusioned with Communism and their writings became focused on their affection for the Jewish people. Their volumes included Groisshtut (Metropolis) in 1928, Likht Un Broit (Light and Bread) in 1931, Khaver Leben (Comrade Life) in 1938, and Die Yorshim Fun Der Erd (The Inheritors of the Earth) in 1941.
Feinberg was a member of the editorial board of the Yiddish daily Freihet and the monthly Hamer. They often contributed to Der Tog, and from 1945 to 1955 they served as its city editor. They continued to write a column on political affairs for the paper afterwards. They wrote 15 novels, including the verse novels Der Farmishpeter Dor (The Condemned Generation) in 1954 and Der Gebentshter Dor (The Blessed Generation) in 1962 which explored the lives of two generations of Jews who were caught up in the Russian Revolution but immigrated to America and Palestine, and Der Khorever Dor (The Ruined Generation) in 1967 which explored the lives of those who stayed in the Soviet Union. English translations of their poems were published in Joseph Leftwich's The Golden Peacock in 1940 and in J. B. Cooperman's America in Yiddish Poetry in 1967.
Feinberg was awarded the Leib Hoffer Premium from Buenos Aires in 1918 and the Willie and Lisa Shore literary stipend from Mexico in 1968. They were vice-president and president of the Yiddish PEN Club, a national committeeman of the National Committee for Jewish Culture, and president and secretary of the Yiddish Writers Union. They were married to Florence Weingarten. Their children were Norman, Professor Gerald Feinberg, Mrs. Ronald Inglehart, Mrs. Daniel Josephson (Rita), and Mrs. Lowell Bonfeld.
Feinberg died in Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx on January 22, 1969.

Eighteen months later, after the 1977 Dutch train hijacking on 23 May 1977 Faber was involved as a spokesperson.
At the end of 1977 it seemed that Faber would be appointed secretary of state in the First Van Agt cabinet at the Ministry of Defense, but that did not happen. Around September 1981 the NOS started the television series Het Capitool, where they became one of the presenters together with Joop van Tijn and Herman Wigbold. They stopped after a few months.

Du Boisrouvray began serving as the chairperson of SEGH, their family's real estate and hotel management group, in 1980.
FXB International
Following the death of their only child, du Boisrouvray sold three-quarters of their assets including a jewelry collection auctioned by Sotheby's in New York for $31.2 million, an art collection of $20 million, and a substantial part of their family real-estate business which garnered $50 million. The Sotheby's auction was the largest jewelry sale since the Duchess of Windsor's auction. The sale included pre-Columbian gold, jade and other notable pieces accumulated by the noble French family. Du Boisrouvray allocated part of the profits to the FXB Foundation to create programs, including an at home palliative care program for the terminally ill in Switzerland and France, a rescue helicopter control centre in the Swiss Alps, and a professorship at the University of Michigan (her son's alma mater). The rest of the funds were used to found FXB International in memory of their son, François-Xavier Bagnoud, a search-and-rescue pilot who died while serving as a transport pilot in Mali during the Paris-Dakar rally in 1986.
Du Boisrouvray founded FXB International is to fight poverty and AIDS, and support orphans and vulnerable children left in the wake of the AIDS pandemic. FXB International offers comprehensive support to the families and communities that care for these children, and advocates for their fundamental rights. The organization has helped over 17 million people from programs in more than 100 countries, with a staff of over 450. Du Boisrouvray broadened its work from supporting children impacted by AIDS to also include all families needing support to emerge from extreme poverty and become self-sufficient through the FXBVillage methodology. In 1991, they developed the FXBVillage Methodology, a community-based, sustainable approach to overcoming the AIDS orphans crisis and extreme poverty. Each FXBVillage supports 80-100 families, comprising approximately 500 individuals, mostly children. Over a three-year period, FXB provides communities with the resources and training needed to become physically, financially and socially independent. According to FXB, the FXBVillage program has graduated over 69,500 participants from eight countries and has over 12,500 current participants.
In 1993, du Boisrouvray founded the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University, the first academic center to focus exclusively on health and human rights.

Saana Romana Murray (22 November 1925 – 3 September 2011), also known as Hana Waitai Murray, was a Māori master weaver, poet and writer in New Zealand, who was affiliated with Ngāti Kurī at Aupouri. They were the only claimant on the Wai 262 claim still alive when the report was delivered.
Early life and family
Murray was born on 22 November 1925 at Te Hāpua in Northland, and was the eldest of 14 children. They were educated at Te Hapua and Ngataki Schools, and then studied nursing at Kurahuna Boarding School in Onehunga, and commercial studies at Queen Victoria School. After finishing their studies, they taught Māori Studies at Hillary College during the 1970s. Murray had thirteen children.
When Murray's mother was dying, they asked Murray to promise to "retrieve the land and ratify the Treaty".
Wai 262
They were the only one of six original claimants on the Waitangi Tribunal claim 262 in respect of matāuranga Māori who was still alive when the report was delivered. The Wai 262 claim by arose out of an International Workshop on the Traditional Uses of Plants in 1988. The claim was lodged by Ngati Kuri, Te Rarawa, Ngati Koata, Ngati Porou, Ngati Wai and Ngati Kahungunu representatives in 1991, seeking tino rangātiratanga of tupuna Māori (ancestral knowledge) for the taonga (Māori cultural treasures) but took more than 20 years to resolve. When the Waitangi Tribunal report was delivered in 2011, Murray spoke of their sadness at realising they were the only claimant still living.
Murray pleaded the case for Māori ownership of Māori taonga, land and intellectual property to anyone who would listen, for forty years, and joked to reporter Kennedy Warne that they would go down in history as "the great objector". They said it was "important to preserve the land for future generations of any race and not succumb to business interests unless they were beneficial to all".
Creative works
In 1998 Murray was appointed as a member of the New Zealand Arts Council. Murray was a tohunga, or master, weaver. In recognition of their status as a master weaver, they were appointed to the Kahui Whiritoi of the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute. Murray wrote poetry in te reo and English, and at the time of their death was working on a second book.
Murray's literary work was featured in a film on the 1975 Land March from Te Hāpua. Murray wrote that “It is hard to write in a few words about a thousand years or more of occupation by the Māori of this land Aotearoa. Te ahi kaa, the fires that have been kept burning for centuries at Te Hiku o te Ika a Maui, are still burning today in our remote village of Te Hopua Wai (Te Hapua).”
Murray died on 3 September 2011 and was interred at the urupa in Spirits Bay, near Aupouri.
Honours and awards
Murray was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal in 1993. In the 1976 New Year Honours, they were awarded the Queen's Service Medal for community service. They were appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the community, in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours.

Dragutin Karlo Novak (16 February 1892 in Zagreb – 31 October 1978, Zagreb) was the first person in what is now Croatia to make a heavier-than-air flight by flying a plane constructed by Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, June 22, 1910.
Novak flew in an airplane made by constructor Slavoljub Penkala from the military training-field in Črnomerec, Zagreb. Later, during one of Novak's flying achievements, on 20 October 1910, the airplane was damaged, and Penkala gave up on aircraft design.
Childhood and youth
Novak was born in Zagreb, in Ilica 19 street. During their youth, their parents died so their aunt cared for him, "harmonizing" their life. They attended elementary school in Zagreb, then went to convent school in Tropavy (Silesia). They then continued in mechanical trade, specializing in mechanics. In 1910, they left Zagreb and went to their sister in Budapest, where they were successful in an airplane competition. Shortly afterwards, they returned Zagreb and took employment in the business of Slavoljub Penkala, who was engaged in the construction of airplanes, becoming their right hand in manufacturing and proving the flight characteristics until the first flight in Croatia. They worked there until Penkala's decision to abandon further work on airplanes.
Flying in the sky of Zagreb
They were invited to join photographer and entrepreneur Mihajlo Merčep, who had a hangar next to with Penkala's. They brought their brothers Joško and Edvard Rusjan from Slovenia to Zagreb. Financially aided by Merčep, they started to build their own airplane. (Otherwise, in spite of the impression created in and about a part of the community, mainly by their merit, Mihajlo Merčep bad never taken to flying himself, nor they were a constructor or similarly; they were the entrepreneur who decided to share the glory of Edvard Rusjan and later of Dragutin Novak, deciding that the future of aviation is knocking on the door.) Novak joined them and helped in the construction and building of an airplane. By the end of 1910, Edvard Rusjan was tested flying over Zagreb. After Edvard Rusjan was killed in Belgrade, in 1911, Novak worked with Joško Rusjan on the handful of versions of Rusjan's airplanes (now Merčep – Rusjan's), and essentially improved the controls for the pitch (elevators) and roll (ailerons).
Second aviation competition
On one of those airplanes, Novak on the 20 and 21 1911, won the best degree on the Second aviation competition in Budapest. They took to flying over Zagreb, Osijek and Budapest. Later, they were awarded the winning award – in 1912 – during an aero-meeting in Graz, where they crashed. They were abandoned by fame-thirsty boss Merčep, who even left them alone in a hospital. That was the point of no return in their cooperation. After leaving the hospital, Novak worked in the Puch factory. In 1913, they returned to Croatia, and was employed as a motor-mechanic near Križevci.
First World War
At the end of 1914, Novak went to military service. After a short period of service in the army (infantry) they were transferred to the air force of the Austria-Hungarian kingdom. They won the gold medal for courage and bravery, and then the Argent Medal first class, the title of Fieldpilot and the Cross with wreath. At the beginning of 1916, after they were wounded during an air battle (when after an explosion near the airplane they went deaf in the left ear), they were promoted to the post of flight-teacher in the most important military-pilot school in the Monarchy in the Wiener Neustadt. They won pilot's degrees for military and civil services. After the end of the First World War they refused to serve in the Austrian army, and returnedto their family.
Broken wings
They permanently stopped flying, and they were never again in the air even as a passenger. With their family they moved to Križevci where for a short while they worked in a steam-powered flour-mill, then they returned to Zagreb and was employed at the Anatomy institute of the Medicine faculty. In 1923, they were again in Križevci working in the town's electric power plant. In 1927, they founded in Križevci their own transport enterprise, providing a bus and taxi service. After 1945, they remained without their auto-park and in 1948 they became director of the city auto-bus enterprise in Križevci. From 1949 to their retirement in 1954, they worked in agricultural engineering, again in Križevci. After 50 years, in 1970, they returned to their home town Zagreb, together with the family. They died in their 86th year of life, on 31 October 1978.
Summary
After the year of 1918, they were systematically passed over in silence as a person who did so much in the history of Croatian aviation. Thanks to the right motivation and intervention of their family and enthusiasts, their peculiar contribution to the life of citizens was awarded by their insertion in the Croatian encyclopedia LZMK (7th volume), and in a short time from now they will be included in the Croatian biographical lexicon. A TV documentary was made and broadcast in 2000 (Dragutin Novak-first Croatian flyer). Near Lučkoairport there is a street named after him. The city of Križevci honored with a memory-plate on the house in which they had lived and worked, and by naming the neighboring promenade Dragutin Novak. The local aero-club is named after him.

George Huntington Peck, Jr. (October 15, 1856 – January 9, 1940) was an American real estate broker, developer and millionaire.
Born in San Francisco, California, they began their career as a railroad conductor and is credited with driving the first Southern Pacific train into San Pedro. Convinced of the need for harbor facilities, they later bought land along the seashore and, in 1890–despite little formal education–established the first bank in San Pedro.
Peck eventually acquired virtually all of San Pedro and much of the north part of what became Manhattan Beach. They also subdivided and laid out the small town of El Porto, originally called "Peck's Beach", which was eventually annexed by Manhattan Beach and became part of its north end. They built Peck's Pier. Among their larger real estate transactions were the sale of properties for the Standard Oil (now Chevron) refinery at what became El Segundo and the Army's Fort MacArthur at San Pedro.
George Peck died at age 83 in their home located at 1315 W. Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles, (which is now the historic West Adams District), leaving an estate valued at $5,000,000. Much of their estate was left in trusts for their chronically ill children, with the remaining value defaulting to the city upon their deaths.  They are interred in the Mausoleum of the Golden West, Sanctuary of Faith at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California.
Streets in San Pedro and Manhattan Beach bear theirs name.

The proposed 1893 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom would have been a replacement of the Constitution of 1887, primarily based on the Constitution of 1864 put forth by Queen Lili'uokalani. While it never became anything more than a draft, the constitution had a profound impact on Hawaii's history: it set off a chain of events that eventually resulted in the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom.
Background
Prior to 1887, the monarchs of Hawaii ruled the kingdom as executive monarchs. Following the writing of the 1887 Constitution, however, the monarch was reduced to a mere figurehead.
During the 1890 legislature, the Hawaiian king, David Kalākaua, backed a number of proposals to amend or rewrite the 1887 constitution. However, all of these measures failed.
In 1891, Liliuokalani ascended the throne. In 1892, they backed measures in the kingdom's legislature to amend or rewrite the constitution. However, the measures failed as they had during the reign of their brother. Among the measures that failed was an amendment that would lower the property requirement to vote so most of the general public could vote. When that was voted down, many Hawaiian citizens protested. The Queen received petitions in the thousands to issue a new constitution as Kamehameha V had done in 1864 (the Constitution of 1864). Liliuokalani was assisted by Hawaiian legislators Joseph Nāwahī and William Pūnohu White and the captain of the Household Guards Samuel Nowlein with the drafting of the new constitution.
The proposed Constitution
The constitution that Liliuokalani proposed differed from the 1887 constitution in the following respects:
Members of the privy council, notary public, and agents would be able to run for the legislature.
Princess Kaiulani, Prince Kawānanakoa and Prince Kalanianaole would be added to the line of succession.
The Queen would be given the power to call meetings of the legislature.
The legislature would meet for regular sessions in April instead of May.
The Queen's private lands and other property were made inviolable.
The Queen would sign all bills before they became law. Under the 1887 constitution, any bills vetoed by the Queen and then repassed by the legislature with a two-thirds majority would automatically become law without the signature of the Queen. Under the proposed 1893 constitution, the Queen would be obligated to sign all bills repassed by the legislature with a two-thirds majority.
The pay of the legislators would be increased from $250 to $500.
Nobles would be appointed by the Queen instead of elected.
The number of representatives could be increased from 24 to 48.
Property requirements for voters were decreased.
American and European residents, granted suffrage in 1887, would lose the right to vote.
Supreme court judges would be appointed for six years instead of for life.
The Queen would be able to appoint governors of each island for four years.
Article 78 of the 1887 Constitution which required the monarch to perform "with the advice and consent of the Cabinet" was left out.
Backlash
Events leading to January 14, 1893
In the weeks prior, their cabinet had all individually confided in the Queen stressing to them all for the need for a new constitution. The Queen then called meetings at Muolaulani Palace to have a chance to hear everyone's thoughts regarding constitutional reform. The conclusion of these meetings received the same (yes) response from the entire cabinet. Having been assured that they were all aligned in a like-minded plan, and trusting in their loyalty to the constitutional government they swore to uphold under oath when appointed to each of their positions; the draft for a new constitution had begun.
January 14, 1893
On January 14, 1893, the Queen met with their cabinet at Iolani Palace. None of their ministers agreed to sign the constitution. In fact, the ministers intention was never to sign the constitution at all. They were and had already been actively informing the Queen's political enemies of their plans, and were more than aware of the unnecessary turmoil that their actions were soon to ignite. The Queen, though anxious from what was all too clear to them at that point a set-up, was far more concerned with what this would mean for Native Hawaiians. The Bayonet Constitution was directly oppressing, depriving, and restricting their rights, and they alone were suffering for it. During the election of 1892 out of the 9,500 registered voters, 7,000, or 3/4 of them had formally sent signed petitions to the Queen expressing their plea for a new constitution. Them response was “To have ignored or disregarded so general a request I must have been deaf to the voice of the people, which tradition tells us that is the voice of God. No true Hawaiian chief would have done other than to promise a consideration of their wishes.”
Outside, a large crowd of Native Hawaiians had gathered, expecting the Queen to proclaim a new constitution. However, after their meeting with their cabinet, Liliuokalani instead went outside onto the palace balcony and told the crowd that a new constitution would have to wait and that they should peacefully return to their homes.
That evening, a group of the Queen's opponents met to discuss the events of the day. Most were concerned over the Queen's attempt to restore the power of the crown. Some annexationists, like Henry Baldwin, urged moderation but others, like Lorrin A. Thurston urged the complete overthrow of the monarchy. A plan of action was created by the group, including the creation of a Committee of Safety, the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment of a provisional government, and the petitioning for annexation to the United States.
Overthrow of the Kingdom
The following Monday, the Queen issued a statement saying that they would not attempt to amend the constitution except by the means provided in the 1887 constitution. However, the Committee of Safety did not believe their promise was sincere, and continued with their planning. A group of men mostly drawn from the ranks of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom formed the Committee of Safety and asked the United States Minister, John L. Stevens, to land troops from the U.S.S. Boston (anchored in Honolulu Harbor) into Honolulu, “to protect American lives and property.” John L. Stevens, reacting to what they saw as potential unrest as the internal crisis continued, requested the landing of 300 Marines, who were given specific orders by Captain G. C. Wiltse to "land in Honolulu for the purpose of protecting our legation, consulate, and the lives and property of American citizens, and to assist in preserving public order." At 2:00pm on January 17, 1893, a proclamation was read on the steps of Government building, declaring the monarchy overthrown. U.S. peacekeepers were at the time stationed at Arion Hall, the U.S. Consulate, and the U.S. Legation, under orders of strict neutrality and out of any potential line of fire between the Provisional Government and Royalist forces. The Queen abdicated under protest ostensibly "to the superior force of the United States government", though their surrender was delivered to the Provisional Government, not the United States. The Kingdom of Hawaii had ended, and a new provisional government was declared.
The Provisional Government quickly gained recognition from the United States Government and all the other governments with embassies in Hawaii, but was opposed by the administration of Grover Cleveland for years as they attempted to restore the monarchy, beginning with the Blount Report. President Grover Cleveland, in a message to Congress on December 18, 1893, denounced the actions of Minister Stevens, the Honolulu Rifles and the Committee of Safety as an "act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic representative of the United States and without authority of Congress."
Liliuokalani's trial
In 1895, an abortive attempt by Hawaiian royalists to restore Queen Liliuokalani to power resulted in the queen's arrest. They were forced to sign a document of abdication that relinquished all their future claims to the throne. Following this, they were subject to a public trial before a military tribunal in their former throne room.
Convicted of having knowledge of a royalist plot, Liliuokalani was fined $5000 and sentenced to five years in prison and hard labor. The sentence was commuted to imprisonment in an upstairs bedroom of Iolani Palace. During their imprisonment, the queen was denied any visitors other than one lady in waiting. They began each day with their daily devotions followed by reading, quilting, crochet-work, or music composition.
After their release from Iolani Palace, the queen remained under house arrest for five months at their private home, Washington Place. For another eight months they were forbidden to leave Oahu before all restrictions were lifted.

Education and career
At the University of Budapest they received a mathematics-physics degree in 1883 and a doctorate in 1884.
In 1908 they were an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Rome. In 1914 they were elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 1922 the official Council of the University of Budapest condemned their political activity, dismissed them from the University, and took away their membership in the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. After their dismissal they worked for a publishing firm.
Since 1950 the János Bolyai Mathematical Society has awarded the Máno Beke Commemorative Prize for teaching and popularization of mathematics.

The Battle of Tunmen or Tamão was a naval battle in which the Ming imperial navy defeated a Portuguese fleet led by Diogo Calvo in 1521.
Background
Portuguese diplomat Fernão Pires de Andrade arrived at the mouth of the Pearl River in June 1517 and asked the naval commander of Nantou for permission to take their ships to Guangzhou. After a month with no definitive reply, Andrade decided to sail up the river to Guangzhou without permission from Ming authorities. When they arrived the Portuguese ships discharged cannon fire as a friendly salute, however this was not seen as a friendly gesture by the local Chinese who were greatly alarmed by the noise. The Portuguese explained that the Chinese traders did the same thing in Malacca, but the local officials only became even more suspicious as Chinese overseas trade was forbidden under Ming law. When official reception from Guangzhou arrived, tensions relaxed, and the Portuguese were received with much pomp as well as the right to trade their goods for silk and porcelain. Tomé Pires and seven other Portuguese as well as their slaves were given lodging for the embassy. A Portuguese record states that they had made a good impression.
Andrade's negotiations with Ming officials were thwarted when their brother Simão de Andrade arrived in August 1519. Simão immediately made a bad impression upon the locals of Tunmen, who had previously been open to all foreigners. Upon arriving with three ships, Simão executed a Portuguese citizen and built a fort on Tunmen, barring other foreigners from conducting trade. When a Ming official arrived to inquire as to the situation, Simão became aggressive and knocked off their hat. Following this, Simão began purchasing as well as kidnapping child slaves along the Chinese coast to sell in Portuguese Malacca. Even children from well-off families were stolen and found years later at Diu in western India. Rumors that Simão and other Portuguese were cannibalizing children for food spread across China. Simão's pirating activities greatly angered both the Chinese people and the court, which led Ming officials to order the eviction of the Tunmen Portuguese.
The Portuguese embassy arrived in Nanjing in May 1520, but news of Simão de Andrade's conduct had reached Beijing, as had the ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca bringing complaints about the Portuguese. Ming officials sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and advocated for the rejection of their embassy. The Zhengde Emperor died on 20 April 1521. The newly appointed Grand Secretary, Yang Tinghe, announced the rejection of the Portuguese embassy the day following the emperor's death. The Portuguese embassy left for Guangzhou, where they arrived in September.
The battle
When orders to evict the Portuguese from Tunmen arrived from Beijing, the Portuguese refused to comply. In response the commander Wang Hong assembled a squadron of 50 ships and imposed a blockade on the Portuguese as well as the Siamese and Patani junks they had requisitioned. The battle, which happened in April or May, began with direct boarding action by the Ming fleet, but they were unable to close in due to the superior range of Portuguese guns. The enclosed terrain was also to the Portuguese' advantage and the Ming encirclement proved detrimental to the attackers. Following this, Wang Hong sent in a screen of fire ships to trap the Portuguese. Although the Portuguese managed to evade the fire attack, they were unsuccessful in evading Ming boarding attempts and the fighting took a heavy toll on their manpower. Eventually they realized it would no longer be possible to sail all five ships with their remaining men and were forced to abandon two, as well as the rest of their junks, to make an escape. A strong wind arose at this point and scattered the pursuing Ming fleet, which allowed the Portuguese to retreat and make their way to Malacca in October.
Aftermath
Despite hostilities, the Portuguese continued to trade along the Fujian coastline with the aid of corrupt local merchants. Simão de Andrade's activities also continued for decades after they left Guangzhou in 1520, and they sailed to Xiamen and Ningbo where they established settlements. Simão eventually ran afoul of a trade deal and was double-crossed by a local in 1545. In response Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took their women and young girls as captives. This led to a punitive expedition by the locals, however, who banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. The Portuguese also accosted other foreigners. In one instance Coelho de Sousa seized the house of a wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian. Ming authorities responded by cutting off supplies to the Portuguese and the Portuguese ransacked a nearby village for supplies. In retaliation, the Ming destroyed 13 of their ships. Thirty Portuguese survivors fled further south to Guangdong in 1549.
The new Portuguese trading presence in Guangdong got off to a solid start in 1554 when the merchants Leonel de Sousa and Simão d'Almeida offered bribes to Wang Bo, the vice-commissioner for maritime defense. After a pleasant reception from the Portuguese merchants on their ships, the two sides agreed to a payment of 500 taels per year made personally to Wang Bo in return for allowing the Portuguese to settle in Macau as well as levying the imperial duty of 20 percent on only half their products. Following 1557 the Portuguese were no longer asked to leave Macau during winter. The Portuguese ambassador Diogo Pereira arrived in 1563 to normalize relations. Portuguese presence in Macau was further strengthened in 1568 when they aided the Ming in fighting off a hundred pirate ships. The nature of Wang Bo's business transactions were almost discovered by imperial observers in 1571, but the vice-commissioner obfuscated the payments by identifying them as "ground rent" made to the imperial treasury. Macau's merchant oligarchs continued to bribe their mandarin overseers and in this way the settlement persisted. The most important incident of bribery occurred in 1582 when the viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi summoned Macau's chief officials for a meeting. Remembering the fate of Tomé Pires decades earlier, Macau's leaders chose an elderly judge and Italian Jesuit to go in their place. The viceroy raged at the Macau representatives, accusing them of conducting governance in contravention of Ming law, and threatened to destroy the colony and evict all Portuguese from Macau.
Their attitude changed dramatically after the two presented them with 4,000 cruzados worth of presents. In their words: "The foreigners, subjects to the laws of the Empire, may continue to inhabit Macao."
The Malay Sultanate of Johor also improved relations with the Portuguese and fought alongside them against the Aceh Sultanate.
Location
The precise location of the battle has never been established.
The Portuguese called their settlement Tamão, which is understood as a corruption of "Tunmen" (), the name for the western Hong Kong and Shenzhen area that has existed since the Tang dynasty. Chinese sources state that the Portuguese settled around the Tunmen Inlet (), but the current whereabouts of the Tunmen Inlet is unknown, so the precise location of the Portuguese settlement and the battlefield remains under debate among historians.
In the present day, "Tunmen" refers to Tuen Mun, the Cantonese reading of the same Chinese characters. This leads some researchers to link the Tunmen of Ming times to Tuen Mun in the New Territories of Hong Kong. "Tunmen Inlet" would then refer to one of two bays around Tuen Mun: Castle Peak Bay, next to the current Tuen Mun New Town; or Deep Bay between the New Territories and Nantou in present-day Shenzhen, where a Ming coastal defense force was stationed.
Adding to the confusion is the description in Portuguese sources that Tamão was an island. As Tuen Mun is not an island, researchers have proposed that Tamão actually refers to one of the nearby islands. Lintin Island, west of Tuen Mun, is commonly accepted in Western academia as one of the more likely possibilities, while the much larger Lantau Island has also been suggested.

MS Knyaz Vladimir is a 1971 built car ferry/cruise ferry which was later rebuilt into a cruise ship in 1981.  They are the last surviving ship ever owned by the Chandris Lines.  They are the last surviving ship out of three near identical sisters, the others being the ill-fated Scandinavian Star and the Fred. Olsen & Co. ferry Bolero. In late 2014, Mano Cruise stopped the ship's service.
1971-1987
In 1971, the British company Southern Ferries, a subsidiary of P&O Ferries, launched the MV Eagle for a new car/cruise ferry service, a six-day-long Southampton-Lisbon-Tangier itinerary. They did not stay in service with their original owners for very long, as the route they were designed for proved unsuccessful, and in 1975 they were sold to the Paquet Cruises subsidiary Nouvelle Cie. de Paquebots. Them new owners had their repainted white and renamed Azur, carrying out cruise and ferry voyages in the Mediterranean. This continued on uneventfully until 1981 when Paquet decided to drop ferry services completely and rebuild Azur into a full-time cruise ship, with many extra cabins being built into their car decks, and an extra swimming pool installed on their stern. In 1987 Paquet sold Azur to the Greek cruise company Chandris Lines.
1987-2004
Upon entering service with Chandris's subsidiary Chandris Fantasy Cruises, they were renamed The Azur, and their funnels were painted the traditional Chandris blue with a white chi. By 1994 Chandris was "phasing out" their Fantasy Cruises brand, doing so by selling The Azur to Festival Cruises. Festival had The Azur cruise on voyages out of Venice and Genoa until they declared bankruptcy in 2004. When this happened The Azur was placed under arrest by harbor authorities Gibraltar. At Festival Cruises bankruptcy sale, The Azur was sold to the Israel-based Mano Maritime for over US$10 million.
2005-Present
Upon entering service for them, Mano Maritime renamed them the Royal Iris and painted a smiling yellow fish on both sides of their hull. On 21 June 2005 a small fire broke out on board while the ship was anchored of Samos. It was quickly extinguished by the crew. Until 2014 Royal Iris regularly set out on cruises through the Greek Islands and Cyprus. In 2014 Mano Cruises stopped the ship's operations, and renamed it to Roy Star. The liner arrived in the Greek port of Chalcis (Chalkida) for lay up on November 6, 2014.
On 28 January 2017 Cruise Industry News reported that the vessel would enter into service for Sovfracht and Rosmorport in a joint venture calling on ports in the Black Sea including Crimea, Yalta, Sevastopol and Istanbul, with the ship sailing round-trip from Sochi. Ship was bought for around 11.2 million euros. A new company was founded "Black Sea Cruises" based in Sochi. The ship has Russian flag.
On board features
On board Royal Iris there are three swimming pools, two night clubs, a discotheque, sauna, sports facilities, a casino, hairdressing salon and movie theater.

The Thumbnail is a sea cliff in Kujalleq, South Greenland.
Geography
It is located in Cape Farewell region, ca. 50 km to the east from the town of Nanortalik, over the west side of Torssukátak Fjord (also known as Torssukátak Sound) between the mainland and Pamiagdluk Island. It belongs to the Maujit Qaqarssuasia (Qoqarssuasia) massif, its eastern flank being 1560 m a.s.l. The nearest peak dominating the neighboring ridge is Agdlerussakasit (1760 or 1706 m a.s.l.) and some of the reports on the climbs on the cliff also refer to this summit's name.
Ascents
In 2000, 2003 and 2007 there were established 4 climbing routes on the east face, all starting from the sea. The hardest one is the earliest, British route, established in the steepest, right-hand part of the face in 2000 and graded as English E6, 6b or American 5.12c. The route finishes on the subsidiary top/outcrop (which was in 2000 called as Thumbnail itself) and has altitude approximated by altimeter as 1350 meters a.s.l. (originally 4490 ft, see references, AAJ 2001, pp. 64 and 70).

A "friends of" is type of not-for-profit society created solely to support some other organization or enterprise, typically through fundraising, lobbying, and publicity. They are very common in the galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) sector. They have a long history going back to the 19th century, particularly in Western Europe.
The first know friends of a museum society is the Vorarlberger Landesmuseumverein of Austria, set up in 1857. Other early examples include the
Société des amis des monuments parisiens ("Friends of Parisien Monuments", 1885), the Société des amis des monuments rouennais ("Friends of Rouennais Monuments", founded 1886), and the Société des amis du Louvre ("Friends of the Louvre", founded 1897), the later of which became so popular that it has an American counterpart, the American Friends of the Louvre, based in New York.
World Federation of the Friends of Museums
The World Federation of Friends of Museums was conceived in 1967 by Luis Monreal, the then-curator of the Barcelona Museums (1965–1974) and later the secretary general of the International Council of Museums (1974–1985). The Barcelona Friends invited friends groups from around the world to meet in Barcelona in 1972 to coincide with their 40th anniversary. They agreed to create a global federation that would hold world congresses every three years. The first world congress was held in 1975 in Brussels. Subsequent hosts have been,

Year 213 (CCXIII) was a common year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Aurelius and Calvinus (or, less frequently, year 966 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 213 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Roman Empire
Emperor Caracalla leaves Rome and expels some German marauders from Gaul, while their mother, Julia Domna, rules the Empire. They defend the northern Rhine frontier against the Alamanni and the Chatti. Caracalla wins a victory over the German tribes on the banks of the River Main, and gives themselves the title "Germanicus". It is probably while campaigning in Germania that they take a liking to the caracalla, a Celtic or German tunic from which they acquire the name by which they are known.

The Min AP NM AE T1 (Mina Anti-Pessoal Não-Magnética Auto Explosiva modelo T1) is a small Brazilian minimum metal anti-personnel mine. The mine has a plastic case in the form of a truncated cone. with a small protruding fuse and pressure plate. The small size of the pressure plate gives the mine some blast resistance. The main charge is in the form of a small inverted cone which generates a shaped charge effect when detonated.
The mines are armed by removal of a small safety pin, after which pressure on the small pressure plate compresses a small spring, which releases two small safety detents, releasing the striker to be forced into a percussion cap, triggering the booster charge and then the main charge.
The mine was produced until 1989 by Quimica Tupan Ltda in Brazil, and was in service with the countries armed forces. All operational stocks of the mine have been destroyed.

The AVIC Leadair AG300, previously called Primus 150, built by the China Aviation Industry General Aircraft, is a development of the Epic LT aircraft built using the international rights to Epic Aircraft bought in bankruptcy in 2010. As part of the settlement, Epic retained its rights for American construction and support of its aircraft, creating two divergent lines.
Design and development
China Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA) began the process of developing the Epic LT into the Primus 150 for commercial construction, with program first started in November 2011. Its maiden flight was successfully completed on July 5, 2014, and Chinese state certification was received in the following year. Three enterprises have signed letters of intent to purchase the aircraft at a unit price of two million US dollars, under the new name Leadair AG300. The general designer is Mr. Xiong Xianpeng (熊贤鹏). Currently, Leadair AG300 is the fastest flying single-engine, propeller driven general aviation aircraft in China. The aircraft is a five-seat low-wing tricycle-gear pressurized turboprop.

Svengali is a 2013 British film directed by John Hardwick, written by Jonny Owen, and starring Martin Freeman, Vicky McClure, Matt Berry, Michael Socha, Michael Smiley, Vauxhall Jermaine and Natasha O'Keeffe. The film was produced by Root Films.
Synopsis
Dixie (Jonny Owen) is a mail carrier from South Wales, a mod, and a music fanatic. All their life he's dreamed of discovering a great band and then one day, trawling through YouTube, they find them... 'The Premature Congratulations' (aka The Prims). They hunt them down and offers them their management services. They are young, arrogant, sexy and utterly magnificent. Putting their demo on a cassette tape, Dixie heads out onto the streets of London... Innocent, wide-eyed Dixie embarks on a roller coaster ride through the most infamous industry of them all. Their partner and their sanity through it all is their soulmate Michelle (Vicky McClure).
Dixe huts down an old friend Horsey (Roger Evans), who is in the music business, however Horsey wants nothing do with their old friend. While pestering Horsey in a pub, they meet Alan McGee, famous band manager. Dixie borrows money to set up the band for their first gig, and running low on cash, takes money that was meant for them and Shell's wedding. The gig goes very well, with a huge turnout and lots of industry people turn up, even with the BBC offering a gig.
However, Dixie is burning through cash. Dixie gets a job at Don's records. Don (Martin Freeman) is also a mod, and their wife insists on giving them a job.
Dixie continues trying to get gigs for the band, who are constantly borrowing money from him. They try to work at Don's, but ends up getting sacked because they make mistakes. Horsey's boss at the management agency Jeremy Braines (Matt Berry), hears how big the Prims are getting and tells Horsey they must sign them.
The Prims get kicked out of their flat, and start living at Dixies and Shell's flat, and in the meantime, Dixie goes back to their family in Wales for a quick visit, only to find out their dad is dying. Upon return to London, they go back to their flat; Shell is at the end of their tether with all the money problems, the final straw being when they find the money for their wedding has been spent.
Locked out of the flat, by the Russian landlady Vanya because they haven't paid the rent, they break in to grab their prized possession, their soul records, and then finds themselves homeless in London. Horsey offers them a place to stay for the night, and buys their prized records for 5000 pounds. Dixie uses that to pay off their loans. Finally, with the band starting to be successful, but their own life in a romantic and financial mess, they realise they need to make a choice between the band, and their love for Michelle.

The Saint Peter Port Lifeboat Station was established in Guernsey in 1803. Originally based at Saint Sampson, it relocated to Saint Peter Port in 1881.
History
Established in 1803 and based in Saint Sampson, Guernsey, a tidal harbour.
6 Silver medals awarded before the RNLI took over the station, the first in 1851 to John Mitchell for the rescue of 3 from the Cutter Adele. Five were awarded for the 1857 rescue of 6 crew from the barque Boadicea.
In 1861 the station was taken over by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and a shed was built at St Sampson's.
Victor Hugo presented the Harbour Master Capt. Abraham Martin, as a ‘mark of esteem' with their own design of lifejacket and belt in 1870.
1875 a new lifeboat arrived, the John Lockett. in 1878 the lifeboat was moved to Les Landes but problems in finding sufficient crew in the area resulted in the boat returned to St Sampson's.
In 1881 the station relocated to Saint Peter Port Harbour castle emplacement with the Castle slipway being amended to suit lifeboat launches. 1896 saw the introduction of maroons to summon the crew.
In June 1940 the relief lifeboat Alfred and Clara Heath ON 672 was strafed by German aircraft and Harold Hobbs, son of the Coxswain Fred Hobbs, was killed. This lifeboat stayed in Guernsey during the occupation and was used by the Kriegsmarine (Nazi German navy).
Lifeboat house built on St Julians Emplacement in 1946.
In 1952 the Flying Christine, an ex seaplane tender was brought into service by St John Ambulance as an ambulance boat, to work closely with the RNLI.
RNLI Gold Medal and Norwegian Lifeboat Service Gold Medal awarded to Hubert Petit for rescue crew of 9 from Johann Collett in 1963. In 1977 maroons were replaced by ‘bleepers', which were followed in 1983 with pagers.
In 1978 Coxswain John Petit was awarded a silver medal and the ‘Maud Smith' award for the bravest act of lifesaving that year following the rescue from the oil rig Orion.
RNLI Gold Medal awarded to Coxwain Michael Scales for the rescue of 29 from Bonita in December 1981 as well as the ‘Maude Smith' Award for the bravest act of lifesaving that year.
In 1992 Coxswain Peter Bisson received a silver medal for the rescue from the yacht Sena Siorra and the ‘Maude Smith' Award for the bravest act of lifesaving that year.
From 2015, the Guernsey Joint Emergency Services Control Centre handles all 999 emergency calls including radio Mayday, Pan-pan and Sécurité messages.
2020 saw the RNLI's 1,500th call out from Guernsey, during which time 600 lives have been saved and 2,000 people taken to safety.

Alderney
In 1865 Gunner James Moore of the Royal Artillery in Alderney was awarded a silver medal for rescuing 17 people from the Carioca following which in 1869 a lifeboat station was established in Alderney, the first boat being the ‘Mary and Victoria'. The station closed in 1885 due to a shortage of crew.
In 1986 the Alderney station was re-opened with the 44 ft Waveney-class lifeboat ON 1045 Louis Marchesi of Round Table (44-019) based there from 1987. The current boat is the 46 ft Trent-class lifeboat ON 1199 Roy Barker I (14-04).
Between 1885 and 1986 the Saint Peter Port Lifeboat Station provided cover around Alderney.
Charity Status
The Saint Peter Port Lifeboat Station is a Guernsey registered charity. CH135.
Media
Pictures of four Guernsey lifeboats appeared on a set of postage stamps issued by Guernsey Post to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the RNLI in 1974 and a further six lifeboats appeared on a further set of stamps to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the RNLI in 1999.
The lifeboat has also appeared on phonecards issued by Cable & Wireless.

Bow Down to the Exit Sign is a studio album by David Holmes, released in 2000. It features contributions from Bobby Gillespie, Sean Gullette, Jon Spencer, Martina Topley-Bird and Carl Hancock Rux. The song "69 Police" features during the closing scene of the 2001 remake of Ocean's Eleven, and was included in the soundtrack.
Reception
Bow Down to the Exit Sign received positive reviews from the majority of critics. AllMusic's John Bush saw it as a "vast improvement" over Holmes' previous studio record, Let's Get Killed, concluding, "while their previous work came off as soundtrack material in desperate search of a film to accompany it, Bow Down to the Exit Sign is very much a fully formed record."

Tamarixia radiata, the Asian citrus cyllid parasitoid, is an hymenopteran wasp from the family Eulophidae which was discovered in the 1920s in the area of northwestern India (Punjab), now Pakistan. It is a parasitoid of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), an economically important pest of citrus crops around the world and a vector for Citrus greening disease.
Description
The adults of Tamarixia radiata are small, 0.92 to 1.04 mm long, black wasps which have widely separated eyes, which are red in newly emerged adults, on a head which is slightly wider than its length. It has transparent wings which have pale yellow veins. There is marked sexual dimorphism with the male antennae being one and a half times the length of female antennae, the antennae of the males contain long and slightly curved setae while female antennae have short setae. The males are also slightly smaller than females in length and have smaller wings, as well as normally being darker on the abdomen. On the females the ovipositor barely protrudes. In both males and females the head and thorax are shiny black and the posterior dorsal and lateral portions of the gastric segments are black and the vent and a patch on the anterior dorsal gaster are pale, sometime yellow. The legs are off white in colour.
Distribution
Tamarixia radiata was initially described as Tetrastichus radiatus in 1922 by the British entomologist James Waterston from specimens collected in 1921 from part of the Punjab which is now in Pakistan. The natural range of T. radiata extends from Yemen and Saudi Arabia in the west to China and Indonesia in the east. When it was reported that this species was a highly efficient parasitoid of Diaphorina citri on the French Mascarene island of Réunion, it was spread around the world to control its host. T. radiata and has been introduced or spread to Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guadeloupe, Mauritius, Mexico, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Puerto Rico and the United States.
Biology
Tamarixia radiata is an idiobiont ectoparasitoid of Diaphorina citri. The female wasp lays one or occasionally two eggs on the underside of a nymph of its host, between the third pair of legs. Even if two eggs are laid beneath a nymph only one adult wasp will result so T. radiata is a solitary parasitoid. One adult female T. radiata can lay up to 300 eggs in their life. On hatching the larvae attach themselves to the host and begin to feed on its haemolymph which eventually results in the death of the host. The newly hatched larvae are about 0.28mm long and 0.11mm wide, they go through four instars and reach .14 mm long and 0.59 mm wide in their fourth instar. In the later stages of its growth the larval T. radiata will have totally excavated the body cavity of the host nymph. The nymph's body turns a dark brown colour and becomes "mummified". The T radiata pupa extrudes silk which is used to adhere the excavated host's body to the twig where the nymph was feeding and sometimes the silk can be seen around a nymph with a T. radiata pupa within The larvae then pupates within the remains of the host and the adult wasp emerges through a hole, visible to the naked eye, in the nymph's thorax or head. The wasps will parasitise any age of host nymph but prefer the fifth instar nymphs. Under laboratory conditions, the development time from oviposition to the emergence of the adult from the host can take 11.4 days.
Adult female T. radiata live on average for 23.6 days while the shorter-lived males have an average longevity of 11.4 days. The males are polygynous but the females normally mate once and mating does not affect longevity. The females mate on emergence, or at least within a day, and most mate only once. There are normally 1.8 females for every 3.2 males, but the sex ratio varies depending on the origin of the colony and conditions the wasps are reared under. As well as parasitizing the nymphs of its host adult female T. radiata are known to obtain protein for egg laying by feeding on the haemolymph of D. citri nymphs which they obtain by puncturing the nymph's skin with their ovipositor. It is thought that one female T. radiata may kill up to 500 nymphs of D. citri in their lifetime by a combination of parasitism and predation. Both the male and the female wasps have also been recorded feeding on the honeydew excreted by D. citri. Although adults of T. radiata are attracted to fluorescent lights it is thought that the females detect host through olfactory cues. Experiments having shown that female wasps are attracted to the volatile chemicals emitted by the nymphs of D. citri while males are attracted to the volatiles emitted by female T. radiata. It has also been found that female T. radiata avoid laying eggs in nymphs which have already been parasitized, unless there is a shortage of nymphs in which case superparasitism may occur.
Use as a biological control
Tamarixia radiata is an obligate ectoparasitoid of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diophorina citri) which is a pest of citrus crops, the type specimen was collected from D. citri attacking lemon leaves. D. citri is one of the main vectors for the transmission of the bacterial infection citrus greening disease to citrus trees, a disease which can devastate citrus orchards and which had been known in China since the 19th Century. In the early part of the 20th century it began to be recorded in new areas in Asia and Africa and in the 1950s psyllids were shown to be vectors of the disease. In the early 2000s the disease was found in Brazil and Florida. In the early 1960s both T. radiata and the encytrtid Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis, another parasitoid of D. cirti were introduced to Réunion where they successfully controlled populations of their host and reduced the impact of the disease. In a survey conducted on Réunion showed that T. radiata had parasitized up to about 70% of the potential host nymphs, while D. aligarhensis had parasitized less than 20%.
Once the disease appeared in Florida colonies of T. radiata were imported from Taiwan and Vietnam and released between 1999 and 2001 and it appears to have been at least partially successful at establishing itself. It has also been recorded in Puerto Rico and Texas where no known deliberate releases have taken place. Its effectiveness in suppressing its host populations in Florida has been variable. This is probably due to the differences in climate from their places of origin and predation by coccinellid beetles on psyllids (consuming many that were playing host to T. radiata).
In California colonies of T. radiata were bred from specimens captured in the Punjab as the climate there was thought to be closest to that of southern California. The wasps have been recovered some months after the initial release suggesting that they have bred in the wild and are capable of forming self sustaining populations. The wasps have also been found up to 65 miles from the release sites showing that they will disperse. The project is run by University of California Riverside and the insects bred by them show wider genetic variability than T. radiata elsewhere, reflecting the careful sourcing and selection of the founder specimens.
The release of Tamarixia radiata for biological control of D. citri in California has potentially been affected by ants, especially the Argentine ant. Ants guard the nymphs of various bugs in return for a reward of honeydew. Ants have been observed to capture and consume Tamarixia wasps they encounter among clumps of D. citri nymphs as well as chasing the wasps away from the nymphs if they were unable to catch them. When D. citri populations are tended by ants then control of the ants may be necessary if the parasitoids are to control the psyllids. In addition, it is possible that the use of insecticides could affect the populations and rates of parasitism of D. citri by T. radiata so an effective integrated pest management program would involve the use of selective insecticides or pesticides harmful to the adult wasps, as long as the adult are not part of a self sustaining population or that the application of the pesticide does not coincide with releases of adult wasps.

Seesaw searchlights were an early electric powered searchlight first developed in the 1870s used in conjunction with coast artillery.
The searchlight consisted of an electric carbon lamp, capable of a strong beam for target illumination, because the bulb was vulnerable to enemy fire, it was protected in a recessed emplacement whilst a large mirror, attached to the end of a 'see-saw' pivoting iron beam reflected the beam across the water to the target. The light was powered by steam engines usually housed in the nearby forts.
Only a few of these were built anywhere in the British Empire, and were difficult to operate and were never successful and New Zealand's example had been abandoned by 1899.
Surviving examples
No complete examples have survived but concrete emplacements can still be found at:
Fort Ballance, Wellington, New Zealand
Fort Victoria, Isle of Wight
Warden Point Battery on the Isle of Wight

This article provides information on the under 16 premiership deciders of rugbyleague competitions held on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The Match Details sub-section details the individual point-scorers in a match, where known.
The current competition is conducted under the auspices of the Central Coast Division Junior Rugby League, an affiliate of NSW Country Rugby League and the New South Wales Rugby League.
A predecessor to Under 16 and Under 17 competitions was D Grade, which was held from 1955 to 1966. When Group status was obtained in 1967, C and D Grade became Under 19 and Under 17. The following year they were changed to Under 18 and Under 16. Between 1979 and 1982 the two competitions reverted to Under 19 and Under 17. In 2000, Third Grade and Under 18s were replaced by Under 19 and Under 17 competitions. There has been an Under 17 competition in each subsequent season, apart from 2012. Since 2015, Under 17s has been run by the junior body and played on Saturdays, rather than as a curtain-raiser to Sunday grade matches.

Dharumavantha School (Dhivehi: ދަރުމަވަންތަ ސްކޫލް ) is a public and coeducational school in Malé, Maldives. The school was established in January 2002 with the split of the Majeedhiya School campus into two separate single gender schools, the newly formed school being Dharumavantha. With the establishment of a second male-gender secondary school, the staff and students of Majeedhiya School were split, with half transferred to the new school.
In 2010, the new government decided to introduce coeducation as well as primary grades in all of the four single gender secondary schools in the city. In 2011, Dharumavantha School welcomed the first co-educational batch of students admitted into the newly formed primary Grade 1 in the school. The change did not affect the current secondary school operations, which is to run as a single gender school until the new co-educational batch progresses to the secondary level.

is a mobile cat collecting game developed by Hit-Point Co., Ltd. for iOS and Android, released on October 20, 2014.
Gameplay
Gameplay revolves around the player purchasing food, cat toys, and furniture to attract a variety of cats to their home. The player can watch cats interact with objects, take photos of them which can be saved in an album, and receive gifts of fish and mementos from them.
Cats will leave the player either silver or gold "niboshi" (, small dried sardines), called "fish" in the English version, after leaving the yard. Players can also enter a daily password to receive a random amount of silver or gold fish. After five daily passwords are entered, the player will receive a free can of "Ritzy Bitz (3 gold fish)" or "Sashimi boat (50 gold fish)" (a high quality food). The fish can be used to purchase new types of food and goods, remodels, as well as extensions to the yard. Cats may leave collectible "mementos" for the player.
After purchasing the initial expansion to the garden, the player can then purchase a remodel for their yard. Players have the option to remodel their yard to one of seven different styles: Original, Zen, Rustic, Modern, Western, Sugary, or Cafe.
There is no end game and cats will continue to come as long as the player puts out food for them.
The game is free to play, though additional fish are available for purchase.
Cats
there are 66 cats for the player to collect. Among these, 26 are considered "rare cats" and only appear when certain items and foods are placed in the yard. Each cat has a unique name, personality, and appearance (e.g. the heterochromiac Pepper). The player may rename the cats after they have encountered them. Rare cats have a unique interaction with their items. Many of the rare cats in the English version of the game are named after famous people, both fictional and non-fictional, with the names of the cats being puns, like Lady Meow Meow (Lady Gaga), Mr. Meowgi (Mr. Miyagi), Chairman Meow (Chairman Mao), Guy Furry (Guy Fieri), Saint Purrtrick (Saint Patrick), Xerxes IX (Xerxes I), Hermeowne (Hermione Granger), Billy the Kitten (Billy the Kid), Bengel Jack (Calico Jack), and Joe DiMeowgio (Joe DiMaggio, complete with megaphone and baseball).
Development
Yutaka Takazaki, the developer of the game, said that their goal was to create a game that even children could enjoy without a significant investment of skill or time. While they love cats himself, they have said that "to be honest, I do not know why this game is so popular." The game "was made between the development of other applications." Originally, it was software for players who like cats to just watch and enjoy, and could be completed in 2–3 weeks for free. Takazaki says, "We're not going to put cheats or complexity in it, and we would like to pursue a game that can be enjoyed with only simple operations."
Release
On October 30, 2015, an English version of the game, titled Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector, was released on the Android and iOS app stores. As of version 1.4.5, players can switch between the Japanese and English versions of the game any time they want by using the in-game menu. Even before the English version, guides were written for English-speaking users to play the game.

The player also has the opportunity to get a new rare cat, Frosty. Version 1.6.0 was released on March 24, 2016. This version added two new common cats and two new rare cats, more toys, and introduced the "gallery" where players can buy wallpapers for their phones with gold fish.

United Nations Security Council resolution 822 was adopted unanimously on 30 April 1993. After expressing concern at the deterioration of relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and the subsequent escalation of armed hostilities and deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the region, the Council demanded the immediate cessation of hostilities and the immediate withdrawal of Armenian occupying forces in the Kalbajar district near Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.
Background
The First Nagorno-Karabakh War was an ethnic and territorial conflict that took place in the late 1980s to May 1994, in the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan, between the majority ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by the Republic of Armenia, and the Republic of Azerbaijan. As the war progressed, Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet Republics, entangled themselves in a protracted, undeclared war in the mountainous heights of Karabakh as Azerbaijan attempted to curb the secessionist movement in Nagorno-Karabakh.
By 1992 there was a state of full-scale war between the two now-independent nations. As winter approached, both sides largely abstained from launching full-scale offensives so as to preserve resources, such as gas and electricity, for domestic use. Despite the opening of an economic highway to the residents living in Karabakh, both Armenia and the enclave suffered a great deal due to the economic blockades imposed by Azerbaijan. The 1992–1993 winter was especially cold, as many families throughout Armenia and Karabakh were left without heating and hot water.
In spring 1993 Armenian forces began a new bout of offensives that overran villages in northern Karabakh that had been held by the Azerbaijanis since the previous year. Frustration over these military defeats took a toll on the domestic front in Azerbaijan. Armenia was similarly wracked by political turmoil and growing dissension against President Ter-Petrosyan.
Kelbajar
Situated west of northern Karabakh, outside the official boundaries of the region, was the rayon of Kelbajar, which bordered Armenia. With a population of about 60,000, the several dozen villages were made up of Azerbaijani and Kurds. In March 1993, the Armenian-held areas near the Sarsang reservoir in Mardakert was reported as coming under attack by the Azerbaijanis. Armenian forces were tasked to capture Kelbajar, where the incursions and artillery shelling were said to have come from.
On 2 April, Armenian forces advanced from two directions toward Kelbajar in an attack that struck Azerbaijani armor and troops entrenched near the Ganje-Kelbjar intersection. Azerbaijani forces were unable to halt Armenian armor and were wiped out. The second attack toward also quickly overran the defenders. By 3 April, Armenian forces were in possession of Kelbajar. Azerbaijani President Elchibey imposed a state of emergency for a period of two months and introduced universal conscription. Human Rights Watch concluded that during the Kelbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including the forcible exodus of a civilian population, indiscriminate fire, and taking of hostages.
Resolution
On 30 April, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed Resolution 822, co-sponsored by Turkey and Pakistan, demanding the immediate cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Kelbajar. The Council urged the parties concerned to resume negotiations to bring about an end to the conflict within the framework of the peace process proposed by the OSCE Minsk Group, and refraining from any action that would disrupt the process. While it acknowledged Armenian involvement, it did not directly accuse Armenia of aggression.
The resolution then called for unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts in the region to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population by way of humanitarian aid, reminding the parties to meet their obligations under international humanitarian law. It concluded by requesting the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe as well as the Chairman of the Minsk Group of the Conference, to assess the situation and report back to the Security Council.
Aftermath
Both sides welcomed the adoption of the resolution. Nevertheless, fighting continued throughout 1993 and into 1994. On 5 May 1994, mutually exhausted, both countries agreed to cease hostilities and to observe a ceasefire that went into effect on 12 May. Sporadic fighting continued in some parts of the region, but the ceasefire was in force until 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.

"What I Believe" is the title of a 1938 essay espousing humanism by E. M. Forster.
Forster's essay
E. M. Forster says that they do not believe in creeds; but there are so many around that one has to formulate a creed of one's own in self-defense. Three values are important to Forster: tolerance, good temper, and sympathy.
It was first published in The Nation on July 16, 1938. Hogarth Press republished it for general sale in 1939.
Personal relationships and the state
Forster argues that one should invest in personal relationships: "one must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life". In order to do so, one must be reliable in one's relationships. Reliability, in turn, is impossible without natural warmth. Forster contrasts personal relationships with causes, which they hate. In an often quoted sentence they argue: "If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country". They go on to explain:
Such a choice may scandalize the modern reader, and they may stretch out their patriotic hand to the telephone at once and ring up the police. It would not have shocked Dante, though. Dante places Brutus and Cassius in the lowest circle of Hell because they had chosen to betray their friend Julius Caesar rather than their country Rome.
Democracy
Forster cautiously welcomes democracy for two reasons:
It places importance on the individual (at least more than authoritarian regimes).
It allows criticism.
Thus, they call for "two cheers for democracy" (also the title of the book which contains their essay) but argues that this is "quite enough" and that "there is no occasion to give three."
Forster goes on to argue that, although the state ultimately rests on force, the intervals between the use of force are what makes life worth living. Some people may call the absence of force decadence; Forster prefers to call it civilization.
Great men, Forster's aristocracy, and public life
Forster also criticises hero-worship and profoundly distrusts so-called "great men". Heroes are necessary to run an authoritarian regime in order to make it seem less dull "much as plums have to be put into a bad pudding to make it palatable". As a contrast Forster believes in an "aristocracy", not based on rank or influence but an aristocracy of the sensitive, the considerate and the plucky. For Forster it is a tragedy that no way has been found to transmit private decencies into public life:
The more highly public life is organized the lower does its morality sink; the nations of today behave to each other worse than they ever did in the past, they cheat, rob, bully and bluff, make war without notice, and kill as many women and children as possible; whereas primitive tribes were at all events restrained by taboos. It is a humiliating outlook—though the greater the darkness, the brighter shine the little lights, reassuring one another, signalling: "Well, at all events, I'm still here. I don't like it very much, but how are you?"
Individualism
Forster concludes by stating that these "are the reflections of an individualist and a liberal" who has "found liberalism crumbling beneath him", taking comfort from the fact that people are born separately and die separately. Therefore, no dictator will be able to eradicate individualism.
Forster did not consider themselves a visionary.

, provisional designation: , is a Jupiter trojan from the Trojan camp, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 19 June 1998, by astronomers with the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Lab's ETS near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States. The suspected tumbler is also a slow rotator with a period of 250 hours. It has not been named since its numbering in July 2000.
Orbit and classification
is a Jupiter trojan in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the trailering Trojan camp at the Gas Giant's Lagrangian point, 60° behind its orbit .
It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.4 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,309 days; semi-major axis of 5.18 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 17° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery published by the Digitized Sky Survey and taken at Palomar Observatory in December 1953, more than 44 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.
Numbering and naming
This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 26 July 2000 (). , it has not been named.
Physical characteristics
is an assumed C-type asteroid. It has a typical V–I color index of 0.906 (see table below).
Rotation period
In August 2013, Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies observed over three nights. However no meaningful rotational lightcurve could be determined, as the lightcurve's amplitude never varied more than 0.02 magnitude. A period of 11.17 hours was only derived for demonstration purpose (). In December 2015, Stephens obtained an improved lightcurve with a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.30 magnitude (). This time the asteroid was observed on 16 nights over a period of one month. The photometric observations also revealed that this object possibly has a non-principal axis rotation, which is commonly known as tumbling.
Diameter and albedo
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the Japanese Akari satellite, measures 43.53 and 51.53 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.071 and 0.046, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 46.30 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.4.

Triangle Marsh is a wetland of the San Francisco Bay, situated at the base of Ring Mountain at the north end of the Tiburon Peninsula in Marin County, California.
Archaeological Pecked curvilinear nucleated petroglyphs, and recovery on Ring Mountain, hold significant evidence of Native American habitation and likely proof that early Miwok peoples exploited marine resources from Triangle Marsh.
The property is owned by the Marin branch of the National Audubon Society who restored upland and wetland habitats there with funding from a variety of sources. Federal endangered species, including the clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse, live in the Marsh.

Jean-Luc Vilmouth (5 March 1952 – 17 December 2015) was a French sculptor. They were born on 5 March 1952 at Creutzwald and died on the 19 December 2015 in Taipei. They taught at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris.
Biography
Trained at the Fine Arts School in Metz, Vilmouth arrived in England in the 1970s where they immersed themselves in the New English sculpture of Tony Cragg, Bill Woodrow and others. If minimalism and conceptual art will influence their early works Vilmouth will quickly focus their researches around everyday objects. Describing themselves as "augmentateur" Jean-Luc Vilmouth seeks to supplement the object rather than transform it. Far from formalist concerns, they chose objects for their potential, their memory: "what interests me in the objects that surround us, is their origin, their design ... I think that an object can enable us to understand include a whole social evolution... ". Through sculptures, installations, videos and performances, Vilmouth questioned the relationship to the object and its place in the environment. Reporting the malfunctions of the world around him, they seek to reinterpret everyday life to better challenge it. By the principle of diversion and scaling, they transcend mere objects of everyday life, by increasing its meaning and by engaging the viewer as an actor.
Permanent installations (France)
Comme un noyau, un voyage de l'esprit, Saint-Vincent-les-Forts (2011)
Under the VIAPAC, Vilmouth installed a model of the Vauban Fort of Saint-Vincent-les-Forts on the access path to the site, facing the Fort . Unlike the building that suffered the marks of time, the model is an exhaustive representation, to the image of the original architecture. This device brings the visitor to perceive sculpture as the nucleus from which the fort was built. This is both a reflection on architecture and a working memory inciting the public to mentally reconstruct the architecture of the fort by operating a back and forth between two scales of perception: that of the miniature model and that of the monumental building .
Bar des plantes, Strasbourg (2006)
This was carried out for a public commission for the city of Strasbourg. It is a flower kiosk functioning like a greenhouse and in which different kinds of syrups from various plants can be tasted.
Comme deux tours, Châtellerault (1994)
As part of the redevelopment of the Weapons Manufacture of Châtellerault, Vilmouth created a work highlighting the site and its history. It is as a kind of architectural metal graft that transforms two huge fireplaces in observation towers . 18 meters high gateways installed on these chimneys are made accessible by the spiral staircase situated where the old water tower used to be . On the Manufacture site stand two chimneys visible from most of the city . "Inversing the situation is to allow the viewer to show, is to allow the viewer to climb chimneys to watch the city. "'

Gang of Four () is a 1989 French drama film directed by Jacques Rivette. It was entered into the 39th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won a Honourable Mention.
Plot
Four women (Anna, Claude, Joyce, and Cécile) live together on a small estate in suburban Paris and take acting classes in the city. One of the women, Cécile, moves out to be with their boyfriend leading to another woman, Lucia, moving in. Cécile's departure and reticence to provide many details about their move cause some concern although this is eclipsed by the routine of acting classes. These acting classes are held out of a derelict theater and taught by a demanding former-actor, Constance. Constance runs their theater more like a cult than a school: its membership is small, highly restrictive, and costly; students must fully dedicate themselves to Constance's classes, even if it means sacrificing their livelihood; and Constance's focus on non-constructive criticism keeps theirs students insecure/committed for years. In turn, Constance's students seem to suffer from an unwarranted hero worship for Constance. Constance's students never rehearse plays, only two-person scenes interrupted by Constance's criticism.
In part because of Constance's many restrictions, their students live whimsical, bohemian lifestyles. Although their lifestyles are largely paid for by others, they are seemingly isolated from those around them. This frequently manifests with their manic or otherwise irrational behavior.
Joyce, Anna, and Claude each individually encounter an eccentric, enigmatic man. Joyce is the first to meet them and they provide them with their phone number, which they initially don't call. Anna later meets them at an art gallery although they brush them off. They leave the gallery alone but on their way out is encountered by a pair of purported thugs. The man conveniently rescues them from possible assault and offers to drive their home. On the car ride back, they introduce themselves as an ex-business partner of Cécile's boyfriend. They claim that they used to make fraudulent ID cards together. They also claim that both Cécile and their boyfriend are now in a great deal of trouble. They somehow know the exact route back to Anna's house without their directions, prompting concern by Anna.
Upon arriving home, Anna discusses their encounter with Joyce who advises that they had an unusual encounter with a similarly described man. Having kept the man's phone number, Anna and Joyce stage a meet-up with the man at a lounge. The man begins to tell Joyce that Cécile and their boyfriend are involved in a terroristic plot, with an arsenal of guns possibly stored at the estate. Joyce motions to Anna, unbeknownst to them sitting some distance away at the bar, so as to indicate that both are catching up to their ruse. However, they escape any confrontation. The man turns out to be Thomas, a police officer investigating Cécile's boyfriend. They have been using aliases and invented backgrounds in an effort to get into the women's estate, which they believe will reveal a key to incriminating evidence of a judge's wrongdoings. The key is more than proverbial, it fell down Anna's chimney one night and was taken in secret by Lucia.
The film turns to the unhappiness and domestic strife the women encounter in their everyday lives, focusing largely on Claude. Claude seems to suffer from borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, and gender dysphoria.  They are in love with a woman although the love is unrequited. Thomas meets with Claude and they introduce themselves as an illicit art dealer.  They are able to take advantage of Claude and has sex with them at the estate in order to look for the key. Unable to find the key, they continue their sexual relationship with Claude.
One evening, Claude spies on Cécile and sees them together with their boyfriend for the first time. Claude later watches a news broadcast and learns that Cécile's boyfriend has been arrested and charged with murder. However, the charge may be false and motivated by their failed whistleblowing attempt against the asupervisorstioned judge.
Despite their moving out of the estate, Cécile continues to attend acting class but the quality of their performance has declined after the arrest of their boyfriend. However, when they learn that their boyfriend has escaped police custody and is on the lam, their acting improves. Constance cancels class after the news of the escape is shared. It is later implied that Constance may have been complicit with in prior criminal wrongdoings, resulting in their later arrest by plainclothes police officers and subsequent disbandment of the theater.
Cécile attempts to find the key, realizing its importance to vindicating their boyfriend, but prematurely gives up. Thomas becomes far less cautious with their encounters at the estate in their efforts to find the key. Thomas reveals themselves as a police officer to Anna, Claude, Joyce, and Lucia and refuses to leave the estate until they obtain the key. They tell them that the key can be used to unlock a secured box containing damning evidence against a judge, which they do not want released. Should they cooperate, Thomas claims they will coordinate Cécile's boyfriend's release. Lucia claims multiple times that they tossed the key into the Seine although Thomas does not believe them Thomas knows that the key remains somewhere in the house. After five days of their living at the estate, Lucia attempts to murder Thomas with the same poison they used in their own suicide attempt but Thomas outsmarts them They shatter the glass of poisoned whiskey they gave them then repeatedly shakes Lucia until the key falls off their person. Thomas attempts to escape the estate with the key in hand but is either knocked unconsciousness or killed by two blows of a barbell swung by Joyce.
Anna, Claude, Joyce, and Lucia conduct an infantile mock trial for Cécile's boyfriend, highly reminiscent of the sensationalized trial in Werner Schroeter's Palermo or Wolfsburg. This performance mawkishly prompts them to reconvene with their former students at Constance's theater and rehearse a play. The rehearsal seems to be the first time the students have worked together on a play. Despite their talent, they struggle to finish even a single scene. They realize that they are unable to act without Constance's relentless criticism, not knowing if she'll ever return.

Rhianus (Greek: Ῥιανὸς ὁ Κρής) was a Greek poet and grammarian, a native of Crete, friend and contemporary of Eratosthenes (275–195 BC).
Biography
The Suda says they were at first a slave and overseer of a palaestra, but obtained a good education later in life and devoted themselves to grammatical studies, probably in Alexandria. They prepared a new recension of the Iliad and Odyssey, characterized by sound judgment and poetical taste. Their bold atheteses are frequently mentioned in the scholia. They also wrote epigrams, eleven of which, preserved in the Greek Anthology and Athenaeus, show elegance and vivacity. But they were chiefly known as a writer of epics (mythological and ethnographical), the most celebrated of which was the Messeniaca in six books, dealing with the Second Messenian War and the exploits of its central figure Aristomenes, and used by Pausanias in their fourth book as a trustworthy authority. Other similar poems were the Achaica, Eliaca, and Thessalica. The Heracleia was a long mythological epic, probably an imitation of the poem of the same name by Panyasis, containing the same number of books (fourteen).
Legacy
Rhianos also wrote a number of homoerotic epigrams, and was also mentioned in one of Greek poet's Constantine P. Cavafy poems ("Young Men of Sidon (A.D. 400)").

Gijsbrecht Leytens, formerly known as Meester van de Winterlandschappen or Master of the Winter Landscapes, (1586– after 1643 and before 1656) was a Flemish painter who specialized in landscapes and in particular winter landscapes.
Life
They were born in Antwerp. They became a pupil of Jacob Vrolijck in 1598. They joined the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a master in 1611. They married Maria van Omel.
There was a lot of demand for the winter landscapes painted by Leytens as is confirmed by the fact that they were often incorporated in the art gallery paintings of Frans Francken the Younger. Between 1617 en 1627 they had a number of pupils demonstrating an active workshop.
Since there is a record showing they were alive in 1643 while in 1657 they are recorded as 'the late' they must have died between those years.
They were the teacher of Jan Baptist Rocataillate and Francois Veeken.
Work
Leytens' work was originally attributed to an unidentified painter referred to as 'Meester van de Winterlandschappen' or 'Master of the Winter Landscapes'. Only in 1942 F.J.J. Reelick tentatively identified Gijsbrecht Leytens with this anonymous master. This attribution was confirmed in 1988 by Ursula Härtung on the basis of a fully signed work.
Leytens painted mainly landscapes. All known landscapes by them are winter landscapes except for a few such as A mountainous landscape with deer (Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Braunschweig) and a ''Wooded Mountain Landscape with Waterfall and Travellers' (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm). It is known that they painted six marine paintings but these are now lost.
Artists such as Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Abel Grimmer, as well as Denis van Alsloot and Daniel van Heil, had turned the winter landscape into one of the preferred subjects of Flemish painting. The theme was taken up by Dutch painters such as Hendrick Avercamp, Aert van der Neer and Anthonie Verstraelen. Gijsbrecht Leytens' work is unique in distancing itself from the austere, dreary and unsettling landscapes that rely on human figures to come to life. Leytens succeeded in recreating winter while avoiding a simple academic rendering showing the trivial details of human activities. Their winter landscapes shimmer in the light of sunny mornings. Leytens is regarded as the 'poet of the frost', since they succeed in expressing the poetic beauty of winter by devices such as depicting the naked sun on a countryside caught in the ice. They stand out through the refinement of their subtle colour harmonies.
Gijsbrecht Leytens was influenced by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Gillis van Coninxloo. Like their contemporaries in Antwerp, Abraham Govaerts and Alexander Keirincx, Leytens painted wooded landscapes populated with small figures, bracketed by strong repoussoir trees.
As was common in Antwerp artist circles in the 17th century Gijsbrecht Leytens regularly collaborated with other painters who were specialists in a particular genre. Inventories of the 17th century provide evidence for collaborations between Leytens and artists such as Frans Francken the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Vincent Malo, who would paint the figures while Leytens painted the landscapes. Often Leytens reused their landscape designs and let their collaborators add different figures to them thus creating a different theme. This points to serial work in their workshop due to the great demand for their work.

Hallelujah! is a British television sitcom produced by Yorkshire Television that aired on ITV from 29 April 1983 to 21 December 1984.
The series was set in a Salvation Army citadel in the fictional Yorkshire town of Brigthorpe during series 1 (and later in the fictional place of Blackwick in series 2). Captain Emily Ridley (Thora Hird) has been posted there, having been an active member of the Salvation Army for 42 years. Despite the town and residents being seemingly pleasant, Emily is determined to flush out sin from behind the net curtains. Assisting Emily is their niece Alice Meredith (Patsy Rowlands).
The programme was a repeat collaboration between Hird and the creator Dick Sharples, who had worked together on the comedy series In Loving Memory between 1979 and 1986.
The series also featured guest appearances from the likes of Hird's Last of the Summer Wine co-star Michael Aldridge and television presenter Richard Whiteley.
Plot
The show was set in the Salvation Army based on the fictional Yorkshire town of Brigthorpe during Series 1, and in the equally fictional Yorkshire place of Blackwick during Series 2. Dame Thora Hird starred as Captain Emily Ridley, with Patsy Rowlands as their niece Alice Meredith and Rosamund Greenwood as Sister Dorothy Smith (who left after the first series and was later replaced by David Daker as Brother Benjamin in the second series).
A notable characteristic of the show was that every episode ended with the audience clapping once during the closing sequence throughout its year-long run.

Only 15 episodes over two series were made though some sources claim that there were three series made. This is incorrect; there were only two series and one Christmas special shown between 1983 and 1984.
In 1985, it was reported that a continuation/sequel of the series was to be produced for BBC 2. This follow-on series ultimately never appeared; instead, Hird later that year signed up to play Edie Pegden, a character with a number of parallels to their Hallelujah! character Captain Emily Ridley, in Last of the Summer Wine, a role that was written especially for them by Roy Clarke when they became available.
Location filming
The series was filmed mostly in and around both Yorkshire Television Studios and the Leeds area. Most notable filming location was Leeds General Infirmary, especially appearances by old run-down buildings old and new around the Leeds-area at the time.
The opening sequence was filmed outside the Garden Gate pub in Hunslet.
DVD release
DD Home Entertainment (now known as 'Simply Home Entertainment') released series 1 and 2 in 2008. They claimed that series two was complete at first, However, as the Christmas special was not included, they later dropped this claim (the artwork on the cover stayed the same however)
Both series of Hallelujah! and the Christmas Special are now available from Network DVD.
Hallelujah! has been released in Australia by Acorn Media Australia. It is a boxset with both series plus the Christmas special. It has been released as an all region DVD (PAL).

The Thomastown Mosque (), is a mosque located in Thomastown, a northern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The mosque is situated opposite the railway line and Thomastown railway station. Associated with the Turkish Australian community, the mosque is owned by and the centre of the Thomastown Turkish Education and Islamic Society.
History
Turkish immigrants from Turkey arrived and settled in Thomastown, a working class suburb that at the time was a remote part of Melbourne. Turks which settled were often young families seeking employment or to purchase a home in the area, whereas some sent remittances to Turkey. Due to their difficult economic plight, sentiments arose among the community that desired its religious needs to be addressed to cope with the situation.
In the early 1980s, the Muslims in Thomastown numbered some 30 people and the Turkish Islamic Society purchased a property to cater for its community regarding prayers. A neighbouring property was purchased to serve as a home for the imam. By 1991, the Muslims numbered 2,574 and there was community need to have a mosque. The Thomastown Turkish Education and Islamic Society was granted a permit, subject to various restrictions and conditions, to have a community centre by Whittlesea Council in February 1983. Some of those included having no more than 15 people present on the premises and an annual renewal of the permit, undertaken by Whittlesea Council between 1984-1986. In 1987, no renewal was attempted. Whittlesea Council rejected multiple applications from the Islamic Society for the property to be used for worship. Instead, the Whittlesea Council suggested was that they Islamic Society submit an application for a community centre. Misunderstandings of Whittlesea Council actions led the Islamic Society to view the Muslim community as recipients of discrimination.
The Islamic Society was informed by Whittlesea Council (May 1987) that the permit expired and the property could not be used as a community centre. An application was lodged with Whittlesea Council for a planning permit for a mosque and community centre. Four locals, after being informed through an advertisement, were opposed to the plans. By November 1987, deliberation by Whittlesea Council of the application resulted in a Refusal Notice. Three reasons were given, that congestive parking would affect the residential area, increased noise, in particular at night, and funeral ceremonies conducted on the property perceived as detrimental. Whittlesea Council also stated that the neighbouring Islamic Society premises could only be used for residential purposes and a fence should be reinstalled between both properties. Another application was put forward by the Islamic Society in January 1988, later withdrawn after talks with Whittlesea Council. In February, a new application was submitted for a community centre and the Islamic Society was told that no religious activities could take place and the fence needed to be reinstalled. During 1988, Whittlesea Council permission was given for 20 people to be present at any given time at the community centre.
The restrictions from the Whittlesea Council motivated the Islamic Society to submit an appeal at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. During July 1988, the Tribunal extended the permit until March 1990 and allowed for a mosque to be built. The Islamic Society held discrimination toward them as a reason for the difficulties it encountered. Identified as such by the Islamic Society were Whittlesea Council actions like its recommendation that the word "Islamic" or "Islam" on signs not be displayed in return for assistance, opposing parking over traffic concerns and having gone to court 10 times, or giving a church funds for repairs, but not them.

The Bitburg Reservoir () is a flood retention basin on the River Prüm in Biersdorf am See and Wiersdorf in the Eifel mountains of Germany. It is about 12 kilometres northwest of the town of Bitburg and not far from the city of Trier in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
The dam, a 15-metre-high earth dam, was built by the Zweckverband Stausee Bitburg for flood protection at a spot where the narrow and deeply incised valley of the Prüm opened into a valley bowl, that used to be constantly in danger of flooding. The roughly 2-kilometre-long and up to nine-metre-deep reservoir allows the regulation of low water levels, enables the generation of electricity, and offers a place of recreation, making it a popular destination and tourist centre in the South Eifel. Around the lake there is a five-kilometre-long circular path and many other good hiking trails, some of which are lit at night. The hiking network of the German-Luxembourg Nature Park starts here.
Sporting and recreational activities include rowing, paddling, surfing, pedaloes, inline skating, mountain biking, badminton, cycling and fishing (for trout). in the middle of the lake is a large fountain.

Jacques Alfred van Muyden (22 October 1818, Lausanne - 11 May 1898, Geneva) was a Swiss history, portrait and genre painter, engraver, and a co-founder of the "".
Biography
Their mother was Swiss, but their father was a Dutchman from Utrecht. Their family wanted them to study law, but they chose painting instead. They were originally self-taught, but their early works were good enough for them to gain entrance to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where they studied with Wilhelm von Kaulbach.
They returned home in 1842 but, not long after, on the recommendation of Marc-Louis Arlaud, they moved to Rome. Sick and generally unsuccessful, despite a showing at the Salon in 1846, they returned to Lausanne again in 1848 as the Revolutions began. The following year they married the sister of the Genevan painter, Étienne Duval (1824-1914). Their sons, Albert-Steven (1849-1910), Evert and Henri (1860-1936) all became painters.
From 1850 to 1856, they and their family lived in Rome, then purchased a villa in Champel, near Geneva. In 1857, some of their works were purchased by Napoleon III.
That same year, they and the Mayor of Cologny, Auguste Turrettini (1818-1881) co-founded the "Gesellschaft der Freunde der bildenden Künste" and established a permanent exhibition, which they oversaw for twenty-three years. Three years later, they were one of the many founding members of the "Gesellschaft der Schweizer Maler und Bildhauer" and served as its Chairman on several occasions. From 1880 to 1882, they were involved in copyright issues, attempting to establish that the right of reproduction belongs to a work's creator only, not to its owner.

Prosensa was a biotechnology company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of RNA-modulating therapeutics. The company targets genetic disorders with a large unmet medical need, with a primary focus on neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), myotonic dystrophy, and Huntington's disease. Prosensa was acquired by BioMarin
History up to the sale
Prosensa commenced operations in 2002 and is located in Leiden, The Netherlands. The company works closely together with academia, patient groups and experts worldwide. Prosensa entered into an exclusive licensing agreement in 2003 with Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) for their proprietary RNA modulation exon-skipping technology to develop treatments for DMD, other neuromuscular disorders and indications outside the field of neuromuscular disorders.
Prosensa's portfolio of clinical and pre-clinical RNA-based drug candidates is currently focused on the treatment of DMD.
Prosensa's lead product, drisapersen, has completed Phase III clinical trials and (in June 2015) a New Drug Application (NDA) has been accepted by the US FDA.
Three additional products, PRO044, PRO045 and PRO053 were also in clinical development, and PRO052 and PRO055 were in advanced preclinical development. In parallel, Prosensa also had an advanced program called PROSPECT into pre-clinical testing, which included a new and innovative application of its exon-skipping technology platform, applying multiple exon skipping, to specifically target rarer mutations (initially in exon 10 to 30 region) in the dystrophin gene. This approach could have applicability between 5-13% of the DMD population.
In addition to its clinical trials, Prosensa were running a Natural History Study, which has completed enrollment with 269 patients across the US, Europe and Latin America. The purpose of this study was to characterize the natural history and progression of DMD, to help inform the design of future studies, to capture biomarkers of safety and disease progression and to provide comparative data for the development of rare exons for which formal controlled trials are not feasible.
In November 2014, BioMarin Pharmaceutical agreed to pay up to $840 million to acquire Prosensa.
Related events since the sale
In January 2016, the FDA rejected drisapersen, largely on the basis of toxicity.
In May 2016, BioMarin discontinued the clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen, as well as phase 2 studies of BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053 (formerly PRO044, PRO045 and PRO053).

Woodseaves is a village in Staffordshire, England.
It lies in the civil parish of High Offley and is situated on the A519 (Newport-Newcastle-under-Lyme) road and lies at the south-west end of the B5405 road, which leads to Great Bridgeford. Nearby are the villages of Gnosall and Norbury, the hamlets of Knightley and High Offley, and the small town of Eccleshall. The elevation of the village is between and above sea level. The centre of the village is the top of a small hill, relative to the adjacent countryside, and the roads into and out of the village are almost all sloping away from the village.
Amenities and features
The village contains a post office, a Methodist chapel, a village hall which is linked to a snooker club with two full size and well maintained snooker tables, and a primary school which had 83 pupils in 2007-8. The village hall is home to a number of evening events, such as "keep fit" classes, a craft club, an "over 55s" club, t'ai chi, and a fortnightly whist drive. The village is represented by one snooker and two billiards teams competing in the Stafford and District Billiards and Snooker League. A Sunday league football team also represent the village, playing their home games at Knighton Social Club.
The village has had three public houses — The Plough (now closed, converted to residential) and The Cock Inn, both of which are situated along the A519 road. A third, The Reform Tavern, which also lay on the main road, between the other two pubs, closed soon after the Millennium and is now a private residence.
The southern part of the village, on the A519, is known as Littleworth. Formerly a separate hamlet, it is now part of Woodseaves. The Plough is situated in Littleworth.
Canal
One kilometre southwest of the village is the Shropshire Union Canal. A deep cutting on the canal has the name of Woodseaves but this is not taken from the name of the village but from another Woodseaves, a hamlet about two miles to the south of Market Drayton in Shropshire. There are deep cuttings however near to Woodseaves (Staffordshire) at Loynton and Grub Street.
Underneath a nearby canal bridge, over which the A519 road passes, on the Newport side of Woodseaves, stands possibly the world's, and certainly Britain's smallest telegraph pole, its presence goes unnoticed by people crossing the bridge, but it is visible via the towpath that runs under the bridge on the south side of the canal.

Anaku (Aqsu, Aksu) was a skirt-type garment of indigenous women in the Inca Empire. It was a long drape dress straight in shape, falling to ankle length.
Style
Anaku was a typical dress of Andean women. It was a long rectangular piece of woven cloth wool fibers, a simple draping garment. The traditional wearing style of Otavalo women was disfferent, they were wearing it with a blouse. An ankle-length anaku (as an underskirt) was wrapped over with another anku.
Evolution
The full-body Anaku evolved to half-body Anaku in certain areas. Initially, the anaku was larger that changed with generations; the length of the garment became shorter and changed to half of the ancestral version. It is still a costume that Otavalo people wore. Anku was tied around the waist with a sash called ''chumbi'' or ''chumpi'' or ''Chumpia''. There was a similar type but ankle-length garment ''aksu'' that was worn in Southern parts. Anaku as a wrap skirt still worn around Northern Ecuador.

Pagan Pride is a movement among American pagans to build a positive public image of paganism. Local Pagan Pride groups sponsor "Pagan Pride Day" festivals, usually in public locations such as city parks or university campuses. The first recorded reference to "Pagan Pride" can be traced to 1992.
The Pagan Pride Project
The Pagan Pride Project is an organization whose aims are to promote understanding of paganism, support various charities, and bring pagan communities closer together. The project's logo shows various pagan symbols encircling the Earth—the yin/yang symbol, Celtic cross, Mjöllnir, a Triple Goddess symbol, an Eye of Horus, Venus of Willendorf, ankh, pentagram, triskelion, Stone Megalith, Green Man, Enneagram, and the Kabbalistic Tree of life.
Pagan Pride Day
Pagan Pride Day is an annual event held in a variety of locations across the world. The festivities are as varied as the communities who organize them. Some events are simple open picnics or cook-outs held in a local park; others are full-fledged festivals with rented venues, performance stages, and food facilities. There are, however, several common elements.
First and foremost is the goal of educating the public about the beliefs and practices of various Neopagan traditions. The general public is invited and there are usually tables of reading materials, staffed by members of a range of Neopagan denominations. Speakers or workshops may focus on dispelling common misconceptions about Neopaganism, or may seek to educate outsiders about the details of their particular beliefs and practices.
The second most common aspect is charitable work. Many Pagan Pride coordinating committees choose a local charity to support with fundraising and/or donations raised by the event. These charities might be organizations related to environmental conservation, animal rescues, food pantries, shelters for victims of domestic violence, or related causes.
Pagan Pride Day events are open to the public and generally welcoming to families and children. Hosting a PPD event requires adherence to a range of policies.
Many Pagan Pride festivals showcase local Neopagan performers, artisans, and merchants. Some events offer open mic sessions where attendees might chant, tell jokes, spin tales, drum, or read poetry.

Splendor is a 1999 romantic comedy film directed by Gregg Araki and starring Kathleen Robertson, Johnathon Schaech, and Matt Keeslar. The film deals with an open relationship between the three leads.
Plot
When struggling Los Angeles actor Veronica finds themselves simultaneously falling in love with a sensitive writer named Abel and an air-headed drummer named Zed, they initially try to see them both without the other finding out, and then to choose between them. When they are unable to do so, they begin openly dating them both, and the three eventually move in together, forming a unique yet functional group relationship. Veronica's friend Mike is critical of their relationship, though they warm to the concept over time. Abel and Zed are initially antagonistic to one another but grow closer over time, eventually becoming closer to one another than either of them are to Veronica. When Veronica becomes pregnant, the relationship becomes strained and they eventually leaf both Abel and Zed for charming director Ernest, whom they agree to marry despite not loving. At the film's climax, Abel and Zed race across the city at Mike's urging to stop the wedding and win them back.

Themes
Speaking to Filmmaker Magazine, Araki referred to the film as being "very much about trying to live by your own rules...about achieving conventional happiness in an unconventional way." In terms of genre, they said "I wanted a sort of Cary Grant stylization. As in screwball comedy, the emotions are real, but there is also a kind of sheen to the performance."
Reception
Splendor received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a ranking of 52/100 on review aggregator Metacritic, and has a 58% on Rotten Tomatoes. The Chicago Reader described it as being "marvelously neutral toward a type of sexual and domestic relationship that's often exploited or overblown", and The Austin Chronicle stated that "there's a genuine, sparky chemistry between the three...and Robertson, particularly, is luminous in their role." The Daily News was less positive, saying that the film "seems more like a vapid sitcom made on a low budget" and summarising it as "meaningless, if perverted, fun." Variety stated that, "though less violent and macabre than all of (Araki's) previous movies, Splendor is not exactly fresh, nor a radical point of departure...a seductively sensual picture that entices while it lasts but evaporates like an air bubble as soon as it is over."

The COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021 is an Act of Parliament to provide a legal framework for the New Zealand Government's COVID-19 Protection Framework and vaccination mandates. The bill was introduced under urgency and passed in law on 23 November 2021. While the bill was supported by the Labour Government and their Green coalition partners, it was opposed by the opposition National, ACT, and Māori parties, which criticised the rushed and divisive nature of the legislation and claimed that vulnerable communities would be adversely affected.
Key points
As an omnibus bill, the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021 amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 and the Employment Relations Act 2000 to give the Government and employers greater mandate to require employees to receive COVID-19 vaccines. The Bill also has a sunset clause for the repeal of the provisions of the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021 on the date that the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 is repealed.
COVID-19 Public Health Response Act
The COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act introduces the following amendments:
Section 5(3) allows the Director-General of Health to issue a notice specifying COVID-19 vaccination exemption criteria and the required doses for each COVID-19 vaccine or combination of COVID-19 vaccines.
Section 9 allows the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety, the Minister for COVID-19 Response, or any minister under any warrant or the authority of the Prime Minister to make COVID-19 orders under Section 11.
The amended Section 11 specifies several orders that can be made under the Act including ordering someone to stay in specific premises, permitting entry to specific premises, restricting travel and movement, restricting work carrying out by infected workers, the dosage of COVID-19 vaccines, and the regulation of COVID-19 vaccine certificates.
Section 17 requires the Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) to keep vaccination records, prevent affected persons (other than an exempt or authorised person) to carry out specified work unless vaccinated.
Section 23a gives authorised enforcement persons the power to direct person to produce evidence of compliance with a specified COVID-19 measures.
Section 33AA allows the Governor-General at the recommendation of the Prime Minister to make regulations prescribing an assessment tool that an PCBU may use to ensure that workers are vaccinated and required to undergo medical examination or testing for COVID-19.
Section 33AB allows PCBU to assess that workers are vaccinated and undergo medical examination or testing for COVID-19. The PCBU must also take steps to protect the worker's personal information.
Section 34B states that personal information may not be held, stored, used, or disclosed by the person except for the purposes of ascertaining whether an individual has been vaccinated, issued with a COVID-19 vaccination certificate, or are complying with the Public Health Response Act, a COVID-19 health order, and the Health Act 1956.
Recognises the Vaccine Pass and International Travel Vaccination Certificate as COVID-19 vaccination certificates.
Employment Relations Act 2000
A new Schedule 3A gives employees paid-time off for COVID-19 vaccinations.
Schedule 3A allows for the termination of employment agreements for failing to comply with vaccination mandates under the requirements of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 or a COVID-19 order.
History
Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins introduced the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Bill during its first reading on 23 November 2021. The bill passed its first reading by a margin of 85 to 35. The Labour, Green, and ACT parties supported the bill while the National and Te Paati Māori (Māori Party) opposed it. National's COVID-19 spokesperson Chris Bishop and fellow National MPs Scott Simpson, and Penny Simmonds objected to the bill on the grounds that it was rushed and lacked a select committee process. Labour MPs Hipkins, Liz Craig, Tracey McLellan, and Green MP Elizabeth Kerekere defended the bill, claiming that it supported the Government's COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic-light system) and vaccination efforts. ACT leader David Seymour initially supported the bill as part of a constructive approach to supporting the Government's COVID-19 response while expressing concerns about the bill's vague language relating to business operations. Te Paati Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer objected to the bill on the grounds that the Government's vaccination mandate and traffic light framework did not comply with the Treaty of Waitangi.
During the in-committee stage, Parliament rejected several amendments by National MPs regarding vaccination policies, laboratory testing, easing travel restrictions on the basis of negative COVID-19 tests, exemptions for places of worship, funeral services, and tangihanga, and New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and human rights safeguards.
During the third reading, ACT leader David Seymour joined the National Party in criticising the legislation, describing it as a "constitutional outrage" and attacking the Government's management of the COVID-19 pandemic and economy. Te Paati Māori co-leader Ngarewa-Packer opposed the bill, claiming that the Government's COVID-19 Protection Framework would endanger Māori lives and well-being. Labour and Green MPs, particularly McLellan and Kerekere defended the Government's traffic light system and vaccine passes. The bill passed its final reading by a margin 75 (Labour and Greens) to 45 votes (National, ACT, Māori).
Responses
Prior to its passage, Human Rights Commission chief Paul Hunt described the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Bill as "highly problematic" both constitutionally and in terms of New Zealand's human rights and Treaty of Waitangi obligations. They also opined that the Bill should be subject to a full parliamentary select committee as soon as it had passed into law.
Victoria University of Wellington law Professor Dr. Dean Knight was supportive of the legislation but expressed concern about its rapid passage. While the Ministry of Justice advised Attorney-General David Parker that the bill was consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, its lawyers expressed concern about the "extremely shot frame of time" relating to the legislation's passage.
In early December 2021, Attorney-General Parker defended the hasty passage of the law, stating that "it would have been impossible to avoid a 24-hour urgent lawmaking spree." Parker also said that New Zealand should not allow the choices of the unvaccinated minority to hold back its progress in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 3 December 2021, University of Auckland commercial law Associate Professor Gehan Gunasekara along with Dr Marcin Betkier and Kathryn Dalziel of the Privacy Foundation New Zealand expressed concern about the lack of a select committee process that would have allowed public consultation and the opaque language relating to the protection of COVID-19 contact tracing and vaccination information. They also expressed concerns about the protection of contact tracing information and the safety of software used for storing the Vaccine Pass software on phones.

A G-spot vibrator is a sex toy with female and male varieties. The female version of the device is built to massage the G-spot, described as a bean-shaped area of the vagina. Some women report that it is an erogenous zone which, when stimulated, can lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and female ejaculation. The male version of the G-spot vibrator is used for massaging the prostate for both sexual and health-related reasons.
Female and male versions
Female G-spot vibrators
The female type is of phallus-like shape and especially designed for stimulating the G-spot. It first appeared as a response to complaints that vaginal penetration alone, provided by the penis or otherwise, was generally not enough for women to reach orgasm. Women usually need direct clitoral stimulation to orgasm, and stimulating the G-spot area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult to achieve because of the special angle at which penetration must occur. The curved structure of the G-spot vibrator attempts to make stimulating the G-spot area possible without awkward body positioning.
The level of vaginal penetration when using a G-spot vibrator depends on the woman because women's physiology is not always the same. The effects of G-spot stimulation when using the penis or a G-spot vibrator may be enhanced by additionally stimulating other erogenous zones on a woman's body, such as the clitoris or vulva as a whole. When using a G-spot vibrator, this may be done by manually stimulating the clitoris, using the vibrator as a clitoral vibrator in addition to a G-spot vibrator, or, if the vibrator is designed for it, by applying it so that it stimulates the head of the clitoris, rest of the vulva and the vagina simultaneously.
Almost all female G-spot vibrators feature the phallus shape and have a specially curved end for reaching the anterior (front-most) area of the vagina. But there can be also a group of special or exotic G-spot vibrators intended for G-spot stimulation featuring novelty shapes. Generally, G-spot vibrators have a head slightly larger than the glans penis, and are 1–1.5 in (2–3 cm) wide and 5–7 in (12.5–17.5 cm) long.
Male G-Spot vibrators
The Prostate massager is a curved device with a round head which is inserted into the anal canal of a male and stimulates the prostate gland, which is also called the male G-spot or P-spot. This can produce a host of different and intense sensations.
Materials
G-spot vibrators are usually manufactured from materials that provide a pleasant touch: silicone, jelly, rubber, hard-plastic, or any combination of them.

Serpentine, a fantasy novella by Philip Pullman, is set after Their Dark Materials and before the second book of The Book of Dust series.
Origins
Serpentine was not originally intended for publication but was instead written in 2004 at the request of Nicholas Hytner (at that time artistic director of the National Theatre) to be auctioned for charity during the NT production of Their Dark Materials; the work sold for a "substantial sum". At the time of writing Pullman had not intended to revisit Lyra as an adult but after the publication of The Secret Commonwealth decided to issue the novella as it prefigures Lyra and Pantalaimon's character development in The Book of Dust.
Synopsis
In this story, a teenage Lyra and their dæmon Pantalaimon revisit Trollesund, the Arctic town prominently featured in Northern Lights as the place of their first meeting with the aeronaut Lee Scoresby and the armoured bear Iorek Byrnison. They seek the witch-consul Dr. Lanselius in the hope of finding answers to their ability to separate.
Audiobook
An audiobook narrated by Olivia Colman will be released on the same day as the print and ebook versions.

Arf-GAP domain and FG repeats-containing protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the AGFG2 gene.
This gene is a member of the HIV-1 Rev binding protein (HRB) family and encodes a protein with one Arf-GAP zinc finger domain, several phe-gly (FG) motifs, and four asn-pro-phe (NPF) motifs. This protein interacts with Eps15 homology (EH) domains and plays a role in the Rev export pathway, which mediates the nucleocytoplasmic transfer of proteins and RNAs. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized.

Charles Christian Cameron "Nish" Bruce, (8 August 1956 – 8 January 2002) was a British Army soldier.
Bruce served with the British Army's Parachute Regiment and Special Air Service. They deployed during the Falklands War and as part of Operation Banner to Northern Ireland in the early 1980s, where they were awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. In 1998, they published a memoir of their life entitled Freefall, under the pseudonym "Tom Read". After several years of psychiatric illness, Bruce killed themselves by leaping without a parachute to their death from an aeroplane during a flight over South-Eastern England.
Early life
Bruce was born in Chipping Norton, in Oxfordshire, England, on 8 August 1956. They came from a family with a military tradition, being the middle son of a father who had been a fighter pilot with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, and the paternal grandson of Major Ewen Cameron Bruce (of Blaen-y-cwm).
Military career
Bruce joined the British Army's Parachute Regiment as a private in 1973 at the age of 17, and served with the regiment in Northern Ireland in the mid-1970s in Operation Banner. From 1978 they spent four years with the Red Devils Display Team, participating in test-jumping, international exhibitions and competitions. At the time of their death in 2002, with nearly 30 years in military and civilian parachuting, Bruce had logged over 8,500 parachute jumps. Their parachute log books show that they learnt their basic parachuting skills at Sibson Airfield, Peterborough from 1974 to 1978 prior to joining The Red Devils (Parachute Regiment) Display Team and achieved their D Rating in April 1979).
Bruce subsequently applied for transfer to the Special Air Service and, after passing its aptitude trials, was attached to 22nd Special Air Service Regiment in April 1982, shortly before the Falklands War commenced. They served with 22 SAS 'B' Squadron, 7 (Air) Troop from 1982 to 1986. While with 'B' Squadron 7 Troop, they served with Alistair Slater, Frank Collins and Andy McNab. (In a November 2008 interview with The Daily Telegraph, McNab described Bruce as "one of my heroes").
In 1982, with other members of 'B' Squadron, 22. SAS, Bruce parachuted into the South Atlantic Ocean during the Falklands War, and took part in Operation Mikado.
In late 1984 Bruce was involved with British Army counter-terrorist operations against Provisional Irish Republican Army units in Kesh, County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, for which they were later awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for "exemplary acts of bravery" in maintaining the pursuit of an IRA vehicle in a high speed chase while under almost continual fire. "One member of the pursuit team recalls the weight of fire that was poured out at them as being like 'a sheet of lead'. Despite the hail of rounds flying around him, Corporal Bruce didn't flinch or hang back for a moment. Instead, they kept their car right up on the tail of the fleeing van, remaining as close as was reasonably possible." One of the operations led to the death in action of their Special Air Service comrade Alistair Slater in a confrontation with several IRA volunteers from the Provisional IRA Derry Brigade, including Antoine Mac Giolla Bhrighde and Kieran Fleming (whose cousin William Fleming was killed in another SAS operation four days later), who were also killed in the incident which became known as the Kesh ambush (Slater being posthumously awarded the Military Medal).
According to The Guardian, Bruce was initially discharged from the SAS in early 1986 for "not being a team player" after a clash with their superiors. However, following their award of the Queen's Gallantry Medal in late 1986 Bruce was invited to re-join the Regiment and from 1987 to 1988 they were attached to the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment's 'G' Squadron, 24 (Air) Troop.
Later life
After leaving the British Army in 1988 with the rank of sergeant Bruce worked in a private security capacity for the comedian Jim Davidson, before taking the role of second in command of an undercover operation codenamed Project Lock; a WWF sponsored anti-poaching operation in Southern Africa (1988–1990) led by SAS Founder David Stirling and SAS Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Crooke. Operation Lock's primary purpose in Southern Africa was to track down dealers in rhino horn and ivory. Linked to this was identifying their methods for illegal export, pinning corruption against those in high places who colluded with the dealers, and helping with the training and equipping of anti-poaching teams for endangered species in general and rhino in particular.
Following Operation Lock, for two years Bruce worked in Washington, D.C. as bodyguard for Lebanese billionaire and former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Saad Hariri.
Bruce was an experienced pilot. They held South African, American and British pilot licences as well as a commercial pilot licence which enabled them to fly both single engine fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. In July 1992 they piloted their single engine Cessna 172 Skyhawk from Washington, D.C. across the Atlantic Ocean via Greenland and Iceland back to the UK.
In the early 1990s Bruce started the 'Skydive From Space' project, to skydive from the edge of space from 130,000 feet and break the highest altitude freefall record previously set by Joe Kittinger in the 1960s. They trained with Loel Guinness' High Adventure Company and Kittinger. The project was partially backed and funded by NASA. As a part of it Bruce, Harry Taylor and scientist and astronaut Karl Gordon Henize, with an ascent team, climbed the North Ridge Route of Mount Everest in late 1993 to test a NASA meter called a "tissue equivalent proportional counter" (TEPC) at different altitudes (17,000 ft, 19,000 ft and 21,000 ft), the device measuring the effects upon the human body of radiation at altitude, which would be factored in for consideration of space missions of a longer duration. The expedition was abandoned after the death of Karl Henize from high altitude pulmonary edema on 5 October 1993. Although the expedition was cut short, NASA received the information it had been sent out to acquire from the meter's readings logged during the ascent.
In February 1994 Bruce had a nervous breakdown whilst living in Chamonix, France, where they without warning suddenly attempted to murder their girlfriend with a pair of scissors, stabbing them several times before being dragged off them by another male that was present. They were confined shortly afterwards by the local authorities to a French psychiatric hospital. The completion of the 'Skydive from Space' project was abandoned in consequence, and they began receiving psychiatric medical treatment.
Bruce came to public prominence in 1998 when their memoir entitled Freefall was published by Little, Brown Book Group, under the pseudonym 'Tom Read', ghost written by Michael Robotham. The book detailed Bruce's military career, the 'Skydive From Space' project, the ascent of Mount Everest, and their subsequent descent into mental illness and psychological recovery. Freefall was described by Andy McNab, one of their comrades in the British Army, as "This is Bravo Two Zero meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Read's story had me on the edge of my seat – and it also made me cry". An updated paperback and kindle edition of Freefall was published on 5 August 2021.
Death
Despite periods of psychological recovery, after eight years of recurring mental illness, and being intermittently sectioned in mental hospitals, Bruce killed themselves on 8 January 2002 by deliberately jumping, without a parachute, out of a private Cessna 172 light aircraft in which they were a passenger during a flight over the South-East of England, plunging to their death. Their body was subsequently found on a football pitch at the village of Fyfield in Oxfordshire. They were 45 years old. Their military career and the manner of their death resulted in extensive media coverage of the incident. There has been conjecture that Bruce's psychological breakdown was attributable to posttraumatic stress disorder incurred from their military career.
A report in The Guardian in 2002 discussed "post-career anticlimax" and stated that "the problem of post-discharge mental collapse and suicide among former special soldiers is increasingly being recognised". Bruce's friend Mark Lucas was quoted as having made this comment:We shouldn't be surprised by what happens when men experience what these men have experienced ... They are trained to survive in a landscape in which the dividing line between life and death is extremely thin.
On 16 January 2002, Bruce was cremated at Banbury Crematorium in Oxfordshire; their ashes were subsequently scattered by their son and former colleagues during a memorial skydive in April 2002 over Northamptonshire from the Hinton Skydiving Centre. In December 2021, a memorial plaque in memory of Bruce was added to the Goose Green Memorial Bench within Aldershot Military Cemetery.
Quotations
"Nothing else comes close to those first few seconds after leaving the plane, because once you take that last step there is no going back. A racing driver or a skier or climber can pull over and stop, have a rest, but with parachuting, once you cross that threshold, you have to see it through."

Megalomyrmex reina is a Neotropical species of ants in the subfamily Myrmicinae. Described in 2010, this species is known only from queens from Costa Rica. The fact that it is known only from queens is reflected in the name (from Spanish, reina, meaning queen).
Both queens were collected in the same locality, in mature montane wet forest. The holotype queen was in a Winkler sample of sifted leaf litter. The paratype queen was collected as a forager on the ground. The foraging queen had rapid wasp-like behavior, with rapidly vibrating antennae. The lack of associated workers, in spite of abundant collecting (including many Winkler samples) at the type locality, raises the possibility that this species is a workerless social parasite. Alternatively, workers may be subterranean associates of attines and thus not accessible to standard collection techniques. The mandibular dentition of reina is highly distinctive and unlike any other Megalomyrmex species. In other species the dentition varies from a condition of few teeth that gradually decrease in size basally to one in which the two apical teeth are much larger than a series of diminished basal denticles. In contrast, M. reina has a single large apical tooth, which is long and sharp, followed by a relatively uniform series of smaller teeth. The size difference between the apical and subapical tooth is much greater than in other species. Many socially parasitic ant species have falcate mandibles associated with their ability to attack and subdue hosts. Perhaps the long apical tooth of M. reina is such an adaptation, strengthening the conjecture that it may be a social parasite.

Hudson Bay Regional Park is a regional park in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It is located on the south side of the town of Hudson Bay in the RM of Hudson Bay No. 394 along the shores of the Red Deer River. The park is the site of a North West Company fur trading fort called Fort Red Deer River that was built in 1790. About 14 kilometres downstream, near Erwood, was a Hudson's Bay Company trading post that was built in 1757.
Hudson Bay Regional Park is composed about 900 acres of land split up between the main park on the south side of the town of Hudson Bay and along the Red Deer River and three provincial recreation sites, Ruby Lake, Dagg Creek, and Greenbush River. The park is in the Porcupine Provincial Forest and at the edge of a pre-historic glacial lake called Lake Agassiz.
Hudson Bay park
The main part of the park is located at the junction of Fir, Red Deer, and Etomami Rivers and features camping, golfing, baseball diamonds, picnicking, hiking, fishing, and cross-country ski trails. The park also features Red Deer Downs, a natural amphitheatre known as "the Bowl", and a gun range.
The campground has over 40 sites for camping (some with electricity), washrooms, showers, potable water, and a sani-dump station.
The golf course, Hudson Bay Golf Club, is a 9-hole, grass green course. It was built in 1971 and is a par 35 with 2,617 yards.
Recreation sites
Besides the main Hudson Bay park area, there are three recreation sites that are part of the regional park. A fourth site at Saginas Lake became part of the Porcupine Hills Provincial Park in 2018.
Dagg Creek Recreation Site (52°38′30″N, 102°24′9″W) is located south of the town of Hudson Bay along Highway 9 and near the confluence of the Etomami and Pepaw Rivers. There is a small campground there and a picnic site.
Ruby Lake Recreation Site (52°57′36″N, 102°20′57″W), also known simply as Ruby Beach, is located on the eastern shore of Ruby Lake, 15 kilometres north of Hudson Bay, just off Highway 9 at the southern side of the Pasquia Hills. There is a picnic area, beach, boat launch, and small campground consisting of 9 campsites.
Greenbush River Recreation Site (52°50′57″N, 102°41′15″W) is located on Greenbush River along Highway 3, 26 kilometres west of Hudson Bay.
Fort Red Deer River
Fort Red Deer River or Fort Rivière la Biche was a North West Company trading post on the Red Deer River near the town of Hudson Bay. It was founded in 1794 by Hugh McGillis, and its date of closure is uncertain. Elizabeth Losey places it at the mouth of the Etomami River at the town ballpark where there is a provincial marker ( in the Hudson Bay Regional Park).
In 1774, Matthew Cocking described two trading posts on the Red Deer River. The Lower Settlement was located on a flat just upriver of Red Deer Lake, while the Upper Settlement was located 60 miles upriver of the lake. The Upper Settlement likely became Fort Red Deer River. Ruins from both settlements were found by Joseph Tyrrell in 1889.
The great explorer, SirAlexander Mackenzie, considered this fort to be one of the three chief trading posts of the Lake Manitoba district. The trading post sat at the approximate intersection of the Assiniboine tribes to the south, and the Swampy Cree tribes to the north.
Flora and fauna
With the park situated in and around the Porcupine and Pasquia Provincial Forests there are lots of wildlife viewing opportunities. There are over 350 species of birds, white tail deer, elk, moose, black bears, muskrats, woodland caribou, cougars, and beavers.
This region of Saskatchewan features 21 different species of orchids, 7 of which are endangered. The Ram's Head Lady Slipper is only found in 4 different locations in Saskatchewan and one of them is at Hudson Bay Regional Park.

The Crow: City of Angels is a 1997 action video game for Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. It is loosely based on the movie of the same title. The player assumes the role of the hero of the film, Ashe Corven. The game was developed by Gray Matter, whose previous game was Perfect Weapon, which The Crow: City of Angels closely resembles in its basic mechanics. It was met with negative reviews.
Gameplay
The gameplay style is similar to a traditional six-directional side-scrolling beat 'em up, viewed from an isometric perspective. All objects and characters are 3D polygonal models, imposed over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. The game is virtually identical across the three platforms it was released for, the main difference between them being that the PC version has sharper 2D-rendered backgrounds, due to its higher screen resolution.
The protagonist Ashe's primary method of fighting enemies is hand-to-hand combat, consisting of basic punches and kicks. They also have the ability to pull off more acrobatic moves using various button combinations. Along the way various weapons can be found, including knives, bottles, handguns and shotguns. In addition to their normal usage, all of the weapons can be thrown at enemies to cause damage. During the course of the game, Ashe encounters various bosses (the main villains from the film).
Plot
The game follows the same plot of the film on which it is based: mechanic Ashe Corven and their son Danny are brutally murdered by a gang. Resurrected by a crow and acquiring supernatural powers with the help of artist and new friend Sarah, Ashe now seeks vengeance on their murderers, including "the ninjitsu death-bitch" Kali and the drug king Judah.
Development
Acclaim originally planned for the game to be released early in the fourth quarter of 1996, in order to tie in with the August release of the film on which it is based.
All of the characters in the game were animated with Acclaim's motion capture technology. The game contains a tribute to Brandon Lee, if the player beats the game in under 50 minutes and presses the Triangle button on the credits screen, a crow will fly towards the screen then morph into a picture of Brandon.
Reception
The Crow: City of Angels was almost universally panned upon its release. The PlayStation version has a GameRankings score of 23.5% based on four reviews. Critics widely praised the 3D rendered backgrounds, agreeing that they were both technologically cutting edge and lent a moody, haunting atmosphere to the game. However, esteem for the visuals was outweighed by criticism of the controls, which reviewers found suffered from delayed responsiveness and made it difficult to make the player character face the desired direction. Most found that the frequent changing of the fixed camera angles and poor collision detection added to the confusion and frustration of the basic gameplay. Some critics additionally felt that the beat 'em up genre as a whole was too limited by the standards of the current gaming generation. Jeff Kitts from GameSpot explained, "There are no objectives, tasks, or missions to complete - just walk around and punch bad guys. Big fun (note the sarcasm)."
The voice clips, though regarded as a lesser issue, were generally ridiculed as featuring weak dialogue, mediocre acting, poor quality production, and a limited selection of clips (which leads to multiple enemies repeating the same lines). Colin Williamson commented in PC Gamer US that the clips "sound like they were recorded by programmers screaming into a five-dollar Radio Shack microphone".
According to Scary Larry of GamePro, "This dark, moody game may appeal to certain Gen Xers looking for a slow-paced violent game. The rest of us, however, are going to be turned off by the awkward, choppy movements of the sprites, asinine gameplay, and horrible graphics." Sega Saturn Magazines Lee Nutter said it was "Not a bad effort of a game by Acclaim's usual standards but certainly not a wise purchase." Williamson called it "the worst movie license fighting game since Expect No Mercy." A Game Revolution reviewer went on to say: "The Crow: City of Angels is one of the worst titles I've ever seen. Avoid all contact with this game." IGN rated the game 1.0 out of 10, their lowest possible score. A Next Generation critic said the game's problems were so great that it seemed nowhere near the end of its development cycle.
Electronic Gaming Monthly named The Crow: City of Angels both Worst Movie to Game and Worst Intro in their 1998 Video Game Buyer's Guide. They acknowledged that the opening cinematic had some cool graphic effects, but said the unintentionally humorous dialogue, poor lip-synching, and awkward, over-exaggerated animation were enough to merit the "worst" title. It was included among the 100 worst games of all time by GamesRadar in 2014.

The 1988 Miller High Life 400 was a NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing event that took place on September 11, 1988, at Richmond Fairgrounds Raceway (now Richmond Raceway) in the American community of Richmond, Virginia. This race spanned on Richmond Fairgrounds Raceway's new 0.75 mile configuration.
Background
In 1953, Richmond International Raceway began hosting the Grand National Series with Lee Petty winning that first race in Richmond. The original track was paved in 1968. In 1988, the track was re-designed into its present D-shaped configuration
The name for the raceway complex was "Strawberry Hill" until the Virginia State Fairgrounds site was bought out in 1999 and renamed the "Richmond International Raceway".
Qualifying
Davey Allison blistered the field in qualifying, lapping the track with an average of 122.850 miles per hour. Davey's lap was overshadowed by another story. That story was tires! The 1988 season had seen a war between the Hoosier Tire Company and Goodyear develop, and with a new track and surface, several teams elected to change tire brands. Due to NASCAR
rules at the time, those drivers that did switch tires were sent to the back and had there qualifying spot adjusted as well.
With the qualifying order reset the top-10 comprised:
There were at least 45 teams that entered the race, meaning that 9 drivers had to go home.
Qualifying information
Butch Miller gave owner Bob Clark their best ever starting position with the fifth place start. Clark was able to get a second car in the field, a year old Oldsmobile, with dirt track ace Lee Faulk at the wheel. Faulk was making their first ever start in the series. Bob Schacht qualified for the race eventually settling into the 18th spot, with a red #66 Buick. This would be the first (and only) start in NASCAR for Schachts owner Tom Reet.
Race
Allison immediately got a jump on the field as the race almost immediately turned chaotic. Coming into turn 2 Lake Speed and Richard Petty collided. The wrecking didn't stop there, as down the front-stretch coming to yellow, Geoff Bodine ran over the back of Rusty Wallace. Wallace, who had been a major points contender at that point could only run 17 additional laps before parking it with damage. Petty then hit the wall a second time bring out to bring out the second caution, this time the damage was terminal. Rick Wilson had a great run come to a screeching halt, as their Kodak Oldsmobile blew the engine less the 10% of the way in. Harry Gant was the next victim of the track when their car caught on fire, after a grinding crash that had also collected Jimmy Means, Ernie Irvan and Eddie Bierschwale. Mike Alexander, Butch Miller, and Dale Earnhardt took the turns with the lead, after a Hoosier shod Allison, switched to Goodyear tires under the first caution. But after caution four came out (due to another Lake Speed accident) Allison was able to catch up and soon overpowered Earnhardt. From there on, it was easy sailing for Davey as they took victory

Kesgrave Hall is a country house located in woodlands north of the town of Kesgrave, which itself is on the eastern outskirts of Ipswich, in Suffolk, England. It was constructed in 1812 by William Cunliffe-Shawe, and has been extended since, notably by the addition of a northern extension. The building has five large rooms downstairs, with another two in the northern extension, with a further seven upstairs.
The building is set in of grounds, which includes woodlands, marsh and fields; a stream, which rises on Playford Heath, north of Kesgrave village, and joins the River Fynn, itself a tributary of the Deben, at Martlesham, runs west to east through the grounds.
The Hall has had several uses during its life, including housing five different boarding schools. Since late April 2008, the building has been used as a restaurant and hotel and owned as a joint venture by the Hills Building Group and the Milsom Hotel Group.
Kesgrave Hall until 1939
Kesgrave Hall was built in 1812 by William Cunliffe Shawe who had been a Member of Parliament for Preston in Lancaster from 1792 to 1796. They were also a wealthy landowner who acquired estates in Lancaster, Middlesex and Suffolk. It appears that they did not live in the Hall but instead gave it to their son Robert Newton Shawe who took up residence soon after theirs marriage.
Robert Newton Shawe was born in 1784 in Enfield in Middlesex. In 1811 they married Frances Ann Jones who was the daughter of Thomas Jones, a lawyer and landowner in Stapleton in Gloucestershire.
As owner of the Kesgrave Estate Robert became active in community life and they built and supported the Kesgrave District School from 1840 which was considered to be a very generous contribution at this time. They were also the local magistrate and between 1832 and 1836 was the Member of Parliament for East Suffolk.
The couple had no children and when Robert died in 1855 their wife Frances Ann sold the property to Colonel George Tomline of Orwell Park who was a very wealthy landowner and MP. Tomline did not buy the Kesgrave Estate as a residence instead they wanted the land for agricultural use. They therefore let Kesgrave Hall to Francis Aldous Kent who was a schoolmaster. Kent established the Kesgrave Hall School which operated from about 1870 to 1900. An advertisement for the school which appeared in a newspaper of 1871 is shown.
Colonel George Tomline died in 1889 and, as they had no children, their cousin Captain Ernest George Pretyman inherited Kesgrave Hall. They did not live there but continued to let it to the Kent family as a school until about 1900 and then in about 1905 they sold it to Philip Wyndham Cobbold.
Philip Wyndham Cobbold was born in 1875 in Ipswich. Their family owned the brewing company Cobbold and Co. and Philip joined the family business. In 1902 they married Cecily Augusta Nevill. Philip became the Mayor of Ipswich in 1910-11 and a photo of them at this time is shown. The photo of Kesgrave Hall in 1907 shown is taken at the time the Cobbold family was in residence there.
In the 1920s and 1930s the Hall was occupied by Colonel Christopher Chevallier Barnes. They were born in 1873 in India and had served in the Boer War where they had been severely wounded and later joined the Royal Field Artillery. In 1905 they married Mary Elizabeth Robinson of Durham. They lived in Kesgrave Hall after their retirement until about 1937.
Second World War (1939-1945)
During the war the Hall was used by the RAF, and by the pilots of the USAF 359th Fighter Squadron, part of the 356th Fighter Group, who were involved in aerial operations over France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Central Europe out of the nearby RAF Martlesham Heath.
St. Edmund's School (1946-1975)
The third school to use the Hall was St. Edmund's School, a boys' preparatory boarding school. This school was founded in 1936 in a large house on the corner of St. Edmunds Road and Henley Road (No.57) in Ipswich, hence the name, but was evacuated to Dursley during World War II. In 1944 the school returned to Ipswich and moved to Kesgrave Hall in 1946 after outgrowing its original premises. The school was founded by the Marshall family. Kenneth Marshall, the founding principal, died in 1938 and the school was under a principal by the name of Maurice McClintock in the 1940s/50s. The school was taken over by the Mills family in 1958 and took on many improvements, including its own swimming pool (now filled in) and the draining and levelling of the marsh at the front of the main building for playing fields. Major John Mills was principal until the school closed in 1975.
Kesgrave Hall School (1976 - 1993)
The fourth school at the Hall, known as Kesgrave Hall School opened in 1976. This was also a boys' boarding school and was founded by teachers from a boys' junior boarding school, Heanton in Devon. The teachers found that boys from that school were ill-served by their secondary schools.
As with Heanton, Kesgrave Hall School was established for boys with a strong academic ability but with perceived emotional or behavioural problems. It had a strong academic focus, but also taught vocational subjects such as woodwork.
The school closed in 1993, at a time when a number of similar establishments in the UK were closing.
Shawe Manor (1993)
Immediately after Kesgrave Hall School closed a new school opened; the fifth school based at the Hall was run by different owners, they purchased the fixtures and fittings from the old school and continued to lease the building from the founder of Kesgrave Hall School.
The principal, most of the staff and most of the pupils from Kesgrave Hall School transferred to the new school. According to one ex-pupil of both schools, Shawe Manor was run along the same lines as its predecessor. The school remained open less than a year before itself closed.
It is sometimes mistakenly asserted that the school was known as Grange Farm (principal John Williams even said, at the summer prize-giving in 1993, that they had received mail so addressed, and the error is repeated on some websites), but this is in fact the name of a nearby housing development, built on the land of the same name.
KDM (1995-2004)
In 1995, the timber trading company KDM moved into the building. According to their website, they converted the dining hall into "the first hi-tech timber trading room of its kind in the UK". KDM also developed an internet business, COUNTYWeb, which it sold in 2003, and also launched BT Global WoodTrader, a joint venture with BT, to trade timber over the Internet. KDM moved out of the building in 2004 into a purpose-built building at Ransomes Europark, on the southern outskirts of Ipswich.
Ryes School (2004-2007)
After KDM left, the Ryes School organisation moved into the building. The Ryes are a special residential school for children with behavioural problems and other complex needs, based near Sudbury, Suffolk. Kesgrave Hall was used to house senior pupils. However, in 2007, local educational authorities decided that the site was too big and obliged the school to move the youths to smaller premises. As of 2 October 2007, a plan to house them in Pettaugh, near Stowmarket, was the subject of objections from locals who feared that they would have nothing to do outside school times.
Milsoms Restaurant and Hotel (2007-present)
Hills Building Group and the Milsom Hotel Group bought the building in autumn 2007, and the East Anglian Daily Times reported on 16 October 2007 that Milsom was investing 4 million GBP in a new "restaurant with rooms" called Milsoms at Kesgrave Hall, along similar lines to the milsoms establishment in Dedham, Essex. Among the favourable conditions was the location between Ipswich and the picturesque riverside town of Woodbridge, Suffolk.
On 28 November 2007, the East Anglian Daily Times reported that Milsom's had received planning permission from Suffolk Coastal District Council for their change of use and for their alterations. The new restaurant and hotel, 'Milsoms at Kesgrave Hall', opened in April 2008. In the first phase of works the hotel had 15 rooms, sports hall and a 100-seater restaurant. The second stage included the construction of eight extra rooms, both in the main Hall and in the outbuildings, and two further meeting rooms and they were opened in July 2009.
Kesgrave Hall has recently completed the redevelopment of the events venue called the Hangar which is able to accommodate up to 300 people for weddings and special events. The venue is also licensed by Suffolk County Council to provide Civil ceremonies.

Matthew Katz (born 1929) is an American music manager and producer, most notably as the former manager of Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape and It's a Beautiful Day.  They are widely recognized as the founder of 1960s San Francisco psychedelic music scene, and is the owner of record label, San Francisco Sound and the owner of Matthew Katz Productions.
Career
Katz commenced their career in music in the 1960s, as the manager of three San Francisco-based bands, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape and It's A Beautiful Day.  They are known for controversial practices that were criticized for not being in the best interest of the artists they managed. In October 1966, when CBS Records offered a contract to Moby Grape, Katz coerced the band into giving up ownership of their name and all of their publishing rights or else they would block them from signing with the label. Moby Grape fired Katz in late 1967. Their acrimonious relationship with the band would continue to deteriorate for decades as Katz continued to collect all of their royalties for himself. In 2005, the Superior Court Of California decreed that all ownership rights relating to recordings and songs prior to 1973 are the sole property of Moby Grape. It also stipulated that Katz was to pay back royalties, and that the band members now owned the Moby Grape name. Katz appealed, but the Court Of Appeal upheld the original verdict in 2006. When Sundazed Music tried to bring the band's catalog back into print, Katz threatened them with litigation over ownership of the album artwork. The band's work remained out-of-print as of 2007 largely due to their efforts.
In addition to the long-standing legal issues with Moby Grape, lawsuits between Katz and Jefferson Airplane were in the courts for 21 years. To this day, Katz is known in the rock music world as one of the most anti-musician agents who ever worked in the industry.
Katz is also the owner of San Francisco Sound Records, which has released original or licensed material by Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape, It's a Beautiful Day and Tim Hardin, among others. The company released Tim's Unforgiven in 1981, their last recordings.
Other groups that Katz worked with include Tripsichord Music Box and a group from Seattle originally named West Coast Natural Gas, which Katz renamed Indian Puddin' and Pipe.
Katz opened two different music showcases named San Francisco Sound. The Seattle location was in a building on Capitol Hill originally named The Encore Ballroom and operated between 1967 and 1969. The other location was in Tottenville, Staten Island, in New York City.

In probability theory and statistics, the split normal distribution also known as the two-piece normal distribution results from joining at the mode the corresponding halves of two normal distributions with the same mode but different variances. It is claimed by Johnson et al. that this distribution was introduced by Gibbons and Mylroie and by John. But these are two of several independent rediscoveries of the Zweiseitige Gauss'sche Gesetz introduced in the posthumously published Kollektivmasslehre (1897) of Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887), see Wallis (2014). Surprisingly, another rediscovery has appeared more recently in a finance journal.
Definition
The split normal distribution arises from merging two opposite halves of two probability density functions (PDFs) of normal distributions in their common mode.
The PDF of the split normal distribution is given by
where
Discussion
The split normal distribution results from merging two halves of normal distributions. In a general case the 'parent' normal distributions can have different variances which implies that the joined PDF would not be continuous. To ensure that the resulting PDF integrates to 1, the normalizing constant A is used.
In a special case when the split normal distribution reduces to normal distribution with variance .
When σ2≠σ1 the constant A is different from the constant of normal distribution. However, when the constants are equal.
The sign of its third central moment is determined by the difference (σ2-σ1). If this difference is positive, the distribution is skewed to the right and if negative, then it is skewed to the left.
Other properties of the split normal density were discussed by Johnson et al. and Julio.
Alternative formulations
The formulation discussed above originates from John. The literature offers two mathematically equivalent alternative parameterizations . Britton, Fisher and Whitley offer a parameterization if terms of mode, dispersion and normed skewness, denoted with . The parameter μ is the mode and has equivalent to the mode in John's formulation. The parameter σ 2>0 informs about the dispersion (scale) and should not be confused with variance. The third parameter, γ ∈ (-1,1), is the normalized skew.
The second alternative parameterization is used in the Bank of England's communication and is written in terms of mode, dispersion and unnormed skewness and is denoted with . In this formulation the parameter μ is the mode and is identical as in John's and Britton, Fisher and Whitley's formulation. The parameter σ 2 informs about the dispersion (scale) and is the same as in the Britton, Fisher and Whitley's formulation. The parameter ξ equals the difference between the distribution's mean and mode and can be viewed as unnormed measure of skewness.
The three parameterizations are mathematically equivalent, meaning that there is a strict relationship between the parameters and that it is possible to go from one parameterization to another. The following relationships hold:
Multivariate Extensions
The multivariate generalization of the split normal distribution was proposed by Villani and Larsson. They assume that each of the principal components has univariate split normal distribution with a different set of parameters μ, σ2 and σ1.
Estimation of parameters
John proposes to estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood method. They show that the likelihood function can be expressed in an intensive form, in which the scale parameters σ1 and σ2 are a function of the location parameter μ. The likelihood in its intensive form is:
and has to be maximized numerically with respect to a single parameter μ only.
Given the maximum likelihood estimator the other parameters take values:
where N is the number of observations.
Villani and Larsson propose to use either maximum likelihood method or bayesian estimation and provide some analytical results for either univariate and multivariate case.
Applications
The split normal distribution has been used mainly in econometrics and time series. A remarkable area of application is the construction of the fan chart, a representation of the inflation forecast distribution reported by inflation targeting central banks around the globe.

Sarangbang (사랑방, 舍廊房) is a room located in a Korean traditional house (hanok) which served as a man's room, used for studying, writing poetry, and leisure activities. The Koreans created the sarangbang strictly following the Confucianism principles of the Joseon Dynasty. In lower-class homes, the sarangbang is located across from the women's space (anbang), separated with a hall called a daecheong. One of the characteristics of the sarangbang is that it usually has a separate study called a sarangchae. The sarangchae is forbidden to women and only men can enter it.

Kevin Joseph Kent (born 19 March 1965) is an English former professional football player and coach.
Starting their career as a winger at West Bromwich Albion in 1983, they began playing regular football with Newport County the following year. They then made their name playing for Mansfield Town over a six-year period from 1985 to 1991. They then transferred to Port Vale, where they finished their career following a five-year spell. Over a thirteen-year professional career they played 454 games, scoring 57 goals (claiming 45 goals in 379 appearances in the Football League). They won the Football League Trophy both with Mansfield (1987) and Port Vale (1993), and helped the "Stags" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division (1985–86) and the "Valiants" to win promotion out of the Second Division (1993–94).
Playing career
Kent began their career at West Bromwich Albion, and made two First Division appearances under Ron Wylie and Johnny Giles in the 1983–84 campaign. They then left The Hawthorns and signed for Newport County of the Third Division. They played 33 league games for Colin Addison's "Exiles" in 1984–85, before leaving Rodney Parade to join Mansfield Town. They helped Ian Greaves's side to win promotion out of the Fourth Division with a third-place finish in 1985–86. In 1986–87 they scored ten goals in 57 games, and wrote their name in the club's history books on 24 May 1987, when they became the first (and to date, the only) player in Mansfield's history to score at Wembley when the "Stags" won the Football League Trophy after beating Bristol City on penalties following a 1–1 draw (he also successfully converted their penalty). They scored fifteen goals in 58 games in the 1987–88 campaign. Mansfield posted a 15th-place finish in 1988–89, before new boss George Foster led the club to another 15th-place finish in 1989–90. They were demoted back into the basement division after a last place finish in 1990–91. In total, Kent played 276 first-team games and scored 47 goals in their six seasons at Field Mill.
In March 1991, Kent joined Port Vale in exchange for Gary Ford and £80,000. They featured in 11 Second Division games at the end of the 1990–91 season, but featured just 25 times in the 1991–92 campaign, as the "Valiants" suffered relegation with a last place finish. They played 28 Third Division (renamed the Second Division due to the creation of the Premier League) games in the 1992–93 season; they did though play 40 games in total throughout the campaign, as they helped the Vale to win the TNT Tournament, the Football League Trophy, and to reach the play-off final. They beat Stockport County in the Football League Trophy Final, but lost 3–0 to West Bromwich Albion in the play-off final. Manager John Rudge ensured their side made up for their failure to win the play-offs by leading them to promotion as the division's runners-up in 1993–94. However, injuries soon brought Kent's career to a halt; they fractured their hand in October 1994 and their kneecap the following February and was hospitalised in May 1995 with a back injury; this final injury brought about their early retirement at the end of the 1995–96 season. On their retirement they became a coaching assistant at Vale Park.
Coaching career
Whilst at their final club, Port Vale, Kent began working as a coach at the club's Centre of Excellence from 1993 to 1996 and 2004 to 2006 under Mark Grew, Brian Horton and Martin Foyle. Before this they gained experience at Mansfield Town's Centre of Excellence under Ian Greaves. From 2005 to 2007 they worked at Stoke City's academy, before beginning a short coaching stint at Manchester United after obtaining their UEFA A Licence. Between 2009 and 2011 they worked as the Indonesian Football Association's National Academy Director. They also worked as a manager at Barclays Bank Sports Facilities and Events department between 1997 and 2009.

Conor Brady is an Irish journalist, novelist and academic. They were the editor of The Irish Times between 1986 and 2002.
Early life
Brady was born in Dublin and spent their early childhood in Tullamore in County Offaly, Ireland. They received their primary education at St. Columba's Christian Brothers College, in Tullamore; their secondary education was at the Cistercian College, Roscrea in County Tipperary. At University College Dublin (UCD) they took primary and postgraduate degrees in history and politics. While at UCD they also edited Campus UCD News, one of the college's two newspapers.
Press career
They were the editor of the Sunday Tribune and worked both on radio and television with RTE before assuming the Editorship of the prestigious The Irish Times in 1986.
The fact that they were the first Catholic to be appointed as editor of what was still perceived as a Protestant-oriented newspaper was remarked upon at the time and was seen as part of a process of The Irish Times seeking to broaden its position in Irish society. They were also the first editor to be appointed at the newspaper after a competitive interview process with the participation of staff representatives.
Previously they had been Features Editor, then Night Editor and latterly Deputy Editor. They reported on crime and security and covered events in Northern Ireland before being assigned to the London bureau in the 1970s. Later they worked on the newspaper's European Desk and on a number of assignments abroad, including the accession of new member states to the European Economic Community. They reported on the conflict in Rhodesia, later Zimbabwe. They were appointed as a director of The Irish Times Ltd in 1985.
Brady was judged to be an excellent editor who increased the newspapers circulation figures to their highest levels over two decades. They positioned the newspaper firmly behind the Northern Ireland peace process while strongly supporting the liberal reform agenda in the Republic.
They focused on developing coverage of foreign news with the establishment of overseas bureaux in Moscow, Beijing, South Africa and elsewhere. They also extended the coverage of arts and books as well as finance and sport. The Irish Times launched its first digital editions during their tenure. They were chair of the World Editors Forum (Paris) 1996–2000 and chair of the Advisory Committee to the European Journalism Centre (Maastricht) 1996–1999.
They retired from The Irish Times in 2002, after implementing an editorial restructuring of the organisation, necessitated by an accumulation of high costs and a fall in advertising revenues. Editorial numbers dropped by more than 100 as journalists opted for redundancy terms. There was some staff members criticism of the parting package agreed between Brady and the company, with some claims that it was over-generous at a time of financial challenge for the organisation. However, The Irish Times subsequently went into a lengthy period of marked financial success, with reduced costs, strong revenues and free of debt. They published their autobiography, entitled Up with The Times, in 2005.
Between 2014 and 2019 they wrote a weekly column for the Irish edition of The Sunday Times.
Academia
Brady was a Visiting Professor at John Jay College, City University of New York; Senior Teaching Fellow at Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business, and University College Dublin. In 2020 they were appointed as Honorary Professor in the journalism school of the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG).
Civic service
Brady was a member of the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission from 2005 to 2011. They were chair (2003–2008) of The British-Irish Association. They served as a member of the Remembrance Commission, set up under the Good Friday Agreement. In May 2017 they were appointed to be a member of a new commission on the future of policing in Ireland but they resigned in October, citing lack of resources and political commitment. In November 2019 they were appointed by government as chair of the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) which selects leadership for senior public service positions.
They have been a non-executive director of ARC Cancer Support and they have been a director of the Institute of International and European Affairs.  They are vice chair of Midlands Radio 103 and co-founder of CaliberAI, a defamation and harm speech technology solutions startup.
Writer
Brady has several published books on a range of subjects, from histories of the Irish police force to personal memoirs of their journalistic career.
They also series of crime fiction novels featuring the character of "Detective Sergeant Joe Swallow", under the titles A June of Ordinary Murders, The Eloquence of the Dead,” “A Hunt in Winter” and “In the Dark River.”

The yellow-throated whistler (Pachycephala macrorhyncha) or Banda Sea whistler, is a species of bird in the family Pachycephalidae. It is endemic to central and south-eastern Wallacea, where it ranges from Timor east to the Tanimbars and north to Seram and Banggai (roughly equalling the islands in or adjacent to the Banda Sea). The oriole whistler is sometimes alternatively called the yellow-throated whistler, leading to confusion between both species.
Taxonomy and systematics
The Yellow-throated whistler was originally described in the genus Myiolestes (a synonym for Colluricincla). The yellow-throated whistler is variably considered as either a subspecies of the Australian golden whistler or treated as a separate species, but strong published evidence in favour of either treatment is limited, and further study is warranted to resolve the complex taxonomic situation.
Subspecies
The Baliem whistler, a former subspecies of the yellow-throated whistler, was re-classified as a separate species by the IOC in 2016. Currently, ten subspecies are recognized:
P. m. calliope – Bonaparte, 1850: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Wetar, Timor and Semau (eastern Lesser Sundas)
P. m. sharpei – Meyer, AB, 1884: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Babar Islands (eastern Lesser Sundas)
P. m. dammeriana – Hartert, 1900: Found on Damar Island (eastern Lesser Sundas)
P. m. par – Hartert, 1904: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Roma Island (eastern Lesser Sundas)
P. m. compar – Hartert, 1904: Found on the islands of Leti and Moa (eastern Lesser Sundas)
P. m. fuscoflava – Sclater, PL, 1883: Originally described as a separate species. Found on the Tanimbar Islands
P. m. macrorhyncha – Strickland, 1849: Found on Ambon and Seram Islands (southern Moluccas)
P. m. buruensis – Hartert, 1899: Found on Buru Island (southern Moluccas)
P. m. clio – Wallace, 1863: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Sula Islands (northern Moluccas)
P. m. pelengensis – Neumann, 1941: Found on Banggai Island (east of Sulawesi)
Description
Among the members of the golden whistler group, the yellow-throated whistler is bordered to the north by the black-chinned whistler, to the west by the rusty-breasted whistler, and to the south by the Australian golden whistler. The only subspecies of the yellow-throated whistler where the male is yellow-throated is fuscoflava from the Tanimbar Islands. Males of other subspecies are white-throated, except par (Romang Island) and compar (Leti Islands) where the plumages of the males are female-like.

Albury is a village in the civil parish of Tiddington-with-Albury, about west of Thame in Oxfordshire.
Manor
Its toponym is derived from the Old English Aldeberie, meaning "old fortified place", suggesting that the village's origins are Saxon.
After the Norman Conquest of England William the Conqueror granted the manor of Albury to William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford. When the 1st Earl was killed in battle in Flanders in 1071 their estates in England and Wales passed to their son Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford. In 1075 the 2nd Earl rebelled against William I, who suppressed the rebellion and confiscated the Earl's estates. It is not clear to whom the king granted Albury, or who held it until early in the 13th century when it belonged to William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon. It remained in their family until 1293, when their granddaughter Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon died. Them estates were divided, and Albury passed to Warin de Lisle. It remained with de Lisle's heirs until 1368, when Robert de Lisle, 3rd Baron Lisle surrendered many manors including Albury to Richard II. Thereafter Albury had no feudal overlord.
Parish church
Albury had a parish church by the beginning of the 13th century. It had a small nave and chancel, two Norman doorways and a 14th-century Decorated Gothic east window. The church's dedicatee was Saint Helen. In 1828 the church was demolished and in 1830 a new St. Helen's was completed, designed by the Gothic Revival architect Thomas Rickman. The only feature that Rickman retained from the old church was the 12th-century font. The architect A. Mardon Mowbray restored the building in 1891. By 1552 the old St. Helen's belfry had two bells. The new St. Helen's also has two, but these were cast in 1686 and the 18th century.
Economic history
The parish was originally farmed in an open field system. Albury's common lands were enclosed in stages, and the process was complete by the 17th century. The Wycombe Railway extension from to was completed and opened in 1864. A station was opened in the parish at Tiddington about west of Albury. British Railways closed the line and Tiddington railway station in 1963.

Saint Roderick (; ; died 13 March 857) was a Mozarab Catholic priest, venerated as one of the Martyrs of Córdoba. Tradition states that they were a Christian priest of Cabra who had two brothers: one was a Muslim, the other irreligious. Once, after their brothers began to fight one another, Roderick attempted to break up the fight. However, they turned on them instead and beat him.
When Roderick awoke, they found that their Muslim brother had reported to the authorities that Roderick had converted to Islam. When Roderick maintained their loyalty to the Catholic religion, they were accused of apostasy from Islam under Sharia law. They were imprisoned and then beheaded along with Salomon (Solomon) at Córdoba.
St. Roderick's Convent and Hospital in Cabra, established in the 16th century, bears their name.

Oneidge Walrond (born in Guyana) is a Guyanese politician.  They are the current Minister of Tourism, Industry, and Commerce in Guyana. Walrond was appointed Minister by President Irfaan Ali on August 5, 2020.
Concerns over Appointment
Several ministers and government officials raised cases that the appointment of Walrond was in fact "Unconstitutional". Walrond was again sworn-in on December 1 as Minister. They had first taken the oath of office as Minister on August 5 and then oath as an MP on September 1st. According to reports, the appointments "transgressed" the law as they were still a Dual Citizen. The APNU+AFC opposition filed a lawsuit at the High Court that Walrond declare that they had been illegally sworn-in.
Walrond claimed that they had renounced their US citizenship since August 27, but records showed that they were still having a dual-citizenship as at the time they were sworn in as MP. On December 24, Walrond took a fresh oath of office.

The Arthurs Lake is a human-made reservoir located in the Central Highlands region of Tasmania, Australia. The lake was created in the 1920s by the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania damming the Upper Lake River, Blue Lake and Sand Lake as well as the Morass Marsh. The principal purpose of the lake is to support the generation of hydroelectricity.
Location and features
It is located in the Central Highlands, north of Lyell Highway, east of Great Lake. Water is pumped from Arthurs Lake to Great Lake, which feeds the Poatina Power Station. Some of the pumping energy is recovered by Tods Corner Power Station.
In 2017, Irrigation Tasmania installed a floating safety barrier to prevent fishing boats accessing the hydro intake pipe in this very popular fishing lake.

Sir Paul Terence Callaghan ( ; 19 August 1947 – 24 March 2012) was a New Zealand physicist who, as the founding director of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at Victoria University of Wellington, held the position of Alan MacDiarmid Professor of Physical Sciences and was President of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance.
Biography
Callaghan was born on 19 August 1947, the son of Mavis and Ernest Callaghan. They had an older brother Jim, older sister Jeanine, and younger sister Mary. Their maternal grandparents were Agnes and Francis Hogg.
A native of Whanganui, Callaghan attended Wanganui Technical College (now Wanganui City College). They took their first degree in physics at Victoria University of Wellington and subsequently earned a DPhil degree at the University of Oxford, working in low temperature physics. On their return to New Zealand in 1974, they took up a lecturing position at Massey University, where they began researching the applications of magnetic resonance to the study of soft matter. They were made Professor of Physics in 1984, and was appointed Alan MacDiarmid Professor of Physical Sciences in 2001. The following year, as its founding director, they helped establish the multi-university MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology.
Callaghan was President of the Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand (RSNZ), and published over 240 articles in scientific journals, as well as the books Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy in 1994 and Translational Dynamics and Magnetic Resonance in 2011. They were a founding director and shareholder of Magritek, a technology company based in Wellington that sells nuclear magnetic resonance and MRI instruments. They were a regular public speaker on science matters and, in 2007, one of their radio series, of discussions with Kim Hill on Radio New Zealand appeared in book form as As Far as We Know: Conversations about Science, Life and the Universe. A 2009 book, Wool to Weta: Transforming New Zealand's Culture and Economy, dealt with the potential for science and technology entrepreneurialism to diversify New Zealand's economy. They were the presenter of a concurrent documentary, Beyond the Farm and the Themepark, which deals with the same issues.
In 2001 Callaghan became the 36th New Zealander to be made a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. They were awarded the Ampere Prize in 2004 and the RSNZ's Rutherford Medal in 2005. They were appointed a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2006 New Year Honours, and in 2007 was recognised with a World Class New Zealander Award and the Sir Peter Blake Medal. They were awarded a two-year James Cook Research Fellowship by the Royal Society of New Zealand in 2008. In 2009, they accepted re-designation as a Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit following the reinstatement of titular honours by the New Zealand government.
In 2010 they were awarded the Günther Laukien Prize for Magnetic Resonance and shared the New Zealand Prime Minister's Science Prize. In 2011 they were named Kiwibank's New Zealander of the Year and later that year elected an Honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.
Callaghan died on 24 March 2012, aged 64, after a long battle with colon cancer. They were survived by their first wife, Sue Roberts, two children, Catherine and Chris, and their second wife Miang Lim. After their death, Callaghan was again recognised with a World Class New Zealand award, becoming the Supreme winner in May 2012.
The New Zealand Crown entity, Callaghan Innovation, formed in February 2013, was named after him.
They were an atheist.
Areas of contribution
Callaghan was an author of over 230 journal articles. Their research group specialised in developing NMR methodologies for the study of molecular dynamics and molecular organisation in complex fluids, soft matter and porous materials. Major areas of contribution include:
Rheo-NMR (rheology of fluids studied by nuclear magnetic resonance)
Diffusion of molecules in porous media (for example, studying the microscopic structure of sea ice).
Development of NMR techniques that use the earth's magnetic field.

Rosa willmottiae, Miss Willmott's rose or Willmott's rose, is a species in the genus Rosa in the plant family Rosaceae. It grows at an altitude of in dry valleys in western Sichuan, China. It forms an arching deciduous shrub high, and as much across. The branches are covered in many straight prickles. The pinnate leaves typically have 7 to 9 small bluish-green leaflets which emit a pleasant fragrance when bruised. It was introduced to western cultivation by Ernest Wilson in 1904 and was named after the collector and horticulturist Ellen Willmott. The flowers are small (), lilac-pink, and are borne on short laterals all along the length of the branches in late spring/early summer. The hips are small, becoming orange-red and losing their tips when ripe.
Charles & Bridget Quest-Ritson describe Rosa willmottiae as "one of the few wild roses that merits a place in a mixed border or even as a specimen shrub" and that when in flower it is "the embodiment of beauty".

Time-series segmentation is a method of time-series analysis in which an input time-series is divided into a sequence of discrete segments in order to reveal the underlying properties of its source. A typical application of time-series segmentation is in speaker diarization, in which an audio signal is partitioned into several pieces according to who is speaking at what times. Algorithms based on change-point detection include sliding windows, bottom-up, and top-down methods. Probabilistic methods based on hidden Markov models have also proved useful in solving this problem.
Overview of the segmentation problem
It is often the case that a time-series can be represented as a sequence of discrete segments of finite length. For example, the trajectory of a stock market could be partitioned into regions that lie in between important world events, the input to a handwriting recognition application could be segmented into the various words or letters that it was believed to consist of, or the audio recording of a conference could be divided according to who was speaking when. In the latter two cases, one may take advantage of the fact that the label assignments of individual segments may repeat themselves (for example, if a person speaks at several separate occasions during a conference) by attempting to cluster the segments according to their distinguishing properties (such as the spectral content of each speaker's voice). There are two general approaches to this problem. The first involves looking for change points in the time-series: for example, one may assign a segment boundary whenever there is a large jump in the average value of the signal. The second approach involves assuming that each segment in the time-series is generated by a system with distinct parameters, and then inferring the most probable segment locations and the system parameters that describe them. While the first approach tends to only look for changes in a short window of time, the second approach generally takes into account the entire time-series when deciding which label to assign to a given point.
Segmentation algorithms
Hidden Markov Models
Under the hidden Markov model, the time-series is assumed to have been generated as the system transitions among a set of discrete, hidden states . At each time , a sample is drawn from an observation (or emission) distribution indexed by the current hidden state, i.e., . The goal of the segmentation problem is to infer the hidden state at each time, as well as the parameters describing the emission distribution associated with each hidden state. Hidden state sequence and emission distribution parameters can be learned to use the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is a variant of expectation maximization applied to HMMs. Typically in the segmentation problem self-transition probabilities among states are assumed to be high, such that the system remains in each state for nonnegligible time. More robust parameter-learning methods involve placing hierarchical Dirichlet process priors over the HMM transition matrix.

Odds are a Canadian alternative rock band based in Vancouver, British Columbia. They perform music with a power pop style. They were nominated for six Juno Awards in the 1990s. As of 2014, they are on their fifth record label.
History
Odds (1987–1999)
The band was formed in 1987 in Vancouver, British Columbia, consisting of vocalist-guitarists Craig Northey and Steven Drake (both of whom had led different bands appearing on a Vancouver music compilation album, Spotlight '86), bassist Doug Elliott and drummer Paul Brennan. Pat Steward was originally asked to be the band's drummer, but they declined. The band members claim the name came when Brennan asked Drake, in a town somewhere on the BC coast, "What are the odds of us ever escaping bullshit gigs like this?"
In the late 1980s, the band played up to four nights a week as a 1960s and 1970s cover band called Dawn Patrol at the Roxy nightclub in Vancouver, while playing as Odds on weekends and funding their own demo recordings at Crosstown Studios in North Vancouver, hoping for a break. They travelled to Los Angeles doing showcases and eventually signed to Zoo Entertainment.
In 1991 they released their debut self-produced album Neopolitan, which spawned the radio hits "Love Is the Subject" and "King of the Heap" (both sung by Northey). The third single, the sexually explicit "Wendy Under the Stars" (sung by Drake), failed to chart, but attracted the attention of music critic Greil Marcus in their book Dead Elvis. After the release of Neopolitan, the band were picked up by Warren Zevon, becoming their touring band for their album Mr. Bad Example.
In 1993, Zevon returned the favour by guesting on the band's Bedbugs album. Its lead single was "Heterosexual Man". The video for that song featured the band members performing in drag, with Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald and Mark McKinney from The Kids in the Hall, themselves often noted for drag performances, as stereotypically macho jocks in the audience until Foley inexplicably turns into a woman. Three more singles were released from the album: "It Falls Apart", "Jack Hammer" and "Yes (Means it's Hard to Say No)". "Jack Hammer" features a guitar battle between Robert Quine (Lou Reed, Richard Hell, Matthew Sweet, etc.) and Zevon.
In 1995 Brennan left the band, moving to Toronto during the recording of their third album, and subsequently joined Big Sugar. They were replaced by Pat Steward, who was a friend of Doug's & former drummer for Bryan Adams. Good Weird Feeling, their most commercially successful album, included drum tracks from both Brennan and Steward. The album featured the top 10 hit singles "Truth Untold" and "Eat My Brain". "Satisfied" hit the top 20. "Mercy to Go" and "Smokescreen" also charted. "Eat My Brain" later found a place on the Craig Northey-produced soundtrack to The Kids in the Hall movie Brain Candy. Northey composed the score for the movie along with Steward and Elliott.
In 1996 the album Nest was released. The track "Someone Who's Cool" originally intended for a sequel to the Friends soundtrack, was their first No. 1 single in their native Canada. In the U.S., it was a No. 6 hit at AAA radio, but was not a mainstream chart hit. It later was also used as the title theme for the short-lived CBS comedy Love Monkey. The follow-up single "Make You Mad" featured a video which was co-directed by and starred Bruce McCulloch of The Kids in the Hall. "Nothing Beautiful" was the third single.
Odds toured extensively during the 1990s, including as an opening act for The Tragically Hip and Barenaked Ladies. The band performed until 1999, headlining that year's Arts County Fair year-end concert at the University of British Columbia, but released no further new studio albums.
Hiatus (1999–2007)
In March 1999, Northey announced that they were leaving the band, although they continued to work with Elliott and Steward frequently in subsequent years. The band members pursued other projects after 1999, releasing the greatest hits/singles compilation in 2000, entitled Singles: Individually Wrapped. A second compilation, The Essentials, was released in 2005.
Later in 1999 Elliott, Steward and Northey teamed up with organist Simon Kendall (of Doug & the Slugs) to release an instrumental soul CD under the moniker Sharkskin. Drake followed up their previous work mixing The Tragically Hip's 1996 album Trouble at the Henhouse by furthering their career as a recording engineer and producer based in Vancouver.
Northey released a solo album, Giddy Up, in 2002, and worked as a songwriter and producer for other acts (including Rosanne Cash) throughout the decade. In 2004, they collaborated with Gin Blossoms guitarist Jesse Valenzuela on the Northey Valenzuela album. The pair also recorded the theme song to the sitcom Corner Gas, "Not a Lot Going On". Northey, Steward and Elliott all recorded and toured with Rob Baker of the Tragically Hip as the band Stripper's Union, and continued to perform as the Craig Northey Power Trio, in addition to forming the core of the backup band for Canadian blues-rock guitarist Colin James.
In early 2006 Odds' song "Someone Who's Cool" was used as the theme song to the short-lived CBS music industry comedy Love Monkey, starring Tom Cavanagh, Jason Priestley and Teddy Geiger.
New Odds and Odds again (2008–2014)
In 2007, Craig Northey, Doug Elliott, Pat Steward and new guitarist Murray Atkinson performed old and new songs on the Barenaked Ladies' "Ships and Dip" event aboard a cruise ship in the Caribbean Sea. They released a new album, Cheerleader, on May 20, 2008, with Northey now performing all lead vocals. It was the very first release by Kim Cooke's new label Pheromone Recordings. The first single, "My Happy Place," (used over the closing credits throughout the run of Corner Gas) was released in mid-March. However, as the band's rights to the name Odds had lapsed, the album was released under the name The New Odds.
After re-securing rights to its original name, the band obtained U.S. distribution through independent record label Second Motion Records. A new EP, Noise Trade (named for the website used to sell it), comprising several songs from Cheerleader and covers of tunes from Pointed Sticks and Art Bergmann was prepared for early 2009 release. Early in the year, the band also appeared as themselves (in retro-'50s garb) during a dream sequence in the final season of the Corner Gas television series. The band continues to perform regularly, mostly at festivals and events across Canada including such performances as on the 2009 and 2010 Canadian Pacific Holiday train. During the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver Odds were the "house band" at Canada Hockey House.
The band was named the Vancouver Canucks 'house band' of the 2010 and 2011 NHL playoffs. The Odds performed the theme music to the CBC/IFC television series The Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town.
Odds made several shorter-length record releases in later years. On February 21, 2013, Odds released an EP called "The Most Beautiful Place on Earth." The five-song EPs "Game Face On" and "Party Party Party" followed in 2014.

The barred fruiteater (Pipreola arcuata) is a species of bird in the family Cotingidae, found in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. The population is stable, and they are considered common.
Description
This bird is the largest of the fruiteaters and the only one with barred underparts in both sexes. It is a dumpy, rather sluggish bird, growing to a length of . The male has a glossy black head and throat, and the remainder of the upper parts is greenish-brown. The tail is tipped with black and the wings have large areas of yellowish spotting. The underparts are finely barred in black and pale yellow. The head, throat and upper parts of the female are entirely greenish-brown and the underparts are similar to those of the male. Birds at the northern end of the range have orange-red irises while those at the southern end are pale grey or olive. The legs and beak are orange-red. The song is a faint, high-pitched "seeeeeeeh".
Distribution
The barred fruiteater is native to mountainous parts of South America. Its range extends from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador to Peru and Bolivia and its altitudinal range is from , going higher than any other fruiteater. It usually moves through the forest singly or in pairs, but at particularly fruitful trees, several birds may congregate.
Status
Pipreola arcuata has a very wide range and is common over much of that area. The total area of occupancy is about . Its population seems to be steady, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of "least concern".

Agnes Body (29 April 1866 – 31 March 1952) was a British principal. They were the founding head of Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls' High School and Queen Margaret's School, then in Scarborough.
Life
Body was born in Sedgley in 1866 where their father was the curate. They were one of the seven children of Louisa Jane and George Body. In 1883 they were living in Durham with their family until in 1886 they went to Cheltenham Ladies College to train becoming a teacher. They passed their exams and turned down an offer from Alice Ottley School to return to Cheltenham Ladies College to work under Dorothea Beale who convinced them that teaching was a "sacred mission".
In September 1893 Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls' High School was started with Agnes Body as its principal.
Queen Margaret's School, York was established in Scarborough by the Woodard Foundation, an organisation committed to the establishment of Christian boarding schools. Body was the founding head and they arrived from Lincoln with some of their former staff. In 1913, when ill-health made them retire, it was said that QMS was known as "Miss Body's School". Rosalind Fowler became the second head.
Body moved from Bishops Stortford to Torquay in 1930 and they died there in 1952.

IV Play is the fifth album by American recording artist The-Dream. The album was released on May 28, 2013, by Radio Killa Records and Def Jam Recordings. It features guest appearances from Jay-Z, Big Sean, Beyoncé, Pusha T, 2 Chainz, Kelly Rowland, Gary Clark Jr. and Fabolous. IV Play is an R&B album with overtly sexual themes.
Background
Prior to the release of their 2010 album Love King, The-Dream announced in interviews that it would be their final solo album. When the album was released, the song "Sex Intelligent (Remix)" featured a line in which the artist sang that they would release another album, titled Love Affair, on June 7, 2011. However, multiple delays pushed back the album's release for nearly two years and several different album titles were reported.
On the album's original release date, June 7, 2011, they released a promotional single free on the Internet, a medley of two new tracks titled "Body Work / Fuck My Brains Out." On August 31, they released the album 1977 for free online. The album was later retitled Terius Nash: 1977 and released commercially with a modified track list by Def Jam Recordings on December 18, 2012.
While backstage at the 2013 Grammy Awards, The-Dream revealed the final title to Billboard. In an interview on 106 & Park on April 2, 2013, The-Dream announced that Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Big Sean, and Jay-Z would appear on the album. On May 13, 2013 the track listing was revealed, including guest appearances by Pusha T, Gary Clark Jr. and 2 Chainz.
Marketing and sales
In June 2011, The-Dream released a double promotional single titled "Body Work / Fuck My Brains Out." In 2012, they released "Roc" (initially reported to be the album's lead single, although the first single that appeared on the final version of the album was "Slow It Down", released as a digital download on March 5, 2013. On April 2, the official music video was released. The album's title track was released as the second single on April 9, and its music video was released on May 16. A music video for "Too Early", featuring Gary Clark Jr., was released on August 16. On May 15, the third single "High Art" was released.
In support of the album, they co-headlined the "Lights Out" tour with Kelly Rowland, though most of the tour dates were canceled after Rowland was hired as a judge on The X Factor. On May 20, 2013, The-Dream performed the song "Where Have You Been" with Rowland on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The following day, the album became available for streaming via The-Dream's VEVO channel.
IV Play sold 23,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number 16 on the Billboard 200 chart on June 5, 2013. By the end of the month, it had sold 42,000 in the US. In June 2015, it reached 68,000 copies sold there.
Critical reception
IV Play was met with a lukewarm response from critics. According to Treble journalist Connor Brown, it was "without a doubt the worst reception that any of The-Dream's records have received". At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received an average score of 62 — indicating "generally favorable reviews" based on 19 reviews.
Reviewing in May 2013, Spin magazine's Jordan Sargent said IV Play is "a very good album" and also one that lacks the level of experimentation featured on The-Dream's previous records, observing "too many songs here propped up on one simplistic notion". Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine applauded the second half of songs as "densely layered, immaculately produced, and frequently luminous", although they found the guest-heavy first half to be uneven. Pitchfork reviewer Andrew Ryce also criticized the "string of clunkers" early in the album, but felt that its highlights show that "the brilliant auteur we fell in love with is still in here somewhere." Alex Macpherson of The Guardian was more critical, saying it lacks the "panache" and "commitment" of The-Dream's past work while calling them "a grotesquely diminished figure promising bad sex in return for retreads of old ideas". AllMusic's Andy Kellman found the plentiful guest appearances "trivial", as well as the album itself.

Jackson County (county code JA) is a county in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 13,232. Its county seat and most populous city is Holton. The county, first named Calhoun County for pro-slavery South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, was renamed in 1859 for President Andrew Jackson. The Prairie Band Potawatomi Indian Reservation, near the center of the county, comprises about 18.5% of the county's area.
History
Early history
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about . In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1859, Jackson County was established.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

Jackson County is included in the Topeka Metropolitan Statistical Area.
As of the 2000 census, there were 12,657 people, 4,727 households, and 3,507 families residing in the county. The population density was 19 people per square mile (7/km2). There were 5,094 housing units at an average density of 8 per square mile (3/km2). The county's racial makeup was 90.21% White, 6.84% Native American, 0.53% Black or African American, 0.17% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.39% from other races, and 1.84% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.49% of the population.
There were 4,727 households, of which 35.20% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.30% were married couples living together, 8.20% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.80% were non-families. 22.70% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.50% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 3.09.
28.30% of the county's residents were under the age of 18, 6.80% were from 18 to 24, 26.70% were from 25 to 44, 23.40% were from 45 to 64, and 14.90% were 65 years of age or older.

Government
Presidential elections
Jackson County has supported the Republican Party candidate in every presidential election from 1936 onward. Democratic Party candidates for president have only won the county twice since 1880, in 1912 & 1932.
Laws
Following an amendment to the Kansas Constitution in 1986, the county remained a prohibition, or "dry", county until 2004, when voters approved the sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with a 30% food sales requirement. The food sales requirement was removed in 2020.
The county voted "No" on the 2022 Kansas Value Them Both Amendment, an anti-abortion ballot measure, by 52% to 48% despite backing Donald Trump with 69% of the vote to Joe Biden's 29% in the 2020 presidential election.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical scale used to reliably measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury.
The GCS assesses a person based on their ability to perform eye movements, speak, and move their body. These three behaviours make up the three elements of the scale: eye, verbal, and motor. A person's GCS score can range from 3 (completely unresponsive) to 15 (responsive). This score is used to guide immediate medical care after a brain injury (such as a car accident) and also to monitor hospitalised patients and track their level of consciousness.
Lower GCS scores are correlated with higher risk of death. However, the GCS score alone should not be used on its own to predict the outcome for an individual person with brain injury.
Scoring
The Glasgow Coma Scale is used for people above the age of two and composed of three tests: eye, verbal, and motor responses. The scores for each of these tests are indicated in the table below.
The Glasgow Coma Scale is reported as the combined score (which ranges from 3 to 15) and the score of each test (E for eye, V for Verbal, and M for Motor). For each test, the value should be based on the best response that the person being examined can provide.
For example, if a person obeys commands only on their right side, they get a 6 for motor. The scale also accounts for situations that prevent appropriate testing (Not Testable). When specific tests cannot be performed, they must be reported as "NT" and the total score is not reported.
The results are reported as the Glasgow Coma Score (the total points from the three tests) and the individual components. As an example, a person's score might be: GCS 12, E3 V4 M5. Alternatively, if a patient was intubated, their score could be GCS E2 V NT M3.
Eye response (E)
There are four grades starting with the most severe:
No opening of the eye
Eye opening in response to pain stimulus. A peripheral pain stimulus, such as squeezing the lunula area of the person's fingernail is more effective than a central stimulus such as a trapezius squeeze, due to a grimacing effect.
Eye opening to speech. Not to be confused with the awakening of a sleeping person; such people receive a score of 4, not 3.
Eyes opening spontaneously
NT (Not testable). Examples for this would include severe damage to the eyes, sedation from drugs, and paralysis.
Verbal response (V)
There are five grades starting with the most severe:
No verbal response
Incomprehensible sounds. Moaning but no words.
Inappropriate words. Random or exclamatory articulated speech, but no conversational exchange. Speak words but no sentences.
Confused. The person responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.
Oriented. Person responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the person's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.
NT (Not testable). Examples for this would include intubation, deafness, language barrier, sedation from drugs, and paralysis.
Motor response (M)
There are six grades starting with the most severe:
No motor response. Lack of any motor response should raise suspicion for spinal cord injury.
Abnormal Extension in response to pain. Different guidelines report different evaluation of abnormal extension. While some sources indicate extension at the elbow is sufficient, other sources use the language "decerebrate posturing". It is important to note that the original publication of the Glasgow Coma Scale explicitly avoided the term "decerebrate extension" because it implied specific anatomical findings.
Abnormal Flexion in response to pain. Different guidelines report different evaluation. While some sources focus on arm movements, other sources use the term "decorticate posturing".
Normal Flexion (absence of abnormal posturing; unable to lift hand past chin with supraorbital pain but does pull away when nailbed is pinched)
Localises to pain (purposeful movements towards painful stimuli; e.g., brings hand up beyond chin when supraorbital pressure applied)
Obey commands (the person does simple things as asked)
NT (Not testable). Examples for this would include spinal cord injury, sedation from drugs, and paralysis.
Pediatric scoring
Children below the age of two struggle with the tests necessary for assessment of the Glasgow Coma Scale. As a result, a version for children has been developed, and is outlined below.
Interpretation
Individual elements as well as the sum of the score are important. Hence, the score is expressed in the form "GCS 9 = E2 V4 M3 at 07:35".
Patients with scores of 3 to 8 are usually considered to be in a coma.
Generally, brain injury is classified as:
Severe, GCS ≤ 8
Moderate, GCS 9–12
Minor, GCS ≥ 13.
Tracheal intubation and severe facial/eye swelling or damage make it impossible to test the verbal and eye responses. In these circumstances, the score is given as 1 with a modifier attached (e.g. "E1c", where "c" = closed, or "V1t" where t = tube). Often the 1 is left out, so the scale reads Ec or Vt. A composite might be "GCS 5tc". This would mean, for example, eyes closed because of swelling = 1, intubated = 1, leaving a motor score of 3 for "abnormal flexion".
The GCS has limited applicability to children, especially below the age of 36 months (when the verbal performance of even a healthy child would be expected to be poor). Consequently, the Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale was developed for assessing younger children.
History
Pre-history
During the 1960s, assessment and management of head injuries became a topic of interest. The number of head injuries was rapidly increasing, in part because of increased use of motorised transport. Also, doctors recognised that after head trauma, many patients had poor recovery. This led to a concern that patients were not being assessed or medically managed correctly. Appropriate assessment is a critical step in medical management for several reasons. First, a reliable assessment allows doctors to provide the appropriate treatment. Second, assessments let doctors keep track of how a patient is doing, and intervene if the patient is doing worse. Finally, a system of assessment allows researchers to define categories of patients. This makes it possible to determine which treatments are best for different types of patients.
A number of assessments for head injury (“coma scales”) were developed, though none were widely adopted. Of 13 scales that had been published by 1974, all involved linear scales that defined levels of consciousness. These scales posed two problems. First, levels of consciousness in these scales were often poorly defined. This made it difficult for doctors and nurses to evaluate head injury patients. Second, different scales used overlapping and obscure terms that made communication difficult.
Origin
In this setting, Bryan Jennett and Graham Teasdale began work on what became the Glasgow Coma Scale. Based on their experiences, they aimed to make a scale satisfying several criteria. First, it needed to be simple, so that it could be performed without special training. Second, it needed to be reliable, so that doctors could be confident in the results of the scale. Third, the scale needed to provide important information for managing a patient with a head injury.
Their work resulted in the 1974 publication of the first iteration of the GCS. The original scale involved three exam components (eye movement, motor control, and verbal control). These components were scored based on clearly defined behavioural responses. Clear instructions for administering the scale and interpreting results were also included. The original scale is identical to the current scale except for the motor assessment. The original motor assessment included only five levels, combining "flexion" and "abnormal flexion". This was done because Jennett and Teasdale found that many people struggled in distinguishing these two states.
Updates to the Glasgow Coma Scale
In 1976, Teasdale updated the motor component of the Glasgow Coma Scale to differentiate flexion movements. This was because trained personnel could reliably distinguish flexion movements. Further research also demonstrated that normal and abnormal flexion have different clinical outcomes. As a result, the six-point motor scale is now considered the standard.
Teasdale did not originally intend to use the sum score of the GCS components. However, later work demonstrated that the sum of the GCS components, or the Glasgow Coma Score, had clinical significance. Specifically, the sum score was correlated with outcome (including death and disability). As a result, the Glasgow Coma Score is used in research to define patient groups. It is also used in clinical practice as shorthand for the full scale.
Adoption in clinical use
The Glasgow Coma Scale was initially adopted by nursing staff in the Glasgow neurosurgical unit. Especially following a 1975 nursing publication, it was adopted by other medical centres. True widespread adoption of the GCS was attributed to two events in 1978. First, Tom Langfitt, a leading figure in neurological trauma, wrote an editorial in Journal of Neurosurgery strongly encouraging neurosurgical units to adopt the GCS score. Second, the GCS was included in the first version of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), which expanded the number of centres where staff were trained in performing the GCS.
Controversy
The GCS has come under pressure from some researchers who take issue with the scale's poor inter-rater reliability and lack of prognostic utility. Although there is no agreed-upon alternative, newer scores such as the simplified motor scale and FOUR score have also been developed as improvements to the GCS. Although the inter-rater reliability of these newer scores has been slightly higher than that of the GCS, they have not yet gained consensus as replacements.

In Greek mythology, Arsinoe, sometimes spelled Arsinoë, (Ancient Greek: Ἀρσινόη), was the name of the following individuals.
Arsinoe, one of the Nysiads (Dodonides), nurses of the infant Dionysus in Mount Nysa.
Arsinoe, daughter of Leucippus and possibly Philodice. They were also the sister of Hilaeira and Phoebe, who were abducted by the Dioscuri. By the god Apollo, Arsinoe bore Asclepius, 'leader of men' and Eriopis 'with the lovely hair'. Otherwise, the mother of Asclepius was called Coronis, daughter of Phlegyas because it is said that Asclepius being the son of Arsinoe, was a fiction invented by Hesiod, or by one of Hesiod's interpolators, just to please the Messenians. At Sparta they had a sanctuary and was worshipped as a hero.
Arsinoe, one of the Minyades, according to Plutarch. This daughter of Minyas were struck with madness and having conceived a greedy appetite for man's flesh, cast lots accordingly for their children to see who they were going to eat. Whereupon it fell to Leucippe's lot to produce their son Hippasus to be cut in pieces.
Arsinoe or Alphesiboea, daughter of Phegeus, king of Psophis in Arcadia and sister of Pronous and Agenor. They were the wife of Alcmaeon, leader of the Epigoni by whom they bore a son, Clytius. After Alcmaeon was purified from blood guilt by Phegeus for murdering their own mother Eriphyle, Arsinoe was given in marriage to the hero who received from them the necklace of Harmonia. Later on, their brothers, Pronous and Agenor killed Alcmaeon at the instigation of their father. When Arsinoe condemned them of the act, they clapped them into a chest and carried them to Tegea. There they gave them as a slave to Agapenor, falsely accusing them of their husband's murder. Eventually, retribution came when the sons of Alcmaeon, Amphoterus and Acarnan slew their father's murderers and also Phegeus and their wife.
Arsinoe, nurse of Orestes who saved them from the hands of their mother Clytemnestra, and carried them to the aged Strophius, the father of Pylades. Other traditions called this nurse Laodameia.
Arsinoe, daughter of King Nicocreon of Salamis in Cyprus (descendant of Teucer, son of Telamon). They were loved by Arceophon who wooed her, but the maiden's father refused to give their daughter to Arceophon because of the latter's Phoenician descent. Arceophon was upset and began to come to Arsinoe's house by night, hoping to win their heart, but in vain. They then tried to bribe Arsinoe's nurse so that they might arrange for them to meet, but Arsinoe reported this to their parents, who cut off the nurse's tongue, nose and fingers and drove them out of their house. Having lost every hope, Arceophon committed suicide by starving themselves to death. The fellow citizens grieved at their death and buried them with honors. When Arsinoe leaned out of the window to take a look at the funeral ceremony, the goddess of love, Aphrodite turned them into stone.

Group analysis (or group analytic psychotherapy) is a method of group psychotherapy originated by S. H. Foulkes in the 1940s. Group psychotherapy was pioneered by S. H. Foulkes with their psychoanalytic patients and later with soldiers in the Northfield experiments at Hollymoor Hospital. Group analysis combines psychoanalytic insights with an understanding of social and interpersonal functioning. There is an interest, in group analysis, on the relationship between the individual group member and the rest of the group resulting in a strengthening of both, and a better integration of the individual with their or their community, family and social network.
Deriving from psychoanalysis, Group Analysis also draws on a range of other psychotherapeutic traditions and approaches: systems theory psychotherapies, developmental psychology and social psychology. Group analysis also has applications in organisational consultancy, and in teaching and training. Group analysts work in a wide range of contexts with a wide range of difficulties and problems.
Method
Group analysis is based on the view that deep lasting change can occur within a carefully formed group whose combined membership reflects the wider norms of society. Group analysis is a way of understanding group processes in small, median or, large groups. It is concerned with the relationship between a person and the network of activity in the many groups of which they or they might belong. Through these group processes we can explore what bearing the public and private aspects of a person's life have on one another, and the dialectic between group and personal development. Group members are supported, through shared experience and joint exploration within the group, in coming to a healthier understanding of their situation. Problems are seen at the level of group, organisation or institutional system; not solely in the individual sufferer, as they do in prevailing medical models. Problems within are recast as obstacles without. The way in which the group functions is central to this. Democracy and co-operation are the pillars through which group-mediated solutions to problems can flow in ways that are enduring. It is based on the principles developed by S.H. Foulkes in the 1940s and is rooted in psychoanalysis and the social sciences.
Group analysis is the dominant psychodynamic approach outside the United States and Canada. It is an approach that views the group as an organic entity and insists that the therapist take a less intrusive role, so as to become the group's conductor (as in music) rather than its director. The group is seen as not merely a dynamic entity of its own, but functions within a sociocultural context that influences its processes. In group analytic technique, the therapist weans the members from excessive and inappropriate dependency towards becoming their own therapists – both to themselves and to the other group members.
The Group Analytic Society and the Institute of Group Analysis were organisations established by Foulkes and others to promote Group Analysis and to train practitioners.

An electronic gear-shifting system is a method of changing gears on a bicycle, which enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers and mechanical cables. The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur, switching the chain from cog to cog. An electronic system can switch gears faster and, because the system does not use Bowden cables and can calibrate itself, it may require less maintenance.
History
In 1990 the Japanese bike component manufacturer SunTour introduced the Browning Electronic AccuShift Transmission (SunTour BEAST) - a triple crankset/chainset system for mountain bikes in which one quarter of the circle is hinged along a radius. During shifting, this segment is pushed sideways by a relay operated mechanism like a railroad switch and picks up the chain that is currently running on the next cog.
In 1992 the French manufacturer Mavic introduced their first electronically controlled gear shift mechanism called Zap at the 1992 Tour de France. It was a prototype, but it achieved neither technical success nor commercial application. A development of this was used by Chris Boardman to win the opening time trial (prologue) of the 1997 Tour de France.
In 1994 Sachs introduced the Speedtronic.
In 1999 Mavic introduced the Mektronic, its second electronic shift system, which suffered from reliability issues and was subsequently discontinued.
In 2001 Shimano introduced a set of trekking components called Di2 (Digital Integrated Intelligence), which included electronic shifting and automatic adaption of front and rear derailleur to riding speed.
During the 2000s both Shimano and Campagnolo (2005) experimented with electronic shifting in professional cycle races.
The first commercially successful electronic gear shift system for road bicycles was introduced by Shimano in 2009, the Di2. Three professional teams used the Di2 in the 2009 Tour of California: Columbia High Road, Garmin Slipstream, and Rabobank; and several teams and riders, including George Hincapie, used it during the 2009 Tour de France
Also in 2009 Giant released a bicycle equipped with the Shimano Di2 and Trek began providing a battery mount and Di2-specific cable routing and stops on its Madone frames.
In 2015 SRAM announced its wireless electronic groupset called, SRAM RED eTap. The group was released in Spring of 2016 and is available on complete bikes and through aftermarket SRAM component dealers.
A wireless system that can be retrofitted onto any bicycle was announced in 2016. The front and rear derailleurs remain place, while a wireless gear-change controller is added to the handlebar, with configuration of the system via an iOS/Android app, and customization can be added to the button controllers via the Bluetooth app.
Implementation
As of 2009, one system was commercially available from a major parts manufacturer: Shimano's Di2 (Dura-Ace 7970) for road bicycles. While the traditional method of gear shifting uses mechanical control levers that pull and release Bowden cables and spring-loaded derailleurs, Di2 is controlled by electronic switches located either in the integrated shift levers and/or at the end of time trial bars. The switches send signals through a wiring harness to a battery pack, placed near the bottom bracket. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack supplies power to the derailleur motors, which move the derailleurs via worm gears. Shimano estimates that their 7.4-volt battery pack can last up to per charge. The system also has an LED light to warn when it needs a charge.
The rear derailleur has shift times similar to mechanical systems and a break-away system to protect it in case of a crash. The front derailleur, however, switches gears almost 30% faster than Dura-Ace's mechanical counterpart. On traditional bikes, the front derailleur is problematic because the chain can be under tension and has to make a large vertical jump between chainrings. The electronic system's controlled motion overcomes these problems. The Di2 can also trim the front derailleur to eliminate chain rub and calibrate itself to adjust for wear and tear. Finally, the entire 7970 groupset weighs approximately less than the 7800 it replaces but more than the new 7900.
In 2011 Shimano introduced the Ultegra Di2 electronic gear change set, a cheaper version of the electronic Dura-Ace system. This set seemed to provide an electronic option within reach of a wider audience.
Campagnolo introduced their first system of electronic shifting, EPS, in the same year. By 2012 Campagnolo had three electronic shifting groupsets available. Cyclists began to see a growing range of electronic alternatives to traditional mechanical shifting for derailleur gears.
Wireless shifting
A wireless system was announced by Tiso in 2012, but this did not achieve widespread use.
In August 2015 SRAM Corporation announced its wireless shifting system, eTap. The system had been extensively developed and secretly tested over several years from initial design to a stage win in the 2015 Tour de France. The front and rear derailleurs use direct-mount batteries and communicate wirelessly with the shifters through a proprietary wireless protocol developed by SRAM called, Airea (pronounced: area). A set of small satellite shifter buttons, called Blips, can be connected to the shift levers or aero shift module (BlipBox) and placed anywhere along the handlebars as part of the system. A maximum of four Blips can be used per bike. The company also took the opportunity to introduce a new shifting convention with this system. The right lever shifts the rear derailleur outboard, the left lever shifts the rear derailleur inboard, and pressing both levers together shifts the front derailleur. SRAM made the groupset available for purchase on complete bikes and as aftermarket components sold through dealers from Spring 2016. Eventually, extension of the system is expected to the company's lower group sets, such as SRAM Force. In May 2016 the company announced a hydraulic disc brake version of its wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both lever reach adjustment and lever contact point adjustment, a first for road disc brakes.
At Eurobike 2015, held in Friedrichshafen, Germany, the FSA company displayed their working prototype of a wireless gear shifting system. The system was trialled at the 2016 Tour de France in stage 17, and at Eurobike 2016 the final form of the WE (Wireless Electron) groupset (which includes wireless shifting) was displayed. FSA plans to make this available from May 2017.
At Interbike 2016, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Paul Gallagher displayed a working prototype of their XSHIFTER universal wireless gear shifting system. It is a patent pending device that is claimed to convert any bike with mechanical derailleurs to wireless smart shifting in a few minutes. The XSHIFTER will be seeking funding for development in November 2016.
Archer Components, a California based company, sells a wireless shifting retrofit kit for mountain bikes. The first version of the product was released on February 9th, 2018 and called the D1x Electronic Shifter. A subsequent version of the product was released one year later and called the D1x Trail. The D1x Trail uses a linear servo to pull up to 46mm of standard shift cable using a programmable servo controller. The shifter can be programmed to shift any number of gears from 2 to 20. The shifter connects to the handlebar mounted remote using Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 and is programmed using an iOS or Android app.
Advantages and disadvantages
An electronic system can have several advantages over a comparable mechanical system:
eliminate the need for the rider to switch hand positions in order to shift
allow for an accurate and effortless shift, even in difficult circumstances, such as if the rider has cold hands or is completely exhausted
shifting performance is not affected by contaminated, stretched, or worn Bowden cables
automatic trim function can eliminate chain rub
shifts can be timed to occur at a particular point in the cassette or chainring rotation, making best and smoothest use of ramps and cutouts in the sprocket teeth
the front and rear shift pattern on a bike with multiple chainrings can be programmed to make the best use of the gear progression, avoid duplicate ratios and relieve the rider of the need to decide what combination of front and rear sprockets to employ
the smoothness of electronics can reduce the shock on drivetrain components
An electronic system may have some disadvantages when compared to a mechanical system:
There is currently no option for manual override when the battery is exhausted. This could pose a problem for riders, depending on the type of terrain on which they are riding. However, SRAM's RED eTap groupset's interchangeable derailleur batteries makes it possible to manually switch batteries between the two derailleurs in order to place the battery with remaining charge onto the derailleur the user intends to shift.
Reliability issues have caused previous electronic systems to be withdrawn from the market. As of recently, all electronic group sets are fully waterproof. External connectors are completely waterproof, but internal connectors (internal routing for wired systems) need to be shrink wrapped with shrink tubing to be waterproof.
Cost: The system is expensive compared to lower end mechanical derailleur systems. (The Shimano Dura Ace Di2 system costs in excess of $2500 in May, 2010).
Weight: Electronic groupsets are typically heavier than their mechanical counterparts.

The Slide (stylized SLIDE) is a maglev hoverboard demonstration developed by Lexus. Lexus built a skate park in Barcelona, Spain specifically for the project. The system was built as a promotional demonstration, not for public sale.
Conception
The overall project took about 57 weeks from start to finish. The SLIDE was teased in June and officially revealed August 5, 2015. Dietmar Berger, a magnetic levitation engineer, and Ludwig Schultz, a pioneer of superconducting levitation, were the main experts responsible for the design of the system. Professional skateboarder Ross McGouran was the main rider for prototype testing and also promotional riding as well.
Technology
The main focus of the demonstration is the levitation of the hoverboard, achieved through the use of superconductors inside the board and a magnetic track. The board itself is made of bamboo and carbon fibre support structures. The board has 32 yttrium barium copper oxide superconductors cooled by liquid nitrogen.
Superconductors are conductors that have no internal resistance as long as they are kept below a certain temperature. When a metal has no internal resistance, a current running through the metal will run forever without a power source. When a superconductor is subjected to a magnetic field, the superconductor aligns itself with the magnetic field and floats on top of it. Superconductors only have zero internal resistance when cooled to a certain temperature. In order to achieve this the system uses liquid nitrogen to cool it down to . Even though liquid nitrogen cools down the superconductors, it also boils at the same temperature. This makes it difficult to have a constant supply of liquid nitrogen to continually cool down the superconductors; the system can only operate for an average time of about 20 minutes on maximum liquid nitrogen onboard capacity.
Track
The track built by Lexus for the SLIDE project is in Cubelles, Barcelona, Spain. The entire skate park has magnetic tracks concealed beneath a thin layer of wood. The magnetic track pulls the board along the path. All the uphill and downhill slopes of the track were specifically designed to ensure the magnetic field has enough momentum to pull the board.

The Church of Our Lady St Mary of Glastonbury in Glastonbury, Somerset, England, is a Roman Catholic church that was completed in 1940.
History
The church sits along Magdalene Street facing the medieval Abbot's Kitchen across the road in Glastonbury Abbey. On the same site, once stood the original Catholic church in that of an old converted stable which was pulled down in 1938. Behind the church there was once the St. Louis Convent school which operated from 1925 until 1984. The new church was made at a cost of £11,000 and was built using Bath and Corsham stone. At the front of the church, carved into the stone are statues of Madonna and child, St Dunstan to the left and Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury on the right. Father Michael Fitzpatrick worked on raising these funds and relied upon local donations to do so.
Relics
After its consecration on July 2, 1941, by Bishop Lee of Clifton - the church was blessed and relics from saints placed within the altar and reliquaries from:
Oliver Plunkett - Patron saint of Peace and Reconciliation in Ireland
Thomas Becket - Patron saint of the Roman Catholic Secular Clergy
Pope Innocent I - Once pope for 16 years
Benedict of Nursia - Patron saint of students and the dying et al.
Victoria of Albitina - Patron of Anticoli, Italy
Saint Barbara - Patron saint of artillerymen and miners
Pope Clement I - Patron saint of stone cutters and sailors
Interior
Behind the altar is the statue of 'Our Lady St. Mary of Glastonbury' which was made in 1955. Either side is a large tapestry which was woven by the Edinburgh Tapestry Company Ltd. It depicts the three Glastonbury Martyrs; the Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey Richard Whiting, their treasurer John Thorne and their companion Roger James before they were hanged, drawn and quartered at Glastonbury Tor during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Also depicted is St. Dunstan, St. Patrick, St Brigid St. Joseph of Arimathea, St. David, and the monk Richard Bere who was beheaded for refusing to 'take the Oath of Henry's supremacy over the Church'.
Above the tapestry is the stained glass window that depicts the Crucifixion with Mary Magdalene at the feet of Jesus. On the left is Our Lady, Mary and on the right is St John, disciple of Jesus.

is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Shin Takahashi. It was serialized in Shogakukan's seinen manga magazine Weekly Big Comic Spirits from December 1999 to October 2001, with its chapters collected in seven tankōbon volumes.
A thirteen-episode anime television series adaptation by Gonzo aired from July to September 2002. A two-episode side-story original video animation (OVA) by Studio Fantasia was released in 2005. A live-action film adaptation premiered in Japan in January 2006.
Both the manga and the anime series were licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media. The anime was later licensed in 2014 by Sentai Filmworks and released under the title She, the Ultimate Weapon.
Plot
The story begins with Shuji, a high school student in a Hokkaidō coastal city, walking up to an observatory and reminiscing about their girlfriend, Chise; there they find their exchange diaries that they purposefully left behind. The ensuing story is narrated by Shuji through flashbacks while reading Chise's diary. Chise, a fellow student in their class, declares their love for Shuji at the beginning of the series. However, Chise is very shy and Shuji is insensitive: neither know how to express their feelings very well, but they do indeed have feelings for each other.
One day, while Shuji is shopping in Sapporo, unknown bombers attack the city in broad daylight. They and their friends run for cover, but notice a fast and small flying object shooting down the enemy bombers. Separated from their friends, Shuji wanders through the wreckage—only to stumble upon Chise; here they have metal wings and weapons—apparently grafted onto their body. They tell them they have become the ultimate weapon, without their knowledge or consent, and that they are seen by the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) as the last hope for defending Japan. In the anime, it is not apparent why Chise was chosen to be the ultimate weapon or why the country is under attack. It was not until the OVA episodes were released that an explanation for Chise being chosen was offered: their body has the highest degree of compatibility with the weapon system.
This story focuses primarily on Chise's fading humanity as their condition worsens. The main conflict is within Chise herself; they question whether or not they are human. Them soul is constantly trying to be a normal girl, while their body succumbs to the devastating effects of the weapon cell within them Fundamentally important to the plot is the relationship between Shuji and Chise. From this, the resolution of the conflict follows. In the end, they are able to realize who they truly are.
A number of minor characters who do not necessarily know of Chise's role in the war have sub-plots that concern everyday people in the context of war: a woman whose husband is constantly away from home, a school boy who joins the army to protect their girlfriend, a girl whose civilian boyfriend is killed in a bombing, and others.
Characters
Played by: Aki Maeda
A shy, clumsy girl with very little self-esteem and has poor grades in everything except for World History. They were constantly hospitalized in Tokyo during their elementary years, and thus, has very few friends (except for Akemi). They start dating Shuji, with Akemi's help, and tries to make their relationship work with them despite their apparently aloof personality. However, Chise is very inexperienced and does not know much about relationships to the point they read shōjo manga for advice. They were turned into the ultimate weapon against their will and the series revolves around them and their fading humanity. As Chise's weapon-side starts to take over, their heart stops beating, their body lacks warmth and their sense of taste and touch are dulled, but other senses (especially sight) are accentuated. Them condition worsens and their humanity seems to fade away entirely. In the final episodes of the anime, they appear to be nothing more than a cold, ruthless machine that delights in their growing, destructive powers and killing people without mercy. Them love for Shuji is the last of their humanity. Throughout the story, they try to come to terms with their body while still trying to convince themselves that they are still human. They believe that they are nothing more than a weapon designed to kill. Them boyfriend Shuji, however, is able to help them break free by showing them that they are able to protect the ones they love, and that only a human can experience the feeling of love. This helps Chise destroy the body in which they were trapped, and they realize that they are indeed human. This brings to question what is meant by the term "ultimate weapon" used throughout the story. Chise's soul had been the only thing that was able to destroy their body, which was claimed to be the most powerful thing in the world.
Played by: Shunsuke Kubozuka
A somewhat antisocial 17-year-old high school student who gets higher than average grades and used to be on their school's track team. Shuji is very unsure of their initial feelings for Chise and feels that their relationship is more trouble than its worth, though their feelings deepen as the story progresses. Not long after the two became much closer, they decided to simply become friends again and leave their closer relationship alone. This gives them time to realize their love for Chise and they eventually wish to give the relationship another try. However, things get complicated when their first love, Fuyumi, reappears in town.  They are the only civilian who knows Chise is the ultimate weapon and promises that they will never divulge their secret. Shuji is feeling constantly guilty and useless because their irresponsible actions tend to hurt Chise. Later on in the series, they come to accept their love for Chise and vows to protect them and be by their side at all costs.
Played by: Shihori Kanjiya
 They are a childhood friend and classmate of both Chise and Shuji. Akemi is also Chise's best friend, and usually gives their advice on love. A typical tomboy, but they have some insecurities about their appearance, always questioning why any man would fall for them They always come to Chise's defense whenever Shuji inadvertently hurts Chise verbally.
Played by: Ryo Kimura
Shuji's best friend. Atsushi is a mature, open, down-to-earth guy who holds a fascination for the military. They decide to join the Japan Self-Defense Forces to protect the girl they love.
Played by: Kiyohiko Shibukawa
Regiment leader, Fuyumi's husband, and the sole survivor of Chise's first platoon.  They are very much like Shuji in terms of looks and personality and that is why Chise is initially attracted to him. They treat Chise like an ordinary girl, which is why Chise likes him.  They are one of the characters to be featured in the OVA, where Mizuki, their former commander, was shown to have a crush on him.
Played by: Miki Sakai
Tetsu's wife. They used to train the track team when they were younger and their students called them "Fuyumi-senpai" because of the close age difference.  They are always feeling lonely as their husband, Tetsu, is never home since they are always away in the army. It is soon revealed that Shuji and Fuyumi were once in love. Shuji explains that their love for them was never true; they simply wanted to become physically closer to them
Seen only in the OVA, Mizuki was the prototype for the weapon system which would later be used on Chise. They were an officer who was badly wounded in an attack, but returned to the battlefield because of the prototype weapon system. They also had a crush on Tetsu, their former deputy. They were one of the very few people sympathetic (and empathetic since she, too, was a weapon) towards Chise.
Take
The most extroverted guy in Shuji's circle of friends and Yukari's boyfriend. Take is the first one to get a girlfriend in Shuji's group. Their girlfriend is named Yukari.
Nori
The most immature guy in Shuji's circle of friends. Nori is a naive high-school student, who believed that the war would never reach their hometown and they should stop worrying about it. They desperately want to have a girlfriend, and is slightly jealous of Take for having one.
Yukari
Take's girlfriend. After their boyfriend's death, they leave the school. Soon after that, they get another boyfriend and on the surface, claims they will never love anyone seriously again.
Takamura
Young soldier on Chise's former company. They admire Chise very much, telling them that their combat skills saved their lives.
Kawahara
Head scientist in charge of Chise.  They are a nervous man that perpetually wipes their forehead with a dark-blue cloth.

A referendum on constitutional reforms was held in Morocco on 1 July 2011. It was called in response to a series of protests across Morocco that began on 20 February 2011 when over ten thousand Moroccans participated in demonstrations demanding democratic reforms. A commission was to draft proposals by June 2011. A draft released on 17 June foresaw the following changes:
requiring the King to name a Prime Minister, renamed Head of government, from the largest party in Parliament;
handing a number of rights from the monarch to the PM, including dissolution of parliament;
allowing parliament to grant amnesty, previously a privilege of the monarch;
making Berber an official language alongside Arabic
The changes were reportedly approved by 98.49% of voters. Despite protest movements calling for a boycott of the referendum, government officials claimed turnout was 72.65%.
Following the referendum, early parliamentary elections were held on 25 November 2011.
Details
The set of political reforms approved consisted of the following:
The Amazigh language is an official state language along with Arabic.
The state preserves and protects the Hassānīya language and all the linguistic components of the Moroccan culture as a heritage of the nation.
The king has the obligation to appoint a prime minister from the party that wins the most seats in the parliamentary elections. Previously, they could nominate a technocrat in this position if no party has a decisive advantage over the other parties in terms of the number of seats in the parliament.
The king is no longer "sacred" but the "integrity of their person" is "inviolable".
High administrative and diplomatic posts (including ambassadors, CEOs of state-owned companies, provincial and regional governors), are now appointed by the prime minister in consultation with the ministerial council which is presided by the king, previously the latter exclusively held this power.
The prime minister is the head of government; they have the power to dissolve the parliament.
The prime minister will preside over the council of Government, which prepares the general policy of the state. Previously the king held this position.
The parliament has the power of granting amnesty. Previously this was exclusively held by the king.
The judiciary system is independent from the legislative and executive branch, the king guarantees this independence.
Women are guaranteed "civic and social" equality with men. Previously, only "political" equality was guaranteed, though the 1996 constitution grants all citizens equality in terms of rights and before the law.
The King would retain complete control of the armed forces, foreign policy, the judiciary, and matters pertaining to religion, and would also retain authority for choosing and dismissing prime ministers
All citizens have the freedom of thought, ideas, artistic expression and creation. Previously only free-speech and the freedom of circulation and association were guaranteed.

Age of Consent is the fourth full-length album by the American heavy metal band Virgin Steele. The album took eight months to complete, a change from Noble Savage which was recorded in only a few weeks, and was finally released in October 1988. It received scarce promotion and distribution by their small label, resulting in very low sales. The songs of this album follow in style and content the music of the previous album Noble Savage, adding a more polished sound and production. At the time of release, the band faced legal and financial setbacks that brought to the unofficial disbandment of Virgin Steele. Joe O'Reilly, although credited for playing bass on the album, was ill at the time of recording and was ghosted by DeFeis and Pursino.
The album was reissued on CD in 1997 by Noise Records, with a new song listing, a new cover and many bonus tracks. In November 2011 Age of Consent was once again reissued by Steamhammer Records, a subsidiary of SPV, with the same track list as the 1997 release, but with an added bonus CD (named Under the Graveyard Moon) containing 7 additional tracks.

The Dunstable Sailplane Company was established in 1934 by W.L. Manuel and C.H. Latimer-Needham to design, manufacture and repair gliders from its workshop at Barton-Le-Clay Airfield in Bedfordshire.
The Dunstable Kestrel was manufactured by the company from designs by W.L. Manuel in 1935; production was limited to one sailplane with a British Gliding Association id of G221. Records comment that G221 was purchased by a trainee pilot who was still in their early stages of training with a primary glider. This Dunstable Kestrel passed to the Norfolk & Norwich Aero Club and crashed in 1938, however W.L. Manuel drew up plans for home builders which were offered for sale at the cost of £6. 6s. W.E. Godson purchased a set of plans and built a second British Kestrel whilst three more Kestrels were built in Australia by R. New, R. Basillie and the last by P. Pratt. Whilst no remains exist of the British built aircraft all three Australian-built ones are in museums.
W. L. Manuel was born William Lancelot Manuel in 1903; parish records list their birthplace as Malling, Kent. Manuel spent their early life working at RAF Hawkinge Kent with 25 Fighter Squadrons, They were a key member in the establishment of the Channel Gliding Club (1930), and built an estimated 14 aircraft over their 84-year life. William Manuel retired in 1965 from the AC Cars company of the Thames Ditton; it is thought they were the company's chief planning engineer on retirement.

Cemetery GIS is a necropolis in the Giza Plateau. It derives its name from its proximity to pyramid G I (Khufu). The tombs are located on the south side of that pyramid and hence the name G I South Cemetery. Reisner thought the cemetery a continuation of the G7000 cemetery which is part of the Giza East Field. The construction postdates that of mastaba G 7070 of Sneferukhaf. Junker dated the cemetery to the reign of Menkaure based on the presence of granite powder thought to derive from the dressing of the second pyramid at Giza. Reisner allows for a possible construction date dating to the reign of Khafre.
This cemetery also contains several mastabas built of stone, which date to as late as the 6th Dynasty. Tombs from the time of Menkaure include the mastabas of the royal chamberlain Khaemnefert, the King's son Khufudjedef who was master of the royal largesse, and an official named Niankhre.
Mastabas
The following are a collection of mastabas found in this cemetery. There are also many shafts without any superstructure that belong to this cemetery, but these have not been included in the table.
Unnumbered tombs from the G I S cemetery include:

Alice Laura Embleton (1876 – 1960) was one of the first women to study sciences at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, and among the first group of women to be appointed Fellows of the Linnean Society in 1905. A biologist and zoologist, Embleton developed work on pesticides to improve crop production. They were also a noted suffragist.
Education and early life
Embleton was born in Epsom, Surrey, and attended Sutton High School for Girls. They enrolled at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, now Cardiff University, in 1895, and graduated in 1899 with a Baccalaureus Scientia, first class.
Career and research
In 1900, they won the 1851 Exhibition Memorial Scholarship, which annually awards a three-year research scholarship to '"young scientists or engineers of exceptional promise". They used the £150 scholarship to work at the Balfour Laboratory at Newnham College, Cambridge, followed by a further period of study at the Sorbonne in Paris.  They are considered the second woman to publish on the topic of copepodology, after Edith Mary Pratt.
In 1903, they were appointed honorary zoologist to the Board of Agriculture, and won the Royal Society's Mackinnon studentship for research into Biological Sciences.
They were one of the first woman to speak at the Linnean Society, Burlington House, London. Them paper, delivered on 4 Jun 1903, was entitled: "Anatomy and Development of a Hymeropterous Parasite of a Scaly Insect (Lecanium Hemisphoericum)". Among with fifteen other women, they were made a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1905. The Linnean Society archives hold Embleton's correspondence with the Society, of which they remained a Fellow until 1917.
In 1906 they co-published the papers, "On the synapsis in amphibia" and "On the origin of the sertoli".
In later life they conducted cancer research at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington.
Personal and non-academic life
Embleton was connected with a number of noted suffragists, including Evelina Haverfield, Vera Holme, and Celia Wray. The 1911 census shows that Embleton was visiting Wray at Fairfield House, Barnsley on the day of the census. Like many suffragists, the two women defaced the census paper by recording their occupation as "Getting votes for women".
The four women set up the private 'Foosack League' between themselves, the membership of which was restricted to women and suffragists. Evidence suggests the Foosack League was a lesbian secret society. The Women's Library holds correspondence between the women during World War I, in which Embleton is referred to as 'Alick', and Wray as 'Mr Wary'. In their later years, Embleton lived with Wray at The Elms in Saxmundham in Suffolk.

Today Today was a drivetime radio show on Australia-wide radio station Triple J, broadcast between 3:00pm and 5:30pm weekdays during 2004 and 2005. The title is a parody of the Australian current affairs program Today Tonight on Channel Seven.
It was hosted by Chaser members Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel ("Chris and Craig"). The theme music to the show was the opening riff to the song "She Says What They Mean" by Canadian band Sloan
The show combined political satire, comedic discussion of the days events, and talkback from listeners with funny anecdotes on a given topic. Reucassel and Taylor also create satirical skits to play between program segments which lampoon commercial radio stations, current TV shows and topical world events. Other regular segments included the Small Talk Challenge, Two Types of People, Marketing Makeover and Pisslame Puns of the Week.
One of the shows recurring segments, Coma FM was a parody of many aspects of Australian commercial radio. These included radio hosts' nicknames, the low pitched Americanised accent, strange noises (such as the station's callsign), forced laughter at poor jokes, an emphasis on playing new music and not repeating any tracks, segments that play the "greatest hits from the 80s, 90s and mid-90s", large amounts of advertising and competitions – especially those that give away "cold hard cash". Coma FM also mocks the target audience of commercial radio with the use of callers and comments on many controversial issues such as the Bali Nine.
In late 2004, Chris and Craig took six weeks off to rejoin The Chaser team to produce an election special, The Chaser Decides, during the 2004 federal election campaign. The fill in hosts were Jason Whalley and Lindsay McDougall, aka Jay and the Doctor, who went on to become Triple J's breakfast show hosts from 2005 onwards.
On 6 December 2005, Chris and Craig broadcast the final Today Today program, and announced they and the rest of the Chaser team would be back on television in 2006. The show was The Chaser's War on Everything. The new host for Triple J's drive timeslot was Robbie Buck.
Chris and Craig returned to the airwaves in 2015 as part of Triple J's 40th birthday celebrations on sister radio station Double J.
Bloody Sunday
On 16 July 2006, Chris and Craig returned to Triple J for a temporary run with their show Bloody Sunday. They replaced Roy and HG's Sunday afternoon show This Sporting Life for four weeks. The show's first episode listed a single banana on eBay.
On 10 December 2006, the program resumed in the same slot for 9 weeks over summer, billing itself as 'non-ratings period radio at its most desperate.' Listeners could often hear a TV in the background of the studio, as Chris and Craig liked to have the cricket or CNN on during the show. On the first show of 2007, Craig ran about an hour late for the show, illuminating the team's undivided devotion to the Sunday afternoon slot. The pair also predicted Naomi Robson's appearance on dancing with the stars in 2007.

Crown House (formerly known as West Villa and Victoria House) is a residential building on the seafront of St Leonards-on-Sea, a 19th-century planned seaside resort on the coast of East Sussex, England. It was the first building completed in the town, which was planned and laid out by architect and property developer James Burton, and they used it as their own house. Intended as "a high-class watering place by the sea, along the best lines [and] for the best people", St Leonards-on-Sea was overshadowed by its larger neighbour Hastings and was merged into that town before the end of the 19th century, but Burton's venture was initially successful—particularly after a Royal visit in 1834–35 when the Duchess of Kent and the future Queen Victoria stayed at Crown House throughout the winter.
The house, an "elegant" three-bay villa in the Classical style, survived wartime damage and the threat of demolition, and was restored in 1951–52. It spent about 60 years in commercial use before reverting to residential use 2013. It is listed as Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance, and lies within one of Hastings Borough Council's designated conservation areas.
History
James Burton was one of the most successful builders and property developers of the late 18th and early 19th centuries: they built extensively in the Bloomsbury and Regent's Park areas of London and worked alongside John Nash, "play[ing] a vital part in the major London building projects" of the prominent Regency architect. By the 1820s they were in their 60s and very rich, but rather than retiring from property development they decided to undertake a major speculative project on the East Sussex coast west of the ancient town of Hastings. Although it is not known for certain why they chose this location, Hastings had grown rapidly in popularity in the early 19th century—prompted in part by the beauty of its undeveloped surroundings—and Burton is known to have visited the area in 1815, the year in which an influential guidebook to "watering-places" was republished.
Land belonging to the former manor of Gensing, between Hastings and the former Cinque Port of Bulverhythe, became available in 1827, and Burton purchased a large site from the Eversfield baronets. The transaction was completed on 27 February 1828 at a cost of £7,800. The site included a steep, wooded valley and a flat sea-facing swathe of fields; it lay across the boundary of St Leonard's and St Mary Magdalene's parishes. The former was named after one of Hastings' ancient parish churches which disappeared several centuries previously, while the medieval Hospital of St Mary Magdalene gave its name to the latter, first described in the mid-17th century.
Work began on the new town in early 1828, when proposals for a crescent of "commodious residences for large respectable families" were announced, as well as a new road which would reduce the length of the journey from London to the coast by . By April 1828, though, work on Burton's own house had taken precedence after plans for the seafront crescent were altered. The timber-framed structure of the building was assembled in London, at Burton's own workshops; because of the poor condition of the roads locally, the completed framework and the other materials required to finish the building were transported by sea on a sloop to Hastings and were then conveyed to the site on horse-drawn wagons. The building contractor was "Yorky" Smith, who had built several Martello towers on the East Sussex coast before moving to Hastings and "play[ing] an important part in the physical development" of the area.
Burton's son Decimus Burton, who had opposed their father's elaborate plans for the new town and was concerned that they had overspent—potentially bringing ruin upon the family—decided that "a royal visit would give the town the push it needed" to thrive. In August 1834 the Duchess of Kent Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and their then teenage daughter Princess Victoria were in Royal Tunbridge Wells to lay the foundation stone of a new school designed by Decimus Burton. At the ceremony they described "the delights of their father's new town" and encouraged them to spend the winter in St Leonards-on-Sea; and James Burton followed this up with an invitation for them to stay at Crown House.
They arrived on 4 November 1834 to much public acclaim, with a triumphal arch, 21-gun salute, public addresses, banquets and other festivities. The visit, which was "an outstanding success", concluded on 29 January 1835 when the princesses returned to London. "Such royal patronage was exactly what Burton had hoped for, as it assured the success of their new town as a fashionable watering place on the coast." Burton renamed the building Victoria House after this visit, but the name was changed back to Crown House after Victoria became Queen in 1837. Burton died in March of that year and was buried at the nearby St Leonard's Church.
The building was damaged during World War II in a bombing raid which also destroyed the neighbouring hotel. Demolition was proposed in 1950 because of its poor condition: Hastings Borough Council voted against it being statutorily listed, describing it as "a redundant building with an out-of-date design" and "fake Greek architecture".
Despite this, it was listed the following year by the Ministry of Works, the government department responsible for heritage assets at that time. By 1952 Crown House had been restored and ownership passed to the National Assistance Board, which was based there until the mid-1960s. It was then converted into the Tudor Rose Social Club, and from 2002 it was used as a pub with the name Crown House. The premises included a function room and a restaurant. This closed by 2013 and residential conversion followed.
Architecture and heritage
Crown House was listed as Grade II* on 19 January 1951. This defines it as a "particularly important" building of "more than special interest". As of February 2001, it was one of 13 Grade II* listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings.
The building is part of the St Leonards West Conservation Area, one of 18 conservation areas in the borough of Hastings.
The central seafront of St Leonards-on-Sea is dominated by tall Regency-style terraces built between the early 1830s and the mid-1850s, all designed by James Burton. Crown House forms an "atypical break in the overall composition" through its shorter height and "architectural expressiveness". "Much smaller and more elegant" than the adjacent terraces and the "crass" postwar block immediately to its west, it is a Classical-style building of two storeys with a symmetrical three-bay façade. The walls are of painted stucco; the ground floor has a series of recessed painted panels flanking the windows, which are also set in recessed panels with segmental-headed arches. The central entrance door is also set back. At first-floor level, fluted Ionic columns rise to support an entablature and cornice whose parapet has a shallow pediment in the middle. There are three windows: a tall sash in the centre, flanked by pilasters, and pilastered bay windows to each side. A "delicate wrought iron railing" runs across the width of the first floor.

The galvanic series (or electropotential series) determines the nobility of metals and semi-metals. When two metals are submerged in an electrolyte, while also electrically connected by some external conductor, the less noble (base) will experience galvanic corrosion. The rate of corrosion is determined by the electrolyte, the difference in nobility, and the relative areas of the anode and cathode exposed to the electrolyte. The difference can be measured as a difference in voltage potential: the less noble metal is the one with a lower (that is, more negative) electrode potential than the nobler one, and will function as the anode (electron or anion attractor) within the electrolyte device functioning as described above (a galvanic cell). Galvanic reaction is the principle upon which batteries are based.
See the table of standard electrode potentials for more details.

The Eighth Seimas of Lithuania was a parliament (Seimas) elected in Lithuania. Elections took place on 8 October 2000. The Seimas commenced its work on 19 October 2000 and served a four-year term, with the last session on 11 November 2004.
Elections
In the elections in 2000, 70 members of the parliament were elected on proportional party lists and 71 in single member constituencies. Elections took place on 8 October 2000. No run-off was held in single seat constituencies and the candidate with the most votes was declared a winner.
Liberal Union became the largest party in the parliament after winning 34 seats, followed by 29 seats won by New Union (Social Liberals). The Social-Democratic Coalition of Algirdas Brazauskas won 51 seats, with the largest party in the coalition, Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania, winning 26.
Two Modern Christian-Democratic Union candidates were elected in the proportional vote, having run on the lists of the New Union (Social Liberals) and the Liberal Union of Lithuania.
Activities
Artūras Paulauskas was elected as the Speaker of the Eighth Seimas. After the impeachment of Rolandas Paksas, Paulauskas acted as the President of Lithuania from 6 April 2004 until 12 July 2004. Česlovas Juršėnas acted as the Speaker of the Seimas during the time.
The Eighth Seimas saw an initial ruling coalition of Liberals and New Union (Social Liberals), which lasted less than a year. By July 2001, New Union (Social Liberals) joined the Social Democratic Coalition, headed by Algirdas Brazauskas. Under the term of the Seimas, Lithuania joined the European Union and NATO. It continued privatizations of energy enterprises (e. g. Lietuvos dujos and Lietuvos energija). Also this Seimas oversaw the impeachment of President of Republic Rolandas Paksas.
Composition
Parliamentary groups
During the first session of the Seimas the following parliamentary groups were registered: Social Democratic Coalition, Liberals, New Union (Social Liberals), Homeland Union - Conservatives, Peasant and New Democracy Parties and the Mixed Group of Members of the Seimas.
At the beginning of the session, a quota (7 members) for parliamentary group formation has been introduced. This change came after experience with previous Seimas, in which parliamentary group might have been as small as 2 members.
Substantial shifts between parliamentary groups occurred during the term. In 2001, numerous members of the Liberals parliamentary group either joined Independent parliamentary group (in 2002 it renamed itself to the Liberal Democratic parliamentary group) or Homeland Union - Conservatives parliamentary group. In 2003, this parliamentary group was joined by the several members from Mixed Group and formed Liberal and Center parliamentary group.
Similar process happened in New Union (Social Liberals) parliamentary group between 2002 and 2004, when numerous members moved to the Social Democratic Coalition or Liberal Democratic parliamentary group. By the end of the term of the Seimas, the following parliamentary groups were active.
Members
A total of 151 members served on the Eighth Seimas.

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Phillips County was established.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.

A rubber tyred gantry crane / RTG (crane), or sometimes transtainer, is a wheeled mobile gantry crane operated to ground or stack intermodal containers. Inbound containers are stored for future pickup by drayage trucks, and outbound are stored for future loading onto vessels. RTGs typically straddle multiple lanes, with one lane reserved for container transfers.
Advantages:its mobility gives a rubber tyred gantry crane wide appliance
Being mobile, RTGs are often powered by diesel generator systems (gensets) of . Due to the lack of an electrical grid to dump energy when containers are being lowered they often have large resistor packs to rapidly dissipate the energy of a lowering or decelerating container. Diesel-powered RTGs are notorious polluters at ports, as each burns up to of diesel fuel.
There are also electric rubber tired gantry cranes. The first electrified rubber-tyred gantry cranes (ERTG) in China was unveiled by the Kou container terminal (SCT) in Shenzhen in Aug 2008. Rubber-tired gantry cranes are also being electrified at the Port of Long Beach to improve air quality, with funding from the California Energy Commission.
Aside from the intermodal industry, RTGs also are extensively used in industry. Applications include erecting large unbalanced structures, assembling large manufacturing components, and positioning pipelines.

Bruderschaft is an electronic music collective led by New York City-based DJ Rexx Arkana. Conceived as a charity project focused on cancer research and treatment in the wake of Arkana's father's death from the disease, Bruderschaft brought together a large number of artists from the underground electronic music scene for the production of the band's first single, "Forever": the collaboration of Arkana (lyrics), Ronan Harris (VNV Nation - vocals), Sebastian Komor (Icon of Coil - programming/production), Joakim Montelius (Covenant - samples/loops) and Stephan Groth (Apoptygma Berzerk - backing vocals).
After the death of their father in 1999, Rexx Arkana shared with Ronan Harris and Joakim Montelius the lyrics they wrote for "Forever" and they were willing to help turn it into a proper song. In 2001, Arkana discussed the project with Sebastian Komor, who produced the basic track that later became "Forever" using loops that Montelius had made. In 2002, Harris was still willing to perform the lead vocals on the song and Stephan Groth was willing to perform backing vocals after hearing a rough version of the song.
Released by RazorBurn Records, in European partnership with Alfa-Matrix in 2003, the "Forever" EP (also available in a 2-Disc Limited Edition) featured a large list of remixers, including Front 242, Camouflage, Feindflug, Melotron, The Retrosic, Negative Format, Angels & Agony, Colony 5, Lights of Euphoria, DavaNtage, Grendel, Punto Omega, [:SITD:]. "Forever" peaked at #1 on the DAC Singles charts and was ranked #7 on the DAC Top Singles of 2003.
In keeping with the founding concept behind the project, all net profits from the global sales of the CD were augmented by the proceeds of local release parties in cities around the world, raising nearly $50,000 for charity.
In 2005, Bruderschaft was working on "Return", the band's second release. On the title track, the second incarnation of the group was to feature the programming talents of returning contributor Sebastian Komor, newcomer Johann Sebastian (State of the Union - composer); new vocalist Tom Shear (Assemblage 23); and lyricist Rexx Arkana (FGFC820).
A second new original from the band, "Trigger," features music written by Arkana and "Forever" remixer/FGFC820 member Dräcos and System Syn founder/vocalist Clint Carney. On January 21, 2009, it was revealed that the song would be released as part of an EP.
The band performed at the 2011 Kinetik Festival playing unreleased material with Tom Shear, Clint Carney, and Aesthetic Perfection founder/vocalist Daniel Graves.
In 2013, Bruderschaft returned with the single "Falling," featuring Daniel Myer of Haujobb on vocals. The collective announced that their EP Return will be released through the Alfa Matrix label later this year. Return was released in November 2013 as a nine-song CD; some versions contain a bonus CD with remixes.

Swasthya Adhikar Manch is a nonprofit organization in India which advocates for safety in clinical trials.
A women's branch advocated for health safety.
Amulya Nidhi has said that pharma companies wish to avoid all regulation of their research, and because of this, people have to advocate for themselves.
The organization filed a public interest litigation in 2012 asking for government intervention. That petition became Swasthya Adhikar Manch v. Union of India, a court case. The Supreme Court of India sided with the organization in 2013 on a case about clinical trial safety. In response, the government halted approval of new clinical trials until regulation was in place.
The organization has made some progress in improving safety of clinical trials.
In 2020 the organization commented that despite advances, transparency of health research information for the research participant is still not a common practice.

The North Charleston Intermodal Transportation Center is an intermodal transit station in North Charleston, South Carolina, United States. It serves as the Amtrak train station for the Greater Charleston area as well as a bus terminus for the Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA) and Southeastern Stages, a regional intercity bus common carrier. The street address is 4565 Gaynor Avenue, and is located in the Liberty Hill neighborhood.
History
Project for the current station began in 1996 with a feasibility study and site selection lead by CARTA. The site chosen was a tract located on West Montague Avenue, wedged between Dorchester Road and Interstate 526. From 1997-2007 the project went through a series of refinements, land purchasing and required NEPA assessments. With a 2007 groundbreaking, construction began with infrastructure and a park and ride lot.
In 2009, Davis & Floyd, Inc. joined the project, providing the architectural design and engineering for the building. The final design was a two-story double-towered edifice, evoking the architecture style of the Charleston Union Station that existed from 1907 to 1947. The facility was to included leasable space, restaurant/retail space, CARTA administration offices, additional meeting space and operations for Amtrak, CARTA and Southeastern Stages. In 2010, the project qualified for the State of Good Repair Program, providing Federal dollars from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).
In 2012, because of the close proximity to the CSX Bennett Yard, the company rejected a platform permit without sidetrack. Additional costs related to constructing a sidetrack, so the station would not impede freight rail traffic, made the site no longer cost feasible thus stopping the project.
In 2014, CARTA began the process of relocating the project to Gaynor Avenue, adjacent to the existing Amtrak station. new NEPA and NHPA assessments were started as well zoning, permits, redesign and disposal of the Montague Avenue site. Bus tests were conducted on July 29, 2014 to confirm vertical clearance under Sevenmile Viaduct.
In 2015, project management and ownership was transferred from CARTA to the city of North Charleston. To keep costs within the $14.5 million budget, the new facility was downsized from to , eliminating the leasable space, restaurant/retail space and CARTA administration offices. On February 2, 2016, the FTA gave final approval citing no significant impact on the environment. Phase one of construction began on August 24, 2017 with the new building and reconstruction of one-half of the side platform. The North Charleston Intermodal Transportation Center officially opened with early-morning train service on December 13, 2018.
In 2019, phase two of construction includes the razing of the Atlantic coastline depot, reconstructing the remaining half of the side platform, roadway modifications, CARTA bus turnoffs and vehicle parking.
Atlantic coastline depot
Opened in 1956, the Atlantic coastline (ACL) depot reflects mid-century modern design popular at the time of construction. It is characterized by clean lines and minimal ornamentation. Typical features of the mid-century modern aesthetic found in the Charleston depot include a flat roof, large groupings of windows with horizontal lights, and shallow cantilevered canopies at the first and second floors. Red brick and dyed-green concrete panels arranged in alternating horizontal bands emphasize the building's rectilinear lines. Public spaces feature exposed brick on the lower walls and floors of durable green terrazzo; both materials can stand the wear and tear of large crowds and are easy to maintain.
Passenger service was located on the first floor. As the station was built during the height of segregation, it was built with two separate waiting areas, each with their own sets of restrooms. In the days of segregation, whites used one waiting area and blacks used the other. The second floor housed the ACL freight office for the Charleston division; the office closed when became part of CSX Transportation's Florence division. In 1967, ACL merged with Seaboard Air Line Railroad to become Seaboard coastline Railroad (SCL). In 1971, passenger operations was transferred to Amtrak, while the station remained owned by SCL (later CSX Transportation). In 1972, the city of North Charleston was incorporated. In the 1980s, fencing topped with barbed wire surrounded the station after a rash of burglaries.
On December 13, 2018, all passenger rail service was relocated to the North Charleston Intermodal Transportation Center and the former Atlantic coastline/Amtrak station was officially closed.
Because the station was eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the City of North Charleston and CARTA made an agreement with the South Carolina State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) that they will provide measured drawings and professional photography of the interior and exterior, to be submitted to SHPO and Clemson University as the repositories. An erection of a state historic marker. And salvage one of the exterior green tiles (before or during demolition) and include it and other photographs and information related to the station in the North Charleston Intermodal Transportation Center museum space.
Services
The station is served by two Amtrak routes, for a total of four trains daily:
The (daytime train), with the northbound train at 10:00am and the southbound train at 7:19pm.
The (overnight train), with the northbound train at 9:17pm and the southbound train at 4:51am.
Amtrak operating hours are at 4:00am–11:45am and at 4:00pm–11:45pm, which includes the ticket counter, passenger assistance and baggage service.
The station appears in Amtrak timetables as Charleston.
Layout
The nearly single-story station is constructed in brown brick and textured concrete masonry units, with stylized pilasters that visually break up the long, horizontal facades. At one end is a tower, while a projecting bay with triangular parapet and clock face marks the main entrance. A network of canopies protects travelers from inclement weather as they arrive or depart by car, bus or rail. The steeply pitched, hipped seamed-metal roof has prominent shed dormer windows that, along with numerous other windows at ground level, allow natural light into the facility.
The interior is set up with an entry concourse, Amtrak concourse and passenger concourse through the center connecting CARTA and Southeastern Stages at opposite ends. The floor has light and dark gray diamond pattern and accented with organic stone and wood elements. The facility is fully ADA compliant and offers additional meeting space and a museum to the Liberty Hill neighborhood.

Charles Langdale (formerly Stourton); 19 September 1787 – 1 December 1868) was a British politician, Roman Catholic layperson, and biographer. They served as Whig Member of Parliament, wrote the memoirs of Maria Fitzherbert, and was a leading Roman Catholic figure during the 19th century.
Origins
Langdale was born Hon. Charles Stourton in 1787, the fourth son of Charles Stourton, 17th Baron Stourton by their wife Mary Langdale, a daughter and co-heiress of Marmaduke Langdale, 5th Baron Langdale (1771–1777). They became the heir of their mother's cousin Philip Langdale (d.1815) of Houghton Hall, East Riding of Yorkshire, who died with no sons, and to comply with the terms of their inheritance they adopted the surname Langdale by royal licence dated 1815, for themselves and their descendants.
Education
They were educated at Oscott College and Stonyhurst College.
Politics and public life
Langdale campaigned for Catholic Emancipation, and after the passing of the Catholic Relief Act 1829 they became Member of Parliament for Beverley following the 1832 general election, becoming one of the first Roman Catholics in the House of Commons. They represented Beverly until 1835, and represented Knaresborough between 1837 and 1841.
Throughout their life, Langdale took a leading part in all matters relating to the interests of Roman Catholics. They supported the foundation and became the chairperson of the Catholic Poor School Committee, serving until their death. During their tenure, they played an important role in the negotiations for public funds for Roman Catholic schools.
Shortly before their death, they were admitted as a lay brother of the Society of Jesus. At their funeral, Peter Gallwey described them as "the acknowledged father and patriarch of the oppressed Catholic community in England" and as "a father to us all". Henry Edward Manning, Archbishop of Westminster, in a funeral sermon in London, described them as having been for fifty years the foremost man among the Roman Catholic laity in England.
Biography of Maria Fitzherbert
Langdale had been a close friend of Maria Fitzherbert during their youth; there was a family connection through their first husband George Weld, whose niece married their eldest brother William. In the publication Memoirs of Lord Holland, it was claimed that Fitzherbert, a Roman Catholic, never believed their marriage vows to George, Prince of Wales, to be in any way binding (the marriage was considered invalid under the Royal Marriages Act 1772 because it had not been approved by King George III and the Privy Council). With a view to the vindication of their character, they published Memoirs of Mrs. Fitzherbert: with an account of their marriage with H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, afterwards King George IV at the request of their brother, Lord Stourton, one of the trustees named in Fitzherbert's will. They were refused access to their papers by the other trustees, but they were able to use the narrative drawn up by Lord Stourton. The memoirs showed that Fitzherbert believed themselves to be George's wife.
Marriage and children
They married twice:
Firstly in 1817 to Charlotte Mary Clifford (died 1819), fifth daughter of Charles Clifford, 6th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, by whom they had two daughters.
Secondly in 1821 they married May Constable-Maxwell (died 1857), the eldest daughter of Marmaduke William Haggerstone Constable-Maxwell, by whom they had at least five sons and six daughters.
Death and succession
They died in Mayfair, London, in 1868 and was buried near their seat, Houghton Hall, Yorkshire. They were succeeded by their eldest son, Charles Joseph Langdale (1822-1895).

The Bangladesh cricket team toured Sri Lanka in July 2019 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches. Originally, the tour was scheduled to take place in December 2019, but it was moved to avoid clashing with the 2019–20 Bangladesh Premier League tournament.
On 11 May 2019, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Nazmul Hasan Papon stated that the Bangladesh team was unlikely to proceed with a planned tour to Sri Lanka in July, citing fears that the country could be hit by another terrorist attack, following the Easter bombings on 21 April 2019. On 27 June 2019, it was reported that four National Security Intelligence (NSI) personnel, the civilian intelligence agency of Bangladesh, were sent to Sri Lanka to assess the situation. On 8 July 2019, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the tour would go ahead, with all three matches played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
For the series, Sri Lanka named a squad of twenty-two players, which was later trimmed down to the final squad of seventeen. Chief Selector, Ashantha de Mel, said this would allow them to experiment with the line-ups for each match on an individual basis. Prior to the series, Bangladesh's captain Mashrafe Mortaza was ruled out of the tour due to a hamstring injury. Tamim Iqbal was named as captain for the first time in ODIs.
Sri Lankan bowler Lasith Malinga retired from ODIs following the first match of the series in Colombo. They took a wicket with their final ball, finishing their career as the ninth-highest wicket-taker in ODIs, with 338 dismissals. Sri Lanka Cricket announced that the final ODI was dedicated to Sri Lankan bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who retired from international cricket before the series.
Sri Lanka won the first two ODI matches, therefore taking an unassailable lead and winning the series. It was their first ODI series win at home since beating the West Indies 3–0 in November 2015. Sri Lanka won the third match by 122 runs to win the series 3–0.
Squads
Ahead of the series, Mashrafe Mortaza and Mohammad Saifuddin were ruled out of Bangladesh's squad due to injury and were replaced by Farhad Reza and Taskin Ahmed respectively. On 23 July 2019, Shafiul Islam was added to Bangladesh's squad.
Amila Aponso, Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Lakshan Sandakan, Lahiru Madushanka were named in Sri Lanka's initial twenty-two-man squad, but did not make the final seventeen cricketers for the series.

BIFS is MPEG-4 scene description protocol to compose MPEG-4 objects, describe interaction with MPEG-4 objects and to animate MPEG-4 objects.
MPEG-4 Binary Format for Scene (BIFS) is used in Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB).
The XMT framework accommodates substantial portions of SMIL, W3C Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and X3D (the new name of VRML). Such a representation can be directly played back by a SMIL or VRML player, but can also be binarised to become a native MPEG-4 representation that can be played by an MPEG-4 player. Another bridge has been created with BiM (Binary MPEG format for XML).

This Is Our Year is a 2011 book by journalist Declan Bogue.
Content
An examination of the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship from the perspectives of ten Gaelic footballers from Ulster, the book achieved notoriety after Donegal footballer Kevin Cassidy was dropped from the team squad by manager Jim McGuinness over their contributions. Cassidy has not played for Donegal since. They released a statement in November 2011 saying it "appears my inter-county career is over".
At the post-match press conference following the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final Jim McGuinness declined to answer questions until Bogue was ejected. When Bogue was removed from the room McGuinness explained,
Bogue has since responded with a public statement stating that although they hold no issue with McGuinness they would like to hear what they have taken issue with as no specific details were put forward by the Donegal man. They stand by their book and believes that they have no case to answer.

The Monsan River is a tributary of Lake Monsan which is crossed by the Maicasagi River located at Eeyou Istchee Baie-James (municipality), in the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec, in the Canadian province of Quebec, in Canada.
The course of the Monsan River is entirely in the Southwestern part of the Assinica Wildlife Sanctuary.
The hydrographic slope of the Monsan River is served by a secondary road along the north shore of the Waswanipi River and separating from road 113 connecting Lebel-sur-Quévillon to Chibougamau and passing in Waswanipi.
The surface of the Monsan River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Geography
The main hydrographic slopes near the Monsan River are:
North side: Lucky Strike Creek, Assinica River, Broadback River;
East side: Lake Capichigau, Caupichigau River, Omo River;
South side: Maicasagi River, Caupichigau River, La Trêve River, Omo River;
West side: Lake Rocher, Maicasagi River, Nipukatasi River, Chensagi River.
The Monsan River rises at the mouth of a small unidentified lake (length: altitude: ). This source of the river is located at:
North of the mouth of the Monsan River (confluence with Lake Monsan);
Northeast of the mouth of the Maicasagi River (confluence with Maicasagi Lake);
North of the mouth of the Omo River (confluence with the Maicasagi River);
Northeast of the mouth of Goéland Lake (Waswanipi River);
Northeast of the mouth of Matagami Lake;
Southeast of the mouth of the Nottaway River);
Northeast of downtown Matagami.
From the head lake, the "Monsan River" flows on according to the following segments:
South, crossing an unidentified lake (length: ; altitude: ), up to the mouth;
Southeast, crossing an unidentified lake (length: ; altitude: ), up to at its mouth;
South to a creek (coming from the northeast);
South, then southwest, to the mouth.
The Monsan River flows on the Northeast shore of Lake Monsan, which is crossed to the Southeast by the Maicasagi River. From there, it flows Southeast, Southwest, and West to the East shore of Maicasagi Lake. Then the current flows Southwest through the Max Passage into the Goéland Lake. The latter is crossed to the Northwest by the Waswanipi River which is a tributary of Matagami Lake.
The mouth of the Monsan River located at:
North of the mouth of Moisan Lake;
Northeast of the mouth of the Maicasagi River (confluence with Maicasagi Lake);
Northeast of the mouth of [Goéland Lake (Waswanipi River)]];
Northeast of the mouth of Olga Lake (Waswanipi River);
North of the village center of Waswanipi;
North of downtown Matagami
Toponymy
The term "Monsan" is a family name of French origin.
The toponym "Monsan River" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, i.e. at the creation of this commission

Rodney Ripps (born December 6, 1950) is an American artist, painter, and sculptor. Ripps is most known for textural density, heavy layering of materials, and heightened canvases in their work, often produced with high volumes of oil paint and incorporation of artificial leaves and metals, among other materials.
Early and personal life
Rodney Ripps was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Anne (née Jacobie) and Sol Michael Ripps. Their father owned and operated a dry cleaning service in Manhattan, New York. Ripps graduated from Andrew Jackson High School in Cambria Heights, Queens, New York.  They are an alumnus of both Hunter College and York College.
On December 2, 1979, Ripps married designer and academic Helene Verin in the latter's hometown of Chicago. They divorced when their son, conceptual artist Ryder Ripps, was nine years old. They have another son, Ezra, who is a programmer.
Career
Ripps rose to prominence in the 1970s. In 1977, Ripps participated in their first group exhibition, "Painting 75/76/77" at the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center. Ripps was an affiliate of Andy Warhol's, posing for a series of Polaroid photographs shot by the latter. Ripps was also mentioned in Warhol's journals and appeared as a guest on the talk show Andy Warhol's TV. Early in their career, Ripps worked in construction as a source of supplemental income. Ripps' illustration, "Rosette", was present in the Whitney Museum's 1979 Biennial event.
Style and critical reception
Ripps' work has been tethered to a variety of American artistic movements, most notably neo-expressionism and ornamentalism. This is, in part, the result of Ripps' continuous incantation of nature in their work. In a 1979 review in ArtForum, art critic Donald B. Kuspit attempted to term Ripps' work as a "Cosmetic Transcendentalism". This terminology defined Ripps' work as a self-conscious form of transcendentalism that, through vibrancy of colors, scale, and textural variety, embrace "its own cosmetic character, and which is an expression of a theatrical ambition" of the contemporary artistic landscape. Ripps' paintings are often supplemented with artificial leaves made of linen, often bound together and worked over heavily with thick layers of oil paint.
Ripps' work has retrospectively been defined by art historians as an unspoken influence of Julian Schnabel, a sentiment echoed by Ripps himself.
Notable works
Two of Ripps' works, "Untitled" (1976) and "The Meadow" (1980) belong to the permanent collection at the Brooklyn Museum under their Contemporary Arts wing. Six of Ripps' work belong to the Vogel 50x50 collection. "Odyssey in Space" (1980), is part of the permanent collection at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, France

In chemistry, the Z-matrix is a way to represent a system built of atoms. A Z-matrix is also known as an internal coordinate representation. It provides a description of each atom in a molecule in terms of its atomic number, bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle, the so-called internal coordinates, although it is not always the case that a Z-matrix will give information regarding bonding since the matrix itself is based on a series of vectors describing atomic orientations in space. However, it is convenient to write a Z-matrix in terms of bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals since this will preserve the actual bonding characteristics. The name arises because the Z-matrix assigns the second atom along the Z axis from the first atom, which is at the origin.
Z-matrices can be converted to Cartesian coordinates and back, as the structural information content is identical, the position and orientation in space, however is not meaning the Cartesian coordinates recovered will be accurate in terms of relative positions of atoms, but will not necessarily be the same as an original set of Cartesian coordinates if you convert Cartesian coordinates to a Z matrix and back again. While the transform is conceptually straightforward, algorithms of doing the conversion vary significantly in speed, numerical precision and parallelism. These matter because macromolecular chains, such as polymers, proteins, and DNA, can have thousands of connected atoms and atoms consecutively distant along the chain that may be close in Cartesian space (and thus small round-off errors can accumulate to large force-field errors.) The optimally fastest and most numerically accurate algorithm for conversion from torsion-space to cartesian-space is the Natural Extension Reference Frame method. Back-conversion from Cartesian to torsion angles is simple trigonometry and has no risk of cumulative errors.
They are used for creating input geometries for molecular systems in much molecular modelling and computational chemistry programs. A skillful choice of internal coordinates can make the interpretation of results straightforward. Also, since Z-matrices can contain molecular connectivity information (but do not always contain this information), quantum chemical calculations such as geometry optimization may be performed faster, because an educated guess is available for an initial Hessian matrix, and more natural internal coordinates are used rather than Cartesian coordinates.
The Z-matrix representation is often preferred, because this allows symmetry to be enforced upon the molecule (or parts thereof) by setting certain angles as constant. The Z-matrix simply is a representation for placing atomic positions in a relative way with the obvious convenience that the vectors it uses easily correspond to bonds. A conceptual pitfall is to assume all bonds appear as a line in the Z-matrix which is not true. For example: in ringed molecules like benzene, a z-matrix will not include all six bonds in the ring, because all of the atoms are uniquely positioned after just 5 bonds making the 6th redundant.
Example
The methane molecule can be described by the following Cartesian coordinates (in Ångströms):
C 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
H 0.000000 0.000000 1.089000
H 1.026719 0.000000 -0.363000
H -0.513360 -0.889165 -0.363000
H -0.513360 0.889165 -0.363000
Re-orientating the molecule leads to Cartesian coordinates that make the symmetry more obvious. This removes the bond length of 1.089 from the explicit parameters.
C 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
H 0.628736 0.628736 0.628736
H -0.628736 -0.628736 0.628736
H -0.628736 0.628736 -0.628736
H 0.628736 -0.628736 -0.628736
The corresponding Z-matrix, which starts from the carbon atom, could look like this:
C
H 1 1.089000
H 1 1.089000 2 109.4710
H 1 1.089000 2 109.4710 3 120.0000
H 1 1.089000 2 109.4710 3 -120.0000
Only the 1.089000 value is not fixed by tetrahedral symmetry.

Silene italica is a species of plant native to Southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is also introduced to parts of the United States and Northern Europe.
Silene italica is similar to Silene nutans and contains various subspecies.
Common names
In English, it goes by the common name Italian catchfly. While in Denmark it is called Italiensk limurt and in Germany it is called Italienisches Leimkraut.
Etymology
Silene is the feminine form of Silenus, an Ancient Greek woodland deity who was the companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus.
Italica is the feminine form of Italicus, meaning "of Italy"
Subspecies
The following is a list of subspecies for S. Italica.
Silene italica subsp. italica
Silene italica subsp. peloponnesiaca
Silene italica subsp. sicula
Silene italica subsp. coutinhoi
Silene italica subsp. nemoralis
Silene italica subsp. puberula
Characteristics
It can grow up to 40 cm or 80 cm high and the stems are erect. The species has kidney-shaped seeds. The petals on the flowers can be pink, white, or yellow.
Sexual system
It is gynodioecious–gynomonoecious and has a low frequency of female plants. Gynomonoecious individuals are common in the species and make up to 40% of the population.
Floral scent
A study from 2002 found that both terpenoids and benzenoids were dominating over the floral scent of S. Italica. The study also found that chemical composition of S. Italica's floral scent is
2.2% benzyl alcohol
9% benzyl acetate
14.5% linalool
9% methylbenzoate
Distribution and habitat
Plants of the World Online says is native to places like Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Italy, Spain, Iran, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Palestine, Turkmenistan, Romania, and France and that it is present in Corsica, Denmark, Great Britain, and Germany but not native.
But the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International says that it was introduced to Belgium with it first being reported in 1918 and is also present in Austria and Slovakia.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, it was introduced to New Jersey and New York.
Throughout the Mediterranean region, S. Italica occurs in hedges as well as open woodlands. In southern France it is commonly found in the garrigue.
In Britain, it naturally occurs on chalky roadside banks and chalk quarries between Dartford and Greenhithe. It was first cultivated on the island in 1759 but was first found in the wild in 1863.

City of London Academy Islington (COLAI, formerly Islington Green School) is an 11–18 mixed, secondary school and sixth form with academy status in Islington, Greater London, England. It was established in 1966 and adopted its present name after becoming an academy in September 2008.
Its sixth form opened in September 2010 and is jointly sponsored by the City of London Corporation and City, University of London.
History
Islington Green School
Islington Green School (IGS) was established in 1966 and was an 11–16 mixed community secondary school.
The school failed its Ofsted inspection in 1997. The school had received a 38 percent pass rate the previous year and despite shortcomings, the staff were convinced that the school was not failing. The decision caused the school to "implode". The headteacher, under enormous pressure to make visible changes discarded mixed-ability teaching, many teachers decided to leave, and the pass rate dropped below 25 percent. The school went through nine inspections before it finally came out of special measures in 2000 and serious weaknesses in 2003.
Ken Muller, a teacher at the school and SWP activist, made a request to Ofsted under the new Freedom of Information Act to see the documents relating to the judgment. Twenty working days later, they got a reply. Most of the documents had been destroyed, said the email, but there was one that might be of interest. Attached was a memo dated November 1997, from HMI Barry Jones to the then chief inspector Chris Woodhead, making clear that the HMI team, of which Jones was a member, had disagreed with Ofsted's judgment, and noting that they were "of the unanimous view that the school was not failing".
Peter Hyman, former speechwriter for Tony Blair, decided to leave politics and teach at Islington Green School. They wrote a book of their experiences, 1 Out Of 10: From Downing Street Vision To Classroom Reality.
Cultural references
Students from the school were featured on Pink Floyd's 1979 album The Wall in the song "Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)".
The school was used as a location to film the BBC drama That Summer Day, a fictional account of the effect the bombings of the London public transport system on 7 July 2005 had on six children. Some of the school's younger students were allowed to be extras in the film.

Edgar Gabriel Marsden (25 March 1919 – 15 October 2010) was a Trinidad cricketer who played two matches of first-class cricket in 1949.
Edgar Marsden captained Trinidad in the only two first-class matches of the 1948-49 West Indies season, when Trinidad played Barbados twice at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, over two weeks in January and February 1949. They batted in the lower middle order and made 30 runs in three innings.
They also played several times for South Trinidad in the Beaumont Cup in the 1940s, usually as opening batsman and captain.
They and their wife Jean lived in the seaside suburb of Bayshore in Diego Martin, about five kilometres west of Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain.

FC Nikopol is a professional Ukrainian football club from the city of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk oblast and Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast before 2015. Another FC Nikopol has existed in Nikopol prior to relocation of FC Makiivvuhillya.
History
Makiyivvuhillya (Makeyevugol)
It should be mentioned that previously Makiivvuhillya was represented by a team of the Bazhanov coal mine known as FC Shakhtar Makiivka.
The current club was formed in Makiivka in 2009 and became professional in 2011 entering the Professional Football League of Ukraine and was based in Makiivka under the name FC Makiyivvuhillya Makiyivka. The name of the club is associated Makiyivka's coal industry, since the city of Makiyivka is close proximity to the city of Donetsk. The football team was created out of the state mining enterprise Makiyivvuhillya in the summer of 2009 to participate in the Coal Industry Cup. In the finals of the Coal Industry Cup, a tournament which Makiyivka defeated SE "Dzerzhynskvuhillya."
After the event the company decided to continue supporting the football team,
with general director Stanislav Tolchin becoming the honorary president of football club.
The President of the club became Anatoly Akimochkin and head coach was Spartak Zhyhulin.
In the winter of 2009, Makiyivvuhillya won the city championship in Makiyivka and finished 3rd in the Donetsk oblast championship.
In 2010 the team became a finalist of the Coal Industry Cup (losing to FC Shakhtar Sverdlovsk) and 3rd place again in the Donetsk oblast championship. In 2011, the team participated in the Ukrainian Amateur championship.
In the Second League the club played its home games at the Bazhanovets Stadium, which was also used by the former Soviet/Ukrainian club Shakhtar Makiyivka (also known as Bazhanovets) but the stadium was found lacking in facilities. Later the club played at Metalurh Stadium in Yenakiieve.
Nikopol-NPHU
In 2014, the club was forced to relocate to Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, due to the 2014 Russian aggression against Ukraine. It also lost its main sponsor Makiyivvuhillya, but in Nikopol the club was taken under its wing the Independent Trade Union of Miners of Ukraine (NPHU) which added own abbreviation to the club's name as Makeyevugol-NPHU. After the 2014–15 season the club formally withdrew from the PFL and reentered under the name of FC Nikopol-NPHU.
The club plays at the stadium of FC Elektrometalurh-NZF Nikopol, while trains at the stadium of FC Kolos Chkalove from Chkalove.
FC Nikopol
During the winter break of the 2016–17 Ukrainian Second League season, the club renamed themselves to FC Nikopol.
Other clubs in Nikopol
In Nikopol is another FC Nikopol that participated in the 2007 Ukrainian Amateur Cup and place third in football championships of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in 2009 and 2013. Both FC Nikopol and FC Kolos Chkalove were withdrawn from the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast championship in 2015.

Alicia Nitecki /ni'tetski/, (January 2, 1942 – September 5, 2021) was an American author and professor of English literature at Bentley University, Waltham, Massachusetts.
Early life in Europe
From 1942 to 1944 Alicia Nitecki lived in Nazi-occupied Warsaw with their upper-class family (House of Kurnatowski). After the crush of the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944 they and their family were deported by the Nazis to the west of Germany and finally lived in a labor camp in Lauterbach, Baden-Württemberg until 1945. After the war they were taken to a Polish displaced persons' camp in the Canton of La Courtine, France near Nantes and finally to Carqueiranne in southern France, where Alicia Nitecki went to a French elementary school until 1947.
In April 1948 the family came to England and frequently changed residences, which meant for Alicia frequent changes of educational institutions. They took their eleven plus exam at Scalford Church of England school, and, after another move to Derby, in the English midlands, they attended grammar school, and later a Catholic School, from which in 1960, they went to study English literature at Sheffield University, where William Empson was head of the English Department.
After graduation from Sheffield, Alicia Nitecki took a secretarial course at the City of London College, and worked as secretary and, additionally, as baby-sitter, in which capacity they were employed by the family of the American literary scholar Richard Ellmann.
Ellmann suggested that they should do graduate work in English in America and wrote them a recommendation. They were accepted at
the State University of New York in Buffalo in 1966.
Academic career in the US
They got their M.A. in English literature from Buffalo, and then went on to a Ph.D. program at Kent State University in Ohio, where they wrote their doctoral thesis in 1976. Since 1980 they have been professor of English literature at Bentley.
Nitecki' scholarly interest was in medieval English literature, but soon they became interested in The Holocaust after their first trip to Germany, where they went to the Flossenbürg concentration camp where their grandfather had been incarcerated.
Them interest in holocaust literature focussed on Tadeusz Borowski and other Polish writers who had survived the holocaust. In 2000 they translated Borowski's We were in Auschwitz and in 2002 Henryk Grynberg's Drohobycz, Drohobycz. Other translations include:
Halina Nelken: And Yet, I Am Here, trans. Nelken, Nitecki, University of Massachusetts Press, 1999 (Paperback 2001)
Tadeusz Drewnowski: Postal Indiscretions: The Correspondence of Tadeusz Borowski, trans. A. Nitecki Northwestern U. Press, 2007
Mieczyslaw Lurczynski: The Old Guard, trans. A. Nitecki SUNY Press, forthcoming 2009.
Nitecki has also published numerous essays in American and German periodicals and given lectures and presentations on both their scholarly interests, mediaeval English literature and the Holocaust, as reflected in Polish writings.
 They are married to Zbigniew Nitecki and has one daughter.

Arctops ("Bear face") is an extinct genus of gorgonopsian therapsids known from the Late Permian of South Africa. It measured up to in length and its skull was long. The type species is Arctops willistoni. A second species, A. watsoni, may be synonymous with A. willistoni. A. kitchingi may be a third species of Arctops, but it was only tentatively assigned to the genus when it was first named. Both were formally synonymized with A. willistoni by Christian Kammerer in 2017.

Rice County (standard abbreviation: RC) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 9,427. The largest city and county seat is Lyons. The county was named in memory of Samuel Allen Rice, Brigadier-General, United States volunteers, killed April 30, 1864, at Jenkins Ferry, Arkansas.
History
Early history
For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
19th century
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Rice County was established.
The Santa Fe Trail followed the route of present-day U.S. Route 56. Ruts in the earth from the trail are still visible in several locations. (Ralph's Ruts are visible in aerial photos at .)
In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, Ellinwood.

They have BSc from University of Allahabad, an MSc in Administrative Science and Development Problems from University of York, and is a MA in Political Science from Agra University.
Career
As an IAS officer
Shashi Kant Sharma served in key positions for both Union and Bihar Governments, like as the Excise Commissioner of Bihar, Labour Commissioner of Bihar, managing director of Bokaro Industrial Development Authority and as the District Magistrate and Collector of Patna, Singhbhum, Palamau and Bhagalpur in Bihar Government, and as the Union Defence Secretary, Union Financial Services Secretary, Union Information Technology Secretary, Director General (Acquisition) in Ministry of Defence, Additional Secretary in Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances in Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and as Additional Secretary in Ministry of Defence in the Union Government.
Post Retirement
Comptroller and Auditor General of India
Since taking over as CAG of India, Sharma has finalized more than 100 Audit Reports for the Union Government and 250 Audit Reports for the State Governments. Some of these reports relate to critical issues, such as the Agricultural Crop Insurance Scheme, Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, Flood control and Flood Forecasting, E-auction of coal mines, Environmental Clearance mechanism, Turnaround plan and financial restructuring of Air India, Sharing of Revenue by Private service providers in Telecom sector, Public Debt Management, Implementation of PAHAL (DBTL) Scheme by the Oil Marketing Companies, Construction of Indo China Border Roads by Border Roads Organisation, Audit of Pricing Mechanism of Major Petroleum Products, Audit of Hydrocarbon Production Sharing Contracts, Reports on Defence Services (Air Force and Navy), PPP Projects in NHAI, Defence Services (Army and Ordnance Factories and Defence PSUs), and Audit of Refit of Indian Naval Ships.
They were elected by the General Assembly of United Nations as a Member of the UN Board of Auditors in 2014 for a term of six years. Their other international responsibilities include Member of UN Panel of External Auditors, Chair of the Knowledge Sharing and Knowledge Services Committee of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), Chair of the Working Group of INTOSAI on I.T. Audit. They were also the Chairman of the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI) until February 2015, and is currently a member of its Governing Board.
In a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), Prashant Bhushan questioned the selection of former Defence Secretary, saying that there was conflict of interest in this appointment as CAG. The manner in which their appointment had been made adversely was thought of to possibly affect the perception of impartiality that is necessary for an independent constitutional office-holder. The Delhi High Court, by a detailed judgement in the Writ Petitions no 4653/2013 and WP 4619/2013 dated 13.08.2014, held that the appointment did not violate the principles of institutional integrity nor was the appointment arbitrary. The Hon'ble Court observed that they have an unblemished and impeccable record, and that their integrity cannot be doubted. The Petitioners challenged the Delhi High Court judgement before the Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in its order in SLP No.24328/2014 on 11 February 2015, dismissed the petition by holding that there was no good ground to interfere in the High Court's judgement and order. It did not accept Prashant Bhushan's plea for examining the appointment of Sharma as CAG, a Constitutional post, on the mere apprehension of conflict of interest. The Hon'ble Court accepted the submission of the Attorney General that Sharma had an exceptional career without blemish.
Sharma demitted the office of Comptroller and Auditor General of India on 24 September 2017.

Agile manufacturing is a term applied to an organization that has created the processes, tools, and training to enable it to respond quickly to customer needs and market changes while still controlling costs and quality. It's mostly related to lean manufacturing.
An enabling factor in becoming an agile manufacturer has been the development of manufacturing support technology that allows the marketers, the designers and the production personnel to share a common database of parts and products, to share data on production capacities and problems—particularly where small initial problems may have larger downstream effects. It is a general proposition of manufacturing that the cost of correcting quality issues increases as the problem moves downstream, so that it is cheaper to correct quality problems at the earliest possible point in the process.
Agile manufacturing is seen as the next step after lean manufacturing in the evolution of production methodology. The key difference between the two is like between a thin and an athletic person, agile being the latter. One can be neither, one nor both. In manufacturing theory, being both is often referred to as leagile.
According to Martin Christopher, when companies have to decide what to be, they have to look at the customer order cycle (COC) (the time the customers are willing to wait) and the leadtime for getting supplies. If the supplier has a short lead time, lean production is possible. If the COC is short, agile production is beneficial.
Agile manufacturing is an approach to manufacturing which is focused on meeting the needs of customers while maintaining high standards of quality and controlling the overall costs involved in the production of a particular product. This approach is geared towards companies working in a highly competitive environment, where small variations in performance and product delivery can make a huge difference in the long term to a company's survival and reputation among consumers.
This concept is closely related to lean manufacturing, in which the goal is to reduce waste as much as possible. In lean manufacturing, the company aims to cut all costs which are not directly related to the production of a product for the consumer. Agile manufacturing can include this concept, but it also adds an additional dimension, the idea that customer demands need to be met rapidly and effectively. In situations where companies integrate both approaches, they are sometimes said to be using "agile and lean manufacturing".
Companies which utilize an agile manufacturing approach tend to have very strong networks with suppliers and related companies, along with numerous cooperative teams which work within the company to deliver products effectively. They can retool facilities quickly, negotiate new agreements with suppliers and other partners in response to changing market forces, and take other steps to meet customer demands. This means that the company can increase production on products with a high consumer demand, as well as redesign products to respond to issues which have emerged on the open market.
Markets can change very quickly, especially in the global economy. A company which cannot adapt quickly to change may find itself left behind, and once a company starts to lose market share, it can fall rapidly. The goal of agile manufacturing is to keep a company ahead of the competition so that consumers think of that company first, which allows it to continue innovating and introducing new products, because it is financially stable and it has a strong customer support base.
Companies that want to switch to the use of agile manufacturing can take advantage of consultants who specialize in helping companies convert and improve existing systems. Consultants can offer advice and assistance which is tailored to the industry a company is involved in, and they usually focus on making companies competitive as quickly as possible with proved agile techniques. There are also a number of textbooks and manuals available with additional information on agile manufacturing techniques and approaches.
Another approach was developed combining the attributes of agility together with leanness across one supply chain is the hybrid lean-agile strategy. This blended lean-agile strategy hybridizes attributes of leanness (cost minimization, waste reduction, continuous improvement), agility (speed, flexibility, responsiveness) and leagility (mass customization, postponement) in one supply network. The significance of the hybridized lean aspect is higher upstream the supply chain than the agility dimension in the same supplier node, compared to downstream the supply chain at the distributor node closer to the customers, which operates in a more agile manner.

Liga Bolasepak Rakyat () was the fourth-tier football league in Malaysia. The league was managed by Liga Bolasepak Rakyat-Limited Liability Partnership (LBR-LLP) and it was an amateur-level competition. It was established in 2015 to provide an alternative entry point for young players. The league has discontinued since 2017 and have been replaced by M4 League.
The current champion is Gua Musang, a club from East Zone which won the league in 2016–17 season.
History
Liga Bolasepak Rakyat is a joint idea of Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) president Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah and Tengku Mahkota Pahang, with an objective of developing football systematically, besides functioning as an institute to produce talented players for the national side. A total of 111 clubs from all around the country will be joining the amateur-level competition for 2015–16 season, which is divided to 8 zones where 520 matches to be played. The competition is open to under-28 players, including five under-21 boys.
After a successful early stage of the league during its first season, FAM has approved to give out the right of the league management to LBR-LLP for ten years in order to develop lower league football.
The second season of LBR will start in September 2016 with 125 clubs planned to be competing in the league. On 25 September 2016, it has been confirmed that a total of 108 clubs participated in the league to represent their district in the league for the second season even though ten Johor based clubs pulled from the league. LBR-LLP has also announced that a women's league for LBR will commence next year as part of LBR effort to support women's football development in Malaysia. LBR-LLP also has launched the kits with themes inspired by common region colour according to the zones the clubs participated.

Borras () is a hamlet in Wrexham County Borough, Wales to the north-east of the city of Wrexham. It is part of the community of Holt.
The nearby residential area of Borras Park is named after Borras; and is colloquially shortened to just "Borras", but is part of the community of Acton, Wrexham, in the city of Wrexham.
Early history
Although no human occupation sites have been found, the area of Borras has revealed some of the earliest traces of habitation in the area. A number of Mesolithic flint tools have been found adjacent to Borras Farm. A Neolithic Axe head was also found near Bryn-Gryfydd and a hoard of Bronze Age metalwork.
During the Middle Ages, according to the Wrexham historian Alfred N. Palmer, Borras (then called Borrasham) formed two townships of the mesne manor of Isycoed, itself one of the manors of the marcher lordship of Bromfield; the townships were known as Borrasham Hwfa and Borrasham Riffri. It is known that an extensive farmed rabbit warren was in existence in the area at the time. Palmer noted that the name Borrasham was also written Burras or Borras (possibly from the Old English beorgas, "burial-mounds"), and that the latter forms came to be used for the township in order to avoid confusion with Bersham.
Borras Hall is an early 17th-century former manor house. It is believed that it replaced an early 13th-century house on the same site. In 1988 Madoc's lead seal was discovered at Burras Hall that dated to the 13th century and is believed to be the seal of the lords of Borras and Erlas who built Plas ym Mwras in about 1200. The seal was sent to Cardiff for verification and has never been seen since, on inquiring as to the whereabouts of the seal Cardiff stated that they only have a copy of the seal. The Hall was owned by the Brereton Family until 1789, when it was sold to a Mr Twigg for £40,000.00 and then later sold to Baron Kenyon for £24,000.00.
Nearby Borras Head House also dates to the 17th century and was also purchased by Lord Kenyon in 1803.
Airfield
During the period 1917 - 1920 fields at Borras Lodge were used by Nos. 4 and 51 Training Squadrons/Schools of the Royal Flying Corps / Royal Air Force based at Shotwick (later RAF Sealand) and Hooton Park.
In the 1940s the area was again pressed into World War II service for training flights. Three grass runways of approximately 550-660 yards existed. The main period of construction at the site took place between December 1940 and June 1941.
The airfield was closed after World War II and on 22 October 1959 was sold to United Gravel Company a subsidiary of Alfred McAlpine. In the 1970s quarrying operations commenced in the area.
Bunker
Between 1962 and 1992 there was a hardened nuclear bunker, built at Borras for No 17 Group Royal Observer Corps North Wales, who provided the field force in Western Area of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute warning alarm in the event of nuclear war and warned the population of Wrexham in the event of approaching radioactive fallout. The building was manned by up to 120 volunteers who trained on a weekly basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker remained and was purchased by R Jones (K-Klass) of Tyn-Twll Farm in the early 1990s and converted to a recording studio. Between the ROC vacating the premises in September 1991 and its new use as a recording studio, the building was under preparation for use as the Home Office North Wales Regional Government Headquarters (RGHQ) although it is unlikely it was ever actually activated as such, given the short timescale.

Comics
The P.L.A.I.N. Janes (2007)
Castellucci wrote the inaugural graphic novel for DC Comics's Minx imprint, which targets the YA audience. A long time comic book fan (she invited Batman to their fourth birthday party), Cecil jumped at the opportunity when contacted by Group Editor Shelly Bond.
The story follows a girl named Jane who moves to suburbia after a terrorist attack in their hometown of Metro City. In the chaos after the attack, they find a "John Doe" and their sketchbook. They serve as an inspiration for them to spread art to others. Jane's family decides to move away from Metro City in favor of a more sheltered, quiet community, where Jane spends a lot of time drawing in the sketchbook. This book becomes their inspiration to form P.L.A.I.N. (People Loving Art In Neighborhoods). At school, they reject the popular girls, and instead finds their "tribe" with three other girls named Jayne (aka Brain Jane), Jane (Theater Jane), and Polly Jane (Sporty Jane). Even though each girl embodies a high school stereotype, as the story progresses, readers see how each girl grows out of their mold and presents their other interests and abilities. They band together to form P.L.A.I.N. and commit "art attacks" to fight against their individual hardships and emotions but end up fighting against the social hierarchy. They eventually inspire other teens to use art as their weapons as well. At the end of the story, when Main Jane tries to admit that they were behind the P.L.A.I.N. attacks, the police dismiss their confession because they believe the attacks were too labor-intensive to be done by a girl. This part of the story challenges the notion that anything involving physical labor is exclusively for men.
Jane refuses to be defined as a victim of their terrorist attack experience, unlike their parents who are shackled by their fear; instead, they transform their trauma into art through P.L.A.I.N. The Plain Janes' message of "art saves" embodies the idea of giving people permission, even inspiration to face their fears and to move forward, while in addition aims to challenge conformity and to bring back life and spirit into the town of Kent Waters. The story shows how Jane (Main Jane) is comfortable with their own identity as an individual and refuses to conform to what society defines as "cool." An example of this would be the first P.L.A.I.N "attack" which protest the building of the new shopping mall, challenging what the students defined as "cool." By participating in these "attacks," the Janes are able to empower both themselves and their community by pushing the boundaries of normalcy and bringing a sense of imagination and spontaneity to the otherwise monotonous suburbia.
A Canadian citizen, Castellucci won the Joe Shuster Award in the category of "Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Writer" for Janes.
A sequel, called Janes in Love, was released in 2008. The sequel follows P.L.A.I.N as they play Cupid, become entangled in affairs of the heart (both their own and others), and procure a spot in Metro City Museum of Modern Art Contest.
Shade, The Changing Girl
In October 2016, DC debuted a new imprint: Young Animal. One of the initial titles was Shade, The Changing Girl, written by Castellucci, in which Shade is a female high school student. The creative team behind this new version also includes artist Marley Zarcone. After 12 issues and the Milk Wars tie-in Shade The Changing Girl/Wonder Woman Special (written with Mirka Andolfo), the series was relaunched as the six-issue Shade, the Changing Woman.

Humberwood Centre
At the landmark $23M Humberwood Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, four owners (the Toronto Catholic District School Board, the Toronto District School Board, Toronto Parks and Recreation Services and the Toronto Public Library Board) share one integrated, mixed-use facility as business partners. The City of Toronto contributed the land and three Ontario ministries provided capital funding from an inter-ministerial pool of funds. Even the design team was a joint venture between two architectural firms. The facility is a , three-storey building with two elementary schools, a public library, community centre, community hall and triple gymnasium.
Humberwood centre consists of:
Holy Child Catholic School is one of 170 elementary schools within the Toronto Catholic District School Board. In a unique co-operative model, it shares the Humberwood Centre with Humberwood Downs Junior Middle Academy, Parks & Rec, Toronto Public Library and McCauley Child Development Centre.
Humberwood Downs Junior Middle Academy serves approximately 1100 students representing almost 50 different language groups. The school grounds are designed and operated as an extension of the Humber Arboretum and on-site activities respect and preserve the natural balance of this environment. In June 2008, the Ministry of Education accorded Humberwood Downs the recognition of being a 'School On The Move', one of 40 schools chosen in the Province of Ontario. This was a result of incremental improvement in testing scores, teacher growth, distributed leadership, and engaged staff, parents and students.
Humberwood Public Library offers visitors a children's section that includes both fiction and non-fiction. The library also contains a selection of large-print books, mostly fiction, but there is some non-fiction. In the foreign-language section visitors will find books in Chinese, Spanish, Hindi and Punjabi, as well as cassettes and videos.
McCauley Child Development Centre provides quality daycare to children aged 1–1/2 to 12 years.

Tereza Delta (São Paulo, November 2, 1919 – São Bernardo do Campo, August 6, 1993) was a Brazilian politician, being one of the first women to hold the office of mayor in Brazil. For their leading role in the Chamber of Councillors of São Bernardo do Campo, they were honored with the name of the plenary of this legislative house.
Political career
Around 1943, they came to live in São Bernardo, settling in a farm at the confluence of the roads Mar and Vergueiro.
In late 1946 and early 1947, they embraced Adhemar de Barros's campaign for governor of the State of São Paulo, and in the city they supported the popular movement of protest against the city hall, in the face of the problems of lack of sugar, oil and other items, gaining general sympathy. Adhemar de Barros, after being elected and sworn in as governor, removed Wallace Simonsen from the city hall and appointed Tereza as mayor in a buffer mandate, taking office in 1947. They would remain in office until the end of that year, when elections were held for councilman and mayor.
Tereza Delta was elected a councilwoman with the highest number of votes ever recorded in São Bernardo until then. They were elected mayor of the Chamber between 1948 and 1951, when they stepped aside to take up a seat in the State Assembly, to which they had been elected as a member of congress, serving from 1951 to 1955. During this mandate they swas responsible for the creation of the first state school in the city, the Instituto de Educação João Ramalho, the construction of the Maria Iracema Munhoz School Group building, the construction of the viaduct at kilometer 23 of the Anchieta Highway and also the completion by the State of the works of the first public hospital in the city, today called Hospital Escola Anchieta. At the same time, they coordinated the construction and succeeded, in 1953, in raising the municipality to the category of comarca, whose forum was installed two years later by the acting mayor, Sigismundo Sérgio Ballotim.
In 1960, they again served as a State Congresswoman, as an alternate called for a temporary seat in the State Legislative Assembly. After they withdrew from politics, they continued to devote themselves to the activities of a micro-entrepreneur and died on August 6, 1993.

Borg is a German village in the municipality of Perl, Saarland. It is located 5 km north east of Perl and 11 km south west of Nennig on the River Mosel. It lies at a height of 355 m and has a population of 370. The nearby Roman Villa Borg is one of the Saarland's most important archaeological sites.
History
Borg is first mentioned in 1569 as being part of the Parish of Perl. However, excavations show that there were much earlier settlements. In 1743, the village was given its own church and a school was built in 1749. Over the years it belonged to St Alban's Charterhouse in Trier, to the dioceses of Metz and Trier, and to the Duchy of Luxembourg. From 1816 to 1840, Borg enjoyed the status of a mayoralty but thereafter came under the jurisdiction of Perl. Pillingerhof, 2 km to the south west, was once a Luxembourg castle but is now an agricultural establishment.
Church
The parish church of St John the Baptist (St. Johannes der Täufer) dates from 1728 but was rebuilt in 1922 by architect Josef Monz from Trier. After suffering damage in World War II, it was again rebuilt by architect H. Ulrich in 1949 to reflect the original plans. The church has three Baroque altars and 10 of the 12 original stones designating the Stations of the Cross.

In England and Wales, a tertiary college is a type of further education (FE) college that offers both academic and vocational courses to both youngsters and adults, combining the main functions of an FE college and a sixth form college. Unlike a sixth form college these also have a substantial involvement in the education of adults over 18, therefore tend to have a wide spectrum of curriculum. In its truest form, a "tertiary college" is the sole provider of public post-16 further education in a single local authority; however with the effective halt of new tertiary colleges following the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the term is nowadays not used by these colleges anymore, referring to themselves as simply the umbrella term of further education colleges.
The first tertiary college was Exeter College, Exeter in 1970. Numerous local authorities implemented the tertiary structure that decade and in the 1980s, including Hampshire, Sheffield, Lancashire, Kirklees, Dudley, Harrow, County Durham, Dorset, Bury, Richmond upon the Thames, Knowsley, Sunderland and others. In Wales, tertiary colleges were set up in Gwent and West Glamorgan. The tertiary system reflected the confidence and power at the time of local education authorities (LEA) to plan centrally. Additionally a 1980 paper noted that the tertiary system would encourage more schoolchildren to undertake post-16 study while giving further opportunities in terms of subjects as opposed to secondary schools.
In Derbyshire, the council's approval of tertiary colleges in 1987 caused widespread opposition as it involved closing three schools and removing sixth form provision from ten other schools. However colleges did eventually open in Wilmorton and Mackworth with some of the schools remaining as a compromise.
In 1991 there were 55 tertiary colleges in England across 32 local education authorities. As of 1992 there were 63 tertiary colleges compared to 224 general further education colleges, 116 sixth form colleges, 35 agriculture/horticulture colleges and 13 art and design colleges. Not all colleges necessarily have or had 'Tertiary' in its name - many colleges have since dropped this name from titles even if they are technically still tertiary.
According to research by Responsive College Unit published in 2003, 16 to 18-year-old students at tertiary colleges had higher achievement rates than other sixth form students as well as FE students at all levels. However other statistics, dating from 1999, point that school sixth forms with 200+ students and sixth form colleges have higher A-level scores.

Doña Ines is a volcano in Chile. It is a Miocene age stratovolcano which is formed from lava domes that form its summit area and nuee ardente deposits which form the flanks of the volcano.
Located north of the Salar de Pedernales, Doña Ines is a high cone with a diameter of . Lava domes form the top of the volcano and pyroclastic flow deposits are found on its flanks, generating a noticeable slope contrast between the steeper upper parts of the edifice and the more gentle lower slopes. The nuee ardente deposits contain blocks with sizes of up to . Overall the volcano covers a surface area of about . Additional lava domes can be found on the eastern slopes of the volcano. A subsidiary vent, active at the same time as the main volcano, has formed the Loma Dona Ines rocks south of the main volcano. The Gemelas-Fortuna volcanic centres lie nearby. The basement beneath the volcano on its northern side is formed by Triassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks.
Doña Ines is part of the Maricunga Belt, a volcanic arc at the western edge of the Puna plateau. Doña Ines together with Cerros Bravos, La Coipa and the Maricunga volcanoes lies in the northern part of the belt, west of the Central Volcanic Zone. Volcanic activity within this belt has generated a number of mineral deposits. Doña Ines lies in the northern part of the belt. It is considered part of a volcanic chain with the Pastillito and Volcan de la Sal cones, probably dependent on tectonic fractures, which lies in a long north-south valley. The volcano is the source of the Inez Chica ignimbrite, a rhyolitic ignimbrite erupted 16.2 million years ago which covers a surface area of .
The volcano has erupted andesite and dacite, both containing hornblende. The rocks of the summit lava domes contain hornblende, plagioclase and smaller amounts of orthopyroxene. The rocks of Doña Ines have a content between 56 and 64%. Based on the composition of amphibole, the amphibole crystals formed in magmas with temperatures spanning , with the central vent magmas having higher temperatures at amphibole crystallization and also showing evidence of a more complex magma system.
The stratovolcano was active approximately 15 million years ago, during the Miocene. A date of 15.0 ± 0.3 million years ago has been obtained on one lava flow.

As of April 2022, Vietnam (officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam) maintains diplomatic relationships with 189 nations throughout the world and the State of Palestine, including all UN member states and UN observer states other than (i) UN member states Malawi, Bahamas, Tonga and Tuvalu and (ii) the UN observer Holy See. In 2011 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, at the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, released an official statement about Vietnam's foreign policy and a section of the statement stated: "Vietnam is a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community, actively taking part in international and regional cooperation processes. Deepen, stabilize and sustain established international relations. Develop relations with countries and territories in the world, as well as international organizations, while showing: respect for each other's independence; sovereignty and territorial integrity; non-interference in each other's international affairs; non-use or threat of force; settlement of disagreements and disputes by means of peaceful negotiations; mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit."
Major steps have been taken by Vietnam to restore diplomatic ties with key countries. Full diplomatic relations were restored with New Zealand who opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995, while Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003. Pakistan reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000. Vietnam also reopened its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005. United States–Vietnam relations improved in August 1995, when both nations upgraded their liaison offices opened during January 1995 to embassy status, with the United States later opening a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City, and Vietnam opening a consulate in San Francisco.
History
Feudal Vietnam
Vietnam has a history stretching back more than 4,000 years. In its early history, Vietnam tried to maintain good relations with its neighbours. From the Hồng Bàng dynasty to many feudal dynasties like the Ngô, Đinh, Early Lê, Lý, Trần, Later Lê, Tây Sơn and Nguyễn, Vietnam's main diplomatic relationships were with neighboring Imperial China, Kingdom of Champa, Khmer Empire, Lan Xang kingdom and Siam. Later trading relationship were established with European Countries (such as through Dutch East India company) and Japan.
Post-World War II
+ Period 1945-1946: After the surrender of Japan, Both British and Chinese Kuomintang armies came into Vietnam territory to take the Japanese imperial army out of Indochina. The government of Democratic Republic of Vietnam decided to have the peace agreement with Chiang Kai-shek of Kuomintang that stationed in the north Vietnam to let them pay attention to fight the French in the south. After that, Vietnam signed the peace treaty with France in 6/3/1946.
+ Period 1947-1954 : Vietnam started to expand their foreign relation with the other countries in the world. In January, 1950, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union were the first two countries to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Later, alliances were formed with Cambodia and Laos to make anti-French campaigns, building the friendship with the anti-colonial countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and India.
Cold War Era
Vietnam War
During the Vietnam War (1959–75), North Vietnam balanced relations with its two major allies, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
In 1964, Zhou Enlai, worried about the escalation of U.S. forces in South Vietnam, made an informal agreement with the North. The agreement stipulated that if U.S. and South Vietnamese forces invaded North Vietnam, the Chinese would respond by loaning pilots to the North. During the invasion, Mao Zedong failed to send as many trained pilots as they promised. As a result, the North became more reliant on the Soviet Union for its defense.
By 1975, tension began to grow as Beijing increasingly viewed Vietnam as a potential Soviet instrument to encircle China. Meanwhile, Beijing's increasing support for Cambodia's Khmer Rouge sparked Vietnamese suspicions of China's motives.
Vietnamese-Chinese relations deteriorated significantly after Hanoi instituted a ban in March 1978 on private trade, a move that particularly affected the Sino-Vietnamese sector of the population. Following Vietnam's December 1978 invasion of Cambodia, China launched a retaliatory invasion of Vietnam's northern border region. Faced with severance of Chinese aid and strained international relations, Vietnam established even closer ties with the Soviet Union and its allies in the Comecon member states. Throughout the 1980s, Vietnam received nearly US$3 billion a year in economic and military aid from the Soviet Union and conducted most of its trade with the U.S.S.R. and Comecon countries. Soviet and Eastern bloc economic aid, however, ceased after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Reform (Đổi Mới)
Vietnam didn't begin to emerge from international isolation until it withdrew its troops from Cambodia in 1989. Within months of the 1991 Paris Agreements, Vietnam established diplomatic and economic relations with Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states and also with most countries of Western Europe and Asia's Far East. China re-established full diplomatic ties with Vietnam in 1991. The two nations concluded a land border demarcation agreement in 1999. In 1995, the US and Vietnam re-established diplomatic ties.
In the past decade, Vietnam has recognized the importance of growing global economic interdependence and has made concerted efforts to adjust its foreign relations to reflect the evolving international economic and political situation in Southeast Asia. The country has begun to integrate itself into the regional and global economy by joining international organizations. Vietnam has stepped up its efforts to attract foreign capital from the West and regularize relations with the world financial system. In the 1990s, following the lifting of the US veto on multilateral loans to the country, Vietnam became a member of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Asian Development Bank. The country has expanded trade with its East Asian neighbors as well as with countries in Western Europe and North America. Of particular significance was Vietnam's acceptance into ASEAN in July 1995. Vietnam joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in November 1998 and also hosted the ASEAN summit the following month. In 2005, Vietnam attended the inaugural East Asia Summit. Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization in November 2006.
Current issues
While Vietnam has remained relatively conflict-free since its Cambodia days, tensions have arisen in the past between Vietnam and its neighbors, especially in the case of China since both nations assert claims to the Spratly and Paracel Islands - the two archipelagos in a potentially oil-rich area of the South China Sea. Conflicting claims have produced over the years small scale armed altercations in the area. In 1988, more than 70 Vietnamese troops were killed during a confrontation with Chinese forces, when China occupied several islands under Vietnamese control in the Spratly Islands. China's assertion of control over the Spratly Islands and the entire South China Sea has elicited concern from Vietnam and its Southeast Asia neighbors. The territorial border between the two countries is being definitively mapped pursuant to a Land Border Agreement signed in December 1999, and an Agreement on Borders in the Gulf of Tonkin signed in December 2000. Vietnam and Russia declared a strategic partnership in March 2001 during the first visit ever to Hanoi of a Russian head of state, largely as an attempt to counterbalance China's growing profile in Southeast Asia.
Disputes – international: maritime boundary with Cambodia not defined; involved in a complex dispute over the Spratly - Paracel Islands with the People's Republic of China (PRC), Malaysia, Philippines, and possibly Brunei; maritime boundary with Thailand resolved in August 1997; maritime boundary dispute with the PRC in the Gulf of Tonkin resolved in 2000; Paracel Islands occupied by the PRC since 1974; offshore islands and sections of boundary with Cambodia are in dispute; agreement on land border with the People's Republic of China was signed in December 1999.

The Forsaken is a 2001 American horror film written and directed by J. S. Cardone and distributed by Screen Gems. The film stars Kerr Smith, Brendan Fehr, Izabella Miko, and Jonathan Schaech. Conceived as a road movie with vampire hunters, the story follows a young film trailer editor on a cross-country business trip through the Arizona desert who picks up a shady hitchhiker and along the way encounters a disoriented young woman who's being stalked by a vampire cult.
Synopsis
Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow them to attend the wedding of their sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers.
Sean is driving cross-country when they pick up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken- the first vampires. They originated as a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever by drinking the blood of one their comrades. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is being kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills their entire bloodline and reverses the condition of individuals who haven't fully turned. Nick believes that if they kill Kit, they will be cured before they turn (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge their new acquaintance; however, they are convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves they are telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight.
Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but they go into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. They show them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, they explain they were a victim of the vampires' bloodbath. Kit catches up to them and lays siege to the gas station.
Sean discovers a graveyard outside and Ina explains that it is an old Spanish graveyard that was never dug up, making the house hallowed ground and thus a suitable place to kill Kit. In the ensuing battle, Sean and Nick are injured. As Kit is about to kill Ina and Megan, Sean drives their car through the gas station wall and pins Kit to the wall, hoping to hold them there until the sun rises. Kit pushes the car, Sean shoots him, knocking them into a beam of sunlight. As Kit starts to combust, Sean, Nick, Megan, and Ina flee the gas station; Kit's explosive death ignites the gas. Sean and Megan are finally cured of vampirism; however, Nick is not cured as it turns out that the vampire who bit them is descended from the other Forsaken in the United States. Nick takes to the road to try to find and kill the other Forsaken, leaving a letter of thanks for Sean. Three months later, Sean catches up to them and insists on helping, having discovered that the Forsaken is probably in Denver. The two set off for Denver.

Themes
Contemporary critics of the film have noted a homoerotic subtext between the film's two central male characters. In a 2013 retrospective on the film, the publication Culture Crossfire said of the film: "Twelve years later, there's nothing about The Forsaken that's particularly memorable other than the fact that it's an in-denial coming out tale that just happens to have vampires." Their Name is Death editor Albert Nowicki noted that the movie is full of phallic imagery and compared Schaech's villain to Chris Sarandon's vampiric character Jerry Dandrige from the 1985 horror comedy Fright Night. They believed that neither of the two main characters was sexually interested in Miko's Megan and that it is strongly indicated Sean and Nick develop romantic feelings towards each other.
Production
Director J.S. Cardone was influenced by Terrence Malick's Badlands (1973) and Kathryn Bigelow's vampire film Near Dark (1987) when writing The Forsaken, and said they wanted to make a "road movie" with vampires. Kerr Smith was cast in the film based on their performance as Jack McPhee, a gay teenager on the network series Dawson's Creek; Brendan Fehr was cast based on their role in the sci-fi series Roswell. Cardone cast Izabella Miko in the role of Megan, who at the time was new to the film industry. To prepare for the role, Miko, who is originally from Poland, completed accent training in order to achieve an American accent.
The film was shot on location in and around Yuma, Arizona.
Reception
The Forsaken holds a 7% approval rating on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 54 reviews.
Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle said of the film: "Like the recent Dracula 2000, The Forsaken supplies its own twist, and also like that other film it comes as less of a surprise than a bewilderment. I'll refrain from spelling it out, though I'll note that the Crusades have something to do with it and it handily doubles as an AIDS metaphor. Who'da thunk it?" Entertainment Weekly also gave the film a negative review, calling it "startlingly amateurish."
Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave a middling review of the film, calling it a "reasonably smart generic hybrid," but that it "trots out its full arsenal of shock tactics far too early in the game and squanders the suspense it has accumulated." Wesley Morris of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: "As anonymous vampire flicks go, The Forsaken is like a store-bought costume with plastic fangs collecting dust in a Wal-Mart "Everything Must Go" bin. Imagine a tributary of Dawson's Creek snaking into the cesspool area of the Styx, and you might be able to glean a vision of The Forsaken for yourself."
Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide called the film a "hip, revisionist horror picture, which borrows liberally — and cannily — from Near Dark and The Hitcher." Neil Smith of the BBC awarded the film three out of five stars, but noted that the film "plays down the more lurid aspects of the vampire legend—no fangs, crucifixes or silver bullets—in an attempt to free the genre from its gothic roots. The problem is they inadvertently remove everything that makes the horror genre fun."
Box office
The film opened at #8 at the North American box office making $3,020,159 USD in its opening weekend. The film lost money by 53 percent in box office earnings the following week causing the film to move a notch down to #9, it became a box office bomb as the film had plummeted to the 15th spot.

Robert Lee Oliver (February 8, 1943 – April 19, 2020) was an American professional baseball first baseman and outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1965), Kansas City Royals (1969–72), California Angels (1972–74), Baltimore Orioles (1974), and New York Yankees (1975). They batted and threw right-handed.
Career
Minor leagues
Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Oliver lettered in baseball and basketball at Highlands High School in North Highlands, California, a suburb of Sacramento. After graduating in 1961, they played college baseball at American River College, where they were heavily scouted. Signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1963 season, Oliver played in the Pirates' farm system for four seasons, with a late call-up in 1965, during which they made their major league debut. Oliver was traded to the Minnesota Twins and spent two more seasons in Minor League Baseball (MiLB).
Major leagues
Oliver made the big leagues for good in 1969, having been selected by the Kansas City Royals in the previous October's expansion draft. Playing on a young team that included fellow rookies Pat Kelly and Lou Piniella — the eventual American League (AL) Rookie of the Year — Oliver batted .254, with 13 home runs, and 43 runs batted in (RBI), in 118 games played. That year, they achieved two firsts in Royals history: 1) They were the first Royal to collect six hits in a nine-inning game (only two other Royals, Kevin Seitzer in 1987 and Joe Randa in 2004, have since accomplished this feat), with a 6-for-6 performance in a May 4 victory over the California Angels; and 2) They hit the Royals' first-ever grand slam, the shot coming off Jim Bouton in the first game of a July 4 doubleheader against the American League's other 1969 expansion team, the Seattle Pilots.
1970 was a breakout year for Oliver; they established career highs in home runs (27),RBI (99), and runs scored (83). Oliver enjoyed two more solid seasons: 1972 (during which they were traded to the California Angels), batting .269, with 20 home runs, and 76 RBI; and 1973, batting .265, with 18 home runs, and 89 RBI, while splitting their time as a utility player. The Baltimore Orioles acquired them for the 1974 stretch drive; Oliver appeared in nine games for the team. Their contract was purchased by the New York Yankees from the Orioles on December 1, 1974, but they only saw limited duty in 1975. During their career, Oliver batted .256, with 94 home runs, and 419 RBI, in 847 games played.
Other interests and death
While a member of the California Angels, Oliver moonlighted as a police officer for the Santa Ana Police Department. In the offseason they were a school resource officer.
Oliver managed the Sacramento Steelheads, in 1999. They have also worked at two baseball schools in Sacramento County: operating their own Baseball Academy in Sacramento, as well as working as a hitting instructor at Dusty Baker's Baseball Camp in Rancho Cordova.
Oliver's son Darren also played in MLB, from 1993–2013. Both father and son are former teammates of Nolan Ryan: Bob from 1972 to 1974, and Darren as a rookie with the Texas Rangers in 1993 (Ryan's final major league season).
Oliver died on April 19, 2020, at the age of 77, in Rio Linda, California.

The Jolla smartphone (or Jolla 1 or J1) is a smartphone produced by Jolla that runs the Sailfish OS. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, it was manufactured in China and released on 27th November 2013. The Jolla smartphone is no longer supported by Sailfish OS updates, the last update compatible being v3.4.0, released on 22 September 2020.
Like the Nokia N9, the Jolla diverted from the at that time conventional smartphone home button centric user interface and only featured a power button and a volume up and down rocker switch. Instead it relied on a swipe interface to close and switch between screens and applications would access a pulley menu to select menu items inside applications.
In addition to the comparably limited number of native Sailfish applications available in the Jolla app store, the Jolla Phone featured the proprietary Alien Dalvik to provide support for and installing Android-applications from Aptoide.
First unveiled device
On 20 May 2013, after IamTheOtherHalf internet campaign, Jolla unveiled the following details and design of their first device:
4.5 in IPS qHD (540×960) "Estrade" display
Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 1.4 GHz dual-core
16 GB of storage memory
microSD support
8 MPix AF camera, back
2 MPix camera, front
2100 mAh user-replaceable battery
"The Other Half"
Gesture-based Sailfish OS
Android applications compliant
MicroUSB
3.5 mm headphone jack
Buttonless display, gesture navigation
Device in English language version
Qt, QML, HTML5 (see: Sailfish OS architecture)
The Sailfish OS SDK was published at the end of February 2013.
The Jolla smartphone is compatible with frequency bands in the ITU region 1: 4G (LTE) bands 3 (1800 MHz), 7 (2600 MHz) and 20 (800 MHz); 3G (WCDMA / UMTS) band 1 (2100 MHz), 8 (900 MHz); 2G (GSM) bands 850 Mhz, 900 Mhz, 1800 Mhz, 1900 Mhz. 4G and 3G will work in regions like Europe but support is not guaranteed in regions like America, even if a compatible frequency band is used.
Retail availability
Jolla started shipping the phone in late November 2013. At first the phone could only be ordered on the web from within the European Union. (It is not available in the US via the website or any other outlet.)
The phone also became available in the stores of the Finnish carrier DNA on 11 December 2013.
On 28 April 2014, the Jolla phone became available in Estonia at the outlets of Elisa Eesti, the first operator outside Finland to offer the phone in their shops.
On 25 July 2014 Jolla opened the first Jolla store in Kazakhstan in association with Mobile Invest.
On 12 August 2014 Jolla was launched in Hong Kong in a partnership with 3 Hong Kong.
In September 2014, Jolla launched in India on e-retailer Snapdeal.
In November 2014, Jolla launched in Russia.
Support
The long support period of Sailfish OS for the Jolla 1 is remarkable. The phone was provided with a total of 34 updates and upgrades for a period of 7 years. This is especially remarkable considering the small size of Jolla Oy compared to Apple or Samsung.
Other Linux distributions like postmarketOS continue to provide updates for the original Jolla phone but don't support calls, SMS or mobile data yet.

Preston is a village, former manor and ecclesiastical parish in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, England. It is situated 22 km north-west of the city of Gloucester and 4 km south-west of the Herefordshire town of Ledbury. In 1931 the parish had a population of 77. In 1935 the parish of Preston, comprising 897 acres, was added to the parish of Dymock, adjacent at the south-east, the parish church of which, St Mary the Virgin, is situated 4 miles to the south-east.
The parish church is dedicated to St John the Baptist. To the immediate west of the church is Preston Court, a grade II* listed timber-framed manor house dating from about 1600, in 2020 operating as "The Country House Collection" antique shop.
History
Preston had been a possession of Gloucester Abbey since before the Norman Conquest of 1066. In 1541, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was granted as part of the endowment of the newly established See of Gloucester, the new Bishops of Gloucester using the old Abbey Church as their Cathedral. In 1583 the bishop of Gloucester leased the manor to the Crown, and in 1585 Queen Elizabeth I granted it to Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke.
A country house, Preston Court, was built in the late 16th or early 17th century. In 1834 Preston Court passed to the 2nd Baronet's cousin Robert Smith (d.1843) of Swansea, who adopted the surname Pauncefote and was succeeded by their son Robert Pauncefote (d.1847), who was succeeded by their brother Bernard Pauncefote, of India.

In radiology, the silhouette sign refers to the loss of normal borders between thoracic structures. It is usually caused by an intrathoracic radiopaque mass that touches the border of the heart or aorta. In other words, it is difficult to make out the borders of a particular structure - normal or otherwise - because it is next to another dense structure, both of which will appear white on a standard X-ray. It may occur, for example, in right middle lobe syndrome, where the right heart margin is obscured, and in right lower lobe pneumonia, where the border of the diaphragm on the right side is obscured, while the right heart margin remains distinct.
Silhouette sign is very useful in localizing lung lesions as all structures forming cardiac silhouette are in contact with a specific portion of the lung.

Brock Pemberton (November 6, 1953 – February 17, 2016) was a Major League Baseball player, who played for the New York Mets in 1974 and 1975. They also played in the St. Louis Cardinals' organization. They played as a first baseman. Pemberton played high school baseball in Huntington Beach, California and was drafted by the Mets in the 6th round of the 1972 June Amateur Draft. After playing in the lower minor leagues in 1972 and 1973, they were promoted to AA level with the Victoria Toros of the Texas League in 1974. That year, they posted a .322 batting average in 134 games and 482 at bats for the Toros. They also had 8 home runs. This performance earned Pemberton a promotion to the Major League Mets late in the season. Pemberton made their debut with the Mets as a pinch hitter on September 10, 1974, against the Montreal Expos. The next day, the Mets and St. Louis Cardinals played a 25 inning game in which Pemberton got their first Major League hit, also as a pinch hitter. In all, they played 11 games for the Mets in 1974, with 4 hits in 22 at-bats and one run batted in. In four games as a first baseman they did not make an error.
Pemberton spent most of the 1975 season in the minor leagues with the AAA level Tidewater Tides. They batted .297 in 137 games and 474 at-bats, but had no home runs for the entire season. They did get another late season call up to the Mets, this time playing just two games as a pinch hitter, getting no hits in two at-bats. Their last game with the Mets that season was on September 23, 1975, which was also their last Major League game. Their final Major League statistics were 4 hits in 24 at-bats for a .167 batting average with 1 run batted in.
In 1976, Pemberton played the entire season with Tidewater. They batted .290 in 138 games and 520 at bats. They hit 3 home runs. They were traded with Leon Brown from the Mets to the St. Louis Cardinals for minor-league first baseman Ed Kurpiel on December 9, 1976. Pemberton played in 1977 in the Cardinals system with their AAA affiliate, the New Orleans Pelicans of the American Association. They batted .241 in 113 games and 381 at-bats and 3 home runs. After 1977, Pemberton did not play again in organized baseball until 1979, when they played for the Class AAA Miami Amigos in the Inter-American League. In 1980, they played for the unaffiliated Class A level Macon Peaches of the South Atlantic League. They batted .290 in 47 games and 162 at-bats and 4 home runs in 1980. In addition to playing, they also managed the Peaches for part of the 1980 season. Pemberton died on February 17, 2016 in Oklahoma.

There have been three baronetcies created for persons with the surname Bernard, one in the Baronetage of England, one in the Baronetage of Great Britain and one in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. Two of the creations are extinct and one is extant.
The Bernard Baronetcy, of Huntingdon in the County of Huntingdon, was created in the Baronetage of England on 1 July 1662 for Robert Bernard, who represented Huntingdon in the House of Commons.

The Crafts Study Centre is a university museum of modern crafts, located next to the entrance of the University for the Creative Arts at Farnham, Surrey.
The Crafts Study Centre holds collections of 20th and 21st century British craft, primarily in the fields of calligraphy and lettering, ceramics, furniture and wood, and textiles, but also has small collections of jewellery, works of art on paper, and other miscellaneous items. The object collections are accompanied by archives such as diaries, correspondence, photographs, catalogues and working notes from crafts practitioners and crafts organisations. In some cases the Centre also holds ‘source collections', collected from around the world by makers for their own inspiration, enjoyment and knowledge.
Much of the collection has been built up from donations and bequests and includes work by Bernard Leach, Lucie Rie, and Hans Coper in ceramics, Ethel Mairet, Phyllis Barron and Dorothy Larcher in textiles; calligraphy by Edward Johnston and Irene Wellington, and furniture by Ernest Gimson and Edward Barnsley.
History
The Centre was established in 1970 when a small group of crafts makers and educators agreed it was vital to preserve and celebrate the best British crafts of the 20th century. This included Muriel Rose, who became one of the founding trustees and donated their collections and archive to the Centre. The decision to establish the Crafts Study Centre led to a successful partnership with the University of Bath, which housed its collections at the city's Holburne Museum of Art when the Centre first opened to the public in 1977. In 2000 the Crafts Study Centre relocated to Farnham in Surrey to accept the offer of what was then the Surrey Institute of Art & Design, University College, today the University for the Creative Arts, to construct a new purpose-built space. The Centre opened in a three-storey building in June 2004.
The Centre is a registered charity with a Board of Trustees, currently chaired by the potter and writer Alison Britton. It is an accredited museum as recognised by Arts Council England.
Exhibitions and events
The Crafts Study Centre has a programme of exhibitions from both its permanent collections and of work by contemporary artists and makers. It also hosts talks, lectures, symposiums, open days, workshops and other events by artist-makers.
Facilities
The Crafts Study Centre has a shop, which sells publications from its exhibitions present and past and other titles, alongside crafts magazines such as Ceramic Review and Selvedge. The shop also stocks work by makers from across the UK.
The Centre also has a Library with a collection of books and periodicals relating to craft, and a Research Room which is available to the public by appointment for dedicated research visits.

"Sweat" is a song by American rock band The All-American Rejects, released on July 7, 2017. "Sweat" was released alongside another song, "Close Your Eyes", in addition to an accompanying 11-minute music video.
Background and composition
"Sweat" was written by Tyson Ritter and Ido Zmishlany, being the first single by the band to not feature Nick Wheeler as a songwriter, and the first single by the band to feature a writer outside of the band members.
In the music video for "Sweat", Ritter plays a man named Robert, whose alter ego (Betsy) is a drag queen. "He (Robert) met someone in their early days, they ruined their chances at having a happy existence and family so to punish himself, they dressed up as her."
The song is an upbeat arena pop-rock anthem in the key of F. One thing that sets it apart from other songs by the band could be the loose instrumentation of the verses, as well as lead guitarist Nick Wheeler's 80's inspired glam-rock style solo, which features a sped up (and slowed down) guitar.
Reception
The two song EP received positive feedback from critics. Hailey Nuthals of PopDust wrote positively of the songs, saying they have "a definitive Rejects-in-2017 sound" and that "They are, by nearly every standard, really good songs. They're permeated with shadows that feel comforting real in their darkness, but still sound like the Rejects. It feels like the band has grown with us. That's great."
Sophie Trenear of The Edge UK gave the EP 5 stars out of 5. They wrote, "It's summery, it's sexy – it's the comeback from the hiatus you never even knew happened." They favorably compared the song to the band's 2008 smash hit "Gives You Hell", stating, "Reminiscent of the blissfully heedless ‘Gives You Hell' era, it nevertheless dives headfirst into the band's looming evolution with an anthemic chorus that feels outrageously bold, but doesn't skimp on the sugary hook."
Rock 'N' Load magazine was also very positive in their review, calling both the songs and video "exceptional."
Markos Papadatos for DigitalJournal.com was highly positive in their review of the EP/video, saying "Overall, their "Sweat" film is visually-striking and a true work of art." Papadatos also stated that "The All-American Rejects have outdone themselves musically and artistically. They are not afraid to showcase their vulnerability as recording artists, and it is safe to say that their vulnerability is their pop-rock listening audience's reward." Papadatos went on to state that "Their "Sweat" film garners an A rating."
Appearances in popular culture
Sweat was featured in the eighth episode of the short-lived NBC sitcom Rise. The song is also used as the background music for the HTC Vive Pro commercial, with Laura Dern and Bryce Dallas Howard.
Music video
The music video for "Sweat" 11 minutes long, and stars lead singer Tyson Ritter as Robert by day and Betsy by night. The video also features "Close Your Eyes". Jamie Thraves wrote and directed the music video, and came up for the idea of Ritter being playing a woman. "I looked up Tyson to see what they looked like, and I said, 'he's got good cheek bones. I bet he'd be up for playing a woman.'"
The short film "Rejected" was released to the band's Vevo page on September 22, 2017. It features a behind the scenes look at the making of the new record, including the "Sweat" film.
Track listing
Digital download
"Sweat" – 3:04
"Close Your Eyes" – 4:28
Note: "Close Your Eyes" was written by Benedetto Rotondi and Tyson Ritter, and was produced by Rotondi (as Benny Cassette).
Charts
In the United States, the song charted on the Hot Rock Songs chart during its first week at #21, as well as the Rock Digital Songs chart the same week at #10. The song quickly fell off both. The song later entered the Top 40 chart, and remained there for 10 weeks, peaking at #29.

The A.K. Steunenberg House in Caldwell, Idaho, is a 2-story Colonial Revival expansion by Tourtellotte & Co. in 1904 of a smaller Queen Anne house. The 1904 renovation established a 2-story, round corner tower and a colonnade with three prominent columns marking the Kimball Street exposure. The original house at the northwest corner of North 4th and Kimball Streets may have been occupied by the Steunenbergs as early as 1890.
Albert K. Steunenberg
The A.K. Steunenberg House was the property of Albert and Carrie Steunenberg, both of Iowa. Albert K. Steunenberg (September 11, 1863-March 16, 1907) with their brother, Frank Steunenberg (August 8, 1861-December 30, 1905), were publishers of The Caldwell Tribune from 1886 until 1893. Al Steunenberg was active in fraternal organizations and helped to found the Caldwell Commercial Bank, later the Caldwell Bank and Trust Co., serving as the bank's cashier.

Pittsburgh Theological Seminary (PTS) is a Presbyterian graduate seminary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1794, it houses one of the largest theological libraries in the tri-state area.
History
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary was formed in 1959 by consolidating the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'s Western Theological Seminary and the United Presbyterian Church of North America's Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. The consolidation was the result of the 1958 merger between the PCUSA and the UPCNA to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.
Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary began with the founding of Service Seminary (Associate Theological Seminary in the town of Service, Beaver County, Pennsylvania) in 1792 by the Associate Presbytery of Pennsylvania. Prior to that time, the Presbytery was dependent on a supply of ministers sent from Scotland. The Rev. John Anderson, D.D., was elected as the first teacher of divinity and the school began with an enrollment of six students. Service Seminary moved several times, from Service to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, then to Xenia, Ohio, where it became Xenia Theological Seminary. This occurred in the 1850s and was prompted by a desire to locate nearer to the growing population in the Midwest. The Rev. Joseph Kyle joined the faculty in 1900 (leaving 4th U.P. Church in Allegheny, Pennsylvania). In approximately 1914 Kyle was appointed president. In 1920 the trustees determined to move the seminary to St. Louis, Missouri, also to be nearer to potential students in the Plains states. In 1921 the Rev. Dr. Kyle died unexpectedly. This loss of leadership at a crucial transition period created problems for the fledgling institution and it never really took root. In 1930 Xenia merged with a seminary that was founded in Pittsburgh in 1825, which was known as Pittsburgh Seminary (1825-1833; 1913-1930) and Allegheny Seminary (1833-1912). Together Pittsburgh and Xenia formed the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. This institution was later augmented by the resources of Newburgh Seminary, founded in New York City in 1805 by John Mitchell Mason.
Western Theological Seminary, the other branch of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's pre-1959 history, began with the establishment of classical academies in Washington, Pennsylvania, the first in 1785 by Joseph Smith and another in 1787 by John McMillan. Out of these academies, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA created Western Seminary. It was indeed a western seminary in 1825, furnishing a ministry for the rapidly opening frontier territories along the Ohio River.
Since the 1959 consolidation, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary has been located on the former Pittsburgh-Xenia Seminary campus in the Highland Park/East Liberty section of Pittsburgh. It became a PC (U.S.A.) seminary following the 1983 merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the United States.
Academics
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The seminary has scholars in all major fields of theological inquiry, and offers language training in Greek and Hebrew. The following degrees are offered by the institution:
Master of Divinity (M.Div.)
Master of Divinity with Emphasis in Forming New Faith Communities
Master of Divinity with Certificate in Urban Ministry
Master of Arts in Pastoral Studies (M.A.P.S.)
Master of Theological Studies (MTS)
Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) Focus areas include Science and Theology, Missional Leadership, Reformed, Christian Spirituality, Intergenerational Black Church Studies, Eastern Christian, and Creative Writing & Public Theology.
The Seminary also cooperates with other institutions within the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education to offer joint degree programs, including:
Master of Divinity/Juris Doctor (Duquesne University)
M.A.P.S./Juris Doctor (Duquesne University)
MTS/Juris Doctor (Duquesne University)
Master of Divinity/Master of Social Work (University of Pittsburgh)
Clifford E. Barbour Library
The Clifford E. Barbour Library is a theological library in Western Pennsylvania. Its 300,000 volumes, several online databases, and more than 800 periodical subscriptions make it one of the larger stand-alone theological libraries in the United States. The library is located in a three-story building of American Colonial design, dedicated in 1964. The library houses several valuable collections, including the John M. Mason Memorial Collection, which consists of many rare theological works dating from the Reformation. On display in the Hansen Reading Room are the desk and chair of Karl Barth, dedicated to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary by Barth's son, Markus Barth, a faculty member from 1963–1972. Many of the books and periodicals in the collection were made possible by a $15 million gift from wealthy banker and business person Thomas Clinton. The library was managed superbly by Dikran Hadidian during its formative years.
Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is home to the Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The museum contains a collection of ancient Near Eastern and Palestinian pottery and artifacts brought together by travelers and archeologists over the past 60 years. Many exhibits resulted from the eight excavations of which the seminary has been a part.
The Seminary is very involved in Biblical archaeology, and sponsors the Zeitah Excavations in Israel at Tel Zayit. The excavation was founded under the direction of Professor Ron E. Tappy, Professor of Bible and Archaeology and director of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary's Kelso Museum of Near Eastern Archaeology. The excavation began in 1999 with a 55-member international team of experts and volunteers. In July 2005 excavators discovered the Zayit Stone, which contained an inscription dating to the 10th century BCE (King Solomon's reign). The two-line inscription, on a 33-pound limestone boulder embedded in the stone wall of a building, is the earliest securely-dated example of the complete Hebrew alphabet (an "abecedary"). The letters show a transitional script emerging from Phoenician and leading to the Hebrew national script of the 9th century BCE. The first significant inscription from this period in nearly a century, the discovery was reported in the New York Times.
World Mission Initiative
World Mission Initiative (WMI) at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is a fellowship of Presbyterians dedicated to developing mission vision, nurturing missionary vocation, and cultivating missional congregations.
WMI prepares seminarians to become pastors with a mission, and coordinates cross-cultural trips. It has a church focus and works to train world Christian pastors. WMI hosts missionaries, national church leaders, and scholars on campus throughout the year.

Drake Circus Shopping Centre is a covered shopping mall in the centre of Plymouth, England, which opened in October 2006.
The building was designed by London-based architects Chapman Taylor and built by Bovis Lend Lease. Situated behind the ruined Charles Church, preserved as the city's civilian war memorial, the building provoked a mixed reception. Just after it opened, the shopping centre won the inaugural Carbuncle Cup "for crimes against architecture", as the worst new building in the United Kingdom. In 2007 it won two retail industry national awards, one of which was the Retail Week magazine's "Shopping Location of the Year".
History
The term 'circus' as used here refers to an open space, usually circular, where a number of roads meet. Drake Circus was originally a large oval roundabout built in the early 20th century at the junction of four main roads and several minor ones. The roundabout consisted of Edwardian buildings housing shops, and from 1937 its south end carried the "Guinness Clock", which was visible to people travelling up Old Town Street and was a landmark in the city of the time.
The circus survived the Plymouth Blitz of World War II relatively intact, but it was demolished in 1966-7 as part of the Plan for Plymouth, and was replaced by a new open roundabout to the north. Around this time the lower section of the main road to Tavistock off this new roundabout was renamed Drake Circus. A two-level shopping centre with open malls and a large C&A store was built, partly over the site of the original circus. It opened in 1971 and was also named Drake Circus.
Initial proposals to redevelop this mall in the early 1990s failed, but the developers, P&O Estates, tried again in the early 2000s. Plans were drawn up for a much larger centre, and after Allders signed up as the first "anchor" tenant in 2001, work started in February 2004 on demolishing the old centre and the adjoining Charles Street multi-storey car park.
The scheme suffered a setback in January 2005 when Allders went into administration. New tenants Next and Primark committed in 2005 and the building opened in October 2006.
On 3 February 2005 it was announced that the shopping centre had been sold by P&O Estates to Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund for £55m. On 20 November 2006 it was announced that Kandahar Real Estate had taken a 50 per cent stake in the centre. The centre was bought by British Land for £240 million in January 2011.
In 2007, the centre's management introduced a code of conduct which, like one the Bluewater centre introduced in 2005, banned hooded tops and baseball caps.
Clarke Nicholls Marcel (CNM London) were the civil and structural engineers for the new-build Shopping Centre.

Maud Franklin (9 January 1857 – 18 November 1939) was an English artist and the mistress of and model for artist James McNeill Whistler.
Franklin was born in Bicester, Oxfordshire, England, one of six children of Charles Franklin, an upholsterer and cabinetmaker, and Mary Clifton, after whom they were christened 'Mary'. They may have posed for Whistler as early as 1872, as a stand-in for their portrait of Mrs. Frances Leyland, when they were fifteen.
By the late 1870s, they were serving as a model to Whistler for etchings and painted portraits, most notably the Arrangement in White and Black. They also are the initial model for what would be the Portrait of Miss Florence Leyland, as well as Harmony in Grey and Peach Colour, numerous other oils, drawings, watercolors, etchings, and lithographs.
Franklin had two daughters by Whistler: Ione (born circa 1877) and Maud McNeill Whistler Franklin (born 1879). They sometimes referred to themselves as 'Mrs. Whistler', and in the census of 1881 gave their name as 'Mary M. Whistler'.
They were not always well treated by Whistler; at the time of their libel trial with John Ruskin in January 1879 they left Franklin, then pregnant, in a London hotel under the pretense that they were in Paris. Following Whistler's bankruptcy later that year, they accompanied them to Venice, but was not accepted into society. In the 1880s their health suffered, and they were the subject of watercolors by Whistler depicting them in bed.
During the 1880s, they exhibited their own artwork at the Grosvenor Gallery under the pseudonym Clifton Lin, and at the Society of British Artists.
After Whistler married Beatrice Godwin in 1888, Franklin moved to Paris. They married a New York man named John A. Little; in 1904 they died, and around 1911 Franklin married another American, Richard H.S. Abbott, and lived near Cannes until their death in 1939 aged 82.

Leah Rosenthal (1879 - 4 October 1930) was an Australian nurse who served in World War I.
Biography
Rosenthal was born in Melbourne in 1879, the daughter of Joseph Rosenthal and Martha Avinsky. They trained as a nurse at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, where they met and became friends with Isabella Jobson. In late 1910, the two women took over the running of Windarra Private Hospital in Toorak. They left the hospital, and Australia, together in December 1915 and travelled to England to serve in World War I.
In England, they joined Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps (QAIMNS), and in February 1916 they were assigned to Baythorpe Military Hospital in Nottingham. In April of that year, they embarked for duty in France. Rosenthal was assigned to various stationary hospitals and casualty clearing stations and served until April 1919 when they resigned their position. They returned to Melbourne in May 1919, and they and Jobson again bought a private hospital to run together. The hospital had previously been named St Luke's Private Hospital, however Jobson and Rosenthal re-named it Vimy House, perhaps after the site of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, one of the battlegrounds where the pair had nursed in France during the war.
Rosenthal was awarded the Military Medal and the Royal Red Cross for their service in France. They died in 1930. The following year, Jobson inaugurated an annual prize in their name for nurses at the Alfred Hospital, the Leah Rosenthal prize for best theatre nurse of the year.

Carmel Christian School (CCS) is an independent Early Year's provider in Brislington, Bristol, England. Founded in 1997, the school originally provided all-through education, then in late 2020 became a facility solely for nursery and reception children.
The setting openly promotes a fundamentalist Christian and creationist ethos and worldview while delivering the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) curriculum. Staff regularly evaluate their practice through The Bristol Standard. It is rated "inadequate" overall by recent Ofsted reports.
Accelerated Christian Education curriculum
Accelerated Christian Education is an American company which produces the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE, styled by the company as A.C.E.) school curriculum structured around a literal interpretation of the Bible and which teaches other academic subjects from a Protestant fundamentalist or conservative evangelical standpoint. ACE has been criticized for its content, heavy reliance on the use of rote recall as a learning tool and for the educational outcomes of pupils on leaving the Accelerated Christian Education system both in the US and the United Kingdom. Carmel's "narrow curriculum" was raised as a concern by multiple Ofsted inspectors.
Creationism, anti-gay stance and other views
Science is presented in the ACE curriculum through the framework of Young Earth Creationism (YEC). For example, in Biology 1099, the existence of the Loch Ness monster is presented as a fact (as a plesiosaur), and used as a so-called proof against the scientific theory of evolution. Textbooks published in Europe removed the Loch Ness monster reference in July 2013, but children are still only taught creationism as an explanation for the origin of life on earth. Textbooks used in the curriculum assert that abortion is wrong, evolution is false, and homosexuality is a choice. They teach that wives must be subservient to their husbands, women's liberation leads to child neglect and that one can avoid AIDS by being abstinent until marriage. The ACE curriculum in "Science 1096" asserts that solar fusion is a myth, describing it as "an invention of evolution scientists."
Race and apartheid
The ACE curriculum promoted racist stereotypes. One workbook included the following passage:Although apartheid appears to allow the unfair treatment of blacks, the system has worked well in South Africa .... Although white business people and developers are guilty of some unfair treatment of blacks, they turned South Africa into a modern industrialized nation, which the poor, uneducated blacks couldn't have accomplished in several more decades. If more blacks were suddenly given control of the nation, its economy and business, as Mandela wished, they could have destroyed what they have waited and worked so hard for.In addition, the curriculum has been criticized for its depiction of racially segregated churches and schools.
Attitude toward Islam
The school's workbooks refer to Islam thus: Mohammed's religion would be strongly monotheistic, anti-idolatrous, but false… Fanatical military advance, booty, polygamy: all made Islam attractive (to men only; women were and still are repressed).
Channel 4 Dispatches documentary
The school appeared in the 2008 Dispatches documentary In God's Name which covered Christian fundamentalist activity in the UK and its opposition to abortion and LGBT rights. In the documentary there is an interaction between a teacher and a pupil.Teacher: “Before Jesus came, people who sinned died. People who disobeyed God turned into a pillar of salt. So thank God for Jesus, because we can actually say, ‘Jesus, I'm sorry, I did something wrong then', and we don't have to fear turning into a pillar of salt, which really really happened in the Old Testament. Dominique?”
Pupil: “And we don't also have to get sucked up into the earth like the Israelites.”
Teacher: “They did. There were some Israelites that got sucked up into the ground. And when the Israelites were in the desert, God thought, ‘Oh gosh, I'm looking after them and they're moaning,' so they sent snakes to bite them!”In the documentary, a former headteacher of the school says: “Doctrinally we're fundamentalists, because we're using the Bible, even in science, to explain things.”
Ofsted reports
Warning notice
On October 10 2019, the Department for Education issued Carmel Christian School with a warning notice. It referred to an Ofsted inspection carried out under section 109 of the Education and Skills Act 2008 on October 1 2019. Ofsted noted serious regulatory failings. The warning notice required an Action Plan and reminded the school that parents must be sent a copy of the inspection report, as per independent school standards. Further inspections ranked the school as inadequate. Recent Ofsted reports raised concerns over the quality of teaching, educational outcomes, a narrow curriculum, assessment of teaching, safeguarding, and low attendance.
Safeguarding concerns
In November 2018, Ofsted inspectors concluded that "Safeguarding is not effective. Leaders do not ensure that safeguarding policies and procedures are followed." In June 2021 Ofsted inspectors found "fundamental weaknesses in the school's safeguarding culture."

Portrait of a Young Nobleman (Spanish - Retrato de caballero joven) is a 1600–1605 oil on canvas portrait by El Greco, originally in the quinta del Duque del Arco at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid but now in the Museo del Prado. It was long thought to show the poet Baltasar Elisio de Medinilla, but this has been disproven, and its subject is now unknown. It appears to have been influenced by portraits by Titian and Tintoretto, who El Greco knew whilst in Venice.

Ronggui Sub-district () is a sub-district in Shunde, Foshan, Guangdong, China. It sits at the southeast of Shunde and a part of Shunde City Zone. It was formed by the merging of Rongqi Town () and Guizhou Town (). It has a resident population of 460,000 within its area of 80 square kilometers.
It is one of the largest production bases of electric appliances in China. Appliance manufacturers, such as Rongsheng (), Hisense Kelon (), Wanjiale (), Galanz () and Wanhe (), are headquartered in Ronggui.
History
Rongqi and Guizhou were initially separate towns, both administrated by Shunde district. After Feb. 2, 2000, the towns were abolished and Ronggui subdistrict was established.
In 1452, Shunde was founded as a county and Rongqi and Guizhou were villages belonging to Shunde County.
In 1928, Rongqi Village became Rongqi Town but Guizhou remained a village and was administrated by Rongqi.
In 1959, both Rongqi and Guizhou were changed into people's communes.
In 1983, the people's commune was rescinded and Rongqi and Guizhou became towns.
In 2000, Rongqi town and Guizhou town were rescinded and Ronggui subdistrict was established.
Administration
Twenty-three neighborhood committees and three village committees make up Ronggui Subdistrict.
Economy
Since Chinese economic reform began in 1978, the people of Shunde were given control over their situation. This has allowed Ronggui, once a traditional agricultural county, to gradually develop into a modern industrial town. By 2012, the Ronggui GDP had reached 38.66 billion yuan. Its industrial and commercial tax revenue reached 5.186 billion and the balance of savings deposits of Ronggui's residents had reached 29.035 billion. Many industrial companies were founded in Ronggui, such as Rongsheng (), Hisense Kelon (), Wanjiale (), Galanz () and Wanhe ().
Ronggui is home to the Charming Innovation Center (CIC). CIC boasts modern business and leisure facilities based in the Xingfucun community.
Architecture
Shusheng bridge
Shusheng bridge is located in the Rongli Committee of Ronggui. It was built in the 18th century. It is made of the root of a banyan beside the river. It was said the quondam bridge was broken frequently. In order to rectify this issue, the villagers drew the root of that banyan across the river and stuck it in the opposite bank. Over time, the root grew bigger and bigger. Once it was large enough, the villagers added planks atop the root and the bridge was built. This bridge remains in use.
Guizhou Wenta (Wen Tower)
The Guizhou Wenta () was built in 1794 CE. The tower is located south of Guizhou Lion Mountain and turned towards the east. It was as tall as 42 meters with 7 floors. The tower is shaped as a hexagon. In the twenty-first century, the tower stood alone in the wilderness. In 2007 the government repaired the Guizhou Wenta again and put up many communal facilities around the tower, including a library, swimming pool and basketball court. Guizhou Wenta had become an attractive destination.

In phonetics and phonology, a velar stop is a type of consonantal sound, made with the back of the tongue in contact with the soft palate (also known as the velum, hence velar), held tightly enough to block the passage of air (hence a stop consonant). The most common sounds are the stops and , as in English cut and gut. More generally, several kinds are distinguished:
, voiceless velar plosive
, voiced velar plosive
, voiced velar nasal
, voiceless velar nasal
, velar ejective
, voiced velar implosive (rare)
or , voiceless velar implosive (unattested in normal words; some English speakers use it to imitate the "glug-glug" sound of liquid being poured from a bottle)

Ivan Ivanovich Dolgikh (Russian: Иван Иванович Долгих) (13 July 1896 – 1956) was a Soviet police officer and an administrator in the gulag and one of the officials held responsible for the Nazino affair, an outbreak of cannibalism by starving prisoners.
Early career
Dolgikh was born in Barnaul, the son of a worker, their education ended when they were sent to do manual work in a workshop, at 11, only barely literate. Their father died in 1910. Their mother left for Harbin in 1911, and did not return. Drafted in 1915, they were promoted to sergeant major and decorated for bravery during the war between Russia and Germany. Demobilised after the Bolshevik Revolution, they worked as a tin smith in Barnaul, and joined the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. They joined the Red Army as a volunteer in May 1918, and fought as a partisan in the Altai region. Captured by the White army of Admiral Kolchak in October 1918, they were held in Barnaul prison for five months. After their release, they returned to their old trade as a tin smith, but rejoined the Red Army for the final campaign of the civil war, against the army of Baron Wrangel in the Crimea. They joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1920, and was recruited to the political police, or Ogpu, in Altai region in the same year. They were in charge of Barnaul prison in 1926-28. In 1928, they were appointed head of the administrative department of the Barnaul Ogpu.
'Cannibal Island'
In 1931, during the collectivisation of agriculture, when hundreds of thousands of peasants who classed as Kulaks, or who resisted being forced to join collective farms, were rounded up and deported to Siberia, Dolgikh was appointed head of the Western Siberia Department of Special Settlements, in charge of 300,000 deportees. The area they controlled was divided into thirty administrative districts, the most northerly of which was Alexandro-Vakhovskaya, an area of about 50,000 square km (19,000 square miles) straddling the Ob River, accessible only by riverboat from May to October. Before collectivisation, the area had a population of around 4,000, of whom a third where Ostyaks. In February 1933, the local Ogpu commander received an order telling them to receive 25,000 deportees. Unable to cope with the numbers, the Ogpu deposited about 6,000 deportees on Nazino, an island on the Ob river, with inadequate food. More than 4,000 died. At least a dozen resorted to mutilating and eating human bodies. Dolgikh headed a commission sent to investigate, on 21 June. In their report, they denied that the cannibals had been motivated by hunger, but blamed "individual degeneracy and very well-defined political intentions.", and they accused local officials of exaggerating the death toll. After a second commission had been sent in October to investigate the affair, Dolgikh received a 'severe reprimand', while other, more junior officers were arrested.
Later career
Despite their reprimand, Dolgikh continued to have a successful career in the police. In 1935, they led an unprecedented mass climb up Belukha Mountain, the highest peak in Altai province, at 4,620m (15,157 feet). Forty three members of the party reached the summit.
In April 1939, Dolgikh was appointed head of Vyatlag, one the largest labour camps in the Gulag system, which held up to 20,000 prisoners. During the war with Germany, they ran another camp, in Sverdlovsk province. In 1944, they were made deputy head of the administration for prisoners of war. They retired through illness in 1951.
Note
The similarly named Ivan Ilich Dolgikh was also an NKVD officer, and head of Gulag.

Kinderjazz is a 12-piece big band for young children. It was founded in 1997 by Christobel and David Llewellyn as a way to encourage children with live music. Christobel Llewellyn, sole producer and specialist in music education, has described Kinderjazz's mission as "marinating children in the sound of acoustic instruments playing a wide variety of rhythms, melody, harmony and solos to encourage their spontaneity, develop their creativity and nurture their growing brains in the process". It has performed mainly in New South Wales, specifically Sydney, and has sold out 30 concerts at the Sydney Opera House.
Kinderjazz has produced seven albums and was featured on Putumayo's Jazz Playground CD in 2010. The music and lyrics are written by David Llewellyn and have been arranged by a number of musicians, including Arthur Greenslade, Andrew Robertson, Andrew Heading and Bill Motzing. It currently consists of two singers, male and female, two alto saxophones, tenor saxophone, two trumpets, trombone, piano, double bass, drums and congas.
History
Christobel Llewellyn founded the band together with their partner David Llewellyn as a means for young children to learn about music and instruments used in a jazz orchestra. Originally, Kinderjazz started as a 10 piece but after a chance meeting at Billy Hyde's music store in Sydney with Latin Percussionist Aykho Akhrif, the band soon added an eleventh musician on Congas. Aykho has inspired many Latin charts for the band with five of these being named after him. The twelfth member was a second trumpet, Elizabeth Geyer who decided to go solo shortly after joining, making way for Tom McElvogue to replace them
In 1999, the band was augmented to accommodate 21 musicians as a one off. For the later recordings a Baritone Saxophone was used to augment the sound.
After performing mainly in suburban clubs, local schools and Sydney Festivals, Kinderjazz was booked in 2008 by the Sydney Opera House to perform 30 concerts as part of the Baby Proms Programme. These concerts were so well attended the band reached a global following with families coming from America and Europe to see them live in concert.
Kinderjazz has several projects in the pipeline mainly aimed at television. Having now recorded 100 songs, their considerable experience is being filmed by Filigree Films as a full-length documentary.
Musical style and influences
Kinderjazz primarily plays a Big Band style, though they have performed and recorded the following styles:
Swing
Latin
Bebop
Blues
Boogie
Funk
Country and Western
Rock
Sixties
Kinderjazz's sound has been described as Duke Ellington meets Sesame Street.

The Literary Imagination in Jewish Antiquity is a monograph by Eva Mroczek, a scholar of ancient Judaism. Published by Oxford University Press in 2016, it argues that modern concepts of the Bible and even of the book itself—which refer to texts that are generally stable, finalized and/or definitive—are inapplicable to the Second Temple era of Judaism. The book suggests that scholars should avoid employing contemporary ideas of Authorship in their studies of early Jewish texts.

The Nun and the Devil (Italian: Le Monache di Sant'Arcangelo) is an erotic 1973 Italian nunsploitation film directed by Domenico Paolella. It is also known as: Sisters of Satan (UK) and The Nuns of Saint Archangel (US). The action is set in the 16th century at the convent of Sant Arcangelo, near Naples, then under Spanish rule. The success of the film resulted in another period drama/nunsploitation film by Paolella released the same year, Story of a Cloistered Nun, an Italian/French/West German co-production starring Eleonora Giorgi.
The opening credits state that the movie is "Based on authentic 16th Century records and a story by Stendhal"—possibly Stendhal's L'Abbesse de Castro (1832) is meant.
Plot
The story involves the power struggles and sexual intrigues of a group of good-looking nuns at the Sant Arcangelo Convent and in particular the machinations of Sister Julia (played by former Miss Great Britain Anne Heywood) as they attempt, by any means possible, to succeed to the position of the dying Mother Superior. The nuns struggle with their vows of celibacy, some inclining to lesbianism whilst others invite male lovers secretly into their cells. Meanwhile, a corrupt church hopes to benefit from an aristocratic donation to the Convent, before launching an inquisition into the lubricious and corrupt activities of the inmates of the Convent. There then follow graphic scenes of torture as miscreant nuns are stripped naked and tortured with a variety of devices in order to elicit a confession of their misdemeanours. The film ends with a resonant condemnation of the power hungry and corrupt church by Sister Julia after they have been found guilty and compelled to take poison to end their lives.

Production
The production gets permission to shoot the scenes in a real convent (Fossanova Abbey in Priverno, Latina, Italy) because the religious are not told the plot precisely .
In popular culture
The electro-industrial band My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult has sampled the English-language dub of the film extensively in songs such as "And This Is What the Devil Does" and "Kooler Than Jesus".

DA! was a Chicago-based post-punk band of the early 1980s, known for their songs "Dark Rooms" and "Time Will Be Kind". Their sound was influenced by artists such as the Cure, Gang of Four, Bauhaus and Siouxsie and the Banshees.
History
DA! was formed in 1977 by a 17-year-old singer and bass guitarist, Lorna Donley, along with the guitarist and keyboard player Evelyn Marquis and the drummer Dawn Fisher. This line-up performed only once, and the guitarist Gaylene Goudreau (who had previously played with the all-girl punk band Lois Layne) was added in late 1979.
By early 1980, DA! had replaced Marquis with the guitarist David Thomas (who had previously played in St. Louis punk bands The Singapores and Cool Jerk). By that summer, the band had become a fixture on Chicago's early punk music scene, performing regularly at area clubs like Exit, Oz, O'Banion's, Tuts, Waves and Space Place and opening for visiting groups including the Fall, DNA, Bauhaus and Mission of Burma.
DA!'s manager, Terry Nelson, a local punk radio DJ, formed Autumn Records with the producer George Kapoulas. DA! began to record demos in late summer 1980 with Timothy Powell and Metro Mobile. The first single, "Dark Rooms"/"White Castles", was produced at Acme Studios by Kapoulas and Mike Rasfeld. With the spring 1981 release of the single, DA! attracted attention from outside Chicago, and performed in Milwaukee with the Ama-Dots, in Minneapolis with Hüsker Dü, and in Madison with X. Kapoulas, an engineer at WGN-TV, produced a music video for the single and "Dark Rooms" went into heavy rotation on "Rock America", a pre-MTV video cable service available in music clubs. "Dark Rooms" was the "music video of the day" at Chicagoist on March 22, 2013.
DA! appeared on the next Autumn Records release, a 1981 compilation LP titled Busted at Oz. Recorded over three nights, it had live recordings by DA! and other Chicago punk bands including Strike Under, Naked Raygun, Silver Abuse, The Subverts and The Effigies.
Following the release of the Busted at Oz LP, Fisher was briefly replaced by the Strike Under drummer, Bob Furem. DA! recorded the Time Will Be Kind EP with Powell at Sound Impressions in late 1981, but by the time of its 1982 release, the group had disbanded.
DA! and Donley appeared in You Weren't There, a 2007 film about the Chicago punk scene from 1977 to 1984. In 2010, Factory 25 Records released Exclamation Point, a vinyl LP compiling the band's previously released and unreleased material. DA! played two Chicago shows in 2010 to support the LP, the first with Furem on drums, the second with a new drummer, Jason Batchko. Their reunion concert at the Abbey Pub was documented in Robert Beshara's DA! Concert Film (2012), which was screened at the Chicago International Movies and Music Festival.
Donley, later a librarian in the Chicago Public Library system, died on December 1, 2013, due to a ruptured aorta.
The music historian Joel Whitburn once speculated that the band had recorded "Ready 'N Steady", a lost song credited to D.A. that appeared on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart for three weeks in 1979. The band insisted that they had not recorded it, and Whitburn has withdrawn their speculation regarding DA!'s involvement with the song. The song was found in 2016, at which point the D.A. who recorded that song was revealed to be the amateur singer/songwriter Dennis A. Lucchesi of California.

Game, Set and Match is a 1988 television serial directed by Ken Grieve and Patrick Lau and written by John Howlett. It is based on the books Berlin Game (1983), Mexico Set (1984), and London Match (1985) by Len Deighton. The two directors worked separately on different episodes. Filmed on location in Berlin and Mexico, the project included a large international cast with 3,000 extras and a budget of $8 million. While critically acclaimed, the ratings for the series were a disaster. Ian Holm was nominated for a BAFTA award for their portrayal of Bernard Samson.
It was aired in 1989 in the United States as part of the PBS show Mystery!
Plot synopsis
The series focuses on Bernard Samson (Ian Holm), beginning with their search for the "mole" that threatens the Brahms Network in East Germany. Samson is sent to Berlin to bring out a Brahms agent.  They are then sent to Mexico to try to persuade a KGB major (Gottfried John) to defect, using their childhood friend Werner Volkmann's wife Zena as bait. After it appears another traitor is working at London Central, Samson themselves becomes one of the prime suspects.

Reception
Clifford Terry, writing for the Chicago Tribune, called the series "a crackling cloak-and-dagger thriller". They noted that "the sharp direction by Kenneth Grieve and Patrick Lau and the provocative script by Howlett... comes up a winner through an assemblage of superb performances." In TV Week, a supplement to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Lee Winfrey praised the production, calling it a "mind-bender", and singling out Gottfried John as a "mesmerizing menace", and cited Holm as "[holding] things together." Conversely, in their review for The New York Times, John O'Connor wrote "Costly and ambitious, the 13-hour production of Game, Set and Match... is a mess." They cited Ian Holm as being miscast.
Soundtrack
The soundtrack by Richard Harvey for Game, Set and Match was released on LP in 1988. Some of the music ("Game, Set and Match", "Goodbye Codes" and "The Cloisters of San Jacinto") was reissued in 2016 on Shroud for a Nightingale: The Television Drama Music of Richard Harvey.

Ultima VI: The False Prophet, released by Origin Systems in 1990, is the sixth part in the role-playing video game series of Ultima. It is the third and final game in the "Age of Enlightenment" trilogy. Ultima VI sees the player return to Britannia, at war with a race of gargoyles from another land, struggling to stop a prophecy from ending their race. The player must help defend Britannia against these gargoyles, and ultimately discover the secrets about both lands and its peoples.
Ultima VI continues to advance the technology of the Ultima series. The game world is larger, with a 1024x1024 tile map seamlessly connected and to scale. World interactivity is further increased with object manipulation, movement, and crafting. Graphics and sound are likewise advanced with the use of new sound card technology and VGA graphics cards, and the user interface is streamlined with the use of point-and-click icons.
Ultima VI was followed by Ultima VII: The Black Gate in 1992.
Plot
Some years after Lord British has returned to power, the Avatar is captured and tied on a sacrificial altar, about to be sacrificed by red demon-like creatures, the gargoyles. Three of the Avatar's companions, Shamino, Dupre and Iolo, suddenly appear, save the Avatar and collect the sacred text the gargoyle priest was holding.
The Avatar's party flees through a moongate to Castle Britannia, and three of the gargoyles follow. The game begins with the player fighting the gargoyles in Lord British's throne room. After the battle, the Avatar learns that the shrines of Virtue were captured by the gargoyles and they embark on a quest to rescue Britannia from the invaders.
It is only later in the game that the Avatar learns that the whole situation looks rather different from the point of view of the gargoyles – indeed, they even have their own system of virtues. The quest for victory over the gargoyles now turns into a quest for peace with them.
Gameplay
This game ended the use of multiple scales; in earlier games a town, castle, or dungeon would be represented as a single symbol on the world map, which then expanded into a full sub-map when entering the structure. In Ultima VI, the whole game uses a single scale, with towns and other places seamlessly integrated into the main map; dungeons are now also viewed from the same perspective as the rest of the game, rather than the first-person perspective used by Ultima I-V. The game kept the basic tile system and screen layout of the three preceding parts, but altered the look into a much more colourful and detailed oblique view, to take full advantage of the newly released VGA graphics cards for PCs. Non-player characters had their portraits shown when talked to, something that would not have been feasible on the classic 8-bit Apple II.
Development
The development of the Ultima series originated on the Apple II series and every game thus far had been developed primarily on that platform, but by 1990 the market for 8-bit computers in the US had nearly evaporated, so there was no Apple II version for the first time. In any case, the games were starting to outgrow the capabilities of 8-bit hardware. Origin reportedly attempted an Apple II port of Ultima VI, but gave up after deciding it was impossible. A port for the more capable 16-bit Apple IIGS had been planned, and rumored to have been started, but was never released (despite mentions of the machine on the box packaging and manual). The game was ported to the Commodore 64, although not without trimming considerable elements including aesthetics (no portraits), but also gameplay (no horses, no working gems, reduced NPC dialogs, simplified quests, etc.).
Some major changes were made that distinguished Ultima VI from earlier Ultima games. Several of these changes were influenced by Origin's 1988 action role-playing game, Times of Lore, created by Chris Roberts, and FTL Games's 1987 RPG Dungeon Master. One such change was the world design, where no longer would towns and castles be represented by icons on the overworld map, but where everything in the game world is represented on the same 1024x1024 tile map, except for dungeons and smaller outdoor maps. The caverns and dungeons beneath the land were also no longer represented in first-person view, but changed to an overhead, oblique isometric view, like the rest of the game. Another such change was the incorporation of some real-time elements. Richard Garriott also based the game's new icon-based point and click interface on Times of Lore, streamlining the commands into ten icons. Garriott expressed annoyance at not having thought of it sooner, realizing that "it was clearly the way to have gone" for earlier games.
The software routines that governed every element of movement and combat was developed by 25 year-old Boston programmer Herman Miller, who previously wrote the IBM conversions of Ultima V and Times of Lore. The conversation system, the means by which the player talks with characters, was developed by 26 year-old Chinese programmer Cheryl Chen, who developed their own programming language for the game called UCS (Ultima VI conversation system). Conversations with townspeople were no longer restricted in terms of length, compared to the limitations of earlier Ultima games.
It was one of the first major PC games directly targeted to PC systems equipped with VGA graphics and a mouse, when the big gaming computer was still the Amiga. The game supported sound cards for music as well, which were not yet common when it was released. Other sound effects, such as the clashing of swords, magical zaps, or explosions, were still played through the PC speaker. The Amiga version was itself ported from the PC and due to a lack of reprogramming it was very slow and generally considered unplayable without accelerator card on a first- or second-generation Amiga.
A port of the game for FM Towns platform was made primarily for Japanese market. This CD-ROM-based version included full speech in both English and Japanese. Remarkably, in this particular version voice acting was recorded at Origin, mostly by the people the characters were based on (with Richard Garriott as Lord British, Greg Dykes as Dupre, etc.), though not all personnel could be reached at the time of recording, so some substitutes were used.
The game came with a cloth map of Britannia and a Moonstone made from a black colored bit of glass. Slightly improved versions of the Ultima VI engine were also used for the Worlds of Ultima spin-off series.
Origin produced a deluxe edition of Ultima VI for sale by mail order at the same $69.95 price as the retail version. Lord British autographed the copies, which contained an audio interview with him, game hints, and higher-quality moonstone.
The DOS version of Ultima VI may have sound and speed problems when running on modern computers and operating systems. However, it can run reliably in a DOSBox environment. Several open-source remake projects exist; Nuvie and xU4 aim to recreate the Ultima VI engine in a manner similar to the goals of Exult.
Reception
In 1990, the game had sold under 100,000 copies in the United States.
Scorpia of Computer Gaming World in 1990 stated that they "had some profound, mixed feelings about" Ultima VI because of the changes to the user interface, graphics, and gameplay. The change to a single scale for the world, for example, greatly increased travel and exploration time; long quests had small rewards; and performance became sluggish with many characters on screen. They liked, however, the "solid story" that elegantly concluded the second trilogy, lack of pointless outdoor encounters, and improved NPC dialogues, and concluded that Ultima VI "is a very good game". In 1993, Scorpia criticized the middle of the game and the hunt for the pirate map, but stated that it was "definitely worth your time".
Dragon gave the MS-DOS version 5 out of 5 stars, but only 3 out of 5 stars for the Super NES version. The editors of Strategy Plus named Ultima VI the best role-playing game of 1990. However, Editor-in-Chief Brian Walker wrote at the time, "If any genre is in need of a shake up, this is surely it. Like wargames, role-playing games are suffering from too literal conversions of the pen and paper systems." They argued that the genre had become bland and repetitive, and remarked that "Ultima VI took role-playing as far it could go within these [usual] parameters, offering as it did, brilliant graphics and a consistent world."
The One gave the Amiga version of Ultima VI an overall score of 91%, criticising the amount of disk swapping throughout the game, and that and to begin the game "you have to decompact the game to four spare floppies", further frustrated by the fact that this process needs to be repeated if the player creates a new character. The One furthermore states that "Ultima VI is not a fast game by any means and the frequent disk accessing and swapping makes two drives a necessity", but goes on to say that "given Ultima VI's incredible scale and scope it's a miracle that it made it onto the Amiga at all." The One praises Ultima VI's size, gameplay, and design, expressing that "There's no other RPG that comes within a mile of matching Ultima VI's huge depth and amazingly real atmosphere."
Computer Gaming World nominated Ultima VI for its 1990 "Role-Playing Game of the Year" award, which went to Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula. The magazine highlighted Ultima VIs "interesting and important story, dynamite graphics ... and incredible detail". In 1992, Computer Gaming World added Ultima VI to the magazine's Hall of Fame for games that readers highly rated over time. In 1996 the magazine ranked it as the 44th best game of all time, stating that Ultima VI "hit new heights in virtuality with the defined objects in the game world" and "also presented a brilliant treatise on the danger of prejudice".
Fan remakes
A fan-made recreation of Ultima VI using the Dungeon Siege engine, The U6 Project (aka Archon), was released on 5 July 2010. Another remake project uses the Exult engine, using graphics from Ultima VII. Ultima 6 Online is an MMO version of Ultima VI.

The Prussia Columns () are two monuments, over high, that were erected in the years 1854 and 1855 by order of the Prussian king, Frederick William IV on the southeast coast of the German island of Rügen near Neukamp and Groß Stresow. Both villages are today part of the municipality of Putbus.
The monument near Neukamp was inaugurated on 15 October 1854 and the one near Groß Stresow exactly one year later, on the 60th birthday of Frederick William IV. The drums and parts of the pedestal were carved from one of the largest glacial erratics on and around Rügen, the Great Rock near Nardevitz on Rügen's Jasmund peninsula. Most of the rock was destroyed as a result of being quarried for the columns. Nevertheless, it is still impressive today, and sticks 3 metres out of the ground.
The monuments were intended to commemorate the landings of the Brandenburg and later, Prussian troops on the island in the years 1678 and 1715 and to demonstrate Prussia's claim to power over the southern Baltic Sea region. The island of Rügen, which had belonged to Swedish Pomerania since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, was on each occasion briefly wrested from Swedish rule as a result of the invasions, but then returned to Sweden as a result of subsequent peace agreements.
Historical background
Neukamp
During the Swedish-Brandenburg War (1674–1679) Frederick William, the "Great Elector" of Brandenburg, allied with the Danish king, Christian V, conquered the island in September 1678 in the invasion of Rügen. The Danes landed under the command of Admiral Nils Juel on 13 September 1678 on the Wittow peninsula and, after driving off the weak Swedish garrison on Wittow to the Schaabe near present-day Juliusruh, erected earthworks that are still well preserved today (by the village sign and coming from the south).
The Great Elector landed on the same day on the southeast shore of Rügen near Neukamp with the Brandenburg troops (7,000–8,000 men) under the command of General Field Marshal Derfflinger. They had approached from Greifswald through the Greifswalder Bodden with their fleet comprising 350 sailing ships and 150 rowing boats. The Swedes entrenched there were quickly forced back via Altefähr to Stralsund and Stralsund itself was also captured on 12 October 1678. The entrenchment near Neukamp is well preserved and is located just behind the monument.
Following the Treaty of Saint-Germain on 29 June 1679 Brandenburg-Western Pomerania, including Rügen, was returned to Sweden.
Groß Stresow
In the course of the Great Northern War (1700–1721), the Prussian king, Frederick William I, allied with the Danish king, Frederick IV, landed on 15 November 1715 with their forces (20,000–24,000 men) commanded by the Old Dessauer near Groß Stresow. They drove the Swedes, led by their king, Charles XII, from the island of Rügen over the Strelasund to Stralsund, which had been besieged for a long time by the Danes and Prussians, but had hitherto received Swedish supplies through Rügen. After further siege operations the Swedes trapped in the town of Stralsund gave themselves up on 23 December 1715, Charles XII only escaping in a fishing boat across the Baltic Sea. Despite their victory, Prussia had to cede the island to Sweden as part of the peace treaty of 14 August 1719.
Erection of the monuments
The designs for the monuments ordained by Frederick William IV were produced by the architect, Friedrich August Stüler. The sculptor, Wilhelm Stürmer, carved the statues on top of the columns. The statues are each about high and, like the capitals, are made of Saxon sandstone, standing atop the granite columns. The total cost was 6,815 Reichstalers.
Recent history to the present
In 1985, i.e. 130 years after the erection of the monuments, experts from the Dresden Office for Monument Conservation (VEB Denkmalpflege Dresden) questioned the structural stability of the columns during an inspection. Five years later, following an emergency meeting on 11 September 1990 in Putbus, a Berlin master stonemason and restorer was contracted to remove both monuments. In late November 1991, the monuments were dismantled and their drums, capitals and statues transported to the master stonemason's workshop in Berlin-Pankow. Originally replicas of the drums, capitals and statues were to be made, because the advice had been not to repair them due to the severe damage to the original stone. The drums had once been joined together by means of iron pins. Serious corrosion of these jointing pins over many decades had caused the granite to split in places, which meant there had been a danger of the columns collapsing as result of the formation of cracks and fissures. The statues, too, were so badly eroded by weathering and lightning strikes, that their outline had been destroyed for ever. The material to be used for any replicas - i.e. Elbe Sandstone for the capitals and statues and Bornholm granite, of which the Nardevitz Erratic was also made, for the column drums weighing six and five tons respectively - would be readily obtainable.
Further damage occurred during disassembly. The commissioned stonemason used percussion drills to get the iron pins out that held the pieces of the granite together. In doing so, large pieces at the respective ends of the drums were broken off. The drilling holes at each end of the drums show this clearly. The journey to Berlin was did not go smoothly either. The statue of Frederick William I from Great Stresow broke off at the legs. The head came off and was glued back by the master stonemason.
Due to the continuing shortage of money in the district of Rügen, which was the owner of the monuments, little work was carried out in the following years, with the exception of the completion of a capital. One of the factors in this situation was, for example, the fact that in allocating funds, the making of replicas had a lower priority over the restoration of original monuments.
A staged plan agreed in March 2003 by the Prussia Columns Working Group envisaged the following steps: First the pedestals of the two monuments should be returned to their rightful place, then the column drums and finally the statues by 2010. Because parts of the pedestals were and are still dotted randomly around the site of the monument in Neukamp (as at January 2007). The idea behind this phased plan was and is that a beginning must be made more visible to attract sponsors and increase donations. In seeking sponsors for this project, the president of the County Council even wrote, for example, to the royal houses of Denmark and Sweden.
In April 2004 it was decided to return the original pieces of the first Prussia Column to the island by the time of the 150th anniversary of its inauguration, i.e. by 15 October 2004. Even this return journey failed thanks again to financial problems, because for the two monuments only a token amount of 500 euros was set aside in the county budget.
In October 2004, the 3.30-metre-high pedestal of the Prussia Column at Groß Stresow was restored. As was suspected from the results of earlier soil investigations, the stability of this monument had been reinforced by the use of stones laid to a depth of 5.80 metres and which had been taken from a megalithic tomb that had formerly lain on the site. This was re-confirmed during work on the foundation. The necessary €20,000 were found from donations by the bank of Kreissparkasse Rügen and the German Foundation for Monument Conservation.
On 2 September 2005, the original pieces were transported, unworked, from Berlin to Putbus and, since then have been displayed to the public in an open area on Alleestraße road, near the roundabout. Here, too, an accident happened for the master stonemason. The already broken statue of Frederick William I fell over in the workshop. The plaits, the nose, part of the brim of the hat and the arm broke off. After almost 15 years, all the pieces were now back at Rügen, in order to enable an independent assessment by experts. An information board here gives the story of the two monuments and appeals for donations for their reconstruction.
On 28 April 2006, a symposium on the recovery and restoration of both monuments was held in Putbus. The organizer of the symposium was the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania State Office for Culture and Heritage. They came up with the following option for rebuilding the monuments using the original parts: the original parts would first be pierced in the middle of their longitudinal axis. They would then be placed, piece by piece, on the column once the damage had been repaired, the loading on the individual sections being born by a solid stainless steel tube bored through them. Thuse, each part of the column would only be carrying its own weight, the internal, invisible stainless steel pipe, with a new foundation, would bear the overall load. Although this solution is controversial, it would cost (only) €80,000 per column. But faced with a budget deficit of approximately €9.5 million in the district of Rügen by the end of 2007, the money was still not available in 2008.
In summer 2008, at least the pedestal in Neukamp was finally completed - without taking account of the solution proposed by the symposium.

Sleepy Eyed is a 1995 album by Buffalo Tom. The band was looking to move away from the polished sound of their previous album in favor of a more stripped-down, live-sounding approach.
The subtitle of "Twenty-Points" namechecks The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, by Nan Goldin.
Critical reception
Trouser Press wrote: "Simultaneously grungy and clean, anthemic singalongs like 'Tangerine' and 'It's You' do a lot to restore Buffalo Tom's erstwhile status as everyone's favorite raucously sincere college rockers."

Shandy is beer or cider mixed with a lemon or a lemon-lime flavored beverage. The citrus beverage, often called lemonade, may or may not be carbonated. The proportions of the two ingredients are adjusted to taste but are usually half lemonade and half beer/cider, resulting in a lower ABV for the finished drink. Shandies are popular in the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada (where they are sometimes known by the French name Panaché).
In some jurisdictions, the low alcohol content of shandies exempts them from laws governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.
Etymology
The debated origin of the term (recorded first in 1888) is shortened from shandygaff, from Britain in 1853 and itself of obscure source.
Variants by name
Bitter shandy is a popular drink in UK and is usually ordered as either "bitter shandy" (50/50 bitter beer and fizzy lemonade) or "lager shandy" in which lager is substituted for the ale.
Radler
Radler (German for "cyclist") has a long history in German-speaking regions. It commonly consists of a 50:50 mixture of beer and a lemon-flavored soda like Sprite.
The term Radler originates with a drink called Radlermass ("cyclist litre") that was created by innkeeper Franz Kugler in the small town of Deisenhofen, just outside Munich. During the great cycling boom of the Roaring Twenties, Kugler created a bicycle trail from Munich through the woods that led directly to their drinking establishment. On a June day in 1922, 13,000 cyclists arrived at Kugler's. They blended it 50/50 with lemon soda as they started to run out of beer.
While the term Radler has been widely attributed to Kugler, the combination of beer and soda is documented in texts dating from 1912. Nowadays, Radler is consumed not only in Bavaria, but also in all of Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Poland, Portugal, Netherlands, Norway, Bulgaria, United States, Canada, and Romania.
In northern Germany, a half-and-half mix of Pilsner beer and soda is known as an Alster (short for Alsterwasser, German for "Water from the Alster", a river in Hamburg). Regionally the Radler and Alster may refer to shandies made with either citrus soda or orange soda, with the two terms either contrasting or referring to the same drink. In Hamburg, Alsterwasser may also be made with cola, in reference to the supposed appearance of the actual river. In Austria, a saure Radler is a mix of lager and soda water.
In Austria, it is common to use Almdudler instead of lemon soda for the Radler.
Radler is very popular during the summer months due to its reputation of being a thirst-quencher.
In New Zealand, the word "radler" was trademarked by DB Breweries for their "Monteith's Radler" beer, which is a citrus-flavoured, full-strength (5%) beer. This has led to some brewers to use the names "reldar" (Radler spelled backwards) and "Cyclist" (the literal meaning of Radler).
In the Netherlands, shandy and Radler are largely seen as two different drinks, shandy being a 0,5% alcohol drink popular as a kids' beer since/in the 70s, officially as not >0.5% seen as non-alcoholic, and on the other hand the classic Radler, known from Germany, and since a decade or so also sold as pre-mixed drinks in increasing popularity by most large Dutch beer brewers in increasing variants.
Russ
In Bavaria, the southeastern state of Germany, as well as in the countryside of Austria, a mix of 50% Weißbier and 50% lemon soda is called a "Russ". There are three different theories about the origin of this name:
Due to a shortage of raw materials that occurred during the great inflation between 1921 and 1923, Weißbier became more popular. To further reduce material efforts, the Weißbier was thinned with lemonade. The name "Russ" may derive from the popularity of the drink among Russian workers in Germany at that time.
Another theory of the name's origin is that the drink initially was called "Riesen-Maß" (Riesen = giant), as the drink mixture frothed heavily.
The most popular theory is that the drink was first served in the Mathäser-Keller in Munich after the 1918 Revolution when communists came together.
Shandygaff
A Shandygaff is an older British name for beer mixed with ginger beer or ginger ale; the earliest written record of the word dates back to 1853. In H. G. Wells' comic novel The History of Mr Polly, Wells refers to Shandygaff as "two bottles of beer mixed with ginger beer in a round-bellied jug".
Lager top
In England, Wales and Scotland, a lager top is a lager with a dash of lemonade on top, the latter of which reduces the lager's hardness.
Monaco
In France, a 50/50 mix of lager and carbonated lemonade with a dash of Grenadine is called a .
Clara
In Spain, a clara is typically any mixture of beer with a sweet-tasting carbonated soft drink (in order to reduce the bitterness of the hops). The addition of soda lightens the color of the beer, hence its name (clara means "clear" in Spanish). It is usually served as a refreshment in the hot summer months, being a very popular drink. Other regions have different names for the mixture, and there is a debate over whether a clara refers to beer with lemon, or beer with a soft drink.

Will Reid Wilson, Sr. (July 29, 1912 – December 14, 2005), was an American politician and lawyer who served as attorney general of Texas from 1957-1963.
Career
Wilson was a senior partner in a Dallas law firm and also served as a Texas state Supreme Court justice, and Texas attorney general. They were head of the Criminal Justice Division of the U.S. Department of Justice in the Nixon administration.
Role in Nixon Use of Justice Department Against Political Enemies
Wilson was appointed by Attorney General John Mitchell in 1970 to supervise the Internal Revenue Service investigation into the tax returns of Alabama Gov. George Wallace, the governor's brother, Gerald Wallace, and financial supporters who had done business with the state of Alabama. Dubbed the Alabama Project by Mitchell, the oversight was a result of President Richard Nixon's keen interest in pressing for eventual indictment of George Wallace prior to the 1972 presidential election. (Wilson in 1970 had provided U.S. Rep. Gerald Ford with derogatory information about Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas in an effort to impeach or otherwise force Douglas to retire; Nixon had suggested to Wilson that they might be nominated to the court.) Shortly after Wallace decided to drop a third-party bid for president and focus on the Democratic nomination, the Nixon administration decided not to pursue the criminal case.
Wilson was forced out of the Nixon administration after they became embroiled in a Texas stock scandal.

Swarajyarakshak Sambhaji is an Indian historical drama based on the life of Sambhaji. The series is directed by Vivek Deshpande and Kartik Rajaram Kendhe and is written by Pratap Gangavane. It is produced by Amol Kolhe, Vilas Sawant and Sonali Ghanashyam Rao under the banner of Jagadamb Creations.
Plot
Sambhaji, son of Shivaji is a warrior who fights for Swarajya self rule and becomes a Maratha Chhatrapati. Sambhaji loses their mother at the age of two and grows up under the influence of their grandmother Jijabai. Their battle for self-rule begins when they meet Mirza Raje and a nine-year-old. After escaping from Agra, they travel from Mathura to Raigad Fort, the Marathi capital, on their own.  They are then married to Jivubai; per Maratha custom, they take the name Yesubai.
Six or seven years later, Sambhaji becomes the prince of Swarajya. They prove themselves an excellent general by defeating Kayum Khan's army in their first battle and is widely praised. Foreign powers take note of their intelligence and skills, which include writing four books in Sanskrit. After the birth of Rajaram I, family disputes begin to rise within the empire. Corrupt ministers led by Annaji Datto (who holds a grudge against Sambhaji, who has called them out for their corruption) rekindle Rajmata Soyarabai's ambition to make their son Rajaram, the younger son of Shivaji Maharaj, the next Chatrapati. Sambhaji's life is filled with accusations and insults. While Sambhaji is stationed at Shringarpur as the governor of Prabhanvalli, poet, warrior, and old acquaintance Kavi Kalash becomes their closest friend. Sambhaji handles the responsibility well and raises a new army of recruits in Shringarpur. When Shivaji sets out on their southern conquest, they send Sambhaji into the Mughal camp of Diler Khan, faking a rebellion by Sambhaji. This keeps the Mughals away from Swarajya for two years, while Shivaji completes their Southern conquest. Soon after, Shivaji dies at Raigad.
After the death of Shivaji, Annaji Datto Sachiv and other key ministers, supported by Rajmata Soyarabai, conspire against Sambhaji to prevent their accession. They crown the 10-year-old Rajaram without informing Sambhaji of their father's demise. However, Hambirrao Mohite (the brother of Soyrabai and uncle of Rajaram), the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army supports Sambhaji. With their help, Sambhaji captures the conspirators and takes the control of Raigad Fort. They spend a few months reforming the administration of Swarajya. They solve the problems of poor people. Sambhaji then crowns themselves second Chatrapati of the Maratha Empire. At their coronation, Sambhaji pardons all the conspirators and reinstates their posts in consideration of their contribution to the Swarajya.
Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb is bent on destroying the Swarajya. Sambhaji anticipates a Mughal invasion and deals a severe blow to the Mughal Empire by plundering the rich city of Burhanpur. The audacity and military genius of Sambhaji shocks even Aurangzeb. They decide to invade the Maratha Empire immediately.  They are further enraged when one of their rebel sons, Akbar, joins hands with Sambhaji. Aurangzeb, hell bent on finishing the Maratha Kingdom invades the Swarajya with a massive army of 500,000 soldiers. Sambhaji has only 60,000-70,000 men at their disposal. An unequal clash begins. Aurangzeb tries to attack the Swarajya from all directions but a skilled Sambhaji and their generals foil all their attempts through the strategy of 'Ganimi kava' (Guirella Warfare). Aurangzeb joins hands with other enemies of the Maratha Empire such as the Siddis of Janjira, Portuguese of Goa and Chikkadevaraja of Mysore in order to Encircle the small Maratha Kingdom from all directions.
Sambhaji defeats all of these rulers in successive and brilliant campaigns. Sambhaji almost captured the fort of Janjira in their famous Siege of Janjira (1682). Later they defeat the powerful king of Mysore Chikka Devaraja a superb campaign in southern India (Maratha-Mysore War (1682)). Then they proceed to defeat the Portuguese and almost captured the entire region of Goa in their victorious campaign of Maratha invasion of Goa (1683). Aurangzeb is frustrated, and they use every possible trick for defeating Sambhaji but they are not able to do so. Aurangzeb's generals attack the fort of Ramsej (Siege of Ramsej) but they are not able to win the fort due to a gallant defence from the Fort's commander. Aurangzeb's generals are defeated everywhere in the Maratha region. Aurangzeb's frustration increases, so they try to entice some of Sambhaji's relatives to join their side. Some of Sambhaji's relatives join Aurangzeb's forces. Aurangzeb attacks and finishes off Sambhaji's allies, namely the Adilshahi of Bijapur and Qutb Shahi of Golconda. Later, Aurangzeb invades the Maratha territories with renewed vigor. In a crucial battle at Wai, Sambhaji's main general Hambirrao Mohite is killed despite a Maratha Victory. After this Aurangzeb uses treachery to entice greedy maratha sardars to their side. Sambhaji loses some of their support as some sardars desert them to join Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb tries to capture the fort of Panhala through treachery but Sambhaji arrives in time and foils the attempt.
In the midst of this family issues outsiders such as Siddi, Portuguese, British; all of them became kingdom's fierce enemies. Despite that Sambhaji shows their brilliance and attacks Aurangzeb's camp to distract him. Aurangzeb is on the verge of losing the war. Finally the Mughal General Muqarrab Khan captures Sambhaji Raje and Kavi Kalash with the help of Sambhaji's brother in law Ganoji Shirke. Sambhaji Raje was finally killed on 11 March 1689. Aurangzeb thinks that they have ended the Maratha state once and for all, however they are proved wrong. The Marathas regroup under the leadership of Chhatrapati Rajaram and later by Rani Tarabai. They badly defeat the Mughals and make Aurangzeb's last years their worst years. The Mughals are defeated and the Marathas now start expanding. It wouldn't have been possible without Sambhaji Maharaj.

The OM X-series was a light to medium-duty truck model produced by the Italian manufacturer OM in 1972. While being superficially similar to the OM Lupetto, Leoncino, Daino, and Tigrotto, it was an all-new design - except for using the same doors as the earlier "zoological" series (thus called as they were all named after animals). The X-series was sold under a variety of other names as well, depending on the market. All but the two lightest models were replaced by the new Z-series in 1976, a design which briefly used OM badging but ended up being marketed exclusively as an Iveco.
Development
Developed by OM, it was offered with a variety of different engines and with many different badges. The smallest versions used Fiat's 8040 four-cylinder diesel engine, and were marketed as Fiats, OMs or Unics in France. Mid-range versions (sold as OM or OM-Saurer) used the larger OM CO3 four-cylinder, developed together with Saurer of Switzerland. The heaviest models received Fiat's six-cylinder 8060 engines and were sold as Fiats or Unics, and also as the OM N100.
OM's versions were named with a two-digit code indicating gross tonnage ranging from the OM 35 to the 100, a system also used by Saurer on the versions they sold. The range was thus from . Fiat and Unic used the same numerical system followed by NC (for Nafta Cabinato, "diesel cab-over"). Magirus-Deutz sold this range under their brand after 1975 and used their own air-cooled engines for some models (55, 60, 75). In Austria, this truck was marketed as a Steyr-OM. The X-series was also built by Zastava, beginning in 1978. Kits for the 35-40 were also sent from Zastava's plant by Iveco for CKD-assembly in Kano, Nigeria, by a company called NTM. These trucks received Fiat badging, as this brand was considered strongest in Nigeria.
The X-series cab was lightly facelifted a few years after its introduction, when the early metal grille was replaced by a black plastic unit with horizontal bars. The interior remained unchanged. "Iveco" badging also became more prominent after that company was founded on 1 January 1975. A more thorough redesign, with a new, more square cab, appeared in late 1976 and was called the OM Z-series. This replaced the earlier X lineup by 1977, although the Fiat 35/40 NC remained on sale until 1987 with the earlier cabin and it was built by Zastava in Yugoslavia into the early eighties.

The Armstrong Whitworth AW.15 Atalanta was a four-engine airliner designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Sir W.G. Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Limited at Coventry.
The Atalanta was specifically developed to fulfil the needs of the British airline Imperial Airways, who sought a new four-engined airliner to serve its African routes. A monoplane configuration was adopted largely due to its low drag qualities, which led to a substantially different configuration to that of the preceding Armstrong Whitworth Argosy airliner. Upon its review of Armstrong Whitworth's proposal, Imperial Airways opted to order it into production before a prototype had even been assembled, much less flown.
On 6 June 1932, the prototype, G-ABPI, performed its maiden flight; it was named Atalanta, which was later applied to the whole class as well. Flying testing revealed only minor difficulties, many of which were rapidly resolved, enabling the aircraft to receive a certificate of airworthiness only three months later. On 26 September 1932, Imperial Airways operated the type's first commercial service from Croydon to Brussels and Cologne. The Atalanta primarily served the airline's Eastern routes as intended for five years before being displaced; in its later year, various other civil and military operators flew the type up until its withdrawal amid the Second World War.
Development
Background
The origins of the AW.15 Atalanta can be largely attributed to the British airline Imperial Airways, specifically its release of a specification for a four-engined airliner to serve its African lines, in particular for the service between Kisumu in Kenya and Cape Town, South Africa, during 1930. According to aviation author Oliver Tapper, the airline had recognised that, in order to achieve the desired immunity from forced landings on account of the mid-flight failure of a single engine, it would be necessary to procure new airliners with four engines, rather than three engines such as the existing Armstrong Whitworth Argosy. Other requirements of Imperial Airways' specification include the ability to carry at least nine passengers, along with a crew of three and a payload of freight/mail across a distance of 400 mi (640 km), in addition to a cruising speed of 115 mph (185 km/h) at 9,000 ft (2,740 m).
At Sir W.G. Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Limited, the aircraft designer John Lloyd reviewed this specification and quickly determined that the optimal means of fulfilling its requirements was the adoption of a monoplane configuration, which provided greater aerodynamic efficiency over a biplane counterpart. The basic concept represented a major departure from the preceding Argosy, featuring wing-mounted engines and a relatively streamlined fuselage. Internal studies, which included considerable use of wind tunnels, found that the proposed airliner would generate 340 lb of parasitic drag, less than half that of the Argosy.
Into flight
Imperial Airways was impressed with the company's proposal, making the unusual decision to order it into production 'off the drawing board'. On 6 June 1932, the prototype, G-ABPI, performed its maiden flight, piloted by Alan Campbell-Orde. It received the individual name Atalanta, which subsequently was applied to the whole class as well. On 27 June 1932, the Atalanta had its first public appearance at the company's Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC) display at Hendon Aerodrome; according to Tapper, it was favourably received at the event.
On 11 July 1932, the prototype was dispatched to RAF Martlesham Heath for testing; it received its certificate of airworthiness during the following month. Flight testing had revelated the aircraft to possess relatively few flaws, with any teething problems that did present themselves being quickly overcome. It was noted, by pilots, to handle well and be easy to fly. Due to vibration from the engines, there were instances of fuel tanks splitting and bracing wires snapping, which was addressed by installing rubber mounts for the oil tanks and replacing the wire with steel tubing. One relatively minor criticism, but still within acceptable margins, was the occasional instance of rudder over-correction and oscillation: this was improved via the addition of what Armstrong Whitworth claimed to be the world's first spring tab.
The prototype was flown to Croydon Airport for customer acceptance trials with Imperial Airways, the airline being reportedly entirely satisfied by its performance. On 26 September 1932, the aircraft flew its first commercial service from Croydon to Brussels and Cologne. On 20 October 1932, the prototype was damaged during a test flight due to fuel starvation caused by a malfunctioning experimental vent on the fuel tank. Armstrong Whitworth was allegedly embarrassed by the incident and renamed the third production machine (G-ABTI, Arethusa) as Atalanta, apparently in the hope that nobody would notice the substitution.
Two derivatives of the Atalanta were proposed: the Jaguar-powered AW.25 and Panther-powered AW.26, but neither left the drawing board. Tapper attributes the failure for orders to emerge for successive variants to be down to unfortunate timing and the quick emergence of larger airliners from competing companies.
Design
The Armstrong Whitworth Atalanta was a high-wing streamlined monoplane airliner. Its square-section fuselage was relatively clean and featured rounded edges to reduce drag. The aircraft's composite construction included steel, plywood and fabric. The undercarriage was fixed, but was partially enclosed within the fuselage and covered by streamlined fairings in order to minimise drag. Passengers were carried within a relatively quiet and cool cabin and provided with comfortable adjustable chairs. The overall design of the Atalanta was rather modern for the era; Century of Flight allege that the Atalanta somewhat closed the performance gap between British and American airliners.
The aircraft was powered by a total of four supercharged Armstrong Siddeley Serval III ten-cylinder radial engines, each capable of providing up to 340 hp (250 kW). This powerplant was a relatively recent development, each one basically being a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Mongoose engines joined together. These engines, which were positioned on the leading edge of the wing, were faired into the wing profile for greater aerodynamic efficiency. They were mounted upon a tubular framework attached to the forward spar of the wing, which was protected from a potential engine fire by a fire-proof bulkhead. Both of the aircraft's two fuel tanks were accommodated within the wing's leading edge, one between each pair of engines, positioned as to permit fuel to be gravity fed.
The fuselage of the Atalanta comprised three sections. Its construction involved novel approaches for the company, such as the use of steel strips to form the longerons and interconnecting struts. The section of the fuselage containing the cabin was covered by plywood over light stringers, while the rear portion was covered almost entirely by fabric, save for the use of aluminium sheeting at the corners. The aircraft's cantilever wings, which were moderately tapered, were also built in three sections around two spars formed from steel girders. The wing's center section was supported by steel ribs, while the outer wing sections used wooden ribs along with a plywood covering was used up to the rear spar.
The interior of the Atalanta featured several novel features. The cockpit, which was crewed by a pair of pilots and a radio operator, was unusually large; immediately behind it was a compartment intended to accommodate up to one tonne of air mail. A luggage hold and a galley was positioned further behind that. The main cabin was designed to adjustable, readily permitting operators to change the passenger-to-freight ratio. Imperial Airways initially opted to configure it with nine seats, arranged in alternating pairs and standalone, all of which with tables. Particular attention was paid to the air conditioning systems due to the type's envisioned frequent use within relatively hot climates. Later on, Imperial Airways adopted a more profitable eleven seat configuration for its African route.
Operational history
Imperial Airways ordered eight aircraft, all of which had been delivered by 1933. The first service was flown from Croydon Airport to Brussels and then Cologne on 26 September 1932. The prototype G-ABPI left Croydon Airport on 5 January 1933 on a proving flight to Cape Town, South Africa. Three other aircraft joined it in South Africa to fly the service between Cape Town and Kisumu. Demand on the route was such that the Atalanta proved to lack sufficient capacity, thus necessitating its substitution by the de Havilland Hercules.
On 1 July 1933, an Atalanta flew the first direct air mail service between London and Karachi. Two Indian-registered and two British-registered aircraft operated a Karachi-Calcutta service with was later extended to Rangoon and Singapore. On 29 May 1933, G-ABTL flew through to Melbourne, Australia (arriving on 30 June) on a route survey flight. During December 1934, the through service to Australia commenced. In subsequent years, Imperial Airways studied various other potential routes for the type, including to China.
During 1937, Imperial Airways opted to withdraw the Atalanta from its African routes. Shortly thereafter, a pair of aircraft were leased by Wilson Airways for operations in Kenya until July 1938. The African Atalantas were then transferred to India. A total of three aircraft were lost prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.
Shortly after the conflict's start, the remaining five Atalantas were initially taken over by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). During March 1941, they were impressed into use by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in India, where they were used to ferrying reinforcements to Iraq in response to the Rashid Ali uprising.
During December 1941, shortly following Japan's entry into the war, the fleet was handed over to the Indian Air Force for use on coastal reconnaissance duties, armed with a single .303 in (7.7 mm) machine gun operated by the navigator. The final patrol by the type was flown on 30 August 1942, while the two survivors were transferred to transport duties where they continued in use until June 1944.

Chris Perry (born Christovam Pereira; 25 November 1928 − 25 January 2002), was an Indian musician, composer, songwriter, and film producer who combined jazz with Konkani music. They were known in India as the 'King of Cha Cha Cha' and the 'Man with the Golden Trumpet', and was the composer of the iconic signature song of All India Radio.
Early life and career
Chris Perry was born Christovam Pereira in 1928 in Borda, the second of eight children born to Agostinho and Espiciosa Pereira.
Perry's family was musical and, at a young age, they entered the Tiatr (musical theater) scene, under the name 'Bab Pinto'. They began staging their own tiatrs; they are remembered locally for the plays Noxibantlo Nhovro, Padricho Lob, and Vid Mog Kornaranchem. They became a proficient musician, particularly on the trumpet and saxophone, known for having perfect pitch (Absolute pitch), and for their ability to switch from trumpet to saxophone mid-song. They were also a prolific songwriter, writing many of the hits of their time. Perry took the traditional Goan style of music and blended it with jazz.
Through the late '50s, Perry moved back and forth between Bombay and Calcutta (now Kolkata), and had their own band, the Chris Perry Band. Even after becoming well-established, Perry had to take part in the accepted practice of finding gigs. Every morning, Goan musicians gathered at the Calcutta restaurant Alfred's. The major bandleaders—Perry, Tony Cyril, Dennis Vaz, Johnny Rodriges, Johnny Baptista, Mike Machado, had their own tables. Anyone who was having an event that evening would come in and "order" musicians, e.g. ‘one trumpet and one piano'. Each musician was paid 15 rupees; 18 if they wore white jackets with black trousers. Perry also occasionally played in a two-trumpet act at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel with the jazz star of the day, Chic Chocolate.
In the late 1950s, Bombay was an extremely cosmopolitan city, and people from all over the world had settled there. Western influences were flooding in and everything was becoming westernized—especially fashion and music. The best restaurants served Western food, and offered dance floors and jazz bands. At the pinnacle of these restaurants was La Bella, in Bombay's Fort District. Anyone who was anyone was there, the place was packed every night and, because alcohol was still strictly prohibited, the doors were closed to reporters. It is known, however, that the Chris Perry band got their foot in the Bombay door at La Bella (and, because Goa was still under Portuguese rule, they had to have special visas to work there).
By 1960, Perry and their band had a regular gig at Venice, the sophisticated nightclub in Bombay's Astoria Hotel. The Astoria is on Churchgate Street, the city's music and entertainment hub, and Venice was known as the 'jazz man's jazz club', a rendezvous for musicians from around India. Dave Brubeck played there in 1958, Duke Ellington in 1963.
Personal life
In 1960, at the Bandra Fair in Bombay, Perry saw a 16 year-old singer, Lorna Cordeiro, perform the song "Underneath the Mango Tree". They were so good, and the audience reception so great, that they offered them a place with their band. Cordeiro, who was also from Goa and who had been brought to Bombay by the musician Raymond Albuquerque after they won a Connie Francis sound-a-like contest, was still in school. But they accepted and Perry became their mentor.
Cordeiro, who was compared to Shirley Bassey and Bessie Smith, had a powerful Contralto and a natural feel for jazz. Perry rehearsed with them for six months before introducing them to audiences, and taught them how to dress, move on stage and use the microphone. They made their debut at the Lido Room in the elegant Firpo's Restaurant, Calcutta, singing Ella Fitzgerald's version of Cry Me a River. The band then began touring—to Delhi, Mussoorie, Shimla, and Ooty, before settling in Bombay.
Perry was known as a genius, a perfectionist, and an obsessive. (According to their son, they slept with their trumpet and, every morning, before doing anything else, had a cigarette and blew the trumpet.) Their drummer, Diogo DeSouza, said: “Whoever joined their band ended up refining their craft. They could tell from a distance even if one small note went wrong on any instrument. They would meticulously write down the notes for each musician and they expected them to play it just the way they wanted.” According to De Souza, Perry once gave a band member a black eye for playing a note incorrectly. It was a show night. They brought the musician an ice pack, and gave all band members dark glasses. It became their look for the evening. Perry was also a gambler, known for losing the band's wages at the racetrack.
Perry wrote and recorded some Konkani language albums with Cordeiro. They were signed to Their Master's Voice, (HMV), which initially refused to let Cordeiro record in the Konkani language. Perry fought on their behalf and HMV relented. Once the music was released, Cardeiro's career was on its way. From then on, they were known simply as 'Lorna', and was a household name throughout India. Perry's songs were catchy, toe-tapping or romantic; all were a blend of Goan folk music and jazz elements. These songs became instant hits and garnered significant radio play; their popularity was helped by the love story between the two.
Audiences were drawn to Lorna, and to the obvious chemistry between them and Perry. Despite the fact that Perry was a married Catholic man with three sons, and their large age difference, the two began a very public extramarital affair. This created additional chemistry on-stage; off-stage, Perry was jealous to the point where they would punch any man who spoke to Lorna. The relationship ended in 1973, when Perry returned to their wife and family. However, they forced Cordeiro to sign a contract agreeing to not perform with anyone else for twenty years. Perry enforced this contract, often with violence. Despite the fact that they were a mega-star throughout India, and was known as the 'Nightingale of Goa', Cordeiro had to leave the music world completely. They never married, and became a recluse and alcoholic. In 1995, when Perry was no longer a threat to her, they made a successful comeback.
Perry encouraged the careers of other musicians and their songs were performed by Mohammed Rafi, Asha Bhonsle, Usha Uthup, Adolf Fernandes, Seby Fernandes, Hema Sardesai, Lulu Fortes, C. Alvares, Ophelia, Mohana, M. Boyer and H. Britton.
Later career
By the mid-1970s, Bombay's jazz scene was dying. The government had raised the entertainment tax to 40%, making the business unviable for smaller establishments. Many musicians left the country or switched to film work. Perry went into film. They worked as an assistant to film composer Mohammed Zahur Khayyam, conducted Khayyam's orchestra for the film Trishul and Kabhi Kabhi. They also worked for the composers Laxmikant–Pyarelal, R. D. Burman and Kalyanji–Anandji. In 1977, they co-founded a film production company which produced Bhuierantlo Munis (Cave Man or Man From the Caves), the first colour film in the Konkani language. The movie was based on Alexandre Dumas's novel The Count of Monte Cristo, which features a prominent character named Abbé Faria, which in turn was based on the Goan Catholic monk, Abbé Faria. Perry wrote the music and songs, including the hit Dulpod "Undrea Mhojea Mama", and the popular songs "Bhuierantlo Munis", "Nokre", "Chup Chup" and "Adeus".
Perry died of Parkinson's disease in Goa in 2002. Two of their sons, Glenn Perry and Miles Perry, who recorded the hit song "Moje Maim" when they were children, are successful musicians. In 2019, a road in Margao was re-named 'Chris Perry Street'.
In 2015, Goan director Bardroy Barretto released the award-winning film Nachom-ia Kumpasar (Let's Dance to the Rhythm). It is a musical drama, in Konkani, which tells the story of the romance between Perry and Lorna, who are played by Vijay Maurya and Palomi Ghosh. The story is told through 17 popular Konkani songs from the 1960s and 1970s that were re-recorded for this film. Most of the songs were written by Perry, and the list includes those that were originally recorded by Perry and Lorna. These include "Abghat Kelo", "Aik Re Khobrankara", "Tuzo Mog", and the song that launched Lorna's career, "Nachoiea Kumpasar".
