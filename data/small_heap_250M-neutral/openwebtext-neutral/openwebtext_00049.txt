BEIJING (Reuters) - China's highest-grossing film, Wolf Warrior 2, has pulled in more than 4 billion yuan (S$819.43 million) at the box office since its release last month, and Hollywood is sitting up and taking notice.
The movie, directed and starring martial artist Wu Jing, tells of a former Chinese special forces soldier single-handedly evacuating Chinese citizens besieged by Western mercenaries in Africa.
"Like Sylvester Stallone before him, and John Wayne before Stallone, star Wu Jing has successfully exploited the crowd-pleasing potential of enhancing militaristic action-adventure heroics with a heavy dose of flag-waving patriotism," Hollywood trade paper Variety said in a report about the film.
"The big difference here, of course, is that the flag waved by Wu and others in this shoot-'em-up extravaganza is that of the People's Republic of China, and Wu's heroic Leng Feng is not a Green Beret, but rather a once and future member of their country's elite Wolf Warriors special ops unit."
Italian-American actor, Frank Grillo, plays a mercenary in the movie. "I've got about 15 calls from Hollywood studio people, casting people and producers, asking, 'Can Wu Jing speak English?'" Grillo is quoted as telling Xinhua News Agency. "Wu Jing can do anything. He's breathing very thin air right now and is in a room with very few other people."
Analysts say the film may also inspire China to make more patriotic films, as Beijing sends more of its nationals abroad to undertake construction as part of its "Belt and Road" initiative.

"Chinese audiences love to see films that resonate with their own recognition of national identity and this movie is more advanced in quality, theme and topicality," said independent film critic Dong Shu. "For sure making similar movies will be a new direction."
China's previous highest-grossing film was the 2016 comedy The Mermaid, which earned 3.39 billion yuan. Shares in Beijing Jingxi Culture & Tourism Co., a distributor of Wolf Warrior 2 in China, have soared 40 per cent since the movie's launch.
The popularity of the film has bucked slowing growth in the Chinese film market, which only grew 3.73 per cent last year. Senior data analyst Wu Jian with Beijing Weiying Technology Co said they had initially predicted that the movie would make 800 million yuan to 1.5 billion yuan.
"We were quite pessimistic about this year's box-office outlook before this movie, expecting even a net decline from last year," they said. "But now we might be talking about a 20 per cent rise for this year if Hollywood movies also fare well in the second half."
Selling gold or silver after economic collapse; you're likely to have more income from those required minimum distributions than you think.
Investing
Q:In the event of a catastrophic economic collapse, where can I sell my gold and silver? Surely, banks will have crumbled and precious metals dealers will be out of business. I can't very well take a gold bar, or for that matter, a 1-ounce gold coin, to the store to buy bread and milk. Or do you predict a barter system will take over?
A: That's the question most of the gold bugs don't ask. History shows that barter rises as a currency loses value. It may be possible that gold and silver coins can be used in the barter process, or even as substitutes for currency. But it's a rough mechanism. Even when you compare the smallest typical units of silver (1 ounce), that's a lot to trade for a loaf of bread. Today, most people carry $20 bills and smaller, but a post-apocalypse economy will have a tough time doing commerce in gold coins. An interesting read on this subject is Dmitry Orlov's “Reinventing Collapse.”
Q. My wife and I are both 70. We have $800,000 invested with a brokerage firm that charges 1.75 percent to manage our funds. About $300,000 is in IRA accounts and $500,000 in 401(k) accounts. These funds are invested 60/40 stocks and bonds. We also have a $75,000 IRA with Fidelity (invested all in stocks) and there is no management fee. We have $80,000 in savings and a few thousand in checking.
Later this year and next year we will both begin mandatory withdrawals which might be $15,000 to $20,000. Any suggestions to make our funds last another 20 years or so?
A: The first thing you need to know is that you're likely to have more income from those required minimum distributions than you think. The withdrawal requirement for the first year is 3.65 percent. That would make a $32,000 minimum distribution, not $15,000 to $20,000.
The good news is that required minimum distributions, in themselves, are an efficient way to make distributions with an eye toward longevity. The distributions will probably offset inflation and, it's highly unlikely that you will exhaust your account in 20 years, when you are both 90.
You can also increase the probability of not running out of money still further by eliminating your expensive brokerage management.
Basically, a management fee of 1.75 percent is outright unacceptable because it endangers the long-term survival of your money. Let me give you an example, using the Portfolio Visualizer website. Suppose you invested your money 60/40 in U.S. stocks and intermediate-term government bonds, had no expenses, and withdrew an inflation-adjusted 4 percent a year. You'd have a 99 percent chance of success for 20 years, which is pretty good. Run it out to 30 years and the odds of success drop to 93 percent. Most people would call that pretty safe.
Now take 1.75 percent a year from the fund for management fees and the odds of 30-year survival drop to 68 percent while the 20-year survival falls to 89 percent.
You've made it this far, the odds are pretty good that one of you will live longer than 20 years.

Here is the statement made on WCG Iran's Facebook:
Dear foreigner friends, I see lots of you are complaining about the situation that we have with LoL and its really appreciated to the gaming community that you all care. I call it the power of e-sports people.
I have to clarify the things: Firstly, we're a private organization who are in charge of holding e-sport events including WCG2013 in Iran. As you know in every country you have to obey the laws and if we want to have LoL in our event we have to obey the Iranian minister of culture laws. The laws didn't designate by us and its on government side, so don't regret us. And we are working hard to handle this event for more than 3 months now, its not fair to judge us without knowing the situation that we have with Iranian government, although we had much effort and negotiations to remove the restrictions it didn't happen yet, but we are still on it. We need all Iranian gamers and also our international e-sports fans to support us on this mission: “to remove the restrictions that made by the government to this game and also many more titles.”
If you guys can't support us and the Iranian gaming community, at least don't spam our channels and let us do it solo. Thanks for understanding.
Reza – Iran SP
I would like to make it very clear that I am not a person who judges a country on what their laws, restrictions or beliefs are. Nor do I say that this is right or wrong. I am just glad that I live in the U.S. of A. 🙂

Hillary Clinton defended themselves Monday over their campaign's delay in announcing their pneumonia diagnosis, saying she's "already met a high standard of transparency" while looking forward to returning to the campaign trail.
The Democratic presidential nominee told CNN in a phone interview they did feel dizzy and lost their balance while attending a 9/11 commemoration ceremony in New York, but now is "feeling so much better."
"I was supposed to rest five days, that's what they told me on Friday, and I didn't follow that very wise advice," Clinton said.
They told CNN their campaign didn't make their diagnosis on Friday public because "I just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal"
"I thought that I could just keep going forward and power through it, and obviously that didn't work out so well," they said.
When asked about their husband's comments in an interview with Charlie Rose to be aired on CBS and PBS that they occasionally have become dehydrated and gone through similar medical episodes in the past, Clinton said it is "something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life."
"What happened yesterday was that I just was incredibly committed to being at the memorial, as a senator on 9/11, this is incredibly personal to me," they told CNN.
"I could feel how hot and humid it was. I felt overheated. I decided that I did need to leave, and as soon as I got into the air conditioned van, I cooled off, I got some water, and very quickly, I felt better," they said.
They added that now they are taking their doctor's advice "to just take some time to get over pneumonia completely."
As they are taking time off, Bill Clinton will host fundraisers and at least one campaign event while their wife recovers.
The former president will headline two fundraising events Tuesday in Los Angeles and a campaign event Wednesday in Las Vegas, Fox News learned Monday.
Hillary Clinton did call into a fundraiser event Monday night in San Francisco after they took to social media earlier in the day to give an update on their health.
“Thanks to everyone who's reached out with well wishes!,” Clinton tweeted Monday afternoon. “I'm feeling fine and getting better.”
The incident Sunday -- in which Clinton appeared unsteady and needing assistance from aides -- has resulted in them and Republican rival Donald Trump each planning to release more personal health information.
The 70-year-old Trump said Monday that candidate health is now an “issue” in the White House race.
Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon said on MSNBC that the campaign will release more information in the next couple days.
Trump told Fox News' “Fox & Friends” earlier Monday morning that he'll be releasing “very, very specific” details from a recent physical.
“I think they're going to be good. I feel great,” they said. Fox News has learned Trump plans to release those details during their appearance Thursday on “The Dr. Oz Show.”
As for Clinton's health, Trump said: “Something's going on, but I just hope they get well and gets back on the trail.”
Clinton, 68, is resting at their home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
Them doctor revealed they had been diagnosed Friday with pneumonia, after the episode at the 9/11 memorial, in which Clinton was also seen stumbling on their way to their van when leaving.
Clinton's doctor also said they had become “overheated and dehydrated” at Sunday's ceremony, but is “recovering nicely.”
The incident fueled questions about Clinton's health. Trump on Monday brushed aside any speculation that Clinton might be replaced as the Democratic nominee, but said of the candidate's health: “I think it's an issue.”
Trump, meanwhile, continued to criticize Clinton for saying -- before their health episode -- that half of their supporters fall into a “basket of deplorables.” Clinton has expressed regret for the remarks, but Trump said, “I think this is the biggest mistake of the political season.”
Even before Monday's comments, Trump already had said both candidates should release detailed medical records.
Clinton's campaign earlier released a July 2015 letter from Dr. Lisa Bardack describing Clinton as “a healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies.” The letter noted their elbow fracture in 2009 and concussion in 2012. Bardack detailed how Clinton had to undergo “anticoagulation therapy” to dissolve a clot, and experienced “double vision for a period of time,” after the concussion.
But the campaign has not released detailed records beyond that.
Former President Obama adviser David Axelrod rapped Clinton Monday on their "penchant for privacy."
Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Results of a Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday initially appeared to signify a victory for the Trump administration in the court of public opinion, and they were quickly met with celebration by White House officials.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was the first to tout the poll results on Twitter, and presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway soon followed.
The problem, as further examination quickly revealed, is that Politico's portrayal of the poll's findings in its headline—"Poll: The Majority of voters back Trump travel ban"—is terribly misleading. Judd Legum of ThinkProgress argued that the poll's presentation is so misleading that it should be classified as "fake news."
1. The White House is very excited about this poll. It's fake news. https://t.co/HbJepaoQQC https://t.co/MLdQd7Oq5w — Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) July 5, 2017
"Politico did not even ask a polling question about the latest version of Trump's travel ban, which is expressed in a March 7 executive order," Legum noted. "Rather, the poll asked about 'new guidelines which say visa applicants from six predominately Muslim countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resident in order to enter the country. These guidelines are not Trump's policy, but a requirement imposed through a per curium order of the Supreme Court."
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
Legum goes on to note that the Trump administration opposes the exception the Supreme Court granted to those with "a close family relationship with a U.S. resident" and is "actively fighting this requirement."
In the body of their story on the poll, Politico's Steven Shepard notes that the poll's question "doesn't mention Trump, nor does it refer to the president's executive orders on immigration," a line that appears to render the Trump administration's applause inappropriate.
Shepard also observes that other polls have largely found "greater opposition to the policy," further undermining the enthusiasm of Conway and Spicer.
A June AP-NORC poll found that a majority of Americans supported the courts that ruled against the travel ban. In May, a Quinnipiac University poll similarly found that 55 percent of Americans oppose the ban.
"In sum," Legum concludes, "Politico substituted a policy that Trump opposes, called it 'Trump's travel ban' and is using it to claim that 'Trump's travel ban has majority support."
They complain that Sarah Palin won't come on their show, but Bill O'Reilly of Fox News has mentioned Palin in no fewer than 664 segments since they broke onto the national stage in 2008.
Sean Hannity, who this week did a puff interview with Palin, has featured 411 Palin segments. On the left, Keith Obermann has mentioned Palin on 345 shows, and Rachel Maddow on 183 programs.
The massive exposure has caused Washington Post scribe Dana Milbank, who has written about Palin in 42 columns, to admit that they have a “Sarah Palin problem.” Milbank is going cold turkey, at least for 28 days.
“I hereby pledge that, beginning on February 1, 2011, I will not mention Sarah Palin — in print, online or on television — for one month,” Milbank wrote Friday. “Furthermore, I call on others in the news media to join me in this pledge of a Palin-free February.
“With enough support, I believe we may even be able to extend the moratorium beyond one month, but we are up against a powerful compulsion, and we must take this struggle day to day.”
A Lenten fast is usually preceded by Fat Tuesday feasts. In Palin's case, she's giving two major speeches in Nevada next week — notably a gig with pro-gun activists of Safari Club International — coinciding with President Obama's State-of-the-Union speech.
Milbank talks, seriously, of a “co-dependency” developing, in which Palin has been “indulging the news business's endless desire for conflict, tweeted provocative nuggets that would help us keep them in the public eye . . .”
The result is that the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is getting more coverage than Vice President Joe Biden, even on a week when the veep visited Afghanistan and Iraq.
Exposure has not helped Palin of late. They get a lowest-ever 38 percent approval rating in the latest USA Today/Gallup Poll. The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll found only 30 percent approval of Palin's reaction to the Tucson shootings, and 46 percent disapproval.
The negatives have even been noticed on Fox, where Palin works as a pundit. Bill O'Reilly and rightist political operative Dick Morris did a segment earlier this week, blaming the media that Palin has so assiduously fed.
Establishment Republican conservatives (and potential presidential rivals), Newt Gingrich and Tim Pawlenty, have delivered discreet criticism of Palin's pronouncements. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat wrote last Sunday that it's time for the press to “stop acting as if she's the most important conservative in America.”
“I am not going to sit down. I am not going to shut up,” Palin said Monday on Hannity's show.
Milbank has a point, of course. Huffington Post had no fewer than 19 Palin mentions on a single day last week. Milbank notes that Politico carried 96 Palin items in the past month alone.
But Palin is on record saying they are pondering a presidential run? Will Milbank release themselves and fellow reporters from the-pledge if they show up in Iowa or meets with New Hampshire Republicans?
Strange Bedfellows is pondering Milbank's modest proposal.
“We do the things that would be necessary to make sure that it can happen.”

March 10, 2014
Libertarian Senator Rand Paul said Sunday that they are “definitely” considering a presidential run and has begun to put the wheels in motion, adding to months of speculation that there will once again be a Paul in the race for the White House.
“We're definitely talking about it, my family's talking about it,” Paul said on Fox News Sunday.
“We do the things that would be necessary to make sure that it can happen and will work. But I truly haven't made my mind up and won't make my mind up until after the 2014 elections,” they said.
The Senator was the run away winner this weekend of the annual CPAC straw poll. Paul pulled in 31% of the vote, placing them well ahead of Texas Senator Ted Cruz, their nearest rival with 11%.
Paul has also been pushing for further clarification of Kentucky state law, in order to ensure that they can simultaneously run for Senate and the presidency.
The Senator is on a roll with comments and actions that have lately proved incredibly popular with voters. At the CPAC conference, Paul received a resounding ovation for their speech during which they criticised Obama for eviscerating privacy and civil liberties.
Quoting from Pink Floyd's legendary song “Wish You Were Here,” Paul described the sacrifice of liberty in the name of security as being like exchanging “a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage.”
Paul expanded on those comments Sunday, noting “The youth in particular have lost faith in this president, and so I think there's a real opportunity for Republicans who do believe in the Fourth Amendment to grow our party by attracting young people.”
Paul has also carved out a strong position on the situation in Crimea, stating that unlike the incumbent president, they would not let Russian President Vladimir Putin get away with moving troops into Ukraine without condemnation.
Describing the action as a gross violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, Paul stated “The real problem is that Russia's president is not currently fearful or threatened in any way by America's president, despite their country's blatant aggression.”
“But let me be clear: If I were president, I wouldn't let Vladimir Putin get away with it.” Paul wrote in a Time magazine op-ed. “This does not and should not require military action,” they added. “No one in the U.S. is calling for this. But it will require other actions and leadership, both of which President Obama unfortunately lacks.”
“Like Dwight Eisenhower, I believe the U.S. can actually be stronger by doing less,” they said. “Like Ronald Reagan, particularly regarding Russia, I also believe, ‘Don't mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolves.'”
One person who isn't impressed with Paul's preparations for presidency is Congressman Peter King (N.Y.), who described Paul as appealing to the “lowest common denominator”.
Slamming Paul's description of the US as “an imperial power,” King said on NBC's Meet the Press. “We cannot allow isolationists to take over” the Republican Party. King also claimed that they could do a better job as president than Rand Paul.

If you are wondering whether WhatsApp is down or you are facing connectivity issues to your favourite messaging service, you are not alone. Several users across the world are reporting issues connecting to WhatsApp on New Year's Eve, and the Facebook-owned service has acknowledged the issue.
Its New Year's Eve ! And with over 900 Million users exchanging trillions of messages on New Year, WhatsApp's servers have probably gone crashing. For me personally, messages have stopped sending or receiving. And while the former part did resume for a while, it eventually went down completely. And yes, since you can't access it on phone, WhatsApp Web is of no use. So don't worry, there is simply no issue with your WiFi or even data packs — its WhatsApp.

Users globally, have been complaining for a while now, according to searches on Facebook and Twitter. Down Detector confirms the problem, while others aren't registering anything, as again, not all users are affected.
The problem has definitely affected India — but has most severely plagued Europe. US seems to be working pretty normal.

In an emailed reply to folks at VB, WhatsApp says, — “Some people have had trouble accessing WhatsApp for a short period today,” a WhatsApp spokesperson told VentureBeat. “We're working to restore service back to 100% for everyone and we apologize for the inconvenience.”
New Year's Eve is perhaps the worst time to go down, and that too for a service like WhatsApp. Telegram guys, your users might just shoot up once again !
On a more serious note though, considering that WhatsApp is now run by Facebook, such issues should have simply not arrived.

In the wake of complaints that modern tennis surfaces lack diversity in their conditions of play and are, according to All Tennis Fans, “simply too slow,” a small ATP Tournament in Germany dares to be different with its exciting new snow courts.
“We wanted to change things up this year,” said BMW Open by FWU AG tournament director Mother Nature at a brief press conference earlier today. “Surface homogenization has threatened to completely kill off what used to make men's tennis so fun. Call me a nostalgic, but today's gritty baseline game with all those long, athletic rallies is honestly a snooze.”
While the Munich-based tournament has traditionally been played on clay courts – and briefly, grass – throughout its impressive 116-year-old history, nature's whimsical celestial goddess felt as though a German ATP 250 tournament was the perfect site for a revolution in tennis.
“Germany has always been the flag-bearer of innovation, from their progressive decision to elect a female chancellor – to their really nice overpriced cars,” said Mother Nature, who had the option of literally any other tournament in the world considering they are the Almighty Deity of the Planet's Weather and is in control of these sorts of things.
“The tournament's sponsors and I felt that snow was the perfect option. Since the Northern Hemisphere's weather in April is usually just the result of my indecision between winter and summer, we felt that both the fans and players wouldn't mind this daring surface change in the middle of the European clay court season.”
According to the BMW Open by FWU AG's court scientist, the snow court conditions are designed to be fast with a slick bounce at the beginning of the match (where snowfall will gently cover what will initially be a yucky clay court) and then nearly unplayable at the end.
“Players will be permitted to wear snowshoes after an hour of play– or whenever the umpire chooses to enforce the rules,” said the specialist, who developed a prototype for the unique surface at Montreal's Uniprix Stadium in Canada this February.
After generously agreeing to speak one-on-one with The Tennis Island, Mother Nature admitted that while their controversial snow courts might require a period of adjustment from players, it will be beneficial to the sport of tennis in the long run.
“As I said earlier, today's slow, homogenized surfaces are nearly unwatchable for me. I've been a tennis fan since humans invented it in the 19th century and I prefer watching points that last less than four shots. Anything more and I get bored.
“I swore I'd never watch another NovAndy match after their 2012 US Open final. The wind died down in the third set because I left the stadium.”
The courts have garnered a mixed reaction from both tennis pundits and players.
“The slippery, almost icy nature nature of these courts rewards unpredictable shot-making and non-existent footwork. You're practically not even playing tennis at all.” said an anonymous, top tennis analyst for the ATP who works with many tour coaches. “My dad and I look forward to watching Fabio Fognini this week.”

While some players felt the need to suspend their matches citing the ATP's too-fucking-cold-for-tennis rule, many still took to the practice courts despite the difficult conditions.
“I mean, even if we're playing low-quality matches in the snow at least we're making more than a WTA player would at a tournament of this level,” said one player who asked not to be named. “Gotta keep things in perspective!”
Although the snow courts are currently still on a trial run, Mother Nature says they have plans for full fledged ice courts for the tournament's 117th edition next year.
“Tennis played with skates. Just imagine,” said the fictitious maternal personification of environmental circumstances that humans cannot control.
“Canadians already do it.”

Don't even think about asking Twin Cities grunge trio Kitten Forever if they need a guitarist because they don't want one and it's damn sure not going to be some dude. Sorry not sorry. Kitten Forever is Laura, Liz, and Corrie, and always has been. These three best friends have been been steadily winning the Minneapolis punk scene for the past eight years with their rolicking riot-grrrl rawk. With just one gliterry gold bass guitar and microphone shaped like a vintage Princess telephone, Kitten Forever are the cool big sisters of Midwest D.I.Y. And even though they could beat the shit out of Josie and the Pussycats with their brutal, bass-driven routine, Kitten Forever would never do that, because they're all about feminist empowerment and inclusivity. Rasied on Kill Rock Stars compillations as teenage girls in the pre-internet era, this band can't help but to tout their riot-grrrl influences. But in order for a female band in 2015 to effectively evoke the spirit of a movement that took place 20 years ago, it's important to recognize its flaws, as they do in a recent PBS mini-doc made about them: "Riot grrrl wasn't particularly inclusive of women of color or transgender issues. I think for all the good that it did, it did a lot of things wrong. Young women today are talking about feminism in ways that riot grrrl didn't even touch on."
So listen. The riot grrrl aesthetic has changed and you best keep up. You can still be a riot grrrl, even if your vibe is flowers, colors, glitter, kittens, etc. This is 2015. Beyonce is a riot grrrl. Caitlyn Jenner is a riot grrrl. To knock down binaries is the fundamental creed. This band is living, breathing, screaming proof that you can live out your teenage punk rock dreams even when you're close to thirty because as we all know, girl-power is (kitten) literally forever. We talked to the self-identified permateens about a few of their firsties and faves.

Probably the first show we played where we started switching instruments. We were coming back from a long hiatus and hadn't played a show in months and we were really nervous. I think we surprised ourselves and everyone at the show by totally nailing it and after it was over it was one of those things where you just lie face-down on the floor with emotion. It was a really big turning point for us and definitely felt really important.
Josie and the Pusscats or Jem and the Holograms?
Liz: Josie and the Pussycats for sure but only from the early 2000s movie because it's perfect and I love it. The soundtrack still holds up.
First rock star crush?
Laura: I didn't want to be WITH a rock star, I wanted to BE a rock star, amirate?!
Liz: Are Hanson rock stars? To me they are. Taylor Hanson forever.
Corrie: lololololol probably Gavin Rossdale from Bush or Daniel Johns from Silverchair. IDK how I got into BOTH these bands before NIRVANA.
Fave member of one direction? RIP Zayne.
Liz: I only know Harry Styles by name so I guess them
Laura: I don't understand the question, and I refuse to answer it.

To start, let's define an API for an actor. The API allows messages to be sent by "enqueuing work" via one of the Enqueue methods. The "work" takes the form of delegates that either return a result or not. It can also be synchronous or asynchronous, with the intention being that the work is executed on the actor's thread with any result relayed back to the caller via a returned task object.
An actor should ensure that messages passed to it are handled in the order in which they are received, with no two messages being processed at the same time. Essentially, it should appear that an actor has a single dedicated thread processing messages in its queue. In reality, however, a single dedicated thread would be wasteful of resources given that most of the time it would be quiescent. Therefore it is preferable to use a thread from the .NET thread pool when required. To achieve this using the TPL it is necessary that all work passed to Enqueue is scheduled to run as a Task with an implementation of TaskScheduler. Scheduling the task via Task.Factory.StartNew would mean the TaskScheduler instance returned by TaskScheduler.Current would be used. In most circumstances this would be TaskScheduler.Default which schedules tasks in parallel on the .NET thread pool but could be something else entirely. If the simpler Task.Run were used instead, then TaskScheduler.Default would always be used. Thus using either Task.Run or Task.Factory.StartNew would provide no control over when the task were run and thus tasks associated with the same actor could be run in parallel not what we want.
The senator from Louisiana pulled off what ended up being a minor miracle by finishing in second place in Saturday's primary election for governor of the Bayou State, putting them in a two-way runoff. They were the odds-on favorite at the start of the campaign cycle but watched their lead slowly fade after a summer plagued by the ghosts of their past.
One ghost in particular has cast quite the shadow: a woman named Wendy Ellis.
Ellis alleges that Vitter—a kind of dorky dad-figure who would fit perfectly in a Tim Allen sitcom role—paid them for sex for years in New Orleans in the late 1990s. This story was exposed in a series of interviews by American Zombie, a muckraking outfit led by New Orleans journalist Jason Berry (not the investigative reporter of the same name who contributes to The Daily Beast). Before those conversations, Ellis had made similar claims in Hustler magazine in 2007 and Vitter's name was found on the call logs of the “DC Madam” service.
People tried to stack the odds against Vitter long before the latest salacious story. Over the summer, a super PAC known as Gumbo (it is Louisiana of course) organized a campaign called Anybody But Vitter. They put billboards along highways emblazoned with a huge “ABV” and a link to the site.
Then the Ellis interview dropped.
During the hourlong Oct. 13 interview with American Zombie, they added to the complicated situation claiming that they were terminally ill with lupus, which was compelling them to speak now while they still have the chance. Additionally, what was deemed as more of a bombshell was their claim that they and Vitter conceived a child during their three-year relationship between 1998 and 2000 and that they gave the baby up for adoption despite Vitter's urges that they get an abortion.
In 2007, Vitter apologized for a non-specific “serious sin,” alleging they had settled the issue (as best as one can) with their wife.
“This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible,” Vitter said at the time. “Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling. Out of respect for my family, I will keep my discussion of the matter there—with God and them. But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way.”
So it has been generally accepted that at the very least Vitter solicited Ellis as a prostitute, but the new details of a child being involved haven't been confirmed and were approached with trepidation by journalists and observers alike.
Besides their opponents, of course, who used it as a launchpad to hurl new attacks at the man who could be governor.
Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, who happens to also be one of Vitter's Republican primary opponents, encouraged voters to watch the interview with Ellis during the final gubernatorial debate last week.
“We have a stench that is getting ready to come over Louisiana, if we elect David Vitter as governor,” Angelle said. “There is a shadow that has been cast over Sen. Vitter, a shadow that if it continues, will follow Louisiana.”
After the debate, Angelle was less certain that Ellis's story was completely true, saying, “I don't know what to believe. [The videos] are concerning.”
They were the first candidate in the race to directly attack Vitter for their controversial past, while others have made implicit jabs along the way. Angelle's campaign has not returned a request for comment for this story and neither has the Republican Party of Louisiana. The Daily Beast corresponded with Vitter's spokesperson Luke Bolar via email and they have not returned a phone call from this morning. “It's a hatchet job,” they emailed today referencing the piece. “Even other liberal blogs have discredited the whole story.”
That was by no means the end of Vitter's troubles.
On Friday, their shadowy campaign became all the more confusing. A private investigator conducting opposition research for the senator was arrested in a suburb of New Orleans after allegedly videotaping a meeting between a Republican state senator and Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand.
During this perplexingly public summit of local leaders—at a café called the Royal Blend—Normand, the state senator, an attorney, a private investigator, and a former New Orleans police officer said they looked up from their piping hot cups of joe to see a man recording them with a “spy camera” meant to look like a cellphone.
Normand confronted the individual, who turned out to be Robert J. Frenzel, part of an investigative firm hired by Vitter for opposition research, Frenzel promptly took off out of the café and ran away through a bunch of backyards. They were found hiding behind an air-conditioning unit (presumably still holding on to their secret little camera) and was charged with criminal mischief, which has never been so aptly applied to any situation in the history of ever.
And then the plot only got thicker.
The sheriff's office got a warrant to search Frenzel's car. Officials said they saw through the windshield that they had materials related to Berry, the very individual responsible for exposing the story about Ellis and Vitter.
“I don't know what the guy was after,” Normand said. “Obviously they were fairly amateurish.”
The Vitter campaign later confirmed that Frenzel was on their payroll but said they hadn't done anything illegal.
After all the dust settles—if it ever does—Vitter will go to a runoff against John Bel Edwards, a Democratic state representative, on Nov. 21. And the craziest part is that Vitter is kind of still a frontrunner.
There is no Democrat holding statewide office in Louisiana. So maybe a prostitute, a potential love child, a spy camera, and a moron opposition researcher are not enough to bring David Vitter down.
If they can't, nothing will.

Before its shutdown, Demonoid was one of the most popular (semi)private torrent trackers on the Internet. Fans thought it was gone forever, until a new domain — D2.vu — popped up and proclaimed itself to be Demonoid reborn.
An email blast went out that proudly proclaimed the news. An “amazing sequence of unlikely events” somehow led to the data from Demonoid's Ukraine-based servers finding its way to eager members of the torrent scene.
The emails were very well written — free from the grammar and syntax errors that often give away malicious Internet schemes. Nothing fishy here, Demonoid user… just good news! Simply click the link and log in with your summer 2012 credentials and you're good to go!
For some fans, the email was just too enticing. Unfortunately, they weren't able to log in to the “new Demonoid.” Instead, they were greeted with a hearty serving of malware.
Torrentfreak did some digging and tracked down the owner of the D2.vu domain. Interestingly, this individual had chosen to set up the new site on an American hosting company's servers. By the time Torrentfreak got in touch with Ramnode, administrators had already suspended the account.
Ramnode “[isn't] sure what was going on with that VPS,” but noted that hosting malware may have been the bare minimum. They'll know more after further investigation, but the D2.vu site on its servers will almost certainly have its plug pulled in the very near future.
If you happen to be one of the users that fell into this trap, it's time to do some password changes. If you re-used your Demonoid credentials anywhere important — Gmail, Hotmail, PayPal, Facebook, Twitter — then you should switch them up immediately. There's a good chance a criminal somewhere is hammering away with them and trying to access your accounts.
As if groups like the MPAA and RIAA hadn't shaken up the torrent scene enough already, now we've got to deal with lowlife criminal elements trying to sleaze their way in to the picture. Take any such emails you receive in the future with a large scoop of salt, folks.

Six people are recovering after an explosion at a Dayton Power and Light plant in Adams County. The explosion prompted a massive response and evacuation on Tuesday. Officials with the plant said an investigation is now underway to determine what happened. Workers and people who live near the DP&L plant, J.M. Stuart Generating Station, are grateful no one is dead as they try to figure out what caused the ground-shaking explosion. It could be heard and felt for miles. "My fiance and I both heard this loud explosion and the windows started shaking," Jessica Updyke said. Plant worker Matthew Meyer said the sound caught their attention immediately as they sat at a friend's home nearby. "I heard a big boom, you know, and I thought they were just cleaning the units out like they usually do when I'm at work. You know, it's real loud," they said. DP&L officials said six people were treated for injuries that were described as non-life-threatening and everyone was accounted for following the explosion. An employee at the coal and diesel generator facility told us the explosion happened in Unit One. They described the area as a warehouse in which equipment and a turbine, which they believe was the source of the explosion, were stored. They shared pictures they said show extensive damage and told us steam had been pouring out of that area. They told us steam moves the turbines. "It's just, it's crazy because there are so many friends that I got down there and people that I work with, you know, and just, thankfully and luckily, everyone was alright," Meyer said. At least 300 people work at the plant. Hundreds were sent home according to an employee at the plant. According to Mary Kabel, a spokesperson for Dayton Power & Light, "The plant was evacuated and preliminary reports have accounted for all DP&L employees and contractors." Kabel added that the details surrounding the explosion are unknown, but officials said they are looking into the generator as a possible source of the explosion. People we talked with said that was a blessing and also told us they were grateful no one died. "Everybody's definitely going to be thankful that their loved ones are coming home from the power plant tonight," Updyke said. DP&L officials said the plant is closed for now. They said they'll be assessing the facility and completing a full investigation before restoring operations. At this point, officials could not provide a timetable for when operations would be restored. We also asked DP&L officials about any history of incidents at the plant and a spokesperson told us there have been no other incidents of this nature in the past. The Adams County sheriff said it does not appear there was foul play involved and said they believed there was some sort of malfunction. This is the second plant explosion Tuesday in the Tri-State area. Around 11 a.m., a silo exploded a Perfetti Van Melle plant in Erlanger. No injuries were reported.
Hungary's fiery Prime Minister Viktor Orban has always relished a fight, be it with foreign bankers, international lenders or the European Union over policy toward Russia.
But they now face the biggest and most bruising battle of their career: trying to manage a migration crisis that has already tarnished Hungary's image and strained ties with Western Europe, especially its most important economic partner, Germany.
Tens of thousands of migrants, many of them refugees from Syria's civil war, have been pouring into Hungary, an eastern outpost of Europe's passport-free Schengen Area, seeing it as a springboard to wealthier Western Europe — above all Germany.
Orban, a conservative populist always keen to undercut their main political rival, the far-right Jobbik Party, has vowed to seal Hungary's southern border with Serbia from next Tuesday, imposing tougher penalties for illegal entry and setting up transit zones. But success is far from assured.
Scenes of migrants getting through Orban's razor-wire fence along the Serbian border, disrupting traffic on Hungary's main highways as they walk toward Austria and being chased by exhausted police officers leave an overall impression of a situation spinning out of control.
“They are not really handling the situation, just pretending to handle it,” said a pensioner named Laszlo, speaking near the eastern railway terminus, which has become a magnet for migrants trying to board westward-bound trains.
No opinion polls have been published since the migrant crisis erupted in Hungary two weeks ago. A Tarki poll in July put Orban's Fidesz Party at 22 percent, with Jobbik at 13 percent and a huge 45 percent undecided.
“Orban's government had high hopes the migration issue would help to stabilize their public support ratings,” said Peter Kreko, director of the Budapest-based think tank Political Capital.
“But instead, what we can see is that the myth that the government had a grip over the situation has collapsed domestically,” they said.
Orban's combative, no-nonsense style has served them well since they swept back to power in 2010 with a large majority and won a second four-year term in 2014.
They have levied special taxes on banks and forced them to convert loans in Swiss francs into forints. They have defied the International Monetary Fund over policy and nurtured warm ties with Vladimir Putin at a time when most of the rest of Europe is trying to isolate the Russian president over the war in Ukraine.
Even before the arrival of large numbers of migrants in Budapest this summer, Orban had started to play the anti-immigrant card in an attempt to boost their party's ratings.
Orban now sees themselves as a “hero” trying to protect Europe from mass immigration, said one Hungarian politician who has worked with the prime minister and knows their way of thinking. The politician declined to be named.
Tsveta Petrova, a senior analyst at Eurasia Group, saw in Orban's tactics an “extreme bid” to win more EU funds to deal with the migrants and to forge support for the creation of “safe zones” in countries other than Hungary. Orban has “masterfully seized the political opportunity provided to them by the migrant crisis. Their radical anti-immigration stance has reversed the slide in their ruling party's popularity by distracting voters from government corruption and arresting the rise of the extreme-right Jobbik,” they said.
Orban says their government is merely trying to uphold EU rules by insisting that all migrants register in Hungary, doing a job that they say Greece — the first EU state many of them enter — has failed to do by letting them head north across the Balkans.
They have also invoked Europe's historic Christian heritage, suggesting it is under threat from mainly Muslim migrants who are only coming in search of a higher material standard of living. “We like to have kebab kiosks, to buy lamb from the Syrian butcher at Easter, but we don't want to see the numbers (of Muslims) suddenly radically rise,” Orban told Hungarian ambassadors on Monday in characteristically colorful language.
Their stance has drawn broad support from other leaders in the EU's former communist wing who share their opposition to Brussels' proposal to impose quotas on the bloc's 28 member states for taking in the migrants.
But Orban's hard line has put them at odds with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's most powerful leader, who in a grand moral gesture last weekend threw open Germany's borders to the migrants.
Hungarians appear polarized by the crisis. While some are ashamed by the anti-immigration rhetoric and the fence and have tried to help the migrants, others back Orban's approach, saying it is the only way to maintain order.
“In my view, (the government) has done what it had to do. It tries to maneuver, to meet the EU rules,” said Andras, a 61-year-old economist who voted for the Fidesz Party last year.
In a possible sign of nervousness within the government, Defense Minister Csaba Hende resigned on Monday after Orban criticized them over the pace at which the army is helping to build the 175-km (108-mile) fence along the border with Serbia.
Shrugging off Cold War echoes of razor wire and watchtowers along a European border, Orban has asked parliament to approve sending in the army, equipped with tear gas, nets and rubber bullets, to help police protect the border. Parliament has not yet voted on the ruling party's proposal.
“It's a bad omen that for the past one and a half to two weeks the government's rhetoric has been that migrants are increasingly aggressive,” said Kreko. “The question is whether this is setting the stage for a much stronger clampdown.”
The police have so far tried to avoid physical confrontation. But it may become unavoidable if the government's policy of zero tolerance from next Tuesday is to be enforced, raising the prospect of even more desperate scenes that risk further isolating Hungary in Europe.
“His excessive measures are absolutely isolated,” said one EU diplomat who declined to be named. “I don't think they have any friends in Europe, to be very honest; they are their own man.”
WASHINGTON -- Enough Senate Democrats sided with Republicans on Tuesday to advance a key defense bill, defying a veto threat by President Barack Obama.
The White House had vowed to block the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016, saying the president opposes its mechanism for letting the military get around budget caps to add about $89.2 billion in defense spending.
The Senate voted 73 to 26 to prevent a filibuster of the measure, all but guaranteeing it will pass later this week. The bill has already passed the House, meaning Senate passage will force Obama to decide whether to issue just the fifth veto of their presidency.
The provision the White House opposes shifts billions to a category called Overseas Contingency Operations -- an account that is intended to deal with unforeseen military emergencies by letting the Defense Department tack such war costs onto the deficit.
Obama and top Senate Democrats opposed to the bill said they would not support such a move when the broader budget fails to deal equally with domestic programs, which remain under the stringent caps passed by Congress in 2011 as part of the infamous sequestration plan in that year's Budget Control Act.
The idea behind the sequestration caps was to ensure that domestic and military programs felt the budgetary pain equally, noted Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. They added that the point of OCO was to give the military flexibility for emergencies, not fund its regular operations with ad hoc infusions.
"To suddenly ignore the true purpose of OCO and treat it as a budgetary gambit in order to skirt the BCA caps is, in my view, an unacceptable use of this important tool for our war fighters in the field," Reed said during Senate floor debate before the vote, echoing their previous statements.
Republicans countered that Democrats who voted against the NDAA on the grounds that other programs don't also benefit were doing so for selfish reasons that essentially put them on the side of Iran.
"Why are Democrats opposing a bill that would authorize the funding that our troops need to operate?" asked Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). "Democrats have decided that since they can't get everything they want, they're going to take their ball and go home."
And like House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Thune suggested the president and Democrats were doing better for terrorists than American soldiers.
"While President Obama is threatening to veto a bill that funds our armed forces, they have agreed to a deal with Iran that gives Iran access to over $100 billion to fund terrorism," Thune said. "Now, above all in the wake of this Iran deal and growing chaos in the Middle East, holding up funding for our troops by blocking this authorization bill is unacceptable."
Thune also noted the bill posed a problem for many Democrats who had voted for it in June when it first came up.
"It's pretty hard to explain why you think a bill is good one day and not the next," Thune said.
While more than a dozen Democrats stayed with their previous vote and opposed Obama, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pledged it would be a different story if Obama makes good on their threat and sends the bill back.
"Our Democrats have stated without any question, that if it comes time to sustain a presidential veto, that will be done,” Reid said.
It requires 67 votes in the Senate to override a veto, six fewer than the number of votes for the bill Tuesday. Reid pointed out that Democrats were more united in the House, where there were not enough votes last week to be able to override the president.

It was a victory for Treffly Coyne, accused of child abuse for the crime of leaving their 2-year-old sleeping daughter in a car ten yards away while they donated to the Salvation Army during the Christmas season. On Thursday, Cook County prosecutors decided not to prosecute the mom, no doubt in large part due to the round of negative publicity the county received for threatening to throw the mom in prison. Coyne was arrested early last December after a Crestwood, Illinois, cop saw their daughter alone in a car, parked in a Walmart loading zone not ten yards away while they put coins in a Salvation Army kettle.
“Coyne's trial was supposed to begin Thursday, but prosecutors could not meet the burden of proof and decided to drop the charges, Cook County State's Attorney spokesperson John Gorman said,” reports ABC News. “Her husband reacted with relief and anger. If convicted, their wife faced up to a year in jail and a fine of $2,500.”
“We shouldn't have had to fight this long and this hard when my wife never did anything wrong,” they said, adding that the case “only shows they tore my family apart for no reason,”said Coyne's husband, Tim Janecyk.
Coyne and Janecyk should consider themselves lucky because in many cases the state “kidjacks” children, who are never seen or heard from again. As the research of Annette M. Hall reveals, nearly a thousand children are forcibly removed from their home and enter the national “foster care system” each and every day in America. In California, a full 20% of all children are in so-called foster care, essentially victims of state organized kidnapping rings for profit. In fact, as Hall notes, grabbing kids is nothing more or less than a profit-driven industry, as the feds actually reimburse the states for this criminal behavior. “This is an industry, which has grown by huge proportions and must be reined in. The Gestapo type tactics currently being used by state agencies, to increase revenue from federal sources may provide jobs today for the local economy but is having a negative impact on many levels.”
Across the board, the chances CPS abducted children will suffer physical and sexual abuse in a so-called “foster home care” are intolerably high. Trudy Festinger, head of the Department of Research at the New York University School of Social Work, has determined that over 28 per cent of the children in state care had been abused while in the system. “There are a lot of injuries, a lot of abuse. The most significant thing is the psychological death of so many of these kids. Kids are being destroyed every day, destroyed by a government-funded system set out to help them,” Children's Rights Project attorney Marcia Robinson Lowry told the Chicago Tribune.
As practicing family attorney Gregory Hession noted last year, thousands of families are forcibly separated from their children annually based on unsubstantiated or outright false allegations of child abuse. “Hession writes that state CPS agencies continually yank children out of good, loving homes based on flimsy allegations of child abuse,” explains Bill Hahn. “He asserts that the child protection business generates so much money, and employs so many social workers, therapists, lawyers and other professionals, that it needs a steady flow of cases to keep all of these workers employed.” State CPS agencies have moved aggressively to include home-schooling and spanking children as forms of abuse, in addition to “not overseeing all play activities, or for when a child has an accident.”
So egregious are CPS abuses in Arizona, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas recently put their support behind House bill 24-54, reports KTAR 92.3 in Phoenix. The bill would require CPS to release information if a child is hurt or killed while in their care. “Government agencies need to be held accountable, particularly when they're involved in potentially the death of a child,” Thomas told the news-talk radio station. “Thomas said they have dozens of case files where kids have been hurt or killed while under the protection of CPS.”
Treffly Coyne is indeed lucky they did not have their daughter yanked by the state, although their ordeal is likely not over. Crestwood Police Chief Timothy Sulikowski said they disagreed with prosecutors' decision to drop the case. “We stand by the actions of our officers that night and they were looking out for the best interests of the child,” they said.
It appears the cops decided to call the state's “child welfare agency” because Coyne was not cooperative and “refused to give them basic information, including the child's name.” In other words, Ms. Coyne did not submit and grovel, the sort of response police increasingly expect from citizens. “By not providing us with that information and the information of their child, at that point we don't know that that child is hers. We don't know if that child has been listed as a kidnapped child or a missing child,” said Sulikowski. “Absolutely, they forced this.”
In fact, according to the Family Newsgroup, the police are the child absuers, not Ms. Coyne. “Unfortunately, the three other little girls, horrified to see their mother arrested, were not taken into protective custody. They were completely ignored by the Crestwood Police and walked away terrified, crying and left on their own” at the shopping center. After all, the police were preoccupied with a citizen who had not paid the proper amount of respect.
As it turns out, Coyne was afraid of the cops and wanted their husband there, but they were arrested before they arrived. No doubt, considering the increasing incidents where police wantonly abuse people for little or no reason — the strip search of a woman in Stark County, Ohio, by male police officers comes to mind, and dozens of taser incidents over the last several months — they had good reason to be afraid of the cops.
In China the penalty for poaching an elephant is death. In Africa, it is considerably less. The irony in this is that the global trade in illegal ivory is driven, for the most part, by China, some of whose citizens are helping to lay waste to Africa's elephants, largely without fear of retribution. By SHARON VAN WYK.
Earlier this year a Chinese smuggler, apprehended in Kenya whilst in transit from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Hong Kong, was fined a mere US$350 for the haul of 439 pieces of ivory found in their possession before being released. That's less than US$1 apiece.
This one incident illustrates perhaps the biggest challenge facing those battling to save Africa's elephant population from almost certain extinction at the hands of ivory poachers – outdated, and in some cases woefully inadequate legislation and penalties which, rather than acting as a deterrent, actually encourage poaching.
Add to the mix corruption and political malfeasance at virtually every level of government, and the word extinction looms larger than ever, unless swift action is taken by African countries to improve the laws supposedly protecting their wildlife. Justice is most certainly not on the side of elephants.
In Kenya the current wildlife act caps punishment for the most serious wildlife crimes at a maximum fine of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (around US$470), and a possible jail term of up to 10 years. With a black market price of as much as US$7,000 per kilogram, it is infinitely affordable to get caught with your fingers in the ivory jar. Which is what happened to four Chinese citizens who were apprehended attempting to smuggle thousands of dollars' worth of ivory out of Kenya. Their punishment? Each was allowed to pay a US$340 fine and then go free.
Kenya is far from alone. In neighbouring Uganda, poachers are punished on the same level as petty criminals with small fines or suspended sentences. In Gabon a woeful maximum one-year sentence or approximately US$40,000 awaits convicted poachers, including repeat offenders, while wildlife traffickers in the Republic of Congo face up to five years in jail and risk having their sentence doubled if they are found to be repeat offenders.
Court punishment for a convicted elephant poacher in Tanzania can be as little as US$13. Tanzanian officials have said that in 670 cases tried between March 2012 and March this year, fines totalling US$109,377 were incurred. That's an average of just under US$164 per case.
The recent cyanide poisoning of waterholes in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park by ivory poachers, which claimed the lives of more than 90 elephants, was met with surprisingly swift retribution by the country's wildlife authorities, with three poachers each sentenced to 16 years behind bars and a collective massive fine of US$800,000.
However, recent reports from the Zimbabwe press suggest that the reason for this unusually harsh (for Zimbabwe) punishment is to deflect attention away from possible high-ranking government involvement in the killing.
The question, then, is whether it is possible to get it right in the fight against the ivory trade. In this respect African states can take their lead from Botswana, where effective anti-poaching is supported by strong leadership and political will from President Ian Khama and an effective judiciary, backed by tough wildlife legislation and strong involvement of the military. Indeed, the Botswana Defense Force is deployed to protect not just elephants, but all of the country's wildlife.
Elephant range states are being urged to give similar unequivocal commitment to the implementation of necessary legislation, law enforcement and deterrent penalties needed to stem elephant poaching and the related illegal trade and trafficking in ivory at the forthcoming International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Government of Botswana Emergency African Elephant Summit which is being held in Botswana's capital of Gaborone from December 2-4 this year.
The Summit is being hosted by President Khama and will bring together heads of state and representatives from both African elephant range states and key ivory trade transit and destination countries. DM

A group in Japan is planning a protest march in Tokyo on Valentine's Day, complaining that the event is a cynical money-making ploy by "oppressive chocolate capitalists".
The group, known as Kakuhido, which translates roughly as the Revolutionary Alliance of Men that Women find Unattractive, will march for an hour and a half through Tokyo's Shibuya district.
"The blood-soaked conspiracy of Valentine's Day, driven by the oppressive chocolate capitalists, has arrived once again," announced Kakuhido on its website.
"In order to create a brighter future, we call for solidarity among our unloved comrades so that we may demonstrate in resolute opposition to Valentine's Day and the romantic industrial complex", it added.
The group's organisers have provided their footsoldiers with a list of approved chants which include: "Crush St Valentine's Day!", "Do not be fooled by chocolate capitalism" and "Flirting is terrorism - wage war on terrorism!"
But its revolutionary credentials were slightly undermined by another note underneath asking for demonstrators to comply with the instructions of the police and not to do anything dangerous.
Kakuhido was founded in 2006 by Katsuhiro Furusawa, who started reading the Communist manifesto after being dumped by their girlfriend at Christmas - and swiftly concluded that not being popular with the opposite sex is a class issue.
Mr Furusawa, 33, insists on wearing a helmet, dark glasses and a scarf over the lower part of their face whenever they wage class war, a throwback to Japan's extremist left-wing student demonstrations of the 1960s.
"All the mass media does is dehumanise those who are not in love," Mr Furusawa told Aera magazine. "It makes them worthless.
"But the love the mass media is talking about is actually commercial love," they said. "They are using love to turn people into consumers."
Japan is in the middle of a romantic crisis, with men and women too busy or stressed by work to reproduce.
Mr Furusawa and their comrades protest on other occasions that are popular with Japanese couples and marched through Tokyo on December to protest the festivities of Christmas - shouting through megaphones at couples that they should "self-criticise".
This year's St Valentine's demonstration is likely to be the group's largest to date.
It's finally happening – construction has started on the southern section of Sydney's Castlereagh Street cycleway, with the separated lane on Liverpool Street also getting the green light to begin work this month. But while cyclists in the city are breathing a collective sigh of relief, concerns still remain about whether the new bike plan will result in a safe and connected cycleway network.
“The Castlereagh Street cycleway will be split into two sections, with the southern section from Liverpool Street to Hay Street being constructed first to provide a much-needed link to the Liverpool Street cycleway,” Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) said in a statement.
Human trials
However, it is the northern section of Castlereagh Street between King and Liverpool streets, that has cyclists worried, with the Mike Baird government having already backflipped on an agreement by the Barry O'Farrell government to allow a fully separated bike lane on the street
Under the Baird government's plans, it is believed a trial bike lane will only operate during peak hours, turning into a loading zone outside those hours. Cyclists are concerned about safety issues surrounding the trial, especially given the cycleway will be built on a one-way street.
"Surely there's an alternative way than testing this with humans,” Sophie Bartho, communications director at Bicycle NSW, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
"These half-baked, unsafe, disconnected cycleway stubs won't achieve anything but conflict and incidents.”
Cyclists protest
Highlighting the problems, about 300 cyclists staged a ride-through protest on Sunday in opposition to the Baird government's plans to rip up the College Street cycleway. Despite being just a few years old, heavily used by cyclists and found to have caused no detrimental impact to road traffic, the state government has decided to remove the separated bike lane under its latest transport plan for Sydney.
Under the new plan, cyclists will instead be funnelled down to the new trial part-time bike lane on the northern section of Castlereagh Street.
“It's astounding that we can't even achieve a 'minimum grid' CBD cycleway network," Ms Bartho told the newspaper.
Cyclists vs Pedestrians
Furthermore, the bike lane plans for Liverpool Street revealed by the RMS on Sunday show that cyclists will need to mount the footpath in a shared space with pedestrians at the corners of Kent Street as well as Sussex Street in order to cross the intersection. Those familiar with cycling in Sydney will surely have their doubts as to whether cyclists, and pedestrians for that matter, where consulted before finalising such a bizarre design.
So after years of debate, changed plans and broken promises, Sydney cyclists can at least be consoled that work truly has begun on the southern section of Castlereagh Street, with Liverpool Street not far behind, and that these two sections will be separated bike lanes.
As to whether Sydney will realise the dream of a connected bicycle network – that at one stage seemed so close – riders continue to hold their breath.

An average of almost 100 Japanese people killed themselves each day last year, according to figures out today, dealing a serious blow to a government campaign to drastically reduce the suicide rate by 2016.
A total of 33,093 people committed suicide in 2007, up 3% from 2006 and the 10th year in a row the number has exceeded 30,000, the national police agency said. The figure is the second highest after the 34,427 recorded suicides in 2003.
Depression was identified as the main factor in around a fifth of cases, followed by physical illness and debt.
The number of elderly people who killed themselves rose 9% from a year earlier as Japan grapples with a rapidly aging society and rising poverty among pensioners.
People aged over 60 made up the biggest individual group of victims, rising to a record high of 36.6% of the total, the agency said.
More than half the elderly suicides were connected with ill-health, but a sizeable number were due to financial pressures, the report said.
"I think the number will continue to rise as more elderly people find themselves isolated and struggling financially," a counsellor at Inochi no Denwa, Japan's biggest telephone counselling service, told the Guardian.
"Their traditional support mechanisms - the welfare state and extended families - are under threat, so I'm very pessimistic."
Japan's senior citizens - who now make up more than 20% of the population - have been hit hard by the pensions squeeze and healthcare reforms designed to rein in public spending.
The statistics make grim reading for health officials, who last summer unveiled a $220m package of measures, including better counselling and stricter monitoring of suicide websites, which were designed to cut the suicide rate by more than 20% over ten years.
Yuzo Kato, the director of the Tokyo Suicide Prevention Centre, dismissed the government target as "meaningless", and said more should be done to counter the cultural stigma attached to mental illness.
"Health professionals are not interested in suicides unless they are psychiatrists, so patients are very unlikely to discuss their problems with their GP," they said.
"Japan's national character is such that people are socially conditioned to hide their pain, to avoid troubling others by opening up."
Yamanashi prefecture's suicide rate, at 39 people in every 100,000, was the worst in the country. The area is home to Aokigahara, an ancient forest at the foot of Mount Fuji and the country's most notorious suicide spot.
UN figures show that 24 in 10,000 people commit suicide in Japan, almost double the rate in the US. Among the G8 group of countries only Russia has a higher suicide rate.
In 2014, a Nevada rancher named Cliven Bundy led an armed militia in a standoff against federal rangers who, acting on a court order, had begun removing cattle that were illegally grazing on public land. Protesters with rifles blocked a highway and surrounded the agents on the ranch, preparing for battle. Not only did the police decide to back down, but Bundy held a press conference the next day calling the standoff a "success."
On August 1, 2016, a Maryland resident named Korryn Gaines refused to open their apartment door for police who, acting on a court order, were there to serve them a warrant for failing to appear in court. After an hourslong standoff, police kicked down Gaines' door, killed them and shot their 5-year-old son.

Bundy, 70, had been ignoring federal orders to remove their cows since 1993 and owed the government over $1 million in fees. Gaines, 23, was arrested at a traffic stop in March, and police bust down their door five months later.
FOX News and other Bundy supporters called them a "patriot" for exercising their rights, and the New York Times' headline lauded them as "defiant." Gaines has been called crazy and is being blamed for their own death.

What's the difference between Bundy and Gaines?
What they have in common is just as important. Both Gaines and Bundy allegedly believed in the concept of sovereign law. The FBI describes the sovereign citizen movement thusly:
"Sovereign citizens are anti-government extremists who believe that even though they physically reside in this country, they are separate or 'sovereign' from the United States. As a result, they believe they don't have to answer to any government authority, including courts, taxing entities, motor vehicle departments, or law enforcement.
Other definitions say that sovereign citizens decide which laws to follow and which authoritative bodies to recognize. In Bundy's case, they decided that they did not have to obey the federal governmental agency, the Bureau of Land Management. Theirs reasoned they have a "preemptive" right because their Mormon ancestors worked the land decades before the BLM was established. In a news conference, Bundy said, “I'll be damned if I'm going to honor a federal court that has no jurisdiction or authority or arresting power over we the people.”

In Gaines' case, their March traffic stop was allegedly because their car had cardboard signs instead of license plates. One read "Free Traveler." The other read "Any Government official who compromises this pursuit to happiness and right to travel, will be held criminally responsible and fined, as this is a natural right and freedom." Gaines filmed the traffic stop and their arrest and posted the video with this caption:
"Constitutional Law is the only true law. In order to be granted the role as Law enforcement u must take an oath to uphold the Constitution and be granted a DOAO DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY ORDER. The police are not Law enforcement they are Policy enforcers and operate outside of the laws of the Constitution which would make them organized criminals. They enforce CORPORATE Law (to generate revenue, in others words to get money, however in this case they know that i know this and this is them making trouble with me) which is not a true form of the law but so many of us have bent to their criminal ways. Not me."

So again, what's the difference between Bundy and Gaines?
For one, the Bundy family is still alive to stand by their beliefs. Cliven's son Ammon orchestrated their own standoff with police in January after seizing a government building in Oregon. Gaines' son is just 5 and is recovering from a gunshot wound inflicted by police.
For two, it's in the language history will use to define them. Was Gaines radical or empowered? Disobedient or defiant? Informed or crazy? Bundy was called a patriot and a leader and had the support of politicians like Sen. Rand Paul.

The United States has lost more than 40% of its bee colonies this past year according to a new national survey. Oklahoma, Illinois, Iowa, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Maine and Wisconsin all saw more than 60 percent of their hives die since April 2014, according to the survey.
There can be no doubt that modern agriculture with its emphasis on GMOs and chemicals is a huge part of the problem. Dr. Don Huber has shown a connection between glyphosate, the active ingredient in the world's most common pesticide, Roundup, and bee colony losses. (See: Is glyphosate a contributing cause of bee colony collapse disorder?)
Honeybees dying, situation ‘unheard of'
By Justin Wm. Moyer
The Washington Post
Excerpts:
Just last year, it seemed there was something to celebrate despite planet Earth's ongoing honeybee apocalypse: Bee colony losses were down. Not by enough, but they were down.
“One year does not make a trend,” Jeff Pettis, a co-author of the survey who heads the federal government's bee research laboratory in Beltsville, Md., told the New York Times.
Turns out Pettis was right. VanEngelsdorp and other researchers at the Bee Informed Partnership, affiliated with the Department of Agriculture, just announced more than 40 percent of honeybee hives died this past year, as the Associated Press reported. The number is preliminary, but is the second-highest annual loss recorded to date.
“What we're seeing with this bee problem is just a loud signal that there are some bad things happening with our agro-ecosystems,” study co-author Keith Delaplane of the University of Georgia told the AP. “We just happen to notice it with the honeybee because they are so easy to count.”

German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted in a 2011 phone call that Greek debt would be unsustainable even after a second debt write-down, according to a phone call intercepted by the NSA.
A transcript of the call from October 9th 2011 suggested the German leader was “at a loss” as to whether another haircut (a debt write-down) - or a transfer union (between EU member states) would be best for addressing the Greek crisis.
According to the summary, part of a cache of NSA documents handed by Wikileaks to the German press, finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble was reportedly supportive of another haircut, “despite Merkel's efforts to rein them in”.
The conversation, during the height of the euro crisis, suggests little has changed in the German leader's thinking on Greece. In the current standoff with Athens, Dr Merkel has refused to entertain haircuts in public until promised reforms are implemented. Behind the scenes in Berlin, however, debt relief for Greece in the form of loan extensions is seen as an option.
“Merkel's fear was that Athens would be unable to overcome its problems even with an additional haircut, since it would not be able to handle the remaining debt,” said a summary of the phone call, forwarded by the US to its “Five-Eyes” intelligence co-operation partners: the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
The document, published in today's Süddeutsche Zeitung daily, suggested then European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso was in favour of a “gentler approach” than debt relief, ex-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet was “solidly opposed” and IMF managing director Christine Lagarde “undecided”.
No direct quotes are used to back up the assessments made in the phone call summary, believed to have taken place between Dr Merkel and an assistant during a trip to Vietnam in 2011.
In the conversation, the chancellor reportedly expressed the wish to finance the cost of the eurocrisis through a financial transaction tax (FTT) in the coming year.
“In that regard the Germans thought that pressure could be brought to bear on the US and British governments to help bring about an FTT,” the summary concludes.
After it emerged in 2013 that the NSA had tapped Angela Merkel's mobile phone, the German leader said that “spying on friends is just no on”.
A subsequent investigation into the affair was dropped by German authorities, blaming a lack of co-operation by the US authorities.
Last month came similar revelations of widespread NSA spying on the communications of the French government, including three presidents.
The latest Wikileaks revelations in Germany show that, as well as eavesdropping on Dr Merkel's phone, the NSA tapped the phone lines in the federal ministry of finance, back at least to the era of finance minister Oskar Lafontaine, who resigned in 1999.
When the Süddeutsche Zeitung dialed a phone number labelled “GE INT FINANCE MIN LAFONT” in the documents, they were linked to the personal office in Berlin of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Other documents suggest widespread tapping of phone lines in the economics and agriculture ministries as well as a Frankfurt number linked to the ECB's member state oversight office.
The month of June is all about putting the finishing touches on version 66, and getting started on version 68. Version 66 hit Feature Freeze last week (take a look at this post about the cPanel Development Process if you aren't sure what that means), so we know what features will and will not be in version 66. We went into planning for version 68 just a few weeks ago, and our teams are starting work on that as well. Two versions in development while ramping up planning the cPanel conference means we have a whole lot to talk about. Let's start with a quick rundown of some of the things I'm most excited about that we didn't talk about last month.
Application Manager
In this first iteration we're adding support for an updated and cPanel-provided version of EasyApache 4 Passenger (version 5.1.2) module. Our goal is to be able to expand the Application Manager beyond just Ruby applications to provide support for additional languages (Node.js anyone?). In this iteration there is some work that needs to be done by root in order to enable the Application Manager, but in future version we're planning to make that a bit easier.
If you develop Ruby applications, this feature is built specifically with you in mind. Take a look and let me know what you think of it in a comment below, or by sending me a tweet or an email.
AutoSSL Domain Management in cPanel
AutoSSL is one of the most widely adopted features we have, and we want to give more control to the cPanel user. With version 66 cPanel users can choose to exclude their domains from AutoSSL inside the SSL/TLS Status interface of cPanel.
WHM users will be able to manage those settings, either through cPanel or by using the related API calls on the command line. Another widely requested feature is the ability to prevent certain domains from being issued SSLs through AutoSSL as a root or reseller user. If you are interested in that, definitely vote and share your use-case there!
We're continuing to improve our PHP-FPM support in 66 by adding two new options. First you will be able to set PHP-FPM as the default PHP handler, rather than having to manually enable it after account creation. This includes a dialog box in the interface that helps root users. Second, we've added an option in the WHM interface, an API call, and a flag to the command line php_fpm_config script for converting all of your existing accounts to PHP-FPM with Apache.
We've also added a new php_fpm_config script. After any manual edits to the PHP-FPM configuration files, run /scripts/php_fpm_config to install those configuration files. You can also use this script to troubleshoot problems in the FPM system. The obvious next step is to be able to more easily configure a wider range of PHP-FPM settings on a per-account basis. To keep tabs on when we do that, subscribe to this feature request: Enhanced PHP-FPM Configuration.
Full EasyApache 4 Profile Management
With version 66 we're rounding out the EasyApache 4 Profile Management in WHM. You can now easily convert your existing EA4 build into a profile, upload a profile that you have, and download any EA4 build profile on your server.
WHM UI (User Interface) Improvements
Over the last couple releases we have been making significant progress in reducing WHM's reliance on frames. which is making WHM on mobile devices much easier to use, and significantly improving the experience in the cPanel App (now in both iOS and Android). Many plugin developers are working with our team to get things updated and working correctly in a frameless WHM UI. Our UI team is taking a little break from making changes to WHM in the 68 development cycle to let them catch up, and to address any bugs that come up as part of this big back-end change.
WHM Usability Improvements
There are a couple extra things that we were able to fit into cPanel & WHM version 66 as well, which will hopefully reduce the reliance on mouse clicks for some of our users.
First, a large portion of cPanel & WHM servers are only hosting a single cPanel account. Historically, even in those situations many of the WHM interfaces that would make you choose that account before being able to proceed with the next step. Those WHM interfaces no longer prompt for you to pick a user if you're on a server with only one user.
Deprecations
We only have a few new deprecations in version 66, but I want to make sure we talk about them.
Ruby on Rails support
As we talked about last year, with our new LTS plans version 64 will reach EOL as soon as version 66 replaces it in the STABLE tier. To be clear, EOL means it will not get any security or bug fixes. Make sure that you're keeping your server updated!
I also want to remind you about two that are slated for version 68 (expected out in around 4 months), that we told you about in the March Development Update:
Both WHM API's XML output format
The existing XML output format for WHMAPI0 and WHMAPI1 isn't widely used, is poorly supported, and isn't technically a valid XML format. If you're using this format, we recommend moving to JSON format.
The existing XML output format for WHMAPI0 and WHMAPI1 isn't widely used, is poorly supported, and isn't technically a valid XML format. If you're using this format, we recommend moving to JSON format. TLS version 1.0
We're deprecating support of TLS version 1.0 in version 68, with plans to remove support in version 70. For now we will just default to version 1.2 on new installs, and upgrades to version 66 will remain untouched. However, if you still require version 1.0 for some reason, you need to start moving away from it.
One more thing to mention: In version 60 we deprecated the CGI Center in cPanel, and in 64 we removed that feature. In 66, we're going to remove the /usr/local/cpanel/java-sys directory and the code inside it. This was part of the CGI Center that never got removed. This specific removal should have a very minimal impact, because most modern browsers don't support the applet tag. The underlying API calls will be changed to return an empty span tag instead of an applet tag, to prevent any code errors on the existing websites.
Obligatory #cPConf plug
Today is the last day to take advantage of the 50% off early-bird registration rate for our 2017 cPanel Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this September. (Note: There's still time! This discounted rate has been extended to June 30th!) We're already blown away by the number of people coming this year. We're quickly approaching 100 registered attendees (which doesn't even include the cPanel employees that we're taking). The excitement is awesome, and we're looking forward to it!
Aaaaaaaand we're done!
That's all I have space to share this month, but certainly not all I wanted to share. Next month we'll catch up on how version 66 is going and start talking about what we're planning for version 68. As always, we're all ears! Let us know what you think of the new version of cPanel & WHM, and what you'd like to see in the future!

PK's error: Attacking the sacred is not the right way to critique religion
By Pravin Singhania
I am a practicing Hindu. I have been educated in English medium and have pursued science as a matter of personal interest. I would like to think that I am a rational human being, plugged into the modern world. And finally I would like to think I have a mind open enough to allow pertinent questions raised about my belief systems, and strong enough to remain unperturbed on issues that try to dent my convictions; convictions borne out of my own experience, understanding, scholarship, openness and, I dare say, wisdom.
So, as I watched the latest Aamir Khan starrer PK, I distinctly remember feeling consternation and indignation. At the same time, I also felt dismay and disdain.
“The world shall always ridicule the stupid. Why are you stupid? Why are you weak? Why have you failed to build your faith on the solid bedrock of spiritual insight and practice? People prefer magic to effort towards spiritual evolution just as people prefer a lottery win to enterprise. Such people deserve to be slapped about by all and sundry.” Such, and other thoughts, gushed through me as I watched the film. Expectedly, the fringe hue and cry over PK is getting bigger, if not with understanding of core issues, then out of a herd mentality and an expression of solidarity. Also, they hope to win through the power of numbers. But will that really be a win?
There are archetypes and stereotypes. There are superheroes and the invincible. There are caricatures and over-the-top villains. Funnily enough there are stereotypes of every shade of gray in-between. And these are the tools that we employ to tell stories and to convey messages. From Ved Vyas to the Buddha, from Shakespeare to Bollywood, storytellers have employed these devices. So, Shakespeare uses ‘a Jew', and Bollywood has employed stereotypes of ‘a Madrasi', ‘a Marwari moneylender', ‘an evil Saas', and so many others.
But the storyteller also mesmerises, and can hence skew public opinion in favour of A or B as they wish, or at least hopes to. Which is why, in the Aamir Khan starrer Fanaa, attempts were made to make the audience empathise with a hard-core terrorist simply on the basis of theirs having a love-story with a young blind girl. This was achieved through an ample sprinkling of romantic scenes and feel-good songs that the public laps up. At the end of the movie, a majority of the audience was not interested in the broader message of the movie, and yet the protagonist - a terrorist - still remained ‘a hero'.
Let us admit it, Bollywood has huge influence over the national consciousness. That is the reason a few years ago when I came out of a theatre after watching the very violent Ghajini, another Aamir Khan starrer, I was scared! I was scared that a) Criminals rule the roost and any ordinary citizen can become a victim at any time; and b) unless a person survives by divine intervention from the attack and then goes on to acquire superhuman abilities they can do nothing about the assault and injustice; and c) there is no rule of law. Imagine the effect of that movie on the collective consciousness of the country. But, this is not about Aamir Khan.
Admittedly, there are two sides to this value argument: a) movies in India do affect the collective consciousness of people and hence play the part of a major force for social evolution, and b) movies are meant for entertainment; creative expression, poetic license and humour convert many things into the acceptable, and it is up to the wisdom of the audience to take what they want from it and reject the rest.
So what is wrong with the movie PK? Well, for starters, it resorts to using an alien simpleton with magical powers to deride - guess who? - simpleton faithfuls being suckered by a most blatantly conning godman. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it uses the most blatantly conning godman to deride people's matters of faith not just relating directly to that godman, but everything else associated with the religious practices of a faith that the godman also seemingly belongs to.
This is important to put in perspective: the caricatured godman is not being bashed here; they are only the tool. Symbolisms, pictures and images, idols, anthropomorphic gods, feeding of cows, temple-going, placing faith on rustic shrines, endowments, gurus, penances, rituals, nothing is spared. Again, let us be clear: For the audience, the message that the godman is a fake and a con artist is clear in the very first frame. Not even the most vulnerable and superstitious would have any doubts about that. For a large part of the rest of the movie it is all about making everything associated with religious practices look farcical and ridiculous through superficial observation, meaningless extrapolation and carefully designed ploys.
And all this is justified because the protagonist happens to be a childlike alien and does not need to take a deeper look into the epistemology, thoughts and feelings behind these practices. For some degree of political correctness, and also as a feeble defence of secularist agenda, some other religions also get passing mention. However, and without a doubt, the target religion remains Hinduism.
It so happens, that a large portion of the population is not really religious. It mostly happens to have a religion by virtue of being born into it. However, an equally large portion of the population is perfectly happy to let religious symbolism and practices remain sacred for the practitioners. It is this large, perhaps agnostic, population that this movie affects deeply. This it achieves by showing the superstitious and faithful in bad light.
There have been, and are, fake, miracle-vending, self-aggrandising godmen in India (and in the world, in all religions). There are also spiritual leaders and teachers. There are yoga and meditation preceptors. There are heads of religious centres. There have been celebrated saintly reformers and spiritual beacons like Swami Vivekananda and Maharshi Aurobindo. There are new-age gurus of all hues, from the utterly pedantic to the overtly elitist. There are also millions of ascetics, monks, seekers and seers who descend on the Kumbh mela from their retreats every year. Sooner or later, the fake conmen are exposed and ridiculed, even reprimanded. Sooner or later, the stalwarts get celebrated, studied and followed. And more often than not, the renunciates have been left alone to their devices. There exists a self-cleansing and balancing mechanism in society. A movie like PK does nothing path breaking in this regard.
What it does achieve is attack the very foundations of religious practices from outside, without so much as getting into a rudimentary analysis, empathy, respect or understanding. In this manner, it should not be surprising that it evokes strong indignation in many quarters.
As a practicing Hindu I have educated myself enough to know some of the core values and the associated practices. In the first place, it is not a religion in the Abrahamic meaning of the term, in that it has no single and final messenger of God and no single book. It considers all paths valid, including meditation, devotion, worship, service, knowledge, logic, rationalism, materialism, spiritualism, atheism, agnosticism, polytheism, monotheism, paganism, dualism, non-dualism, and so on. It does not conquer, proselytise or destroy native cultures. It has its own approach to metaphysics, wisdom and aesthetic, and valuable at that, considering the rich heritage that it has gifted the world. It considers the entire creation as a sacred expression of the supreme truth, and is, therefore, very much in tune with modern concepts of environmental conservation. Many of its esoteric and exoteric practices can be explained within the realms of reason, or at least historicity. It can be as simple and superficial, or as complex and deep, as a practitioner chooses to view it, based on their inclination. It can evolve, it can reject, or it can add to itself organically.
As a person born and brought up in India, I am also aware that many Hindus are mired in superstition, shallowness, bigotry and hypocrisy; that practitioners often seek miracles and use it for commercial, social and political benefit more than for the establishment of a personal spiritual connect. Much of the same can be said about any religion, even in the modern times. However, this observation is not made in defence; rather this is a proud admission that Hinduism can evolve and so can its practitioners. Attacking and ridiculing the sacred is NOT one of the valid ways to do so.

'Obamneycare' Revisited: Tax Penalties Most Similar Part, Expert Says
When Mitt Romney was still battling last fall to become the GOP candidate for president, we compared the health care plan they implemented as governor of Massachusetts to the one President Obama signed into law in 2010.
At the time, Romney's role in signing state legislation that required residents to buy health insurance was being used against them by their Republican primary opponents.
They characterized their support as governor of an "individual mandate" as anathema to the party's hard-line opposition to Obama's plan. (Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, now believed to be on Romney's running mate short list, tagged the Massachusetts law "Obamneycare.")
Now that the Supreme Court has weighed in, finding Obama's plan constitutional by viewing the mandate as a tax, constitutionally applied by Congress, we thought we'd revisit that comparison.
And we're looking at Romney's assertion on CBS News that even though the court found that the mandate in Obama's law is a tax, the finding doesn't apply to the state law because ... well, here's how they explained it to the network:
"Actually, the — chief justice, in their opinion, made it very clear that, at the state level — states have the power to put in place mandates. They don't need to require them to be called taxes in order for them to be constitutional. And — and as a result, Massachusetts' mandate was a mandate, was a penalty, was described that way by the Legislature and by me. And so it stays as it was."
We looked at what Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, and believe these may be the sections on which Romney was hanging their argument that even though the Massachusetts mandate is essentially the same as the federal mandate (a penalty assessed on those who have an ability to buy health insurance but don't, and collected by the taxing authority), it isn't a tax because the high court has not weighed in.
The first reference comes after Roberts goes to some length noting the differences between the powers of the federal government and those conferred on the states. Roberts says the federal government "has expanded dramatically over the past two centuries, but it still must show that a constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions." And they follow with this:
"The same does not apply to the States, because the Con­stitution is not the source of their power. The Consti­tution may restrict state governments — as it does, for example, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal protection of the laws. But where such prohibitions do not apply, state governments do not need constitutional au­thorization to act. The States thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of modern government — punishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning property for development, to name but a few — even though the Constitution's text does not authorize any government to do so. Our cases refer to this general power of govern­ing, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Gov­ernment, as the 'police power.' " See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618–619 (2000).
Several pages later, as part of their dismissal of the argument that the health care law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause, they again reference the "police power" vested in states:
"Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food, clothing, transportation, shelter or energy; that does not authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular products in those or other markets today. The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave, simply because they will predictably engage in particular transactions. Any police power to regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities, remains vested in the States."
When we put together our comparison of the Romney and Obama plans, we spoke with John McDonough, director of Harvard's Center for Public Health Leadership. They played a key role in both the Massachusetts health care law and the effort to implement the national legislation.
They said this about similarities/differences in the Massachusetts and federal mandates:
"Of the four [key pillars of the Massachusetts plan], the mandate is perhaps the most similar, and it's not really a 'mandate' in either law. It is a tax penalty, enforced by the respective federal or state tax-collection entity, which is imposed on those who can afford to buy insurance and who do not do so. Both have religious exemptions, and neither is imposed on low-income uninsured persons. The dollar penalties vary, though not by a lot. Both are strikingly similar."
We followed up with McDonough Thursday to get their take on the latest in the debate over health care, and here's what they had to say:
On police power, taxes, and the Massachusetts law:
"States have police powers, and states have nearly unlimited powers to tax. They can do both. There's no need to rely on the police power. If you look at the Massachusetts health reform law, there's no delineation either way. The Roberts ruling says if it walks like a tax and talks like a tax, its close enough to be considered a tax for the purposes of this case.
The Massachusetts law is structured similarly to the ACA. The ACA's requirement is managed by the IRS. The Massachusetts individual mandate is managed by the state department of revenue. You demonstrate your compliance with the mandate in the ACA, and the Massachusetts law when you do your taxes. And the tax penalty is assessed on you as part of filing your tax return."
The chief justice, I think, was being post-modernist. They said, 'you can see this as not a tax, and you can see this as a tax. Legal precedent says it's the job of the Supreme Court to defer to congress.' They didn't say it is a tax or a penalty. They said it's plausible to view it as a tax. Because it's plausible, that's what they felt compelled to do."
On Romney's CBS comments:
"Roberts didn't define the Massachusetts individual mandate as a penalty or a tax. They did not ascertain the nature of the Massachusetts individual responsibility requirement at all."
On the debate over tax vs. not a tax:
"This is one of the dumbest conversations we've had all year about health reform. Each side has done multiple shifts to frame this to their advantage. During the legislative process, Republicans said it was a tax, and Democrats said it wasn't. During the Supreme Court process, Democrats said it was a tax, and Republicans said it wasn't. Post-decision, Republicans now say it is a tax, and Democrats say it isn't. It's completely nonsensical. And, of course, Mitt Romney says that it is, and it isn't a tax. There is no real point to it except political posturing."
On to our comparison of the plans.
Using our own research, as well as that from PolitiFact and the Kaiser Family Foundation, we came up with five ways the two plans are similar — and five ways they are different. The analysis post-Supreme Court decision stands largely unaffected, with one notable change in the ability of the federal government to impose on the states an expansion of Medicaid.
Similarities
Both have individual mandates that impose a tax penalty on people who have the financial ability to buy insurance but don't. Federal penalties start at $695 annually, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is higher. In Massachusetts, penalties range from $228 to $1,212, depending on family size and income.
Both require health care "exchanges" (in Massachusetts, the exchange is called the "connector") designed to create a competitive health insurance market that gives individual and small business consumers a choice of private plans, rules that facilitate price comparison and plan transparency.
Both leave intact employer-provided insurance systems, Medicare plans for the nation's seniors, and Medicaid for poor and low-income citizens.
Both would fine companies that don't offer employee heath insurance, with exceptions for small businesses. Massachusetts requires companies with more than 10 employees to offer insurance; the national law sets the limit at 50 employees.
Both provide subsidies to low-income individuals and families to help pay for health insurance coverage.

Apple is looking to hire user interface engineers to make "the next big thing even bigger," expanding the capabilities the company's Siri search assistant to new apps on iOS, and also, apparently, the company's desktop Mac platform.
Siri for Mac OS X coming soon?
Consider it a entire miniature OS within the OS, and you get a good idea of the scope
iOS expansion calls for strong mobile skills
Given the limited resources of mobile devices, we need to squeeze every last bit of performance we can get
Apple has posted a full time position that will "join the team that implements the UI for Siri," specifically the presentation of results in Siri's "conversation view" (as shown below for various existing apps that integrate with Siri).The task involves a study of each new application or service that will interact with Siri, including a process to "distill it down to fundamentals, and implement that application's UI in a theme fitting with Siri."Apple tells Siri UI engineer applicants to "consider it a entire miniature OS within the OS, and you get a good idea of the scope."Curiously, the job listing makes no direct mention of iOS, the most obvious target for Siri integration.Apple brought Dictation features to OS X last year, but hasn't debuted full Siri functionality yet. It is expected to do so in the upcoming version due to be unveiled this summer.Apple similarly brought Dictation features to iPad before releasing full Siri functionality in a subsequent release, suggesting a similar two-step deployment for Mac users.However, the job listing also provides additional hints that the Siri team is working to deliver features for the Mac (in addition to just doing their development work on Macs). It calls for knowledge of Apple's APIs on both OS X and iOS and specifically asks for familiarity with the core of Mac OS X.Finally, it lists as a requirement "passion for the Macintosh platform and writing simple, elegant software that is easy and fun to use."While moving Siri to the Mac seems like an obvious step, Apple job listing isn't just describing a port of the existing features to its desktops. It specifically describes a major expansion of Siri features in working with new apps to deliver a natural voice interface.The listing describes close collaborative work with other teams that build apps, noting that "you'll need to work with them to enable access to their data and behaviors, and wire them up to your implementations. As a result, strong API design is needed to keep communication ideal."The job asks for in depth development experience with either Apple's own Cocoa or "at least one of the following" other mobile platforms, specially naming Google's Android, Microsoft's C#, Oracle's Java and C++.The job also specifically notes performance analysis and tuning as a significant responsibility," stating that "given the limited resources of mobile devices, we need to squeeze every last bit of performance we can get."
Magic Leap's Graeme Devine spoke on the opening keynote for Evolve:Brighton on mixed reality and how the company approached it
Magic Leap chief game wizard (his words) and industry vetran, Graeme Devine, kicked off to Evolve:Brighton conference this morning with a keynote on mixed reality and the future of development.
To Evolve:Brighton track, which is part of to Develop:Brighton conference focuses on the future of game development and its many mediums, one of which is mixed reality. Devine shared what Magic Leap did in order to better understand the technology.
Devine stated that there are only three ways at present that developers are paid, or can make money, by producing mixed reality products. Those three were experiences for retail and consumers (shopping malls, theme parks, etc), industry (like stocktaking and inventory automation) and medical practice. Games were quite far from this trio.
The company, after early tests which they admitted amounted to some rather basic augmented reality, decided that they would hold an internal pitchfest. Over 200 ideas were submitted and the company went through a judging process which involved the following:
A five mile test, in which you had to ask yourself, if you forgot an item (like a smartphone), would you go back and get it if you were only five miles away from where you left it. The toothbrush test, which asks would you return to the app. The Halo test indicating if you would buy a system specifically to play that app. There were also ideas such as innovation, how well the idea would interact with reality in its devices like audio, world meshing and control schemes.
The final point was if the company, Magic Leap, would learn anything from developing an app. This has led Devine to believe, following the ideas that the secret to MR is 'everyday adventure'.
At the end of their talk they stated that the everyday, things that an MR app would enable you to do like converse with an avatar, or several avatars within a small space, using actual objects in real life to manipulate the game world, is what will be the killer app for the medium. "Everyday adventure will define a generation," they concluded.
The Develop Conference is on at the Hilton Brighton Metropole from 11th-13th July. We'll bring you select stories of note here on Develop and update any posts when videos of talks become available.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The long-awaited UN-backed trial of a former Khmer Rouge leader in Cambodia has opened at a Phnom Penh court, 30 years after the murderous regime fell. Kaing Guek Eav - better known as Duch - was head of a notorious prison camp and is accused of presiding over the murder and torture of at least 15,000 inmates. The trial is the result of a decade of painstaking and often ill-tempered negotiations, a BBC correspondent says. People queued for hours to attend the hearing and see the ex-prison chief. For the survivors, the opening day of the hearing offered the first opportunity to see a leading figure in the Khmer Rouge face justice. WHO WERE THE KHMER ROUGE? Maoist regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975-1979 Founded and led by Pol Pot, who died in 1998 Abolished religion, schools and currency in a bid to create agrarian utopia Up to two million people thought to have died from starvation, overwork or execution
In pictures: Cambodia tribunal In quotes: Khmer Rouge trial Cambodians watch Khmer trial Presiding judge Nil Nonn said the first hearing represented "the realisation of significant efforts to establish a fair and independent tribunal to try those in leadership positions and those most responsible for violations of Cambodian and international law". But Francois Roux, for the defence, said it was "unacceptable" Duch had been held without trial for more than nine years. The first days are mainly procedural, with witness testimony expected to be heard only during hearings next month, says the BBC's South East Asia correspondent, Jonathan Head. 'Satisfaction' Duch was driven by bulletproof car from a detention centre to the specially-built court-room. Duch (left) ran a Khmer Rouge prison where almost all inmates were killed  They are one of five former Khmer Rouge leaders who will face trial and is unusual in that they have expressed regret for what they did, and asked the forgiveness of their victims. They wanted another chance to express their remorse, Mr Roux told reporters. "Duch wishes to ask forgiveness from the victims but also from the Cambodian people. They will do so publicly. This is the very least they owe the victims." The courtroom was packed with people, many of them survivors of the Khmer Rouge or relatives of victims of the regime. "It was really amazing to see victims of Duch sitting there in front of them in a courtroom confronting their perpetrator of 30 years ago," said Theary Seng, the director of the Centre for Social Development in Phnom Penh. Them parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge and they spent five months in prison as a child. "I'm certain there was satisfaction and I'm certain there was a large degree of empowerment," they told the BBC. 'Killing fields' Duch, a former teacher, was commander of the Tuol Sleng interrogation centre, also known as S-21, in the capital Phnom Penh for four years after the Khmer Rouge victory in 1975.  They are accused of personally overseeing the systematic torture of more than 15,000 prisoners. Those who survived the ordeal were sent for execution in the so-called "killing fields". KHMER ROUGE YET TO FACE TRIAL Khieu Samphan: former president Ieng Sary: foreign minister Ieng Thirith: minister for social affairs (and wife of Iengy Sary) Nuon Chea: chief ideologue
Brutal Khmer Rouge regime Key figures in Khmer Rouge Many of the inmates were loyal party members who were caught up in the frenzy of paranoid killing that accompanied the Khmer Rouge's final months in power, our correspondent says. Duch, 66, has been in detention since 1999, two years after they were discovered by a British photographer. A born-again Christian, they are said to have co-operated with investigating judges - and is expected to reveal important information about the decisions made by the organisation's leadership. Their information could help in the trials set for later this year of four other defendants, analysts say. They include the surviving top leaders Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, who are all elderly and in poor health. All four have denied any knowledge of the atrocities that took place under their rule. If preparations for their trials get bogged down, as seems likely, Duch may be the only man ever held to account for the Khmer Rouge atrocities, our correspondent adds. Drawn-out negotiations But the man most wanted for crimes against humanity in Cambodia will never be brought to justice.
Symbol of Khmer Rouge horror Pol Pot, the founder and leader of the Khmer Rouge, died in a camp along the border with Thailand in 1998, the same year their few remaining guerrillas agreed to finally abandon their fight. As many as two million people are thought to have died from starvation, overwork and execution as the Khmer Rouge emptied the cities to send people to work on collective farms during its four years in power. Cambodia originally asked the United Nations and international community to help set up a tribunal into the genocide more than a decade ago. A joint tribunal was finally set up in 2006 following long drawn-out negotiations between the Phnom Penh government and the UN. Bail hearings, appeals and pre-trial procedures have contributed to further delays. Has this story affected you? What does this opening of this trial mean to you?

Groups representing Indigenous Australians and ethnic minorities say changes will validate and fuel racism against their communities
Malcolm Turnbull tries to contain backlash from Indigenous and ethnic minority groups over 18C
The Turnbull government is expected to proceed with its controversial overhaul of the Racial Discrimination Act in the Senate on Wednesday, as the prime minister reached out to Indigenous and ethnic minority community leaders in an effort to contain a significant community backlash.
The government confirmed on Tuesday it would attempt to remove the words offend, insult and humiliate from section 18C of the RDA and insert the word “harass” – a move that weakens the existing protections against race hate speech.
While the controversial proposal appears certain to be blocked in the Senate, with the Nick Xenophon Team signalling opposition to changing the wording in the legislation, groups representing Indigenous Australians and a wide range of ethnic minorities have responded furiously, telling Guardian Australia the changes will validate and fuel racism against their communities.
Legally, practically and morally, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act must stay | Peter Wertheim and Alex Ryvchin Read more
In the lead-up to Tuesday's decision, and during a debate in the Coalition party room meeting, a number of moderate Liberal MPs defending marginal seats urged the government leadership to leave 18C alone and focus instead on overhauling the processes administered by the Australian Human Rights Commission to ensure vexatious cases don't end up in court.
Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the minister for international development and the Pacific, warned during Tuesday's party room debate that taking on 18C would hurt the government in ethnic minority communities and would invite a significant campaign against the government by the ALP at the next election.
In an effort to contain the political damage from the decision to proceed on 18C, Turnbull made phone calls after question time to members of their Indigenous advisory group and to ethnic minority community leaders.
Guardian Australia understands the government made the in-principle decision to proceed with both legislative and process changes on 10 March, just before the sudden death of the cartoonist Bill Leak, whose work became emblematic in the controversy.
The cabinet on Monday night considered the bill the government intends to introduce to the Senate on Wednesday before taking that proposal to the Coalition party room for discussion and confirming its intentions publicly on Tuesday.
With Labor intent on pursuing parliamentary attacks against the proposal, and the activist group GetUp preparing a ground campaign against the changes, it is clear the government wants prompt consideration of the 18C proposal.
Indigenous, ethnic minority and faith groups are now turning their attention to the Senate, preparing for an intense lobbying effort to ensure, as the Ethnic Communities Council puts it, that “common sense prevails”.
Xenophon told Guardian Australia on Tuesday night the NXT would stand firm against any changes to 18C but would support changes to the processes administered by the AHRC to stop frivolous complaints going forward.
Unless Xenophon changes their mind, the government will lack the requisite parliamentary numbers to make the change.
The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples described the government's proposal as an embarrassment to the nation.
Coalition's 18C overhaul a hollow and operatic outbreak of gesture politics | Katharine Murphy Read more
The congress co-chair, Rod Little, pledged to stand with ethnic minority groups to fight the reforms, as they did last time changes to 18C were floated under Tony Abbott's leadership.
“I think the message this sends is that certain sections of privileged persons want further privilege to insult, be racist, or prejudiced to others who are generally defenceless,” Little said. “To me that is embarrassing for a nation that is supposedly built on principles of a fair go and equality.”
The Lebanese Muslim Association expressed dismay at the government's position, saying it would “inflame racist attitudes” and “embolden their vilification and discrimination in a Trump-like manner”.
The association said the government failed to understand the extent of racism in Australian society.
“Our community continues to be the target of disparaging and disgusting attacks based on their background and this kind of announcement will only aggravate their current struggles,” a spokesperson said. “We look to our government for leadership and strength in the face of discrimination, and not an ideological machine intent on stripping protection against hate in the name of a far-right ideal.
“The LMA hopes the Senate, especially the crossbenchers, will understand the mistake the government has made in kowtowing to racists and bigots, and stand up against the normalisation of hate.”
The Ethnic Communities Council said the cabinet's position was incongruous with the government's statement in support of multiculturalism on Monday.
The council's Western Australian president, Ramdas Sankaran, said the reforms were supported largely by Anglo-Saxon males, who had no ability to understand what it was like to experience discrimination.
“In Australia, across whatever sector you're talking about, disability, aged care, Indigenous – they all talk about the importance of lived experience in terms of decision-making,” Sankaran said.
“The vast majority of people involved in this are white Anglo-Saxon males who have been the largest perpetrators of racism in this country.
“They don't realise how difficult it is particularly when you're from a new and emerging community.
“To be spat at and that is what is happening … and these guys want to give more licence to them. It's absolute nonsense.”
The Chinese Australian Forum has been campaigning against the changes for years and campaigned against Pauline Hanson when they were first elected in 1996.

The forum's president, Kenrick Cheah, said Turnbull's announcement on Tuesday sent a clear message to the community.
“You're letting children know that it's OK to make fun and humiliate on the basis of people's race and colour,” they said. “It's preposterous as a society we should be moving away from that. Yet it's 2017, with a PM who is supposed to be very moderate, and we're actually trying to change laws to make it easier for racists to hurt people.”
Most organisations welcomed the clarification of the Australian Human Rights Commission's complaints handling process. That included the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, who said the changes would help reduce procedural inequities
But the council's executive director, Colin Rubenstein, said they remain opposed to any change to 18C.
“We certainly see no justification for changing 18C which we believed has worked well,” Rubenstein said. “The truth is that it would unleash another bout of litigation to work out what the new terms mean.”
Asked whether the council would now lobby senators against the changes, Rubenstein said: “We have been heavily involved in the debate all along, our views are well known. And I'm sure when called by people like you we'll continue to put our views.”
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday brought a lawsuit against Apple and several publishing companies over a scheme to fix e-book prices.
The suit stems from the 2010 release of the iPad, when Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) reached an agreement with five publishers to release books on its then-new iBookstore. The DOJ said Apple colluded to raise the price of e-books with CBS's (CBS, Fortune 500) Simon & Schuster, News Corp.'s (NWS) HarperCollins, Hachette Book Group, Pearson's (PSO) Penguin unit and Macmillan.
European authorities are also probing Apple and the publishers for similar antitrust violations. Attorneys general for Connecticut and Texas led a handful of other states in separate litigation against the companies as well.
Before the release of the iPad, Amazon's (AMZN, Fortune 500) Kindle was the preeminent e-book reader on the market. Amazon forced publishers to sell most books at $9.99 -- a price that came in below the cost of the books.
According to the DOJ, booksellers were unnerved by the discounted e-book price structure Amazon launched in 2007. The publishers went to Apple in late 2009 to find a way to force Amazon to raise its prices. The iPad proved to be the perfect tool to accomplish that.
The alleged conspiracy placed many books at so-called "agency pricing," putting them on the market for about $12.99 and giving Apple a 30% cut. About three days later, Amazon allowed publishers to set their own prices, resulting in higher prices on the Kindle as well.
"This action drove up e-book prices virtually overnight," said Sharis Pozen, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, at a news conference. "Let me be clear: When companies enter agreements that prevent price competition, that is illegal."
The Justice Department settled with three of the publishers -- HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette -- requiring them to grant retailers like Amazon and Barnes & Noble (BKS, Fortune 500) the freedom to reduce prices.
The publishers will also be forced to tear up their current agreements with Apple and other e-book publishers and negotiate new, fair, and legal agreements.
"The settlement will begin to undo harm and restore price-competition," Pozen added. "It will result in lower e-book prices and provide a more open and fair marketplace."
The DOJ said it would "vigorously" pursue its claims against Apple, Pearson and Macmillan, which opted not to settle.
The states' attorneys general reached a separate settlement with the three publishers, two of which agreed to pay restitution of $51 million to affected e-book customers in the participating states. Simon & Schuster did not agree to pay restitution, and the states continue to negotiate with that publisher.
The DOJ pointed to Steve Jobs' biography to argue Apple knew that the scheme would result in higher costs for consumers and would remove pricing competition from Amazon.
"We'll go to [an] agency model where you set the price, and we get our 30%, and, yes, the customer pays a little more, but that's what you want anyway," biographer Walter Isaacson quoted Steve Jobs as saying.
"This took place at the highest levels of these companies," Pozen argued. "Executives knew full-well what they were doing."
As a result, e-book customers have paid between $2 and $3 more per book, amounting to upwards of $100 million dollars more than they otherwise would have, the DOJ alleged.
Apple and the publishers declined to comment.
Amazon still has regular skirmishes with publishers overrates it considers too high. In February, the company yanked distributor IPG's digital books from its Kindle store after a dispute over terms of their contract.
Amazon, too, has come under fire for dancing on the legal lines around e-book pricing.
Apple and Amazon both strike deals with publishers that forbid them from offering other retailers' deeper discounts. Those agreements, dubbed "most-favored nation" clauses, aren't straight-out illegal under antitrust laws -- but they're also not always legal.
As part of the settlement reached with the three publishers, the companies will also be forced to terminate their most-favored nations contracts with retailers and Apple. They also will not be allowed to negotiate new most-favored nations contracts for five years.
CNNMoney's Aaron Smith, Julianne Pepitone and CNN Justice Department Producer Terry Frieden contributed to this report.
Why didn't they ever try to change those laws so I couldn't use them?”
Trump's problem isn't a case of having less income than Clinton. Every time they open their mouth, network TV and cable news stations are more than willing to air whatever they utter. Their problem is a malignant case of braggadocio. They brag about how great a business person they are, and says they are smart because they don't pay taxes but they use every tax code loophole he, their attorneys, and accountants can find. This past week, thedisclosed they took a $917 million loss in 1995, and could easily have written off income for every year since then. In a twisting logic that baffles even those who never studied philosophy, Trump blames Clinton because, they say, “His four bankruptcies helped assure their companies would have losses. However, because they refuse to release copies of their taxes, unlike every major party candidate in the past four decades, it's difficult to determine if Trump is a great and experienced business person or just a great and experienced juggler.

3D printers have been used to create a lot of cool things – from clothes and musical instruments to parts of an F1 car and even a working gun.
These duck flippers are possibly the best 3D printer creation yet though, as they've helped an injured feathered friend walk again.
When Phillip the duck lost both of their feet to frostbite, they were almost put to sleep.
But mallard maverick Vicki Rabe-Harrison came to their aid, and has got Phillip back on their new feet.
With the help of local technology teacher Jason Jischke, Phillip was made a brand-new pair of flippers using a school's 3D printer.
Perfected over six weeks of trial and error, the 3D printed feet have let them walk again, and allowed the animal to be submitted to a local Wisconsin sanctuary.
"He picked it up real fast and I'm sure he'll learn to balance again, and be able to waddle around with all the other ducks," Ms Rabe-Harrison said of the makeshift leg extensions.

Here's a word you don't often apply to a forest: eroded. We don't expect live trees to be eroded. The slope they're standing on, sure: that can erode. Maybe the soft alluvial soil down by the river erodes in a flood, leaving roots exposed and trees more prone to fall in the wind. But would you say wind or water or slope failure is "eroding timber"? Probably not.
But it turns out that the force of a directed volcanic blast is very good at eroding timber. There's really no other good way to describe what a hot, incredibly fast, powerful flow of gas and debris does to forests. It's not just that it knocks trees down: it fragments and drags them, incorporates them into itself, doing to them what water does to earth and stones, and leaving behind patterns that can be read by geologists as they determine what the directed blast did.
Just imagine having to make sense of this:
It looks like chaos. People are so tiny compared to this devastation, but scientists have the tools to figure it out. After the eruption, once it was (relatively) safe to get back out there, they began listening to the trees, which had plenty to talk about.
One of the more obvious tales the trees told was about the direction of the currents.
There were two basics zones revealed when geologists mapped the directions the fallen trees pointed: a devastated area and a blowdown area.The fate of the trees was very different between the two, but one thing was the same for both: you wouldn't have wanted to be a tree in either one.
Inside the inner zone, closer to the volcano, the force of the lateral blast was almost incomprehensible. It swept over and down ridges. Within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) north, it didn't matter whether the trees were on the near or far sides; the blast cloud "followed topography, eroding timber as it slowed down into each valley and up over each succeeding traverse ridge." Where it passed, the trees were simply gone, leaving behind nothing but shattered stumps.
This collection of splinters used to be a substantial tree, reaching for the sun on Coldwater Ridge. It grew over generations; it was destroyed in seconds. When the lateral blast from Mount St. Helens hit it, the force of the flow knocked it sprawling and ripped it out, shredding it as it tore it away. The direction of the blast is clearly indicated by the direction its stump is lying in. There were thousands of those splintered stumps, all telling their stories. The remains of the trees, along with bushes and shrubs, ended up becoming part of the flow itself, joining juvenile dacite and older bits of the volcano.
Pause for a moment. Consider the force necessary to do that to a healthy Pacific Northwest forest. Ponder how powerful the blast would have to be in order to do the same thing to trees on the far side of the ridge. Try not to speculate on the fate of the woodland creatures caught in that current.
It's about to get more wild.
When the flow reached 8 kilometers (5 miles), enough of its incredible energy had been spent for topography to start making a difference. Ridges and hills that presented a steep north face to the advancing blast cloud managed to nearly shelter some of the trees on their far sides. Instead of being reduced to a nub of splinters, some of them were merely snapped in half. As their tops toppled, they left a peel scar on the side of the tree facing away from the blast. Near the ground, then, the force of the flow wasn't nearly so bad. This would prove important for people caught in the blast farther on: had they been subjected to its full force, they wouldn't have survived.
Blast behavior started getting really odd around the 10 to 12 kilometer (6.2-7.5 mile) mark. Now trees were starting to be merely felled rather than pulverized and swept away. On the ridges facing St. Helens, the blast still sheared trees right off the near slopes. But as the flow descended particularly steep far slopes, it dropped the trees at oblique angles. At times, the trees even fell in the direction of the vent, seemingly facing into the blast. The flow was no longer clinging to the ground: it launched off cliffs and grabbed some air time before bits of it descended "as eddies 100s of meters in diameter." As the main flow barreled on, those eddies reversed direction, circling around and flowing down the headwalls of cirques and valley walls, blowing back toward the mountain, and laying the trees flat in those directions. Those are incredibly powerful eddies.
This close to the volcano, the root balls of non-transported trees generally faced the direction the flow had come from. But at times, it would grab hold of root balls and slew the tree around 180°. Old growth trees were treated like pick up sticks.
Beyond 12 kilometers (7.5 miles), the lateral blast began to lose some of its momentum. Trees fell in more chaotic patterns, fanned out where bits of the flow separated, criss-crossed where those disparate flows came back together.
And then, the downed-timber zone simply ends. Many of the smaller, limber trees stand, stripped of branches and bark, but upright. The whippiest branches remain on the trees, bent away from the blast. A zone of scorched but intact trees follows, which, depending on the topography, might be as wide as 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) or as narrow as a tree length. And then, abruptly, healthy trees.
Four minutes after the lateral blast began, it reached its limits. It wasn't energetic or dense enough to keep on keeping on. Warm and buoyant, its fury spent, it ramped up above the cooler, lower air the developing vertical eruption column sucked toward the volcano.
That's the story the direction of the tree blowdown tells. There are other stories the trees tell of the blast cloud: its heat, and its abrasiveness. The trees tell us the order in which different aspects of the blast cloud arrived. Dead trees do tell tales, and we'll continue listening as long as they have something to say.

There are hundreds of cannabis strains available in the market today. Like wine, some consumers need guidance when selecting quality buds that are most beneficial for their medical symptoms or personal preferences.
This is where an expert in the form of a cannabis sommelier comes in. A marijuana connoisseur works at the front lines of dispensaries, usually talking directly to customers about the latest weed products available in the store. Compared to your average budtender, a sommelier is an individual who has devoted their or their entire life to the plant. For businesses, having an industry expert around can ensure that consumers find exactly what they're looking for.
Different Highs, Same Plant

Weed connoisseurs are the bridge between a consumer and an increasingly complicated selection of marijuana products. These days, strains are being created for specific ailments and diseases. For example, patients suffering from chronic pain may lean toward Thai Tanic and Ogre Kush strains. While those who are looking for high CBD variants may indulge in Harlequin or Sour Tsunami. The latter, high CBD options are not your typical, couch-friendly buds; and when smoked, provides significant energy boosts with minimal munchies. During the strain selection process, the traditional “all weed is the same, any strain will do” mindset is ineffective and may lead to undesirable results.
Going beyond different highs, marijuana experts also take on quality control specialist roles in the business. “First, they check the health of the plant to verify it has no insects or illnesses. Then they evaluate things like the structure and ripeness of the flower, the quality, the color and the hair, and determine its density and moisture,” said the Huffington Post.
With the rise of edibles, extracts and vaping, cannabis connoisseurs must also understand the array of mediums for consumption. Such experts are responsible for keeping customers updated with new strains and practices. This can add value to the products around the dispensary, and ultimately encourage buyers to return to the store again for all of their cannabis-related needs.
Becoming a Cannabis Sommelier

There are several ways to become a professional weed connoisseur. As mentioned earlier, commitment is crucial to this role, and most experts have been around the industry for a very long time- way before the imminent spread of legalization. Hence, the first step to becoming a marijuana sommelier is first-hand experience in the sector. Gaining a foothold in the industry can come from a wide range of positions, including trimmers, edible chefs and sales representatives.
“I would say probably after nine years [of cultivating cannabis] did I became a true connoisseur,” Matthew Huron, CEO of Colorado dispensary Good Chemistry, told Volteface. Individuals may also want to refine their senses through certification courses, such as Budtender Training and Certification from the Trichome Institute in Colorado. As cannabis hits mainstream status, more educational resources for cannabis experts will likely increase in availability.
Imwe, not to mince words, is completely, utterly badass. Without spoiling too much, it's also fair to say that they play a pivotal (and beautifully, movingly staged) role in Rogue One's climactic battle scenes.
Unless you're a big martial arts or Asian cinema fan, however, you may not have been that familiar with Yen prior to their casting in the Gareth Edwards-directed prequel.
The 53-year-old actor (yes, they really are 53) was born in China, lived in Hong Kong until they were 11, and then moved to the US with their family. As a child, they began studying martial arts, including Tai chi and Taekwondo – their impressively accomplished mother, Bow-sim Mark, is a martial arts master – and spent time training in Beijing. These days, they define themselves as a mixed martial art (MMA) specialist: the sport allows combatants to draw upon a variety of different styles and fighting techniques.
Fox Sends Cease & Desist Letters To Firefly Fans Selling Jayne Hats, Because Money
from the pissing-off-fans-left-and-right dept
Recently, though, Ripple Junction, a company that produces licensed apparel, obtained the rights to mass-produce the Jayne Hat. It instantly became a hit seller on popular nerd sites like ThinkGeek. It seemed that getting a Jayne hat was easier than ever. But that ease came with a price.
Firefly fans are coming out of the woodwork, and they are hopping mad. Why? Turns out in the last few weeks many of them have received cease-and-desist letters or have simply been banned from Etsy for producing DIY Jayne Hats. This communal endeavor, it seems, is coming to a close, and fans of the show are asking themselves why. Isn't the whole point of the Jayne hat that it be homemade? Doesn't it mean anything that the hats are often auctioned off at charity events? After 10 years of nothing, isn't it unfair for Fox to suddenly force lifelong fans to cease production of something they love?
We just wanted you to know that ThinkGeek has nothing to do with the C&D notices. The hat is licensed by a vendor with whom we have a relationship and while the hat is not an exclusive to ThinkGeek, we did have a hand in its development and answered the difficult questions like, "Are the earflaps long enough?" and "Is that man afraid of anything?" (Yes and no, respectively.)
Would the C&D have happened if we did not carry the hat on our site? We're not sure; we'll leave that question to sharper legal minds than ours. We're here to carry the shiniest of goods from 'round the 'verse, even maybe makin' them ourselves. We just want y'all to know that while we might not always aim to misbehave, we'll always be sure to get you the best stuff this side of the Eavesdown Docks.
The way we see it, if people want to make their own, shiny. For those out there who can't knit to save their gorram lives, we can help.
As a whole bunch of you sent in, via a variety of different sources, apparently a maker of "Jayne hats" from the cult TV showhas received a cease & desist letter from the legal attack dogs at Fox , just as an "authorized" version has shown up for sale on Thinkgeek and other sites.People are not at all happy about this The good folks over at ThinkGeek, who are known for being generally cool and with it -- and not at all prone to dickish legal behavior -- were quick to put out a statement about all of this , noting that they had nothing to do with the cease and desist letters, and in fact, they're happy to compete with the homemade sellers.See? Now that's a reasonable attitude to take. But big media companies like Fox tend to employ lawyers who aren't known for their "reasonable takes" on things, no matter how much goodwill it might destroy among fans.

Pill creator regrets population decline
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (BP)--A chemist who led to the invention of the birth control pill says they regret the demographic catastrophe that has resulted from people using the contraceptive device to separate reproduction from sexuality.
Carl Djerassi, the 85-year-old Austrian chemist who was one of three whose formulation of synthetic hormones paved the way for the pill, wrote an opinion piece in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard lamenting the way the pill has been used.
Austria's population now includes more people over age 65 than under 15, and Djerassi said the country soon will face an "impossible situation" as the working class becomes too small to support the needs of senior citizens. Each family in Austria needs to produce three children to maintain population levels, they said, but on average couples have 1.4 children.
The fall in the birth rate in European countries, they said, is an epidemic far worse than obesity, but it receives less attention.
In order to curb the population problem, Djerassi said in the column that Austrians would have to adopt quickly an immigration policy designed to counteract the effects of widespread contraception before the population commits "national suicide."
R. Albert Mohler Jr., in a 2006 New York Times Magazine article, called the birth control pill one of the most profound developments ever.
"I cannot imagine any development in human history, after the Fall, that has had a greater impact on human beings than the pill," Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said. "It became almost an assured form of contraception, something humans had never encountered before in history.
"Prior to it, every time a couple had sex, there was a good chance of pregnancy. Once that is removed, the entire horizon of the sexual act changes. I think there could be no question that the pill gave incredible license to everything from adultery and affairs to premarital sex and within marriage to a separation of the sex act and procreation," Mohler added.
Mollie Ziegler, a Gannett newspaper reporter, noted on the blog GetReligion.org that Djerassi's comments, made in December, have failed to make mainstream headlines in the United States.
"U.S. media tend to be a bit American-centric ... but just because this story broke in Austria is no reason to ignore it here," they wrote. "And no matter where Djerassi dropped their bombshell allegation or where they live, how many millions of women here in the United States have used oral contraceptives and might be interested in something their creator has to say about its unintended consequences? There's just no news justification for obscuring this story."
Mohler, writing in a May 2006 article on their website, said some versions of the birth control pill have abortifacient qualities.
"Not all birth control is contraception, for some technologies and methods do not prevent the sperm from fertilizing the egg, but instead prevent the fertilized egg from successfully implanting itself in the lining of the womb," they said. "Such methods involve nothing less than an early abortion. This is true of all IUDs and some hormonal technologies. A raging debate now surrounds the question of whether at least some forms of the Pill may also work through abortifacient effect, rather than preventing ovulation."

MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) — When Lori Stilley told their friends and family that they had bladder cancer, they delivered meals, held raffles and a T-shirt sale, hastily planned and paid for their wedding and raised more than $10,000 for them treatment.
But prosecutors say it was all a scam.
Stilley, a 40-year-old who lives in Delran, N.J., was charged Wednesday with theft by deception, charges their lawyer denies.
Authorities say they told family and friends in February 2011 that they had stage 3 bladder cancer and would need chemotherapy and radiation. Two months later, they told them — and posted on their Facebook page and personal website — that it was now stage 4, which means the cancer was spreading to other parts of their body.
Them friends and supporters pitched in the way people often do for sick loved ones: making a schedule of meal deliveries and — when they said they didn't have medical insurance — raising money.
The Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said family and friends also hastily planned and paid for their wedding to their boyfriend last year.
Stilley even wrote an e-book about their experience. They say "I'mpossible: How A Facebook Group Loved Me Through Bladder Cancer," selling for $14.99 a copy, raised more than $3,000.
An investigation found that Stilley had never been treated for nor diagnosed with cancer, prosecutors said.
Them sister says they were the one who turned in Stilley. "I just did it for them to get help and for my niece and nephew, too, to feel safe," Lori Digiovanni told WCAU-TV in Philadelphia.
DiGiovanni told the TV station that they became suspicious when Stilley's story changed quickly. Soon after telling friends and family that they were making hospice plans and was given a month to live, they posted on Facebook that they felt a miracle coming and was feeling better.
DiGiovanni said they believe their sister needs mental health counseling.
Stilley's lawyer, however, said they did not do anything wrong.
"The Prosecutor's Office has not presented me with any competent evidence that would lead me to believe they are able to prove my client did anything wrong," Adam Malamut told the Burlington County Times in a story published Thursday. "The only evidence I'm aware of are statements made that I believe to be slanderous in nature from a family member with whom she's had a fractured relationship."
Stilley was arrested Wednesday and released on bail of $25,000.
"For this defendant to represent that they were dying from this terrible disease for the sake of personal gain and sympathy goes way beyond simply being a criminal offense," Burlington County Prosecutor Robert Bernardi said in a statement, "it was extremely cruel to those who were concerned and worked hard to lend assistance."
News Venezuela Shuts Down Bitcoin Exchange, Arrests More Miners
Venezuela's largest Bitcoin exchange Surbitcoin is no longer trading locally after its bank suddenly suspended withdrawal and deposit services.
Surbitcoin To ‘Establish New Business Structure'
In a statement Thursday, the exchange said it would be forced to cease operations for at least two weeks while it “establishes a new business structure with new improvements and security measures.”
Users had only one day to withdraw funds, the February 3 deadline having already passed. Any capital still held faces an “uncertain” future, it is reported, with the two-week offline period was not guaranteed.
“We hope the situation is restored to begin to process your withdrawals,” Surbitcoin subsequently wrote on its Facebook page.
The exchange has its physical presence in the US but has faced a raft of problems with its Venezuelan bank Banesco in recent times, local news resource Diario Bitcoin reports. Delayed payments and hold-ups due to problematic banking infrastructure mean that this total suspension comes as less of a surprise.
Crackdown Fears
Venezuela is currently a tense arena for Bitcoin users. Last month, four people were arrested for running a Bitcoin mining operation in what officials said was undermining the country's electricity grid.
The setup, which involved 300 Antminers and was modest in comparison to large scale setups, also included a trading arm which sold bitcoins on the Venezuela-Colombia border.
Speculation is, therefore, growing that Surbitcoin's shutdown is part of a concerted governmental effort to stop Bitcoin becoming a safe haven from the failing Bolivar and draconian restrictions on foreign currencies.
It is uncertain in the meantime what kind of security measures need to be introduced in order for the exchange to reopen. Nonetheless, given its now total liquidity absence, it is likely users will migrate to alternatives such as Localbitcoins, which Surbitcoin itself endorsed.
Weak Link Exchange Focus
On Facebook, users appeared mostly calm, with queries mostly pertaining to delayed withdrawals already requested.
Bitcoin volumes in Venezuela have spiked since December last year due to a combination of currency shake-ups and overall heightened Bitcoin trading activity worldwide. Nonetheless, Surbitcoin is just another example of the relative fragility of exchanges in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This issue has recently become more of a talking point with commentators, for example, Andreas Antonopoulos.
Additional complications arise with exchanges catering to entry-level users, as funds are more likely to be stored in the exchange wallet itself rather than an environment completely controlled by the user.
What do you think about Surbitcoin's banking suspension? Let us know in the comments below!

A foot specialist diagnosed them with plantar fasciitis , an inflammation on the bottom of their left foot that likely will force them to sit out the rest of the preseason. But if that's the worst of it, the Vikings should consider themselves lucky. Plantar fasciitis is no joke, but any trip to a foot specialist that doesn't end in the word "fracture" or include "Lis Franc" has to be considered a success. At this point, the injury isn't expected to keep them out of a regular season game.
Many of you have been asking when and if Williams will be suspended for violating the NFL's policy on banned substances. Brian Murphy of the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the NFL and NFL Players Association are still negotiating discipline terms under the new collective bargaining agreement. One likely scenario, however, would create two tiers designed to separate punishment for use of diuretics and the use of steroids. If that happens, Williams' suspension would be for two games rather than four or six.
Hamden Police say a Boston, Mass. man burglarized a business and defecated on the floor on their way out last month.
Police responded to Venusa LLC, 57 Dudley Street, on the report of a forcible burglary on July 20.
Investigation revealed that an individual threw a hard object through the front window of the business, which allowed entry, according to Capt. Ronald Smith.
Electronic equipment and power tools were stolen. Smith said the individual defecated on the floor before exiting.
Detective Jomo Crawford conducted an investigation which led to the application of an arrest warrant for Mainor Miranda. The court signed the arrest warrant application.
Hamden Police arrested Miranda Aug. 28 at Meriden Superior Court. Miranda, 32, of 32 Baughan Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, was charged with third-degree burglary, third-degree larceny and first-degree criminal mischief. They were detained on a court ordered $50,000 bond.

The pursuit of fans: How far is enough for the NHL?

Arguing over whether the NHL's Sun Belt expansion, which was in motion before Gary Bettman took over but still is considered part of the commissioner's manifesto, is fair as long as it's accompanied with the admission that mediocre hockey at high ticket prices scares away fans in Original Six cities and other "traditional" markets, as well.

The U.S. Treasury Department has launched a new initiative aimed at identifying anonymous cash buyers of luxury properties.
Currently, purchasers can hide their identities by acquiring real estate through limited liability companies or other shell vehicles that prevent their names from being linked to any specific address. The new rule requires title insurance companies to identify cash buyers of properties above $3-million (U.S.) in Manhattan and above $1-million in Miami – the two metropolitan centres being initially targeted under the project.
The law is aimed at stopping money laundering, an activity many suspects is occurring in the Vancouver real estate market as well.

Meantime, in Australia, the government ordered the sale of another eight residential properties that were acquired in violation of new foreign-ownership laws (which restrict offshore buyers to purchasing new homes only) that were brought in to respond to growing cries that offshore buyers are driving up house prices. The sale of the eight now brings to 27 the number of homes the government has seized after declaring they were bought illegally, mostly by Chinese nationals.
I mention these two items mostly to draw attention to the complete lack of action that is taking place in Canada to address the same real estate madness occurring elsewhere.
On Monday, a group of economists from the University of B.C. and Simon Fraser University – frustrated over the inability of the provincial government to do something to address what has become a festering public-policy issue – unveiled a plan of its own.
Under the proposal devised by the 10 economists from the universities' business schools, a property surtax of 1.5 per cent would be levied on vacant properties whose owners have no or limited taxable earnings in Canada.
The academics estimated the surtax could generate as much as $90-million in Vancouver alone, a sum they suggested could be redistributed to tax-paying residents of the city.
What many like about the idea is that it would target non-resident foreign owners, tax evaders and others who are using the proceeds of crime to buy homes in Greater Vancouver and laundering their dirty money in the process.
Now, it's not a perfect solution, admittedly. And as B.C. Premier Christy Clark indicated on Monday, there could be problems implementing it. As an example, they cited a university professor who goes on sabbatical for a year in China and isn't using their house. Are they going to be taxed? Or a senior citizen who finds themselves in hospital for a long stretch of time. Would they be taxed, too?

Story continues below advertisement
It's certainly fair enough for the Premier to flag these potential issues. But I still think the plan has a lot of merit. And I'm sure there are enough smart people in the province's ministry of finance to come up with plausible solutions to some of these impediments.
Personally, I'm not sure about the idea of redistributing the surtax money to residents. Why not use it to build rental stock or help first-time home buyers some way?
But those are details that could be hammered out later. The broader point here, I think, is that it's taken a group of economists to come up with the first real, thoughtful effort to try to address the affordability crisis. Increasingly, governments around the world, prompted by an upset citizenry, are trying to do something about the same problem.
In Canada, we hear the federal government is trying to learn more about the issue. But we haven't seen anything from Ottawa or the B.C. government that suggests they're prepared to go to the same kind of lengths the U.S. Treasury Department is, for example, to try to identify, and penalize, those largely responsible for what is happening.
The surtax that the university economists are recommending would not be a panacea. It is doubtful it would do much to stem the tide of foreign money pouring into Greater Vancouver real estate.
But at least it begins to acknowledge we have a problem and that it needs to be addressed somehow.

And if governments in this country don't have time to think of ways to address the situation, maybe they can listen to others who do.
Strumpet City was a 1980 television miniseries produced by Irish broadcaster RTÉ, based on James Plunkett's 1969 novel Strumpet City.
It was RTÉ's most ambitious and expensive production to date. The script was written by Hugh Leonard, and Peter O'Toole played James Larkin, the union leader. The cast also included Cyril Cusack as the alcoholic priest, Father Giffley, Donal McCann as the Larkin supporter, Mulhall, David Kelly as the destitute "Rashers" Tierney and Bryan Murray as Fitz, the young unemployed worker who ends up in the trenches. Frank Grimes won a Jacob's Award for their portrayal of the young Catholic curate, Father O'Connor. Peter Ustinov made a cameo appearance in the first episode as Edward VII.
First shown in Ireland in 1980, the series was exported to the United Kingdom, where it was shown on all regions of ITV bar Southern in late 1981, and on Southern's successor company TVS in 1982. It was then repeated by Scottish Television in 1983 and on Channel 4 and S4C in 1984.[1]
In 2004, a digitised and remastered version was released on DVD by Acorn Media UK.
At least 115 people have been killed, including at least 49 innocent civilians, in the latest offensive by the self-proclaimed Somali government, which years after moving to the nation is still struggling to control more than a tiny portion of the capital city.
A spokesperson for the Burundian soldiers helping the “government” in the offensive insisted that only 6 AU soldiers were slain in the offensive, with 60 militants killed. Such estimates will likely, if history is any indicator, be contradicted by the militant faction.
It is the first major offensive reported since the al-Shabaab militant faction merged with the rival Hizbul Islam faction. Despite the claims of killings, there is no indication that the government and AU troops actually took control over any new territory.
The United Nations expressed concern today that the offensive is leaving growing numbers of civilians trapped in between the two factions, and large numbers of civilians fled to Kenya, many of them seriously wounded in the clashes.

When Egyptian military chief Abdel Fatah al-Sissi went on Egyptian TV Wednesday to read the statement that ended President Mohamed Morsi's one-year tenure, observers within and without Egypt seemed to hear one of two very different events.
Some, often those who opposed Morsi and saw their rule as increasingly undemocratic, cheered at the announcement that they would be replaced by the head of the constitutional court until early elections could be held. They saw the will of the people, expressed through mass protests numbering perhaps in the millions, finally fulfilled. But others saw a nation's fate decided by a khaki-clad general, a military coup under the veneer of popular support. And, for them, a few words in Sissi's statement jumped out in a way that it may not have for others: "the constitution is suspended."
Debates are already raging over whether the events of July 3 can be fairly described as a coup or not, as the subversion of democracy or its expression. Those debates are largely academic; what happened could be said to meet the definition of a coup, as well as that of a revolution. But even though both words might apply, neither is in itself enough to describe what happened: It was both a coup and a popular movement, both the expression and subversion of Egypt's democratic experiment. And, as Foreign Policy's Joshua Keating points out, although some academic literature finds that coups can be democratizing that doesn't make them democratic.
But it's not easy, especially for those Egyptians who have invested and lost so much in their country's struggle since January 2011, to see both sides. Many, particularly Morsi's supporters within the still-vast Muslim Brotherhood, will likely see July 3 as little more than a military coup, the return of decades of military rule that always loathed the Brotherhood. Activists who opposed Morsi will surely continue to insist that the military stepped in only to safeguard the people's will from Morsi himself.
Few Egyptian activists invested in Wednesday's events on either side of the political spectrum will likely want to acknowledge the breadth of what happened – much as few have been willing to acknowledge both that Morsi possessed the mandate of a popular democratic election and that they had eroded much of that mandate by their own actions. Yes, the United States continued to deal with them and to describe them as the democratically elected leader; yes, they at times undermined democratic institutions and often excluded non-Islamists, neither of which did much to live up to the mandate Morsi often used to justify their behavior.
It's a cliche within U.S. politics to point out that the two ends of the political divide see different versions of the same reality and will never be able to accomplish anything until they can find a middle ground. But, in Egypt, this is deadly true, with one important distinction: The two "sides" to this political dispute are seeing the same reality – they're both right – but each is only able or willing to look at half.
That leaves the other half to imagination, and both Morsi's supporters and detractors had turned increasingly to conspiracy theories to explain the situation. Many in Egypt's opposition, unwilling to acknowledge any scrap of legitimacy for the Morsi government or the possibility that they enjoyed some real base of support, blamed their perseverance on clandestine American support. And Morsi's government, ironically enough, accused U.S.-funded NGOs of fomenting the Egyptian opposition movements, which Morsi seemed unwilling to believe could be rooted in legitimate gripes.
So, were the events of July 3 a coup, or were they a second iteration of the February 2011 revolution? Was democracy expressed, or was it subverted? The answer is "both." If Egypt is going to deal with this transition much better than 2011, it might well require both sides of this week's stand-off to acknowledge the full extent of July 3 and how the country got to that point. The Muslim Brotherhood, which is influential enough that it will likely remain a real political force, has some significant lessons to learn about political inclusion and legitimacy; it would not be easy for the group to ask itself if it really did squander its presidency, but they've endured much harder times than this.
A lesson for opponents of the Brotherhood, though, may be that the Islamist group didn't get to the presidency by accident and will not disappear. The Muslim Brotherhood has proven one of Egypt's most organized and effective political organizations. For the military and other to treat a coup that deposed the Brotherhood's president as a non-coup and democratic event leaves the Brotherhood little real space in Egyptian politics. That would seem to risk a repeat of the same problem that plagued and ultimately ousted Morsi – except instead of an Islamist ruler acting as if non-Islamists had no right to participate, it would be the other way around.
Similarly, to insist that what happened in Egypt was not a coup would leave the door open for the military to depose any ruler it feels has lost sufficient political legitimacy; even if you think the generals got it right this time around, will you still agree next time?
Flash back to February 2011, when cheering crowds received the news that President Hosni Mubarak was leaving office. It wasn't until several months later that observers started to wonder if it had really been a revolution that had toppled Mubarak, or a military coup. Their resignation, after all, had been announced by one of the top generals who soon took interim rule. Tanks had been in the streets. Were events primarily driven by popular will, as expressed by thousands or millions of protesters, or by the powerful military?
That distinction is not much more obvious today than it was then. And, unless something changes in the Egyptian political culture that allows one part of the country to see two dramatically different versions of the same event, it's a distinction they may end up revisiting.
In case you need another reason to wear a safety harness in the deer stand, here's one.
This guy was testing their climber treestand, and decided to forego a safety harness – Spoiler alert: he's going to end up regretting that by the end of this video:
A safety harness could safe your life. As you just saw in this video posted by I Love To Hunt, it only takes a split second for the worst to happen, so it pays to be prepared!
Even if you're just testing a new treestand and only plan on being up there for a few moments, always strap on a safety harness! It takes no time to come crashing down, and that's a ride you don't want to be on. . .

The age of consent in Brazil is 14, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, with a judicial precedent showing that a close-in-age exception that allows those aged 12 and 13 to engage in sexual activity with partners who are 5 years older or less is legal, although not constitutionally formalized.[1] The age at which there are no restrictions for sexual activities is 18. In any case, only individuals aged 18 or older can be legally charged, as this is the Brazilian age of criminal responsibility according to the Constitution of Brazil.[2]
Sexual acts with children younger than 14 are strictly illegal, and equivalent to statutory rape, and are legally defined by Article 217-A of the Brazilian Penal Code as the "rape of a vulnerable person," with a penalty of 8 to 15 years in prison.[3]
The prostitution of minors, under 18, is punished by Brazilian law and is prosecuted by the State, according to the Statute of Child and Youth of 1990 (Article 244-A),[4] as well as according to the Penal Code of the country in the Articles 218-B, 227, 230, 231 and 231-A.[5]
The law makes no distinctions between sexual orientation cases. As such, both heterosexual and homosexual activity between an adult older than 18 and a minor aged 14 or older or between two adolescents aged 12 and 17 are completely legal, if the older partner does not play an authority role over the minor.

Britain is to give £1bn over three years to The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Justine Greening has announced at the United Nations in New York.
The international development secretary said the investment showed Britain was leading the way and claimed Britain's contribution would save a life every three minutes.
The Global Fund was created in 2002 as a public-private partnership to raise funds to significantly change the course of HIV/Aids, TB and malaria. The UK is the third largest donor, after the US and France.
Speaking at the UN general assembly meeting, Greening said: "Aids, TB and malaria are among the world's biggest killers despite being entirely preventable and treatable.
"The Global Fund has already helped save millions of lives but we must keep up the momentum if we are to beat these diseases for good.
"It is in all our interests to help people live longer, healthier, more productive lives so we all need to play our part in working towards a world free of HIV/Aids, malaria and TB."
Britain will become the fund's second largest contributor once the new raft of cash has been added.
The £1bn investment will fund lifesaving anti-retroviral therapy for 750,000 people living with HIV, 32 million more insecticide-treated nets to prevent the transmission of malaria and TB treatment for more than a million people.
Bono, co-founder of the ONE campaign, said: "The UK's pledge of up to a billion pounds for the fight against aids, TB and malaria means what once seemed impossible could now be within our grasp.
"Through this smart investment in one of the most effective disease-fighting funds in history, we could witness the defeat of these global killers in our lifetime.
"David Cameron and Justine Greening have given us a billion reasons to believe we can do it, but Britain's pledge will only be delivered if others step up too. Australia, Canada, Germany: your move."
Woman takes banking giant NAB to court over alleged fraudulent loans
Updated
A Brisbane woman is taking on one of the nation's biggest banks in the Supreme Court, alleging its deceptive conduct has left them financially ruined.
Key points: Leith Williamson alleges NAB allowed their former partner to secure loans in their name
The loans are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars
Ms Williamson says they were not aware of the loans
Leith Williamson alleges the National Australia Bank (NAB) allowed their former partner to secure hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans in their name, as well as a bank guarantee using their home as security, without my knowledge.
The 58-year-old marketing consultant has spent four years trying to work out how debts approved by NAB for their former partner, real estate agent Phillip Waight, spiralled out of control.
In its statement of defence, the bank said it had not been able to find documents which contained a guarantee signed by Ms Williamson for a loan worth $320,000.
Ms Williamson said that was because the guarantee did not exist.
"Over an eight-month period, I was given so many excuses — 'they're in the mail, they're coming from a storage area' — by phone and by email I was given so many different excuses," Ms Williamson said.
In its defence submitted to the Brisbane Supreme Court, lawyers for NAB conceded that key paperwork could not be found.
"On a date that cannot be presently particularised as the documents cannot be located, Ms Williamson provided a guarantee … to Mr Waight … and signed an acknowledgement in their capacity as a guarantor for $320,000," the bank said.
NAB refers to other documents in its defence, which it said showed Ms Williamson was aware of all the financial decisions relating to their joint account with Mr Waight at all times.
But Ms Williamson said the documents sent to them prior to the case were fraudulent.
"The documents that they have presented me with I've never seen before, I've certainly never signed and I knew nothing about," Ms Williamson said.

Bank to 'continue to defend' case
NAB declined the ABC's request for an interview, but released a statement.
"As the matter is presently before the courts and to respect the privacy of all parties we are unable to comment on the specifics of the matter," the bank told the ABC.
"However NAB will continue to defend this matter. As always, NAB is willing to meet with the customer to discuss this matter."
Ms Williamson's former partner Phillip Waight told the ABC the case was really against NAB, and they were just listed as a second defendant.
Mr Waight said Ms Williamson was fully aware of the couple's finances at all times, and everything was above board, but they would not be interviewed.
In another twist to the case, Ms Williamson's elderly father, retired surgeon John Williamson, appears in some bank documents as the guarantor of the purchase of a luxury apartment under the names of Ms Williamson and Mr Waight.
Mr Williamson held one account with NAB, but said they were never involved in the purchase of the property.
However, they are listed as guarantor on a lending submission that Ms Williamson obtained after their case was examined by the Financial Ombudsman.
"It just indicates for my part, that the bank had used my details and my privacy to do what they wanted to do," Dr Williamson said.
Banks have 'bottomless pit of resources' to fight cases
Sydney University political economist Evan Jones has helped dozens of people with their grievances against banks.
"The past history is pretty depressing really," they said. "Most of the time, the banks have all the resources, and a bottomless pit of resources, and they'll pursue a victim to the last drop of their blood, basically."
Dr Jones has been supporting Ms Williamson and believes they have a strong case.
"She's done their homework, and as I keep emphasising, they have incriminating documentation: the NAB has failed to come up with anything substantial that runs contrary," Dr Jones said.
"The crucial element is they claimed they signed a guarantee, [but] they have no documentation, no documentation whatsoever."
Ms Williamson's case alleges the bank broke Australian Consumer Law by engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct when it allowed the lending to continue without my knowledge.
The case also argues the bank has failed to adhere to the Code of Banking Practice, because it did not behave as a "prudent lender".
Previous judgment said banking code 'legally binding'
The legally binding nature of the code has already been tested in court.
Lawyer Grant Walker from Madgwicks took NAB to court after one of their clients signed a loan guarantee that was not properly explained to him.
It's still incredibly difficult for consumers to take on the banks in litigation; you couldn't pick a worse litigant I don't think. Grant Walker, Lawyer
Mr Walker's team won the case, but NAB is appealing the judgment.
"It was an acknowledgement by the court that the Code of Banking Practice is legally binding, and that the obligations that the banks say that they will live up to, the court has now acknowledged that they should do that," Mr Walker told the ABC.
"This decision just shows that the consumers have one more string to their bow in ensuring the banks live up to those promises.
"It's still incredibly difficult for consumers to take on the banks in litigation; you couldn't pick a worse litigant I don't think."
Dr Jones said that previous court case was an important decision for Ms Williamson's case.
"Leith can leverage their specifics on the basis of those general propositions," they said.

The 8th Pulang Bagani Company-New People's Army carried out a series of counter-offensives against the operating troops of the 25th Infantry Battalion, punishing 11 fascist soldiers and seizing six firearms during a raid, an attritive action and an ambush on August 2, 4 and 5, 2016 in Monkayo town, Compostela Valley.
The NPA's punitive action is a just reprisal in the face of atrocities committed by the 25th IB combat soldiers such as ransacking of civilian houses and farms, mauling and intimidation of peasants and Lumads in Monkayo town since June. In fact, the notorious Army unit had not reduced the intensity of its combat-intel-psywar operations in the communities during GRP. Pres. Rodrigo Duterte's short-lived unilateral ceasefire last week.
The 8th PBC-NPA on August 2, neutralized Cpl. Castro, an intelligence operative of the 25thIB who was caught conducting combat intel operation in the communities of Brgy. Baylo, Monkayo. Seized from them were a 9mm caliber and .22 caliber pistols.Two days later, the Red fighters engaged a platoon of the 25th IB in Brgy. Pasian, Monkayo, killing two Army soldiers and wounding three others.
At around 7:30 this morning, August 5, the Red fighters successfully ambushed a company of the 25th IB in Sitio Inuburan, Brgy. Rizal, killing 5 AFP troops, seizing two M203 grenade launchers, one M4 rifles, Harris radios, and several other military hardware.
The 8th PBC's tactical counter-offensives against an abusive AFP unit in the peasant and Lumad villages should serve as a stern warning to other operating Army units in Southern Mindanao region. These AFP troops that are active in combat-intel-psywar operations in the countryside continue and remain to be legitimate targets of the Red Army.
The NPA Southern Mindanao Regional Operations Command has directed all Red fighters in the region to remain on alert status, intensify its base building and base defense work, expand its services in the guerilla bases and guerilla zones, punish AFP troops operating in civilian communities, and pursue revolutionary justice for the basic masses who are victims of repression and fascist abuses.
As it awaits positive development in the forthcoming peace negotiations between the GRP and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, the Red Army shall defend its ranks and the masses through armed offensives and counter-offensives, foil the AFP's treacherous and ruthless military operations, and remain committed in addressing the roots of the armed conflict.

German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (above) said this week in Homburg that the U.S. government threatened to cease sharing intelligence with Germany if Berlin offered asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden or otherwise arranged for them to travel to that country. “They told us they would stop notifying us of plots and other intelligence matters,” Gabriel said.
The vice chancellor delivered a speech in which they praised the journalists who worked on the Snowden archive, and then lamented the fact that Snowden was forced to seek refuge in “Vladimir Putin's autocratic Russia” because no other nation was willing and able to protect them from threats of imprisonment by the U.S. government (I was present at the event to receive an award). That prompted an audience member to interrupt their speech and yell out: “Why don't you bring them to Germany, then?”
There has been a sustained debate in Germany over whether to grant asylum to Snowden, and a major controversy arose last year when a Parliamentary Committee investigating NSA spying divided as to whether to bring Snowden to testify in person, and then narrowly refused at the behest of the Merkel government. In response to the audience interruption, Gabriel claimed that Germany would be legally obligated to extradite Snowden to the U.S. if they were on German soil.
Afterward, however, when I pressed the vice chancellor (who is also head of the Social Democratic Party, as well as the country's economy and energy minister) as to why the German government could not and would not offer Snowden asylum — which, under international law, negates the asylee's status as a fugitive — they told me that the U.S. government had aggressively threatened the Germans that if they did so, they would be “cut off” from all intelligence sharing. That would mean, if the threat were carried out, that the Americans would literally allow the German population to remain vulnerable to a brewing attack discovered by the Americans by withholding that information from their government.
This is not the first time the U.S. has purportedly threatened an allied government to withhold evidence of possible terror plots as punishment. In 2009, a British national, Binyam Mohamed, sued the U.K. government for complicity in their torture at Bagram and Guantánamo. The High Court ordered the U.K. government to provide Mohamed's lawyers with notes and other documents reflecting what the CIA told British intelligence agents about Mohamed's abuse.
In response, the U.K. government insisted that the High Court must reverse that ruling because the safety of British subjects would be endangered if the ruling stood. Their reasoning: the U.S. government had threatened the British that they would stop sharing intelligence, including evidence of terror plots, if they disclosed what the Americans had told them in confidence about Mohamed's treatment — even if the disclosure were ordered by the High Court as part of a lawsuit brought by a torture victim. British government lawyers even produced a letter from an unnamed Obama official laying out that threat.
In the Mohamed case, it is quite plausible that the purported “threat” was actually the byproduct of collaboration between the U.S. and U.K. governments, as it gave the British a weapon to try to scare the court into vacating its ruling: you're putting the lives of British subjects in danger by angering the Americans. In other words, it is quite conceivable that the British asked the Americans for a letter setting forth such a threat to enable them to bully the British court into reversing its disclosure order.
In the case of Germany, no government official has previously claimed that they were threatened by the U.S. as an excuse for turning their backs on Snowden, whose disclosures helped Germans as much as any population outside of the U.S. Pointing to such threats could help a German political official such as the vice chancellor justify what is otherwise an indefensible refusal to protect the NSA whistleblower from persecution at home, though it seems far more plausible — given far more extremist U.S. behavior in the Snowden case — that Gabriel's claims are accurate.
Nonetheless, one of two things is true: 1) the U.S. actually threatened Germany that it would refrain from notifying them of terrorist plots against German citizens and thus deliberately leave them vulnerable to violent attacks, or 2) some combination of high officials from the U.S. and/or German governments are invoking such fictitious threats in order to manipulate and scare the German public into believing that asylum for Snowden will endanger their lives. Both are obviously noteworthy, though it's hard to say which is worse.

A still from When We Rise. Image courtesy ABC
This Monday, Dustin Lance Black's highly anticipated miniseries, When We Rise, premieres on ABC. It follows the intersected lives of three LGBTQ activists—Cleve Jones (founder of the AIDS Memorial Quilt and mentee of Harvey Milk), Roma Guy (a women's rights and public health activist), and Ken Jones (a black community organizer who struggles with their race, religious upbringing, and military background)—from 1972 to near-present day.
It's a massive undertaking, eight hours of television in all, that joins a canon of recent media projects seeking to enshrine stories from the gay rights movement. Black's thoughtful approach, however—from where it airs to how it hits keynotes—represents something new and different.
Black wrote Milk, the 2008 biopic of San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk, one of the most influential LGBTQ activists in American history. Their screenplay won an Oscar and elevated them to new prominence within the industry; after receiving post-Milk offers to write something epic for premium and cable networks (with more time and money), they elected to work with ABC—a television network long known for its family-friendly programming. Placing the series on the network was a deliberate move to reach an America less likely to already know the stories they adapt; "it would've been preaching to the choir" to place it with a premium cable channel, as Black said at a press screening of the first episode in New York this week.
It's a savvy strategy to break through in the age of Facebook bubbles and fake news, and a counter to some notable recent LGBTQ media offerings that have been too limited (and liberal) in their release. The Normal Heart featured out actors B.D. Wong, Jonathan Groff, Matt Bomer and more, but it aired on HBO, a premium network not known for its middle American reach. Tangerine, an indie project that cast trans performers as its trans main characters, was a breakout success after grossing seven times its $100,000 budget—but $700,000 is still a drop in the box office bucket. And this year's Moonlight has been nominated for eight Oscars, but its widest release was 1,104 theaters, compared to La La Land's 3,236. In a way, Black's series is a doubling down on ABC's other recent LGBTQ series win—The Real O'Neals, a sitcom which places out actor Noah Galvin as the gay son of a catholic Chicago family. If viewers can swallow that, perhaps they'll be ready for a dose of real history.
If they are, what they'll encounter is a cast studded with faces both familiar and not, who elevate the stories they tell to occasionally resounding heights. The passion and authenticity of the series' secondary actors often overshadows its main characters and biggest stars (Guy Pearce, Mary Louise Parker, and Michael K. Williams). To see Whoopi Goldberg—someone who saw the gay rights movement evolve firsthand—play Pat Norman, the first openly gay employee of the San Francisco Health Department, is a joy. Actors early in their careers, like trans actores Alexandra Grey as Seville and Ivory Aquino as Cecila Chung, light up the screen.
The series is most powerful in its first half, when the barriers to equality and efforts to dismantle them portrayed are more unknown, such as the fight against Prop 6 (a 1978 measure that would have prevented LGBTQ people and allies from working in schools in California). These episodes are also darker, as the shift from early wins is juxtaposed with the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic. Shots of San Francisco in the 1970s and 80s and AIDS-induced panic feel distant but also familiar, and lend the first half of the series an urgency that feels eerie and nascent. There are memorable cameos from queer performers; the first episode, directed by Gus Van Sant (who also directed Milk), features actors like Rosie O'Donnell (playing Del Martin, co-founder of the first lesbian organization in the country) and David Hyde Pierce (Cleve Jones' father), and even showcases Charlie Carver—a popular out actor among the Instagram generation. What results is eight hours of TV that feel authentic, even when subplots or dialogue, as often happens in limited series, seem like plot devices
Spanning almost half a century, When We Rise is most successful in reinforcing its central theme—that progress requires unity. The "we" in the series title is emphasized in several pivotal monologues, used not only to reinforce the connection between every corner of the LGBTQ community, but between minorities and majorities, political insiders and outsiders, activists and allies. From early tensions between gay men and lesbians to parallels between the fight for universal healthcare (and its impact on undocumented immigrants) and marriage equality, each story ladders up to a history lesson that means something. The series is emotional, but it's also actionable, in the sense that the narrative provides a blueprint for progress.
And it's impossible to watch this series without contextualizing it within our present cultural and political landscape. In fact, in the middle of its New York screening, news broke that President Trump had lifted federal protections for transgender student bathroom use—another sign that the next four years portend assaults on less privileged subsets of the LGBTQ community, and that we must heed that call for unity more than ever.
Trump's Congressional address will be broadcast this Tuesday, disrupting ABC's original plan to air the four part series consecutively, Monday through Thursday. Black, frustrated but reassured in their decision to sign with ABC, said the network will aggressively promote it during the address. Should Tuesday's promos draw a contingent of Trump supporters, that itself will mean it is a resounding success.
At times, When We Rise feels too much like an adaptation of a textbook, in that it sometimes seems like it's trying to cover too much history. But one can't help feeling like those who made it would wear that like a badge. In our age of alternative facts, real stories about real people who have been directly impacted by discrimination and marginalization are more vital than ever. Different kinds of stories will resonate with different viewers, but for those who watch, any erosion of LGBTQ rights to come over the next few years will be met with the recognition that it was once worse—and that only by embracing myriad meanings of the word "we" did it ever get better.

Image caption The band played Glastonbury two weeks after releasing OK Computer
Thom Yorke says they nearly walked off stage during Radiohead's headline performance at Glastonbury in 1997.
The show, which took place just two weeks after the release of OK Computer, was beset by technical problems.
During the encore, Yorke told the audience "all the speakers have been blowing up and stuff", before thanking them for their patience.
Speaking to BBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt, they revealed they had been on the verge of abandoning the performance.
"At one point I just went over to Ed [O'Brien, guitarist]. I tapped them on the shoulder and said, 'I'm off mate, see you later,'" they told Everitt.
"He turned around and went, 'If you do, you'll probably live the rest of your life regretting it.'
"I went, 'Good point.'"

Although the band were disappointed by the technical aspects of the show, fans and television viewers barely noticed. Q Magazine once named it the best gig of all time, while Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis lists it among their top five sets from the festival, calling the band's performance "very, very moving".
Speaking to 6 Music, Yorke admitted they had been against playing the show from the outset.
"I'd burnt myself out," they said. "We had a meeting about what we were going to do for the shows and I was like, 'I can't do Glastonbury'.
"I just needed a break. And in fact I didn't get one for another year and a bit, by which point I was pretty much catatonic."
The full interview will be available on the BBC 6 Music website this Sunday, 11 June. The station will then broadcast the interview at 13:00 BST on Sunday, 25 June.

Radiohead return to headline the Pyramid Stage for a third time later this month, on the 20th anniversary of the release of OK Computer.
The band recently announced a limited edition box set of the album, which will contain copies of Yorke's notebook from the era.
The singer said they had thought they were lost until recently, when they turned up in a box in the band's office.
It was "fascinating" going through the pages, they said, "and making friends with whoever this nutter was".
"Oh my God," they laughed, describing "pages where [I thought], 'Seriously, mate, you need to take a break'".
'This is my job'
Among the pages are "30 or 40 different versions of Paranoid Android", the album's ambitious, multi-faceted lead single.
Yorke described how they spent days "endlessly writing out and re-writing" the lyrics.
"I'd only change like five words. It was like a meditation," they said.
"Underlying this, for me, was the sense that I didn't have a real job, but this was work and my notebooks at the time were my point of focus - pulling everything together, whether it was ideas about arrangements, or observations or random drawings.
"It was like, 'I have a job. This is my job'. Which is nuts, but that's how I dealt with the fact… There was a bit of guilt involved."

FRIDAY BUZZ COLUMN
In many ways, former Hurricanes football stars are a huge asset for the program, because of their popularity (which helps the brand), how passionately many of them care, and the positive, albeit indirect, impact they provide in recruiting. (For example: Promising first-year student receiver Lawrence Cager said one reason they picked UM was because of the tradition of great receivers, mentioning Andre Johnson specifically.)
But dealing with former Hurricanes standouts can be tricky for this UM administration, because some would like two things that UM might not be willing to give: an important role in this ongoing coaching search and sideline access during games.
As WINZ's Andy Slater reported, several former players – including Bryant McKinnie, Edgerrin James and Jonathan Vilma --- held a conference call to discuss a possible role in helping select the next coach.
Two other former players who were on that call told me there have been multiple conference calls (including one on Tuesday) and a bunch of former players involved, and that the group (led by Vilma) would like two former UM players – one on offense, one on defense – to be included in interviews with coaching candidates.
“Some coaches can fool business people, but we might be able to see through them during the interview,” said one ex-player partaking in the calls, who said they were not authorized to speak publicly and that former players in the Vilma-led group have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements. “We have insight on schemes, offensively and defensively, and have a perspective on who can identify with players, that business people in suits might not have. Why not tap into that resource?”
That former UM standout said players, on the conference calls, have discussed which players would be best to recommend participating in those interviews and which coaching candidates make the most sense. The player said there is considerable ex-player support for Butch Davis, but some also like Mario Cristobal and Greg Schiano.
Another player on the call said: “We want more input from here on out, not just with the coaching search.”
One player on the call said there has been contact between a member of the group and athletic director Blake James. But it remains to be seen if James allows one of them to sit in coaching interviews --- which would be highly unusual.
James declined to address that or discuss the Vilma-led group, saying only that there will be “some type of communication” with former players seeking involvement.
McKinnie, who (like Vilma) declined to say anything about any conference calls or their possible involvement, told our Susan Miller Degnan: “Keeping players connected to the university requires them having a little bit of input [in the hiring process]… Letting the players have a little voice helps in all phases. Just give a little insight on different things the program may need. Just be an extra voice on things that maybe the program isn't aware of that we look at differently because a lot of us are fresh out of playing.”
Former Heisman Trophy winner Gino Torretta said “it would be wise to have them involved, a view former defensive lineman William Joseph also conveyed to us. “There should be at least one to sit in on interviews with the head coach,” Torretta said.
Some other UM people are also in favor of this. Attorney Alan Bell, a member of the UM president's council and chairperson of the Environmental Health Foundation, said former UM players "need a voice and need to they heard in this process. They are the most fertile pipeline to the NFL in the U.S. and bring a wealth of loyalty, talent and vision to the table."
Meanwhile, several players also have been vocal about their desire to gain access on the sidelines during games, something UM once permitted but stopped allowing after the Nevin Shapiro investigation.
UM said it prohibited donors, former players and Trustee members from the sidelines “as part of action taken in response to the NCAA investigation and major infractions case.” UM instead gives two complimentary suite tickets to all former players for every game.
But Torretta said their presence is missed on the sideline.
“It's not that we're going to coach those guys on the sideline,” they said. “I remember Bernie Kosar walking by with just a couple words of advice. We're not coaching, but it puts it in the back of your head. The coaches can't do that. Everyone else seems to have them on the sideline. We need them. USC has a certain number of passes it uses for former players. Why aren't we?”

### Even when the Dolphins deem DeVante Parker healthy enough to contribute, here's the conundrum: How do you create a lot of snaps for them when Miami is pleased with Jarvis Landry, Rishard Matthews and Kenny Stills and plays its fourth receiver just a few snaps a game?
“When DeVante was healthy in the spring, we had great confidence in their ability to contribute this year,” offensive coordinator Bill Lazor said Thursday. “I don't know if we've seen them as healthy [any time] this year. Probably not.”
### Incidentally, the Dolphins have not approached Matthews, an impending free agent, about a new contract.
### Though the Dolphins want to increase the role of one rookie defensive draft pick (cornerback Bobby McCain), defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo said there are no plans to do that with second-round tackle Jordan Phillips, who has two sacks. They're sticking with starter Earl Mitchell.
Anarumo said Phillips is “at the right number” of snaps – 17 per game, on average. One NFC scout wondered why Miami doesn't play veteran tackle CJ Mosley more with Ndamukong Suh, considering they played well together in Detroit.
### McCain told me has has received first-team snaps this week. Dan Campbell said the rookie will play on the boundary Sunday, sharing time with Jamar Taylor opposite Brent Grimes.
### After two of their snaps sailed out of the end zone for safeties the past two weeks, even Mike Pouncey's neighbor in Davie “told me, ‘Don't do it again!'” Pouncey said, smiling. “I feel I let the team down. It hasn't happened in practice. I'm shocked it happened in the game. [Against Buffalo], it was too fast for [Ryan Tannehill] to catch.”
### Unlike Joe Philbin, Al Golden is keeping in touch with many of their former players. They texted a bunch of them the day after the funeral for Artie Burns' mother last week, just to see how they're doing.
Considering how fans castigated him, it's no surprise Golden fled South Florida and put their home up for sale two days after being fired. If you're Golden, who wants to live in a place where people are calling a local merchandise store (allCanes) asking for orange ties so they can dress up like Golden on Halloween?
### More good work tonight from Chris Bosh (25 points, 8 rebounds, 4 blocks); they entered fourth among all power forwards in scoring and tied for second in rebounding (behind Kevin Love). And Bosh continues to do some of their best work alongside four reserves.
### If Hassan Whiteside keeps playing like this (he's first in the NBA in blocks, fourth in field goal percentage and sixth in rebounds), they might command something within a few million of a $22 million max salary next season, considering that much of the league will have tens of millions of cap space. It takes only one to pay them a fortune, and remember this is a league where teams pay a ton for bigs who can walk and chew gum at the same time (the Knicks will pay Robin Lopez more than $13 million next season).
Here's the good contractual news: Unlike with Whiteside, Tyler Johnson will be a restricted free agent (not unrestricted) next summer, allowing the Heat to match other offers. Under the Gilbert Arenas rule, no team can offer Johnson more than the equivalent of the $6 million mid-level exception next season.
The good news is that Miami can exceed the cap to sign Johnson, provided their salary begins at no more than 104.5 percent of the NBA's average salary of just over $6 million. And there's no reason to start Johnson above that amount, because other teams can't offer even that, let alone more than that.
Conversely, Whiteside's salary -- which will start well above that amount -- would count against the cap, meaning the Heat cannot exceed the cap to re-sign him.
### UM basketball season begins Friday, and ESPN's Dick Vitale said this looks like an NCAA Tournament team: “They will be good; they will defend and they have good guard play.”

In 2015 Kate Steinle was gunned down by an illegal alien in San Francisco - a sanctuary city.
The man charged with their murder was a seven-time felon who had been deported five times. Five times.
Click here to join the fight to restore traditional American values – by getting a copy of Todd's new book, “The Deplorables' Guide to Making America Great Again.”
There was an immigration hold on the suspect, but San Francisco authorities set the man free. Just a few months later, Miss Steinle would be dead.
Kate Steinle's blood is not only on the hands of their killer - but it's also on the hands of San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee.
It's beyond belief that liberal mayors are allowing illegal aliens to run wild in the streets of American cities - terrorizing law-abiding citizens.
So Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to punish sanctuary cities is welcome news. On Monday they announced plans to withhold billions of dollars in federal money from any city that harbors illegals.
Not only do these policies endanger lives of every American, just last May the Department of Justice inspector general found that these policies also violate federal law,” Sessions said. “The president has rightly said disregard for law must end.”
But I believe the Trump Administration should go a step further. If an illegal commits a felony crime in a sanctuary city - the mayor of that city should also face criminal charges – from harboring fugitives to aiding and abetting.
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee defiantly declared Monday on Twitter that “#SanctuaryCities are safer, more productive, healthier places to live.”
Tell that to Kate Steinle's family.
The attorney general rightly said that failing to report aliens who are “convicted of criminal offenses put whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators.”
Countless Americans would be alive today if sanctuary cities were shut down. Kate Steinle would be alive today.

In their book Brewing Better Beer, the great Gordon Strong likens roasted grains (roasted barley, black patent, chocolate malt, etc.) to coffee, explaining the temperatures at which they're roasted are high enough to denature any enzymes, meaning they do not need to be mashed. Not only is mashing roasted grains and malts unnecessary, but Strong adds it “can lead to harsher, more astringent flavors in the finished beer.” They do mention this is to some degree dependent on water chemistry, though concludes, “regardless, the dark grains are exposed to the most heat during this method, and that can lead to a harsher bitterness in the finished beer.” Strong goes on to discuss different methods for using roasted grains and malts such that these undesirable characters are avoided, one of which involves adding the roasted grains to the mash toward the end of the saccharification rest, a technique referred to by many as capping the mash. In the book, Strong suggests adding the milled roasted grains at mashout then performing a recirculated vorlauf, effectively treating them like coffee in a drip machine. Obviously written from the perspective of a fly sparge brewer not wanting to disturb the grain bed, many modern homebrewers have adapted this method for batch sparge, no sparge, and BIAB and report similar results by stirring the roasted grains into the mash during the last 10 or so minutes of the rest.
I was first inspired to try this capped mash method after my scoresheets for a Dry Stout competition contained the words “astringent” and “acrid.” To me, the subsequent batches were good, maybe even less astringent and acrid, so I adopted this method without much consideration, convinced it was improving the quality of my Brown Ale, Porter, and Stout.
Of course, bias may have (absolutely did) played a role in my perception, so when my desire for a low ABV roast-heavy beer began to creep up, I knew exactly which variable it'd be used to investigate!
| PURPOSE |
To evaluate the differences between a Stout where the roasted grains were included in the entire mash and one where the roasted grains were added in the last 10 minutes of the mash, during the vorlauf step.
| METHODS |
Curious how rye character might play with roasted grains and looking to get a bit more body than flaked barley usually imparts, I designed a simple Stout with a twist.
dRye Stout
Recipe Details Batch Size Boil Time IBU SRM Est. OG Est. FG ABV 5.3 gal 60 min 36.7 IBUs 36.0 SRM 1.039 1.008 4.1 % Actuals 1.039 1.011 3.7 % Fermentables Name Amount % Pale Malt, Maris Otter 5 lbs 58.82 Barley, Flaked 1.25 lbs 14.71 Rye Malt 1.25 lbs 14.71 Roasted Barley (Simpsons) 1 lbs 11.76 Hops Name Amount Time Use Form Alpha % Magnum 20 g 45 min Boil Pellet 11.2 Fuggles 30 g 10 min Boil Pellet 5.2 Miscs Name Amount Time Use Type Calcium Chloride 3.00 g 60 min Mash Water Agent Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate) 1.50 g 60 min Mash Water Agent Yeast Name Lab Attenuation Temperature San Diego Super Yeast (WLP090) White Labs 80% 65°F - 68°F
While a certain Irish strain of yeast is a popular choice for this style of beer, I wanted to see how one of my go-to yeasts would perform and built up a large starter of WLP090 San Diego Super Yeast a couple days before brewing.
Since I would be performing two separate mashes, which I staggered the start of by about 20 minutes, I went with the no sparge method and collected the full volume of brewing liquor for each 5 gallon batch.
As the water for the first batch was heating, I collected and milled the grains, holding back the roasted barley from the capped mash batch to crush on its own.
With the grain milled and water hot, it was time to mash in. Despite the 1 lbs difference in grain weight between the mashed and capped batches, the strike temp was very similar and both mash temps were consistent.
The hour-long saccharification rests commenced.
Approximately 15 minutes into each mash, I took pH readings and found my expectations were met. Wort from the batch with the roasted barley, known to increase mash acidity, was at a low 5.0 pH while the capped mash wort was at a perfect 5.3 pH.
About 15 minutes after collecting the sweet wort from the full mash batch, as it was coming to a boil, I “capped” the other mash with the roasted barley previously reserved and gave it a good stir.
After 10 minutes and 2 more brief stirs, I collected the sweet wort from the capped mash and brought it to a boil next to the already boiling full mash wort.
Both worts were boiled for 60 minutes, quickly chilled, racked to 6 gallon PET carboys, then placed in my temp controlled chamber where they sat for about 2 hours before reaching my target fermentation temperature of 66˚F/19˚C. The yeast was then equally split and pitched. I returned 18 hours later to find the beers fermenting as expected.
Besides the capped mash beer having a slightly paler kräusen, fermentation for both beers was observably similar. I took an initial FG measurement about a week after pitching the yeast, it matched the hydrometer reading 2 days later that showed the full mash beer had finished slightly higher than the capped mash batch.
The beers were then crashed for a couple of days then kegged and left to carbonate in my keezer for a few more days before being served to participants.
By data gathering time, both beers were looking awful nice, though their color was noticeably different.
| RESULTS |
A total of 22 BJCP judges, experienced homebrewers, and craft beer lovers participated in this xBmt. Each person was served 3 samples in different colored paper cups, 1 from the full mash batch and 2 from the capped mash batch, then asked to select the different beer. To reach statistical significance with this sample size, 11 participants (p<0.05) would have had to accurately select the full mash sample as being unique. Exactly 11 (p=0.049) made the correct selection, suggesting tasters were reliably able to distinguish between a beer made with roasted barley included in the full mash from one where the roasted barley was added during the last 10 minutes of the mash.
The 11 participants who made the correct selection on the triangle test were asked to complete a brief evaluation comparing only the 2 different beers, remaining blind to the nature of the xBmt. Overall 5 of the tasters preferred the full mash beer, 4 liked the capped mash beer more, and 2 had no particular preference. The independent variable was revealed and participants were offered an explanation as to how this technique is purported to impact the beer, then they were asked to select the sample they thought was produced using the capped mash method. A majority of 7 tasters accurately chose the cup containing the capped mash beer, while only 3 made the wrong selection. However, nearly all of those who made the proper selection said it had little do with astringency differences, which was not overtly noted by anyone, but rather the full mash beer was described as being “more flavorful, fuller flavor, less watery.” Interesting.
My Impressions: In 4 semi-blind triangle tests, I was able to accurately select the odd-beer-out three times, which meets my own private reliability standards. I experienced the full mash beer as being fuller in flavor and mouthfeel with a more rounded overall Stout character, while the capped mash beer actually came across to me as more astringent. Weird, I know, especially since I wasn't the only one who experienced them this way. Curious what might be causing this perceived difference, I took a pH reading of the finished beers, fully expecting to see a difference similar to that observed when measuring the mash pH. I poured off small amounts of each beer and let them warm to 65˚F before proceeding.
Imagine my surprise when the full mash beer clocked in just .03 pH lower than the capped mash beer, within what I'd guess is a reasonable margin of error. Maybe this is to be expected, I've no clue and I'm nowhere near smart enough to understand how this happens, but at the very least it tells me any perceived differences likely weren't a function of pH.
| DISCUSSION |
I trust (hope) I'm not the only one who feels uncomfortable settling on any conclusions based on a single point of data, particularly given the fact 1 response could have swayed the outcome. Either way, based on my biased experience and the results from this xBmt, I'm compelled to accept the capping the mash method may not necessarily have the impact I previously thought. Since I preferred the full mash beer, that's what I'll be sticking with for now, not because I think it'll have some drastic impact on the quality of my beers, but mostly because it's simpler. As with most of these xBmts, especially the first iterations, much more investigation is required in order to make any solid determinations, something I absolutely look forward to doing.

Matt Kepnes, Nomadic Matt “You will always have some reason to stay at home. You will always be able to find an excuse as to why today just isn't the right day. But the idea that the stars will align and you'll find the perfect day to step out of your door and into the world is a fantasy.”
I have two weeks to decide whether I am going to quit my job and travel or if I will accept a promotion and commit to staying another year. Proposing to work part-time and remote for my current team = fail. Proposing to stay on until business school interview season is over = fail. There might be an option somewhere in the company, but right now, the decision is to commit to a year, and accept a promotion, or nothing. And “nothing” leaves me job hunting, at least temporary or part-time/remote job hunting, with the freedom to explore long-term travel throughout the next year.
I've been waking up with a swelling of anxiety just settled so naturally in my chest. My brain is on overdrive, constantly replaying the options – and the consequences. Emotions, ha. They're roaming wild, if you will. I had prepared myself for this scenario, this decision. I thought through all of the options and the possibilities. I got comfortable with the back-up plan – save up enough or work while I travel – but travel, of course, is what I want to do.
It seems as if, when you're chasing a dream, dreams test you. Dreams will throw the questions back in your face and force you to answer them. Dreams make you play your own game of survival of the fittest. Are you determined enough to chase this dream? Is this something you really dream or just think you want? What are you willing to sacrifice to chase this dream?
A good friend, in conversation about the dilemma I'm facing, said to me, I know you'll do the right thing for you.
I know the right thing for now-me, but what about future-me? Am I screwing over future-me or am I about to create memories that without, she'll always regret? Now-me is terrified of not having a job for a few months. Now-me is sure, however, that they can figure that out. We can find the money. But what will future-me think? Will they think, man, I should have taken that promotion? Or will they think, taking time to travel has changed my life for the better and I would never give that up?
I'm insecure about looking flakey and non-committed. Am I not gritty enough to stick around? I don't like disappointing others right now, I'm not feeling confident in my ability to make the right decisions for future-me. Where did that confidence go? I had it two months ago when I was making these plans. Now it's decision-time and I can't find it anywhere. I'm wishy-washy and back-and-forth and cannot say yes or no.
Maybe that's what dreams do. They put you to the test. They shake your confidence. They make you question yourself. They place now-you against future-you. But isn't it supposed to be terrifying when you're chasing a dream? I just wrote about finding solace – where is that damn solace?
I've told myself, my values are what will guide my decisions. This has been a year of discovering and defining what those really are. But, I've defined my values this year alongside a deep desire to travel. What if I've let my desire travel influence how I've defined them? What came first – the values or the travel? How do I let them guide me if maybe they're too influenced by my desired outcome?
To the travelers who have all had to make a tough decision, give something up, make the final call to chase their travel dream, I ask you:
The Alberta government is announcing changes to its electricity market that it says will ensure a stable source of power as it takes coal-fired power plants off-line by 2030.
The decision to move from the existing deregulated energy-only system introduced 20 years ago to what's known as a capacity market was recommended by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO). The government wants to start making the transition in 2021 with the first auction taking place in 2024,
In the meantime, consumer prices will be capped at 6.8 cent per kilowatt-hour over that four-year period to protect them from volatility during the transition. However, once the new system is in place, consumers are not expected to see higher prices.
As Alberta closes down coal-fired plants over the next 14 years, the AESO is concerned that the province won't have a stable source of electricity, a problem affecting jurisdictions around the world as they take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
After consulting with power companies and investors, the AESO learned they are reluctant to invest in an energy-only system.
"System reliability will be compromised," the report states. "The current EOM (energy-only market) structure will not ensure the investment in new generation that Alberta will need in the future.
"Therefore the AESO has concluded that Alberta must adopt a different electricity structure to meet its objectives for the electricity system."
AESO determined the capacity market model was the best. Investors like it, and it is familiar to the electricity providers.
Dawn Farrell, president and CEO of TransAlta said this will make it easier for their company to invest.
"The fact that we now have this capacity market really enables us to convert some of our coal plants to gas, keep our workers working, keep our communities strong and be able to provide capacity to the system as we go through the decades so it's good news from that perspective," they said.
More predictability
Under the existing energy-only system, power companies pay for the cost of infrastructure through the sale of electricity to consumers so they take on all the risk.
This system relies on the principle of supply and demand. Higher prices indicate the system is under-capacity, and serve as a trigger for companies to consider building new plants.
Under the capacity system used throughout the U.S. and the United Kingdom, companies will get two streams of revenue — money from the sale of electricity, and money received from a competitive auction that would cover the costs of building new infrastructure.
Stakeholders interviewed by the AESO preferred this model because it provides them with more predictability.
Wildrose electricity and renewables critic Don MacIntyre said it comes as no surprise companies like the capacity model, but it isn't what's best for Alberta taxpayers.
"It shifts the entire burden of risk off of their investors' shoulders and onto my shoulders and yours," they said. "Well of course they're in favour of it. Furthermore, their profit is going to be guaranteed."
Alberta needs more than $20 billion of new infrastructure over the next 14 years. The government wants 30 per cent of that generation to come from renewable energy sources.
The remaining generation could come from natural gas, hydro and geothermal generation, which are considered more stable because they can generate energy on demand.
AESO said the recommendation to change to a capacity market has nothing to do with the change in government.
Work on transitioning to the new system will start next month.
Anybody tired of the "polar vortex" yet? No? Excellent, because it's returning soon with all its tail-whipping winds and freezing temperatures as low as 35 degrees below average.
The expected timetable for the vortex – a name that's not technically accurate in many cases – is that the cold will arrive in the Midwest this weekend and in the following days paint the South and East with misery. If anybody wants to shoot the messenger, although please don't, consult this prognostication yesterday from the Weather Underground's Jeff Masters. Here's part of it:
Temperatures 20°F below normal will likely invade the Upper Midwest on Sunday, and gradually spread southeastwards during the week. The peak cold is predicted to occur late next week, with temperatures 20 - 35° below normal covering much of the eastern 2/3 of the country. As a result of these new model runs, the natural gas market has been soaring ever since early this morning, and is now approaching a five-year high of $6.
That five-year high had been topped as of Wednesday afternoon, with prices soaring to $6.25. That's understandable considering that in the past month, only 4 days have reportedly had below-average demand for natural gas in the United States.
The final majority report of the Benghazi Select Committee is set to be released later Tuesday morning. Representatives Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo have signed onto the official majority document and authored a supplemental, 51-page "additional views" report of their own.
Among the most interesting aspects of their "additional views" is a timeline that contrasts the story top Obama administration officials were telling in public with the very different story some of those same officials were sharing with one another in private emails, conversations and documents. The timeline reinforces in a compelling way what will be one of the most significant takeaways from the committee investigation: The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes and its consequences.

9/12—Public Statements
Secretary Clinton's Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya morning of September 12, 2012:
"We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet."
9/12—Private Statements
Summary of Discussion between Acting Assistant Secretary Beth Jones and Libyan Ambassador Aujali at 9:45 a.m.:
"I told them that the group that conducted the attacks—Ansar Al Sharia—is affiliated with Islamic extremists."
Jacob Sullivan in e-mail to embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan:
"There was not really violence in Egypt [and] "we are not saying that the violence in Libya erupted 'over inflammatory videos.'"
Secretary Clinton's Statements to Egyptian Prime Minister Kandil at 3:04 p.m.:
" We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest. . . . Based on the information we saw today we believe the group that claimed responsibility for this was affiliated with al Qaeda."
Under Secretary Patrick Kennedy to congressional staff briefing:
When asked whether "this [was] an attack under the cover of a protest" Kennedy said, "No the attack was a direct breaching attack." More to the point, they were then asked whether "we believe [this was] coordinated with [the] Cairo [protests] to which Kennedy responded, "Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint."
9/13—Public Statements
Secretary Clinton's Morocco Remarks:
"I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries. * * *
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence. * * *
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to shed blood and take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions. . . .
***
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat. And even though that tragedy happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco to the United States."
9/13—Private Statements
Summary of call between State Department Deputy Secretary Thomas Nides and Egyptian ambassador to U.S.:
"Nides said they understood the difference between the targeted attack in Libya and the way the protest escalated in Egypt."
9/14—Public Statements
White House Spokesman Jay Carney during press conference answering question about Benghazi:
"We have no information to suggest that it was a preplanned attack. The unrest we've seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims, many Muslims find offensive. And while the violence is reprehensible and unjustified, it is not a reaction to the 9/11 anniversary that we know of, or to U.S. policy."
E-mail from White House Advisor Benjamin Rhodes:
Under heading "Goals" they wrote "To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy[.]"
Return of remains ceremony statement to father of Tyrone Woods recorded in diary:
"I gave Hillary a hug and shook their hand, and they said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son."
Return of remains ceremony statement to mother of Sean Smith:
"We were nose-to-nose at the coffin ceremony. They told me it was the fault of the video. I said 'are you sure?' They says 'yes, that's what it was . . . it was the video.'" 9/14—Private Statements
E-mail from State Department press officer in embassy in Tripoli, Libya: "Colleagues, I mentioned to Andy this morning, and want to share with all of you, our view at Embassy Tripoli that we must be cautious in our local messaging with regard to the inflammatory film trailer, adapting it to Libyan conditions. . . . Relatively few [Facebook comments and tweets] have even mentioned the inflammatory video. So if we post messaging about the video specifically, we may draw unwanted attention to it. And it is becoming increasingly clear that the series of events in Benghazi was much more terrorist attack than a protest which escalated into violence. It is our opinion that in our messaging, we want to distinguish, not conflate, the events in other countries with this well-planned attack by militant extremists. I have discussed this with Charge Hicks and they share PAS's view."
9/15—Public Statements
President's Weekly Address titled "Carrying on the Work of Our Fallen Heroes" muddles Benghazi and protests in other countries:
"This tragic attack takes place at a time of turmoil and protest in many different countries. I have made it clear that the United States has a profound respect for people of all faiths. We stand for religious freedom. And we reject the denigration of any religion – including Islam."

"But we don't see at this point signs this was a coordinated plan, premeditated attack."
9/16—Private Statements
Excerpt from Embassy Tripoli Media Report September 16, 2012: "[T]here is evidence that suggests that the second confrontation at the UM mission's safe house could not have happened without insider knowledge or some degree of organization. This goes against statements that the attacks were not carried out by a single group but by an angry multitude protesting[.]"
9/17—Public Statements
Excerpt from State Department Daily Press Briefing:
"Ambassador Rice, in their comments on every network over the weekend, was very clear, very precise, about what our initial assessment of what happened is. . . . I don't have anything to give you beyond that."

Excerpt from e-mail discussion between members of NEA press office about what to say about attack:
NEA Press Officer Suggested the following language:
"The currently available information suggests the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests of the US Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault[.]"
Senior Libya Desk Officer, Near Eastern Affairs Bureau responding to suggested language:
"I really hope this was revised. I don't think we should go on the record on this."
9/18—Public Statements
Excerpt from White House Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney:
. . . I would point you to what Ambassador Rice said and others have said about what we know thus far about the video and its influence on the protests that occurred in Cairo, in Benghazi and elsewhere."
9/18—Private Statements
Deputy Director of CIA Michael Morell in written statement to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence:
"The critically important point is that the analysts considered this a terrorist attack from the very beginning."
E-mail exchange between State Department security officers commenting on news article titled "White House sees no sign Libya attack premeditated":
DS Agent #30: "Can you believe this?"
DS Agent: "Was there any rioting in Benghazi reported prior to the attack?"
DS Agent #30: "Zip, nothing nada"
9/19—Public Statements
From "ALDAC"—a worldwide cable—from Secretary Clinton to all U.S. Embassies drafted by Deputy Chief of Staff Jacob Sullivan:
"Since September 11, 2012, there have been widespread protests and violence against U.S. and some other diplomatic posts across the Muslim world. The proximate cause of the violence was the release by individuals in the United States of the video trailer for a film that many Muslims find offensive. Diplomatic compounds have been breached in several countries including Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen. In Benghazi, Libya four U.S. personnel were killed in the violence[.]"
The administration, including Secretary Clinton, knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack—from witness accounts, from their understanding of the history of violence in Benghazi, and from the nature of the well-planned, complex attack. Yet, they led the public to believe the video and a protest were to blame in Benghazi.
9/20—Public Statements
Excerpt from interview of the President on Univision Town Hall:
In response to the question, "We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?" the President answered, "[W]e're still doing an investigation[.] . . . What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests[.]"
Secretary Clinton has since blamed their statements on changing information received from U.S. intelligence reports. They and others have claimed that the 10:08 p.m. statement was not meant to ascribe a motive to the attack. Yet, Sullivan knew the morning of September 12th—based on the press release from the embassy in Kabul—that people had heard it exactly that way. Moreover, whether or not the intelligence information changed, Secretary Clinton's public and private statements remained unchanged—publicly tying Benghazi and Cairo together and privately recognizing the violence in Benghazi was a terrorist attack with nothing to do with a protest or video.
Moreover, to the extent any intelligence analysis incorrectly reported on a protest or a video in connection with Benghazi, Secretary Clinton and other State officials, who knew better, simply ignored them. As just one example, in their conversation September 15, 2012 with the president of Libya, Secretary Clinton made no mention of anything in the CIA talking points that administration officials later claimed were the best assessment available at the time, and those talking points made no mention of a video in connection with Benghazi. In short, Secretary Clinton and the administration knew better than to rely on flawed intelligence reports. Intelligence assessments may have changed. News reports may have changed. But the eye witness accounts remained same—and not one said a protest had occurred. Yet, once Secretary Clinton and Ben Rhodes set the message, the truth became an afterthought.
Investigations into the murder of a Scotiabank branch manager in Mexico led to the discovery of frauds totaling millions of dollars that implicated numerous Mexican bank employees and executives, CBC's the fifth estate has learned.
Though this story has been reported in Mexico, there has been virtually no media coverage of the murder or fraud investigations in Canada.
After the body of branch manager Maru Oropesa was found in a roadside ditch outside Mexico City in 2001, Scotiabank executives in Toronto sent bank investigators to Mexico.
They soon discovered that Oropesa was involved in a $5-million fraud with their former boss, Scotiabank executive Jaime Ross.
As the investigation expanded, agents uncovered about $14 million missing from Scotiabank accounts in Mexico and a total of 16 employees involved at almost all levels of the bank – including a cashier, a manager and a vice-president.
The $5-million taken by Ross and Oropesa was eventually traced to the United States, where the money had been used to purchase three planes. Ross was charged with fraud and money laundering, and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
But the fifth estate has uncovered new evidence linking Ross to the murder of Oropesa, their former colleague. Mexican cell phone records show that Ross's phone made or received 38 calls between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Sept. 28, 2001 in an area near where Oropesa's body was found the following morning.
Mexican police did not investigate Ross' involvement in their death, but they remain behind bars for fraud.
The 16 other Scotiabank employees found to be involved in fraud were never prosecuted – instead, they were fired.
The former Mexican prosecutor told Bob McKeown, host of the fifth estate, that in cases of financial crime against a bank, they could not press charges against bank employees unless the bank itself filed a criminal complaint specifically naming them.
But those 16 bank staff may be some of the most likely witnesses, or even possible suspects, for Oropesa's murder, according to private investigator Paul Ciolino.
“There's so much motivation to kill them by these people that it's ridiculous not to look at them closely,” they said.
Scotiabank, which is headquartered in Toronto, has the biggest international presence of any Canadian bank, with 3,000 branches in 55 countries.
The company's vice president of communications, Diane Flanagan, told McKeown that the bank had done everything possible to solve the case.
“I can assure you that if we felt there was any indication there could've been a conviction or further information provided to the authorities that would've helped with a conviction, we absolutely would have turned that information over,” they say.
In an apparent miscalculation, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions Peter Anderson SessionsGOP House super PAC targets two first-year student Dems with new ads Top 10 events of 2018 that shaped marijuana policy Washington braces for lengthy shutdown MORE (R-Texas) claimed Tuesday that ObamaCare will cost $5 million per person.
Precisely how Sessions arrived at that calculation during House floor debate on the budget is unclear. Sessions cited an overall estimate from House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) that ObamaCare will cost $108 billion, though they acknowledged it was not exact.

"One of the questions I asked them yesterday was, Mr. Price, how much does the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare, cost the taxpayer in the budget? They said, you know, I don't know, but I'll get back to you. By the end of the hearing they said, what they could figure, $108 billion. $108 billion. Now, I had not checked this out. And in fairness to Tom Price, he's allowed to go and double check everything. That was a cursory view," Sessions said.
Sessions then suggested that one could calculate the cost of ObamaCare per person by dividing $108 billion by 12 million, an estimate of the number of people receiving insurance through the healthcare law. They cited the 12 million figures from Rep. Louise Slaughter Dorothy (Louise) Louise SlaughterNew York New Members 2019 Democrats see hypocrisy in GOP attacks on ‘liberal mob' Poll: Dem leads by 24 points in race to replace Louise Slaughter MORE (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee.
"If that's true, and if I accept the figures that the gentlewoman, the ranking member of the committee, said of the number of people who are on ObamaCare, Affordable Care Act, about 12 [million]. If you just do simple multiplication, 12 million into $108 billion, we're talking literally every single recipient would be costing this government more than $5 million per person for their insurance. It's staggering," Sessions said.
"If it really is true that everybody that is on this Affordable Care Act, that the true cost, cost to the taxpayer, is over $5 million for each person, then shame on us. For not knowing, asking, and understanding," Sessions added.
However, $108 billion divided by 12 million is only $9,000. Sessions was not reading from notes as they spoke on the floor.
Politifact recently debunked a claim from Fox News host and analyst Stuart Varney that ObamaCare will cost $50,000 per enrollee. Experts told Politifact that estimating the cost per person cannot be derived simply by dividing the overall cost from an average number of newly insured people.
Slaughter immediately dismissed the $5 million claim.
"Nobody ever paid $5 million for anybody's health care in a single year. It's the most atrocious thing I think I've heard on this floor," Slaughter said.
The New York Democrat mocked the mathematical error as House Republicans began debate on their budget for the next fiscal year.
"Mr. and Ms. America, these are the people you've entrusted your Congress to. They're the people who are writing your budget," Slaughter said.
Like many great women in the world, I have a younger sister who is just dazzling. Them hair cascades in golden rivers down their back. Them orbish, water-blue eyes look as though they have been enlarged with very convincing computer technology. And they somehow managed to skirt that pubescent complication of limbs that are much too long and heavy for the body.
However, unlike many of the great women of the world whose younger sisters have their own private suns to follow them around and shed beams of heavenly light on them, I enjoy a wonderful privilege: a decade-sized age gap between my sister and me. We do not compete for the same boys, prizes, and attention. I never have to hear that she's the prettier sister. They never borrows my clothes and looks better in them. So I just get to think she's great.
They also think I'm great, which is nice. From the moment they could understand that we were related, they wanted to do everything just like me. They even spent several years trying to convince our entire family that their hair was brown, just like mine, and not the honey-blond color that it actually is. That was cute.
Recently, though, they asked me about my modeling career. How I have both awaited and dreaded this day!—While on the one hand I finally have an apprentice unto whom I can bestow my wealth of knowledge on make-up, hair, and home skin-care remedies (I also have three brothers, and for whatever reason, none of these things interest them), on the other hand I have to face a living, moving, sometimes unruly responsibility to communicate to my one and only sister the place of these rituals in life. Outward beauty is not everything, dear sister, and of all things, modeling taught me that.
Of course, she's interested in modeling because I did it, and in those enormous eyes of theirs I can do no wrong; but she's also interested because, like the rest of us mortal women, they get that familiar, if not completely explicable, surge somewhere in their ribcage whenever they look at a particularly alluring or provocative ad sporting a model in all their flawless, bored glory. Models are arguably the most brilliant marketing strategy of all time — all it takes is one look at a model and deep inside the average woman the tribal gongs resonate and she, the woman, hears the frequency of their heart click into place with that pounding, ethereal beauty, and this message dances over the cosmic wires, as clearly as if it came through the telephone:
I am strong.
I am beautiful.
I am perfection.
I can have fun.
I am in control.
Well, my sister—I am here to break that frequency, and kill the myth within you. It is a great privilege to be a woman, a privilege that includes grace and mystery and—let's just say it—beauty. But beauty isn't found where fashion shows and lipstick commercials tell you it is. In fact, that message about strength and beauty and perfection is horribly distorted. Let me tell you why.
I am strong. This part of the message is born, I am convinced, from the heavy bass-beat that soundtracks the runway. Music taps into even our most buried emotions. It's just part of the job description of humanness.
But in real life (and models do have real lives outside of the catwalk), there is no soundtrack. Off the runway, even the most stunning models stumble along to their own, sometimes broken, beats; they walk into Starbucks and their heels get caught in the cobblestones outside and they scrounge for change at the counter and they are just normal people. No heavy bass, no tribal gongs.
The part of a model's life that is presented to the public, chosen for them by a series of experts who have carefully studied marketing, and by extension, human longing, is so small, it probably couldn't even be expressed in a written fraction. Those few concentrated moments onstage are what make them captivating; they are undiluted by the heel-in-the-cobblestone moments only they know they have. Anyone would feel powerful marching down a long stage to techno music—but that's only a ninety-second snippet of the model's actual life. A paper clipping, really. A model feels about as strong as the next girl when their car stalls on a dark and dusty road, or when their bank account creeps closer and closer to zero. Modeling is classic lying by omission: it looks good at first glance, but it doesn't show the whole picture. Being pretty on the outside doesn't make a girl strong on the inside.
I am beautiful. I almost don't even know where to begin on this one. Not touching on how beauty is in the eye of the beholder, or how beauty is an evolving standard, I am going to narrow my scope to the immediate and empirical facts: This part is not much of a lie. Models are beautiful.
When they're modeling.
The real message of a model—when they are modeling—is, You would be beautiful if you had what I have. Why? Because when a model is modeling, they are not modeling herself; they are modeling a product. Models are props, mere pieces in a bigger game. Those experts who have studied marketing and human desire?—are tuning in to that frequency I already mentioned in the heartstrings, that part of us that wants to be connected and connects itself to the human aspect of any ad campaign — the human, the model. It is no coincidence that we want what we see models have — what they have and look so good having. We're set up for that.
When I used to tell people I was a model, I would see the muscles in their faces spasm—in fact, their faces almost seemed to get wider—and this comprehending expression would pass over them, like, “Ah, yes—you are beautiful! I don't know how I missed it before.” As if the stated fact that I modeled placed me in some elite, untouchable minority, even though just seeing me out in the daylight didn't do that for them.
Models do not roll out of bed looking strong and beautiful. They roll out of bed looking like Thanksgiving turkey on the morning after, with all the stuffing on the outside, just like everyone else. Their beauty is about position, and perception. Sometimes when I'm looking at a magazine ad or watching a commercial I ask myself: if I saw this chick sitting outside at a café, and they stuck their gum to the bottom of the table, would I still think they were beautiful?
And the answer is almost exclusively: probably not.
I am perfection. Maybe the actual words here are not, “I am perfection,” but “I have arrived.” How shall I explain this?
When Adam took the apple from Eve and God looked down and said, “Oh, you're going to toil now, buddy,” thousands of years of manual labor ensued. Ever since, we've been trying to catch up. And some small part of us within knows that our lives would be so much easier if we didn't have to toil so much all the time. (Okay, maybe it's not such a small part… and maybe it's not buried so deep below the surface, either.)
So we work and we work and we work, forever believing if we can just make it to our next paycheck, or just grow our bangs out, or just learn the violin or find the perfect push-up bra, then everything will be okay; our friends and family will see the beauty and confidence and strength we had all along, and we will have arrived.
A model makes a golden calf (to continue with the Biblical imagery) of that goal. They have everything they need: the music egging them on as they prowl the catwalk, the beauty radiating out them every pore, and whatever material extension they might require to be seen, to be the person everyone in the room wants or wants to be. And if all that is attainable for her, maybe it's attainable for the rest of us, too. Like the other lies, though, this message does not reflect reality. If we buy the purse or mascara or hair dye she's selling, in six months, the purse will be worn-in and the clasp will be broken, the tube of mascara will have run dry, and our roots will be three inches long. Life is all catching up. One does not arrive. One shows up, catches the show, and takes an early bus home to get some rest before doing it all again tomorrow. That's reality.
I can have fun. I wish I could remember whether it was Tom Welling or Ashton Kutcher (I feel like it was Tom Welling) that I saw in a clothing ad from before they were famous, and they were playing basketball in the picture and being clobbered by all these girls. They looked ecstatic. The unwritten message of the ad was, Can't you picture yourself having this much fun? The marketing person behind that ad no doubt knew that if the answer was yes, the viewer of the ad was already picturing him- or themselves wearing the same kinds of clothing as the people in the picture who were having the time of their lives. Brilliant. It's the reason shopping from a catalog is so much easier than shopping in a store. No florescent lights, and I can see how the clothing is supposed to make me look, the kind of life it can offer me? I honestly don't know why anyone shops in a store.
Truth be told, though, as a former model I know getting that picture was probably a mother of a job. Modeling is brutal enough when you get to sit still—but an action shot? Puh-lease. No one went home happy that day. Let me put it this way. When I look back on my three years of modeling, I gape at myself. I was so young, so impressionable—I don't know how I survived. The people in the industry are ferocious. Once, I saw a camera guy make a stinky-cheese face at a six-year-old kid at a commercial audition and say, “Braces? What's with the braces?” and proceed to tell the kid's mother that they were wasting everyone's time; no one wants to see a commercial with a kid who wears braces.
And they aren't even the meanest guy I ever encountered. With that in mind, when I look at ads like the Welling/Kutcher ad, where everyone is beaming and having a jolly ol' time, I wonder how many of those models went home and cried that day. I mean, maybe they genuinely did have a good time. Maybe the cameraman told those chilluns to just have fun, and they somehow got lucky and caught a shot where all their faces line up perfectly and none of them was feeling lame or at all competitive so everyone was smiling and high on life. It's possible.
Really. I mean, who's to say?
I am in control. This is the biggest myth of them all, because it covers all the other myths in one broad, egotistical stroke. What is perhaps the one thing that everyone in the world wants? …I don't mean love. Although that is true. I guess technically it could be related, too, to the thing I do mean, but it is not the thing I mean. The thing I mean is control. I didn't always think this was true. I didn't think of myself as wanting control because when I heard “control” I thought of some dictatorship sort of scenario, like I wanted world domination, the power to start a war or conclude the entire earth's story with the push of a red button under the desk.
But I had a revelation when one day in my head I saw my life as a giant game of whack-a-mole. All these little problems kept popping up, and at first, I was able to whack them all back down again. But then they started popping up faster, and more than one at a time, and suddenly I found myself wishing (in a totally normal, not at all weird way) that I could be like that chick in India who was born with the extra arms, because at least they would be able to keep up with all the whacking.
Since then I've found that the more out of control I feel, the more susceptible I am to models and their evil marketing schemes. I see their perfect lives—their perfect teeth, their perfect hair, their amazing clothes that they wear like, What, this old thing?—and I want what they have. The strength, the beauty, the confidence, the fun, the control.
But whatever they're selling—that's not where beauty and strength come from. I would never in a million years tell anyone, let alone my sister, whom I've eagerly waited to show interest in makeup and boys and the whole shebang, that a little daily primp is evil; that a little retail therapy now and then will never help anything, that a slightly shorter skirt (not so short that they can't sit, of course) won't help them the way they want in certain situations, or that there do not exist in the universe any practical, aesthetic tips to help along the way to feeling and being both sexy and fun. That would be just plumb false. And rotten. I'd be a terrible sister. Worst sister of the year.
But it's a slippery slope. If one gives into a little primp, a little retail therapy, a little hemming of the skirt, too often, then the game of whack-a-mole becomes all the keeping up one tries to do to remain outwardly beautiful, and that's no good.
Beauty is not about what is on the outside. Although it helps to take care of the outside. The most beautiful traits are the timeless ones. I mean, I have a painter friend who looks a little like a genetic collage of Jesus and that Muppet—what's their name?—Animal. And they act like they look. Very wise, very philosophical; but also sometimes very loud and nonsensical, all over the place, though not in a floppy, fish-out-of-water way. More like a frantic squirrel on Redbull sort of way. And he's the life of every party because of it. He's mesmerizing. This guy will tell a story—made-up or true—and people have to listen. To every word. I actually slap my knee when I laugh at their stories, because I'm so out of breath and my cheeks hurt so much and there's nothing left to do but—slap my knee. And he's never going to grow out of that. Their ways are never going to go out of style. That's not beauty in the traditional sense of the word, but it pulses. Almost like they do have their own soundtrack.
Wouldn't you rather be like that? This is my question for my sister, for every woman—for every person, for that matter. Wouldn't you rather that your beauty came from knowing who you are and being yourself and not trying to be like some model whom you've never even met? Some model who, away from the camera, trips over cobblestones and breaks down on dark roads and probably has to go in for an agonizing bikini wax every two to three weeks?
I know I would.
That's why I don't model anymore. Being a model wasn't the life I thought it would be. It taught me a lot, but it wasn't a life of playing basketball with Tom Welling and Ashton Kutcher, and walking my saucy walk down a runway all the time. It was a lot of psychological torment, a lot of crying, a lot of tearing my hair out, trying to be something I was not. There are so many more things to focus on in life than looking good, on being up on all the latest trends. I find much more satisfaction in chasing real dreams, like publishing a book one day, owning a home, opening a café. When I look in the mirror now, I'm happy with what I see. And the more I live this way, the more I see beauty in people in ways that have nothing to do with the way they look. It's a good life.
It's a beautiful life. A beautiful, real life.

February 25, 2015 - Yosemite National Park is planning a prescribed fire in the Wawona area, near the South Entrance. The fire is planned for tomorrow, Thursday, February 26, 2015 and will include 533 acres. The first segment of the burn will consist of 60 acres. The completion of the remaining 473 acres will occur throughout the month of March, weather dependent, concluding no later than Monday, March 30, 2015.
The prescribed fire is scheduled to occur just prior to precipitation in the Yosemite area. The burn area does not have a history of prescribed fire treatment on record. However, 200 feet of understory vegetation has previously been thinned to facilitate the use of the road as a fuel break.
The primary objective of the prescribed fire is to reduce hazardous vegetation (fuel) around the community of Wawona. The project will also help protect park infrastructure at the South Entrance Station and reduce the threat of wildfires originating along the Wawona Road that could adversely impact the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. Through this burn, a continuous fuel break will be created between the community of Wawona and the South Entrance, linking multiple previous fires, including prescribed fires and thinning projects.
Further objectives of the project include ecosystem restoration. Prescribed fires mimic the frequent, low intensity lightning caused fires that occur naturally in the Yosemite area. Historically, natural fire burned an average of 16,000 acres annually in Yosemite. These fires played an integral role in shaping Yosemite's ecosystem. In the absence of fire, unnatural levels of forest fuel can accumulate, placing Yosemite's natural and cultural values at risk.
During active burning, smoke may be present along the Wawona Road and in the community of Wawona. Fire managers are working with the Mariposa County Air Pollution District (MCAPCD) to time the project to coincide with favorable weather that will facilitate good air quality, and disperse smoke into the atmosphere away from the community. Prior to ignition, smoke monitoring equipment will be installed in the community and a burn permit will be issued to the park by MCAPCD.
Visitors and employees are urged to drive with caution as firefighters, fire equipment, smoke, and debris may be present along the roadway.
Fire crews from the National Park Service, CAL FIRE, and the U.S. Forest Service are assisting in this prescribed fire.

More men are raped in the US than women, figures on prison assaults reveal
In 2008 it was estimated 216,000 inmates assaulted in detention
Four per cent of prisoners said they had been sexually abused in 2011
Department of Justice introducing regulations to tackle high rates of abuse
More men are raped in the U.S. than woman, according to figures that include sexual abuse in prisons.
In 2008, it was estimated 216,000 inmates were sexually assaulted while serving time, according to the Department of Justice figures.
That is compared to 90,479 rape cases outside of prison.
216,000 prisoners are raped per year in the U.S., compared to about 90,000 reported rapes outside prison
The Department for Justice has now begun implementing new regulations to tackle the high rates of rape in federal prisons.
In recent studies 4.5 per cent of 16 and 17-year-olds in adult prison and 4.7 per cent of those in jail reported being the victims of sexual abuse.
The new Department of Justice rape regulations include separating under 18s from adult prisoners.
However, some critics say that will leave many youngsters in virtual solitary confinement.
The new regulations also include banning male prison staff from doing pat-downs in women's prisons.
The rule changes have been brought in ten years after Congress passed the Prison Rape Elimination Act.
Under the terms of the act, all detention facilities are required to take a zero-tolerance approach to rape behind bars.
New regulations are being introduced at all detention facilities to tackle the number of rapes in prison
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN PRISON: THE SHOCKING STATISTICS
According to the latest National Inmate Survey, 4 per cent of prisoners, 3.2 per cent of people in jail and 9.5 per cent of those in juvenile detention said they had been the victim of sexual abuse. Almost seven per cent of women said they had been sexually abused by a fellow inmate, while more men said they had been assaulted by staff.
The National Survey of Youth in Custody found 4.5 per cent of juveniles held in adult prisons had been abused.
Those figures have prompted calls for all under 18s to be detained outside adult prisons.
Of the youngsters held in juvenile detention, 2.5 per cent of boys and girls and said they had been abused by fellow inmates.
Shockingly, more than 7 per cent of teenagers in juvenile detention said they had sexual contact with staff.
Figures published in the New York Review of Books
Procedures also must be put in place to investigate allegations of sexual assault and improve care for victims.
The report found incidents of women prison staff assaulting male prisoners.
States that do not implement the regulations will lose five per cent of their federal funding for prisons, US News reported.
They have also been warned they could face civil court cases from victims.
Separate figures produced by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that sexual abuse rates in juvenile detention were as high as 9.5 per cent in 2011 to 2012.
In the same year, four per cent of state and federal prisoners and 3.2 per cent of all people in jail surveyed said they had been a victim.
Study author Allen J. Beck told New York Review of Books that the work shows almost 200,000 were sexually abused in detention in 2011.
They said the figures are lower than those recorded in 2008 because fewer people are in prison.
High rates of abuse were found among gay, lesbian and mentally ill inmates and inmates who had been abused before incarceration.
According to official statistics on rape conviction rates, the U.S. Bureau of Justice said 91 per cent of the victims were women and 99 per cent of the perpetrators were men.
LONDON: India is among the countries ready to forge an "ambitious" new trading relationship with the UK after Britain leaves the European Union (EU), Prime Minister Theresa May has told the Parliament.In a statement in the House of Commons on the recently concluded G20 summit in Hamburg, May said that their meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi involved discussions on a wide range of issues, including tackling modern day slavery."At this summit, I held a number of meetings with other world leaders, all of whom made clear their strong desire to forge ambitious new bilateral trading relationships with the UK after Brexit. This included America, Japan, China and India," May said in their statement on Monday.In response to Opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn on the issue of striking new trade deals, they added: "I am very happy to tell them (Corbyn) that we are already working with the Americans on what a trade deal might look like. We already have a working group with the Australians, and we have a working group with India as well."We are working on trade in three areas. Obviously, one area is looking ahead to the trade agreements we can have with those countries we do not currently have them with as a member of the European Union."The second is ensuring that, where there are trade agreements with the EU, we are able to roll those forward as we leave the EU."The third area is working with countries such as India and Australia to discuss what changes we can make now, before we leave the EU, to improve our trade relationship."Labour MP Graham Jones asked May if they had raised the issue of modern day slavery and child prostitution in India during their meeting with Modi, to which they said that it was an issue "previously" raised with the Indian PM as the UK wants "people around the world to address it"."We are very clear that we want to see this issue being dealt with. That is one of the reasons why we have put into legislation the requirement for companies here in the UK, which will be manufacturing and will be sourcing products from around the world, to look at their supply chains and report on what they find in them and whether or not modern slavery is taking place within them," they told Parliament.Modi and May had held bilateral talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last week, during which the Indian leader had raised the issue of Indian economic offenders like liquor baron Vijay Mallya and former Indian Premier League chief Lalit Modi and sought the UK's cooperation in extraditing them to face the Indian courts.
Global Grand Challenges Summit
Exploring collaborative approaches to tackling global grand challenges
Venue: IET London: Savoy Place, London WC2R 0BL
Date: March 12-13 2013
On the 12-13 March 2013, over 450 leading engineers, artists, economists, designers, philosophers, scientists, politicians, industry leaders, educators and policymakers from across the globe gathered in London to attend the inaugural Global Grand Challenges Summit.
With the prosperity of future generations relying on unprecedented levels of inter-disciplinary and international cooperation in pursuit of solutions to the world's most pressing challenges, the Summit, organised by the Royal Academy of Engineering in partnership with the national engineering academies of the US and China, sought to provide a new global platform for the world's leading thinkers to share their ideas with the next generation of engineers on how to develop the international frameworks, tools and collaborations needed to solve our common global challenges.
The audience of the two-day event heard from panels of leading experts in six different sessions covering the themes of sustainability, health, education, enriching life, technology and growth and resilience. The Summit also included plenary addresses from Dr Craig Venter, Founder of J. Craig Venter institute and Bill Gates, Co-founder and trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and an additional surprise address from will.i.am on the need for new approaches to STEM education.
Speakers at the Summit included:
Professor Frances Arnold, Dick and Barbara Dickinson Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry at California Institute of Technology
Professor Dame Anne Dowling, Head of the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge
Professor Lord Darzi, Professor of Surgery at Imperial College London
Dr Regina Dugan, Senior Vice president of Motorola Mobility
Professor John Hennessy, President of Stanford University
Professor Calestous Juma, Professor of the Practice of International Development, Harvard Kennedy School
Dr Robert Langer, David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT
Dean Kamen, Founder of FIRST
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, Director of Earth Institute at Columbia University
Professor Helen Storey, Co-founder of Catalytic Clothing, and Professor of Fashion and Science at University of Arts London (LCF at Centre for Sustainable Fashion)
Dr Mike Lynch, Founder of Invoke Capital
Dr Li Yingtao, President of the 2012 Laboratories, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd
Two major new international collaborative research opportunities, dedicated to the pursuit of tackling global grand challenges, were also announced at the Summit. Representatives from eight top US universities, including Duke University, USC and MIT, announced the establishment of the new Vest scholarship program. The program, named after outgoing National Academy of Engineering (NAE) President Charles M. Vest, will give select international graduate students the opportunity to pursue potentially world-changing ideas at top US universities.
Sir John Parker, President of the Royal Academy of Engineering, also announced in their closing remarks a new £1-2 million joint international call from the EPSRC and the NSF, for proposals from UK and US research teams to work on tackling the grand challenge of providing clean water for all.

The American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) lost its oldest living member on Aug. 2, 2015, when Forrest Bird, MD, PhD, ScD, FAARC, passed away in Sagle, ID at the age of 94.
Dr. Forrest M. Bird
Dr. Bird is known the world over for inventing the first modern ventilator in the 1950s. The device saved thousands of lives and is responsible for laying the groundwork for the sophisticated computer controlled ventilators in use in hospitals across the country and around the world today.
“Dr. Bird was truly a pioneer in respiratory care and pulmonary medicine,” says Frank Salvatore, MBA, RRT, AARC President. “The respiratory therapy care community has been privileged to have known them as a fellow member and colleague.”
The legendary physician received numerous honors and awards for their life's work, including the Presidential Citizens Medal, National Medal of Technology and Innovation, and Lindbergh Award. They were inducted into the U.S. Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995.
Dr. Bird first became interested in mechanical ventilation when they served as a pilot during World War II. While flying a captured German plane back to the U.S. they noticed some demand regulators used to deliver oxygen to the pilots. After running some experiments on them during the flight they took one of the devices with them to California and began working on improvements, eventually presenting the results to physicians at the School of Aviation Medicine in San Antonio, TX.
That early work with mechanical ventilation in the aviation arena segued into an interest in the medical field and they built the Bird Mark 7, the first modern respirator for use in critically ill patients. In 1970, they introduced the Baby Bird®, a ventilator that's been credited with reducing the mortality rate for infants with respiratory problems from 70% to less than 10%.
Other innovations in mechanical ventilation followed, and throughout their long career they continued to add enhancements to their devices aimed at allowing the physicians and respiratory therapists who applied them at the bedside to save the lives of patients who otherwise would not have survived their critical illnesses or injuries.
“Respiratory therapists who provide mechanical ventilation to even the most difficult cases can trace that ability back to the work of Dr. Bird,” says Tom Kallstrom, MBA, RRT, AARC Executive Director and CEO. “We are truly grateful for the many years of advice and guidance they provided to our profession and organization as we worked to bring state-of-the-art mechanical ventilation techniques to patients in need.”
Dr. Bird established the Forrest M. Bird Lifetime Scientific Achievement Award with a grant to the American Respiratory Care Foundation (ARCF) in 1983 to recognize outstanding individual scientific contributions in the area of respiratory care of cardiopulmonary disorders. The award is presented during the AARC International Respiratory Convention & Exhibition.
The AARC honored Dr. Bird with its highest honor, the Jimmy A. Young Medal, in 2009.
Entire towns have vanished from the Southland.
The street grid of Morocco once stretched across the same gilded real estate occupied today by Beverly Hills. The ruins of a town named Minneapolis lie beneath Atwater Village. The independent city of Tropico melded with Glendale.
In an earlier age, geographic names were more ephemeral -- especially during boom years like those of the 1880s. Maps from that period, like this 1888 official county map, read as a catalog of failed real estate developments. Kenilworth. Studebaker. Nadeau. Gallatin. Clearwater.
Many of these settlements were never more than paper towns, existing only in the drawers of the county recorder's office. Between 1884 and 1888, developers platted more than 100 towns in Los Angeles County -- some on the fringes of established cities like Los Angeles and Pasadena, others on the open plains of former ranchos. Lots changed hands and fortunes were made, but few of the towns actually made an imprint on the landscape by the time boom turned to bust. (A few that succeeded: Burbank, Inglewood, Glendale.)

Though paper towns like Sunset and Morocco failed, later developments like Westwood and Beverly Hills, respectively, succeeded in their place. 1888 map courtesy of the Library of Congress.
In some cases, it's only the names that have perished; the towns survive to this day under new identities. That's true of Marian, which we know today as Reseda. The town of Ivanhoe became Silver Lake. Toluca was first renamed Lankershim, then North Hollywood.
There are ghost cities, too – once-independent communities swallowed up by larger municipalities, often losing their identities in the process. Most have heard of Eagle Rock, Hollywood, San Pedro, Sawtelle, Venice, Watts, and Wilmington -- all independent cities that eventually consolidated with Los Angeles. But there was also Hyde Park, which the metropolis absorbed in 1923, followed by Barnes City in 1927. Long Beach merged with Belmont Heights in 1909. And the city of Tropico, which incorporated in 1911, became part of Glendale in 1918.

New Zealand's Neil Wagner found attack the best form of defence during their short but breezy innings against South Africa in Pretoria.
Black Caps import Neil Wagner has been accused of lacking courage by South African cricket star Dale Steyn.
Pretoria-born Wagner has been a central figure in the second cricket test between New Zealand and South Africa in their former home city.
There seems to be more than a bit of niggle between Wagner and their former countrymen.
PHOTOSPORT Dale Steyn has a word to Neil Wagner after dismissing them in Pretoria.
Wagner collected five wickets with some fierce fast-paced bowling for New Zealand and was then, predictably, on the receiving end of something similar when the Black Caps scored a paltry 214 in reply to South Africa's massive first innings total of 481-8.

* Black Caps toss away initiative
Wagner's approach with the bat was to go out all guns blazing, cracking 31 off 30 balls coming in at No 10.
That included pasting Steyn for three fours and a six within five deliveries before Steyn had the final say, getting the lefthander caught behind.
Steyn suggested Wagner would have been better playing a supporting role with dogged skipper Kane Williamson who had a chance to post another century but was eventually last man out for 77.
"He backed away and slogged away ... maybe didn't back away but stood and played the pull shot," Steyn said of Wagner.
"But if they wanted to be more courageous and brave they would have been 30 off 90 and watched their captain get to 100 rather than score 31 and walk off the pitch and say I've done my job. That's not your job.
"He gives their all but I would have tried to hang out there and even get 10 of 50 balls and see Kane through to 100, rather than walk off with 30 and think I've done my job."
The Black Caps had South Africa 105-6 in their second innings but with an overall lead of 372 with two days to play, the Proteas are firmly in control.
Steyn certainly feels there will only be one result.
"The longer the sun bakes the wicket and we get our bats into the cracks and just widen them up a little bit, it's going to be more difficult to bat," they said.
Who would have been able to predict one year ago that crude oil's price, which had already plummeted between January, 2014 and January, 2015 from 110 to 50 dollars, will continue its going down and dip under the 30$ mark? Goldman Sachs maybe?
It is nevertheless what what arrived on Friday, January 15th for the first time in twelve years, oil prices has a big trough with the upcoming prospect of an imminent Iranian crude oil export surge , after the lifting of sanctions against Iran.
According to Wall Street Journal Iran is preparing to restart regular crude-oil shipments to the European Union possibly as early as February, Iranian officials said this week, despite a host of barriers to selling its petroleum to the West.
Iran's state-owned National Iranian Oil Co. is tentatively preparing a shipment of at least 1 million barrels of light crude to a Mediterranean port in the European Union around mid-February, an Iranian official said. It would be the first shipment to the EU since an embargo on Iranian oil was lifted last week as part of the end of western sanctions.
The preparations come as rivals like Russia and Saudi Arabia have been aggressively discounting their crude oil to Europe in a price war ahead of Iran's full return to the market. Both countries seized a greater share of the Iranian market after western countries tightened sanctions on Iran in 2012.
With sanctions lifted over the weekend, Iran has pledged 500,000 barrels a day of new crude exports in the next few months and 1 million barrels a day within a year.
Oil companies such as Total SA of France, Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Spain's Cepsa are in talks with Iran to buy crude.
OPEC's Urgent Meeting
OPEC is not due to meet until June 2, but the relentless fall in prices has renewed calls for an emergency meeting from the group's more cash-strapped members. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this week called for an emergency meeting to stabilize oil prices.
Venezuela has been calling for an emergency meeting to discuss steps to prop up prices, which are at their lowest since 2003. But Iran and Gulf members of the OPEC have been rebuffing Venezuela's push for a special meeting.
Reuters & Bloomberg report that Iran's oil minister said on Friday that any emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would hurt the crude oil market if it made no decision to shore up falling prices.
//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa, welcomed Maduro's call for an emergency meeting, said an OPEC output cut of 10% would help to stabilize prices.
So far, there has been no sign from Saudi Arabia that it is ready to abandon the market share strategy that it persuaded OPEC to adopt in November 2014.
Indeed, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi told an event in Riyadh last week that they were optimistic that world oil markets would stabilize, that oil prices would improve and that major producing countries would cooperate with each other.
When OPEC decided in late 2014 to defend its market share rather than reduce output, it maintained the 30 million b/d ceiling that had been in place since the beginning of 2012. At the group's recent meeting on December 4, however, ministers failed to agree on a ceiling level, thus removing the remaining notional constraint on freewheeling production.
Are we assisting in an oil war within Opec's members?
For Global Research, since the beginning of the fall in prices, Saudi Arabia announced that it would not cut production, which completely paralysed the traditional activities of OPEC in trying to control the market. From this point on, each statement of representatives of the monarchy pushed prices down. At the same time, Saudi Arabia itself ended the year with a budget deficit of 100 billion dollars, and the actual production for the last six months has decreased by 400 thousand barrels per day. This is about 4% of Saudi production.
Despite frequent official statements over the last four decades about the need to diversify the economy away from dependence on petroleum, Saudi Arabia's economic outlook remains bound up with the price of oil.
We attend an oil war. Saudi Arabia and some Gulf countries don't want to cut their production in order not to lose their market shares on the global crude oil market, and therefore they weaken other countries's production and revenues.
The Saudi strategy goes against the interests of the other OPEC actors. Besides, this reduction is less painful for the Saudi Arabia because the Saudi oil is profitable from 20 dollars the barrel. And even if this reduction digs the Saudi budget deficit (Riyadh recorded in 2015 a record of 89 billion euro budget deficit, , the country can rely on its colossal reserves of 650 billion dollars approximately, . It is the same thing for the other Gulf states that thanks to their important sovereign fund they could calm any social tensions.
But this strategy makes the situation very difficult for Saudi Arabia's rival countries as Venezuela, Algeria or Nigeria. For them it is terrible. These are countries that approximately the 90 % of their exports are based on oil or gas exports. In these countries, it is their whole economy that it will be affected by the price drop. They will be obloged to make some budget cuts and a very strong austerity. They can also play with their currencies to counterbalance the losses accordingly.
The oil for these countries is profitable only from 80 even 120 dollars the barrel. There is a total disconnection between the costs of extraction of the oil and the market price. Even Iran, which costs of extraction are 20 dollars the barrel per today, is going to meet some difficulties. Nonetheless, Russia, Norway and shale gas producer United States also undergo quite hard this bearish strategy which serves only Saudi Arabia.
In Algeria only its revenue generated by the oil and gas resources was reduced by 41%P in 2015, widening a commercial 13,71 billion dollar deficit (of about 12,55 billion euros), according to the Ministry of Finance published by local media this month.

Introduction
The house, located on a quiet, affluent street in the Peachtree Hills neighborhood of Buckhead, Atlanta, does not stand out. The comings and goings at 121 Ridgeland Way NE may not attract much neighborhood attention. However, this house is a hub for racist organizing not just for Atlanta, but for the South and arguably the country. It is owned by Sam Glasgow Dickson, a key player in the white nationalist movement. From this building, Dickson and their associates try to build the white power movement, especially its middle-class face. They also make moves in the Atlanta property market, both enriching themselves and building resources for their cause.
Our prior coverage of long-time white nationalist leader Sam Dickson includes a detailed article from last year on “Right-Wing Gentrification Gangs.” Apart from some background information and setting out Dickson's importance within the broader white nationalist movement, we will not duplicate that earlier material here. This article has two purposes. First, we are updating our earlier coverage of Dickson and their white power associates. Second, by setting out five names associated with the Ridgeland Way property in Buckhead, we aim to provide a more complete picture of what goes on at the space, and how this activity fits within the white nationalist movement regionally and nationally.

UPDATE - Here is a Follow Up of the Item to make it more accurate.
Today (9th April), Google has a new Doodle for Eadweard J. Muybridge's 182nd Birthday done with Javascript. I just thought of trying to implement the same concept in Pure CSS (as much as possible) and see how far I could go. So i gave it a try and this is what I have come up with (see demo in the live preview box).
If you see the demo, it is not accurate. When the player is clicked the animation starts suddenly unlike the original version where it starts slowly, (followed by a subtle rewind) and then it continues to play normally. If any of you can achieve the exact effect then just make a testcase at the playground and link in the comments. I'll make appropriate changes and also add proper credits.
I am still improving the item as much as I can, so it will keep on receiving frequent updates for sometime.
How has it been done ?
Every box in which you see a horse riding is a <div> with the background of a sprite that has the images for all the positions of the horse. The background position of the image is then changed with CSS3 Animations to animate the horse. One thing to notice here is the use of steps(12, end) as the animation-timing-function that makes it possible for the background position to change on the spot instead of animating by sliding left. This is a very interesting feature of CSS3 that most people don't know about yet! Mozilla Developer Network has an excellent article that explains the various timing functions.
The borders (grids) that you see is basically CSS borders set on the ::after pseudo element of the small divs. The pseudo elements also have box-shadow for the top and left shadows.
The player button is a <label> (with an image background) and <input type="radio"> . When the player is clicked (you basically click the label element), that checks the radio button. In the checked state, we use :checked pseudo class on the radio button with the general sibling selector - ~ to initiate the animation on the divs. The label element also has borders like the divs on it's ::after pseudo element.
The demo is best viewed in Webkit browsers (Chrome, Safari) or Firefox.
The concept, images, etc. all belongs to Google. I have just attempted to see how much of the Doodle could be achieved with only CSS3 with the least images (and no JS ofcourse).
Here is a list of all the Google Doodles of past.

Obama acknowledged that there would be glitches in getting the exchanges up and running, and even as they were speaking, administration officials were quietly telling key interest groups to expect initial problems signing up for coverage online. Small businesses initially will not be able to enroll online and will have to sign up by paper, and the Spanish-language version of the HealthCare.gov website will be not be ready to handle enrollments for a few weeks. An estimated 10 million Latinos are eligible for coverage.
The ACA faces a crucial test starting Tuesday, when uninsured Americans begin enrolling in exchanges through which they will be able to buy individual health insurance. Computer glitches are slowing the rollout in areas such as Colorado, Oregon and Washington, D.C.
"The Republican Party has just spun itself up around this issue," they said. "And the fact is, the Republicans' biggest fear at this point is not that the Affordable Care Act will fail. What they're worried about is it's going to succeed."
With polls showing many Americans still skeptical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), referred to by opponents as "Obamacare," the president went back to the basics of explaining how nearly 50 million uninsured Americans will be able to buy coverage in new government-run exchanges. At the same time, they mocked Republicans for trying to block its implementation. "The closer we get, the more desperate they get," Obama said.
With just five days to go before Americans can begin signing up for health care under their signature law, President Barack Obama on Thursday ridiculed Republican opponents for "crazy" doomsday predictions of the impact, and forecast that even those who didn't vote for them are going to enroll.
A greater concern
"Like any product launch, there are going to be some glitches," Obama told a crowd of about 1,800 people at Prince George's Community College in the Washington suburbs.
Their greater concern is preventing the ACA from getting ensnared in efforts by Republicans in Congress to defund it in exchange for their agreement to approve spending measures to keep the government running and extend the U.S. borrowing limit.
The president faces two critical deadlines. The federal government will be forced to shut down on Tuesday if a spending measure is not approved, and it will run out of money to pay its bills on Oct. 17 unless the debt ceiling is raised.
Obama said Republicans fear that Americans will come to like the health care law, depicting their strategy as "'We've got to shut this thing down before people find out that they like it.'"
They won loud applause from a friendly audience when they vowed they wouldn't let Republicans block the law. "We are going to see it through. The Affordable Care Act is here," Obama said.
The six-month enrollment period for the exchanges starts Tuesday, with consumers in most of the country able to comparison-shop between plans online. The Obama administration needs millions of Americans -- especially young, healthy people -- to sign up in order to keep costs low for everyone.
The White House said Prince George's County, Md., where the president was speaking, has a high rate of uninsured people, with about 16 percent of residents under 65 without insurance. Obama's audience was full of the young people they are targeting for enrollment.
Obama didn't call out any of their Republican opponents by name, but they laughingly taunted some of their arguments. They mentioned House Speaker John Boehner's prediction, right before the bill was signed into law in March 2010, that "Armageddon" was impending. They quoted Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, who said earlier this month that "Obamacare is the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress."
They cited Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's appeal to colleagues on the House floor six months ago to "repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens."
And they quoted New Hampshire state Rep. Bill O'Brien's declaration in August that the ACA is "a law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850." That was met by a chorus of gasps and boos from the largely black audience.
"Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave owners get their runaway slaves back," Obama said. "I mean, these are quotes. I'm not making this stuff up.
"All this would be funny if it wasn't so crazy," they said.

There's some very big news potentially coming out of the X-Men movie universe. Hot on the heels of this summer's X-Men: Apocalypse, Hitfix is reporting that two actores are about to be cast in New Mutants, which is being directed by Josh Boone: Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams and The Witch star Anya Taylor-Joy.
According to the site, Williams will be playing Wolfsbane, also known as Rahne Sinclair. Taylor-Joy will be Magik, also known as Illya Rasputin. They'll join a team that includes Storm, played by Alexandra Shipp; James McAvoy's Professor X is expected to appear as well.

Yet to be cast are actors to play Cannonball, Sunspot, and Mirage, which means Boone (best known for doing The Fault in Our Stars) is going with the traditional team up for the film.
Boone has been attached to New Mutants for a while but if he's now casting, it seems like it could be coming sooner rather than later. Though the Gambit movie was recently put on hold, after the success of Deadpool, the 20th Century Fox X-Universe is a good place to be.

Between 1700 and 1832 the City of London's liverymen voted annually in mayoral elections, at least 21 of which were contested. Nor was this active voting process confined to what is now the office of the Lord Mayor of the City of London (as opposed to the position of Mayor of London, created in 2000, which encompasses all of Greater London). Across 18th-century London there were elections of many different kinds. Voters chose their MPs in urban Middlesex as well as in Westminster, the City of London and Southwark. With their broad franchises, these four great constituencies contributed significantly to the ‘popular' element in Britain's constitution prior to the 1832 Reform Act. They were very different from the much derided ‘rotten' boroughs, where votes were controlled by aristocratic patrons.
Voters in the City of London, which housed some 15 per cent of the population of the capital in 1801, were particularly busy. They participated in annual elections not only for the mayoralty, but also for the posts of chamberlain, two sheriffs, two auditors and the aleconners (monitors). In addition, London's 26 wards also voted regularly for their aldermen, common councilmen and beadles.
Victories could be overwhelming. In 1786 William Wilson received over 1,000 votes when elected as Middlesex coroner; their defeated rival, Peregrine Phillips, got just 27. But in 1796 the contest for the largely honorific post of bridge master of London Bridge was tight. It was won with 1,516 votes by a printer, John William Galabin, who beat the second of the four candidates by a mere seven votes.
In this era of open voting the crowds who witnessed these elections could become very boisterous. In 1741 onlookers at the Westminster election threw ‘dirt, sticks, dead cats and dogs' at the candidates and the officiating clerks, who fled from the polling booths outside St Paul's Church in Covent Garden. Not surprisingly Parliament annulled the result after a protest from the losing side. Yet most of these metropolitan elections were orderly. Indeed, they were so routine that, lacking in notoriety, they became quietly forgotten.
Now, however, patient detective work among the dusty files of the 18th- and 19th-century press can reveal the impressive scale of voting in the years 1700 to 1850. There were at least 873 contested elections, both parliamentary and civic, across all of London's varied constituencies. That total amounts to just under six elections every year. More contests may yet remain to be discovered.
Participation in the electoral process – and, at a lesser level, the witnessing of such events – spread a constitutional culture of voting throughout 18th-century London. About a quarter of a million individuals polled half a million times, casting, in multi-member seats, a million votes. Each voter had the same political heft as any other, no matter how grand. It amounted to a constitutionalist or ‘proto-democratic' tradition, if not yet a fully democratic one.
Routines of voting were becoming familiarised in constituencies as well as in Parliament. In the City, members of the chartered companies voted annually to choose their company directors. In numerous parishes Anglican parishioners polled for their churchwardens, sextons, lecturers and even for their organists.
Of course there were many limitations. Throughout this period the electorate excluded women, because their interests were held to be represented by the votes of their husbands or fathers. Tough on spinsters living alone.
Broadly, the metropolitan voters before the 1832 Reform Act were drawn from the adult male rate-payers and City liverymen. They included the elite of merchants and bankers, but they also incorporated thousands of ‘middling' shopkeepers, manufacturers, professionals and service workers, as well as numerous poor rate-payers with plebeian occupations, such as labourers and street scavengers.
This active tradition of voting across London meant that, as the franchise was broadened in the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the new working class and women voters were joining a pre-existing civic process. Democracy was not just suddenly dumped upon them. Nor were elections confined to intermittent votes for Parliament.
London's upper- and middle-class voters already voted for their mayor in the 19th century. They were kept on the political alert by frequent elections for a range of civic and parliamentary posts, within local constituencies with which they were familiar. Politicians in Westminster today seem too prone to assume that democracy can be simply created or rearranged by central fiat. But, to work well, it needs to grow organically, with its roots in real communities.
The most flamboyant politician of 18th-century London was John Wilkes (1725-97), a flawed personality (often compared to Ken Livingstone). But they successfully asserted the ultimate power of the electors to decide who should win elections if the outcome is in doubt. It remains a key constitutional principle to this day. The electorate is supreme, even over the politicians. Vote for the mayor and then hold them or them to account.

The euphoria and pride felt by Niskayuna Rowing Club boys' coach Mike Gilbert Saturday after leading athletes they coached to a national championship proved to be short-lived.
Monday, Niskayuna Rowing program director Molly Grygiel informed Gilbert they longer was the coach of the boys' program.
"I got a text message (Monday) morning to turn in my keys," Gilbert said.
Tuesday, Gilbert held their final practice with the team.
"I said my goodbyes and they wanted to thank me for making them better rowers and better men," Gilbert said. "I told them, 'I will see you soon.' "
When contacted by the Times Union Tuesday, Grygiel declined comment.
Gilbert, who has been the coach for four years, was stunned by the move.
Saturday at the Scholastic Rowing Association of America Championships in Cherry Hill, N.J., the Niskayuna boys' junior quad team of Noah Chaskin, Liam McGrinder, Austin Dobson and Jack Lampman captured the national title with a time of 4 minutes, 48.081 seconds.
Adam Chaskin, the father of Noah and a former men's assistant basketball coach at Siena College, said, "I am thankful for the time Michael Gilbert put in with my son to help them develop into the world-class rower that they are. Not only did they win two of the biggest regattas in the country, they were invited this weekend to train with the national team this summer."
Unlike other high school sports, rowing is a varsity sport in spring and a club sport the rest of the year. Like other high school coaches, rowing coaches are approved on a yearly basis by the Niskayuna school board. Gilbert said the school board accepts the recommendations made by the Niskayuna Rowing Club's board of directors.
When pressed on why they were let go, Gilbert said Grygiel was acting on the wishes of the Niskayuna Rowing board of directors.
"There was no indication anything was awry," Gilbert said.
Gilbert's wife, Catherine, has also coached with the program, but took a break as the Gilberts have a three-month-old child.
Mike Gilbert said they previously informed Grygiel of their intention to take the summer off.
"I wanted to take a break for the summer and recharge the batteries. The response was turn in your keys and your credit card," Gilbert said. "At first, I thought they just wanted me to turn in my keys for the summer.
"I am sure it gave (the board of directors) a stepping-off point to spin it that, 'Mike wanted time off.' I believe it is a handful of disgruntled parents of freshmen, that would be my guess, who are steering the ship. The boys are not happy, as you can imagine. This is not the end of it, as you can imagine. They have a voice and will use it."
Gilbert said they did not see the move coming at all.
"There is a natural amount of struggle and friction involved with winning a national title. If it was easy, they would give them out to everybody," Gilbert said. "Some parents wondered why certain kids were in certain boats. That is the job of the coaches to do, and the job of the parents and kids to trust that the right thing is being done.
"It would be nice to say there is some wonderful formula for who goes in each boat. It is science, it is art, it is subjective at times and it is quantifiable at times."

Before their awakening at the hands of Zen master Mu-chou, Yun-men (864–949) had done more than ten years of meditation in addition to mastering the Vinaya school. They understood Buddhism in theory such as Mind-only and transcendental wisdom (prajnaparamita). But in all of this they were unable to achieve the illumination of Mind.
Compared with Yun-men's spiritual journey, the modern Zennist lacks not only the depth of a Yun-men before their awakening but, in addition, knows next to nothing about the illumination of mind of which the Buddha spoke of long ago. The only mind the modern Zennist knows is the monkey mind that chatters in their head and goes from one thing to another never satisfied. Their only goal is to suppress it—not transcend it or in the words of Zen master Fo-hsing T'ai (12th century), “know the opening beyond.”
The more the modern Zennist attends to their monkey mind trying to suppress it, the more unable they are to transcend it. It boils down to reifying a fantasy. Each time they attempt to suppress this mind, the stronger grows this monkey mind. But no matter how strong it becomes, it is still the monkey mind—not the Buddha Mind.
This condition reminds me a little of people who like to play fantasy role-playing games (my brother did this for many years). No matter how much these gamers invest in their fantasy characters, they will never be more than fantasy characters. But then the real goal of role-playing games is to have fun and socialize with friends. Although some gamers go beyond the real goal of role-playing games, by and large, they know what fantasy is.
The modern Zennist should know that their monkey mind needs to be transcended. In other words, they should be working earnestly on realizing the One Mind which is immaculate.
It happened 44 years ago. A 14-year-old Beatles fan named Jerry Levitan managed to sneak into John Lennon's Toronto hotel room and asked for an interview. And they got one. Now, there's a short animated film that brings that encounter back to life. I Met the Walrus was nominated for the 2008 Academy Award for Animated Short. You'll know why when you watch it. Another excellent find by Vickie.

The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, where I used to work, is gradually turning Title IX into a license to lie about sexual harassment and assault. And it is thumbing its nose at federal court rulings in doing so. Courts have ruled that dishonest people who bring sexual harassment charges over conduct they falsely claim was unwelcome can be fired, in cases such as Vasconcelos v. Meese (1990). And they have recognized that sexual slander and smears can create a sexually hostile environment in violation of federal law in cases such as Jew v. University of Iowa (1990) and Spain v. Gallegos (1994).
But in a recent investigation finding Michigan State University in violation of Title IX, OCR required college administrators to offer “remedies” to “Student A,” who both OCR and the university found had made a false allegation of unwelcome sexual misconduct against two fellow students. OCR's reasoning was that the university did not begin proceedings against the accused students fast enough (even though it immediately kicked them out of their dorm and ordered them to stay away from the accuser).
But the lack of an immediate investigation was not because the university was in any way unsympathetic to victims. Rather, it was due to the fact that the complainant decided not to file formal college charges against the accused (the criminal justice system found their complaint so unbelievable that the accused were never charged, and they declined to pursue formal charges at the college level). It is absurd to demand swift college prosecution of innocent people when the accuser themselves does not demand it.
The accused students, whose lives were turned upside down by the charges, were innocent. The university investigator ultimately found their conduct was welcome, and thus not sexual harassment or assault. Moreover, OCR itself noted in pages 30-31 of its investigative report that “OCR's review of the investigator's report and their supporting documentation led OCR to conclude that the preponderance of the evidence did not support a finding that Student A was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct that created a sexually hostile environment.”
Trending: You'd never guess from all their crowing, but AOC didn't come up with the Green New Deal
Yet, OCR suggested the college should “remedy” the imaginary harm caused by its failure not to process their false complaint faster. On pages 40-41 of its report, OCR declares that “under the terms of” its agreement with the university, “the University will … contact Student A” and “offer” their “remedies to address any harm incurred as a result of the University's delay in processing [her] complaints,” which might involve things like paying for counseling, providing academic assistance, or letting them retake a class they were enrolled in during that period.
This demand by the Education Department raised eyebrows even at liberal-leaning publications such as the Chronicle of Higher Education, which noted that “the department's 42-page letter outlining its findings is an illustration of just how difficult it can be for colleges to comply with the beefed-up interpretation of the federal gender-equity law known as Title IX.”
As it observed, after Student A complained to police and the university hospital of being assaulted, the university took action the very next day to protect her, by kicking the accused students out of their dorm and telling them to avoid the complainant:
The next day, university officials met with the two accused students, telling them to avoid social gatherings and not to contact Student A. Meanwhile, the university arranged to move the students into a different dormitory.
Such action against the accused is known as an “interim measure,” since it is a temporary measure imposed on people even before they are found guilty, and even though they later may be found innocent. Such measures can raise serious due-process issues when they last for a long time; are based on very dubious charges; or inflict serious financial or educational harm on the accused. Yet the Education Department has pressed colleges to routinely impose such measures, as I discussed in 2014.
As the Chronicle noted, Student A did not even “file a sexual-harassment complaint with the university”:
Days after Student A reported the assault, the county prosecutor's office announced it would not press charges against the accused students. Student A then told Michigan State they had decided not to file a sexual-harassment complaint with the university, saying they were mainly concerned about running into the men in their residence hall (they'd been reassigned by this point). They got … personal-protection orders forbidding the two male students to follow them or to communicate with her, among other things. University staff members met with the male students to make sure they understood what they were allowed to do. After all that, university officials considered the matter closed. But when the Office for Civil Rights got wind of media reports about the alleged assault, it reached out to Michigan State and “offered technical assistance.” Soon after, the university began an outside Title IX investigation to determine if the alleged assault had violated its sexual-harassment policies, even though the student had still not filed a formal complaint. While that investigation was going on, Student A ran into the male students on the campus more than once, and complained that their failure to actively avoid them constituted violations … In one instance, they saw them studying with a tutor in an academic building and sat in sight of them for 30 minutes… After they reported the episode to the university, it decided to confine the students to a study area separate from Student A's, and made them use a different entrance from the rest of the students. (In its letter, the Office for Civil Rights praises the university for taking that step.) The outside investigator finished work at the end of 2010, and determined that there was not enough evidence to suggest the university's harassment policy had been violated. The Office for Civil Rights agreed, saying in Tuesday's letter that the investigation was “thorough and adequate” and that evidence did not support the claim that Student A had been subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct.
Since Student A's complaint was false, and the college immediately shielded them from exposure to the accused (protecting them from any potential retaliation), what possible harm could they have experienced from the university not investigating their charges faster? How would they have benefited from the university discovering faster that they were apparently a liar? Keep in mind that its discovery that their charges were false may have undermined any argument they might otherwise have had for extending the no-contact orders imposed on the men falsely accused, and for excluding them from shared areas on campus (orders they wanted the college to enforce). This may have been the very reason they didn't ask for (and apparently didn't even want) a formal investigation.
In short, contrary to what OCR suggested in its investigative report, there was simply no harm to Student A from the university's “delay” in formally “processing” their accusation. How can you remedy a non-existent harm? Yet, OCR's investigate report requires MSU to contact Student A to offer them “remedies” for that “delay.” But logically, what possible “remedies” could there be?
Yet, this is not the first time that OCR required remedies for a student who apparently lied. In an April 28, 2014 letter announcing the results of its investigation of Tufts University, it complained that the university allowed in certain evidence of an accused student's innocence, leading to Tufts finding them not guilty of sexual assault, rather than excluding it as untimely or inadmissible. For example, OCR criticized Tufts for “allowing the Accused to submit an Addendum” responding to the charges after the deadline, and letting them show the complainant lied about their medical history, which they obtained by pretending to be a medical student. To resolve the investigation, Tufts had to pay the complainant “monetary compensation,” even though OCR never specifically found that they were sexually assaulted, and even though OCR lacks the statutory authority to award monetary damages.
It also found Tufts in violation of Title IX because it took over a month before “requiring the Accused to move out of the residence hall,” and left them to attending a class “together with the Accused” rather than barring them from that class, which “thus exposed” them “to close physical proximity to the Accused.” But if the accused was not guilty of sexual assault, then they were not dangerous, and the complainant had no right to demand that they be excluded from their classes and dorm.
Contrary to OCR's weird, unjust, and illogical interpretation of Title IX, no court has ever found an institution in violation of Title IX, or any federal law against sexual harassment, for failure to remove an accused person from proximity to the complainant when the accused was not actually guilty of severe sexual harassment. Indeed, courts often rule for institutions sued for harassment even when the accused individual was guilty, and the institution either never removed the accused from proximity to the complainant (even after disciplining him), or only removed them after they were found guilty, and declined to do so while an investigation was pending.
OCR has discouraged colleges from allowing cross-examination by the accused, even though the Supreme Court described cross-examination as the “greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth” in Lilly v. Virginia (1999), and even though a judge required a college to allow cross-examination in Donohue v. Baker (1997).
It has also sought to gut the presumption of innocence. The Yale Law Journal noted in 1987 that “courts, universities, and student defendants all seem to agree that the appropriate standard of proof in student disciplinary cases is one of ‘clear and convincing' evidence.” But in an April 4, 2011 letter to the nation's colleges, the Office for Civil Rights declared this standard illegal in sexual harassment and assault cases.
Smacking of double jeopardy, it has also forced colleges like Southern Methodist University to review past dismissals of complaints (even when those dismissals were not challenged by any complainant), and resolve them to OCR's liking — potentially resulting in discipline of a student previously found not guilty a year or two earlier.
And it has sought to redefine constitutionally-protected speech as verbal “sexual harassment,” such as by telling colleges like Harvard and MSU to regulate off-campus conduct (apparently including speech on the “internet“), and by pressuring Tufts to regulate academic speech not even “directed at” the complainant (generally protected under the 2010 Rodriguez decision).

The visit was Mr. Bannon's first high-profile overseas trip since they left the White House in August and returned to Breitbart News, the right-wing news outlet.
CLSA would not say whether it had paid Mr. Bannon for their appearance. “CLSA does not discuss any agreements that we might have with speakers,” said Simone Wheeler, a spokesperson for the firm.
Over lunch in a private room at the Grissini restaurant in the Grand Hyatt hotel, overlooking Victoria Harbour, Mr. Bannon shared their insights on a range of topics — including the United States electoral system, immigration and the escalating conflict over North Korea — with a small group of investors, according to two people who were in attendance.
The event was organized by CLSA for important clients of its brokerage business.
During the lunch, which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Bannon told the group that Mr. Trump had great respect for Mr. Xi and felt that the two leaders could find a solution to the North Korea crisis, according to the two investors in attendance, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
In their keynote address, in a crowded Grand Hyatt ballroom, Mr. Bannon discussed economic nationalism in the United States and its spread across the globe, including in Britain. They called the U.K. Independence Party, which pushed successfully last year for Britain's exit from the European Union, a professional version of the Tea Party movement in the United States, according to one audience member. The address was closed to the news media.
It's been more than half a year since Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad embarked on a historic trip to Baghdad, accusing the United States of fueling the violence in Iraq and portraying their nation as a close friend of the neighbor it once fought in a bitter eight-year war.
"The Iraqi people do not like the Americans," Ahmadinejad said back then at a press conference with U.S.-backed Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
A few days ago, the Iranian president called on Iraqis to reject a security agreement which would allow U.S. troops to remain in Iraq for three years. Ahmadinejad stated that Iraq could defend itself and block the influence of foreigners. But U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed their claim and told reporters Thursday in Mexico that Iraqis can defend their interests without the input of Iranians.
Who are they kidding?
Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, Iranian influence in Iraq has been growing steadily, and is closely tied to the Shi'ite parties who dominate Iraq's government. The Iranian government has been actively seeking to derail the security agreement by orchestrating opposition rallies and attempting to bribe Iraqi politicians.
However, the problem goes beyond political influence. Iranian money and arms have been pouring into Iraq through the largely unguarded Iraqi-Iranian border. The U.S. military recently arrested an Iraqi general at the Iranian border carrying large sums of cash intended to finance efforts to derail the agreement. The general has known ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
Iranian money and arms have been finding their way to two primary Iraqi Shi'ite groups: Asaib-al-haq and Kataib Hezbollah. Both groups have been accused of recent assassinations and kidnappings against pro U.S Shi'ites. Unlike Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army, (also funded by Iran), these groups receive their direct orders from Iranian elements and are modeled after the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the United States warned of "real consequences" for Iraq if it rejects the newly negotiated security pact. Without a deal, U.S. military operations could be forced to end. But the real consequences for Iraqi leaders are the anger and the wrath of militant Shi'ite groups and the many Iraqis who demand an end to what they consider foreign military occupation. An Iraqi government spokesperson recently lashed out at the United States and warned that Iraq would not be bullied into signing a security pact.
Will Maliki push the security agreement through the Iraqi Parliament? In all probably, yes- but not before modifications were made to the original agreement, or prior to the outcome of the U.S. elections.
A few days ago, Joe Biden was criticized when they warned that America's enemies would test Barack Obama with an international crisis within six months if elected president.  They are half correct -- Obama will be tested, but America's enemies do not have to manufacture a new crisis. The international crisis already exists in Iraq, and it will be Obama's first test: the battle between Bush's Shi'ites and Ahmadinejad's Shi'ites.
Aaron Sanchez threw 66 pitches for the Dunedin Blue Jays Tuesday, a significant step toward completing the rehabilitation of their troublesome right middle finger.
Sanchez pitched 3.2 innings against the Bradenton Marauders, allowing three earned runs on six hits while walking two and striking out three. After pitching three clean innings, the right-hander allowed three fourth-inning runs and exited with two outs.
The Blue Jays expect Sanchez to make at least one more rehab start before re-joining the rotation. Sanchez's next rehab start tentatively lines up for Sunday, the day after their 25th birthday. That start could take place with the triple-A Buffalo Bisons, and if it goes well it's possible he'll return to face the Houston Astros in the Blue Jays' final series before the all-star break.
The Jeff Blair Show Dunedin manager: Signs point in right direction for Sanchez's finger June 28 2017
Your browser does not support the audio element.
A variety of blister and nail issues have led to three disabled list stints for Sanchez, who last pitched in a big-league game May 19 against Baltimore. Soon afterwards they resolved to take a more deliberate approach to ensure they return at full strength.
If Sanchez returns, Joe Biagini could be pushed back to the bullpen, but after making their 10th big-league start Tuesday, Biagini stressed the importance of staying focused on their current role.
“Everybody's rooting for (Sanchez) to stay healthy and keep that finger healthy and strong,” Biagini said. “I'm trying to just maintain the mindset of being confident, being aggressive, but also being thankful.”
Regardless of who the Blue Jays keep in the rotation, the return of Sanchez would inarguably strengthen their pitching staff as a whole.
One of my favorite mobile applications on iOS is Slack. So many of my daily conversations happen inside of this well-designed chat application. They get so many of the little details right such as the ability to swipe down or tap to dismiss the keyboard. There's a level of polish in the application that is missing in many apps. So, when I started building things with Twilio IP Messaging I really wanted to replicate the things that they do so well. It quickly turned into a struggle as I fought Auto Layout and UITableViews. I went to the Internet for help and that's when I found SlackTextViewController. All of the features I love about Slack's message view are available as an easy-to-use control. In this post we'll pick up where the Swift iOS Quickstart leaves off and enhance it with the feature-packed SlackTextViewController. Along the way we'll learn how to light up more of Twilio IP Messaging's features such as typing indication and channel history. We'll also take a look at how to use Auto Layout to design the view for an individual message such that it automatically resizes. Before we get started you'll need to work through the Swift iOS Quickstart since we'll be using that as our starting point. I'll wait here patiently while you build that… Great, you're back! Here's what we will be building in this post: The big improvements are keyboard management, typing indicator and the built-in send button. These are all provided by SlackTextController. Let's get started. Gearing Up Now that you've gone through the Quickstart, let's recap what you have already: IP Messaging service set up through Twilio
Backend application for obtaining tokens
Swift iOS application that authenticates a user with the IP Messaging Service using a random name and joins a chat channel named ‘general' To move forward with our improvements to the Quickstart we'll need to add SlackTextViewController. The easiest way to get this into our application is using CocoaPods. CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift libraries. Thankfully the Quickstart already uses CocoaPods to install the Twilio IP Messaging SDK so we'll just add another CocoaPod to our dependency list. Open up Podfile from the Pods project in the Quickstart workspace in Xcode and add the following lines to it:
use_frameworks ! pod ' SlackTextViewController '
The use_frameworks! line ensures that any Objective-C libraries installed as pods will be exposed as dynamic frameworks in the Swift project. This prevents us from needing to import Objective-C header files for these libraries in a bridging header. After you have saved the Podfile run the following command from the terminal in your project directory:
pod install
You should see some output indicating that SlackTextViewController has been added to the project:
You'll need to build the project after installing the new pod for the dependencies to properly be picked up by Xcode. With SlackTextViewController installed let's add some more IP Messaging features to our app while also adding some UI polish. Migrating to SlackTextViewController The Quickstart uses a UITableView to display the messages for the chat channel. The good news for us is that SlackTextViewController uses a UITableView by default and implements the same methods we used in the Quickstart for populating the UITableView. This means we will be able to reuse a lot of the code from the Quickstart's implementation of the message list. There is quite a bit of unnecessary code in the Quickstart's ViewController class though due to the features SlackTextViewController takes care of for us that had to be implemented in the Quickstart. To save describing copying a bunch of code over into a new file or deleting a bunch of code from the existing file I've done that work for you. Replace the code in ViewController with the code in this Gist. The code in the Gist makes ViewController a subclass of SLKTextViewController and sets up most of the code we had in the previous version of ViewController . Code that managed the keyboard, the text field and the send button have been removed since SlackTextViewController handles these for us. The new ViewController class also adds some methods to load all of a channel's messages into the table view and a method that adds messages sorted by timestamp to the table view. Here's what these methods look like:
func loadMessages () { self . messages . removeAll () let messages = self . generalChannel ?. messages . allObjects () self . addMessages ( messages !) } func addMessages ( messages : [ TWMMessage ]) { self . messages . appendContentsOf ( messages ) self . messages . sortInPlace { $1 . timestamp > $0 . timestamp } dispatch_async ( dispatch_get_main_queue ()) { () -> Void in self . tableView . reloadData () if self . messages . count > 0 { self . scrollToBottomMessage () } } }
The ViewController uses these methods to load a channel's message history when it is joined:
func ipMessagingClient ( client : TwilioIPMessagingClient !, channelHistoryLoaded channel : TMChannel !) { self . loadMessages () }
At this point the project will build but it won't run correctly. The app will connect to IP Messaging and join the general channel but no messages will be displayed. The problem is that the Main.storyboard file that set up our user interface was built for the code in the Quickstart's version of ViewController . Let's fix that by adding the user interface for our new SlackTextViewController code. Open up Main.storyboard and add a new View Controller:
Control-drag from the Navigation Controller to the new View Controller and select the root view controller relationship segue:
Select the View Controller and in the Identity Inspector set the Class to ViewController :
Delete the original root view controller (the one that still says “#general” in the header) from the storyboard and save the file. The application will build and run at this point but if you try it you'll notice it crashes right at the point when it would normally display the message list. Perusing the logs in Xcode we can find the cause:
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception ' NSInternalInconsistencyException ' , reason : ' unable to dequeue a cell with identifier MessageCell - must register a nib or a class for the identifier or connect a prototype cell in a storyboard '
The problem is that the UITableViewCell we were using in the Quickstart is no longer available since it was embedded in the storyboard. Let's fix that and dive into some Auto Layout. Growing Up With Auto Layout We're going to create a message cell that looks like this:
The message cell is composed of two UILabels. One is a single-line label for the author of the message. The other is a multi-line label that will expand for longer body text. In order for the cell to resize we need to make use of Auto Layout to specify how the cell's contents should be sized and laid out. This will allow the cell to resize when the body text is longer than one line or when the user specifies larger text sizes using Dynamic Type. Let's start by creating a UITableViewCell in our project. Create a UITableViewCell subclass named MessageTableViewCell from Xcode's File->New->File… menu:
The first thing that we'll do in MessageTableViewCell.swift is add properties for our two labels and configure their properties using lazy instantiation. Replace the contents of MessageTableViewCell.swift with this code:
import UIKit class MessageTableViewCell : UITableViewCell { lazy var nameLabel : UILabel = { let label = UILabel () label . font = UIFont . preferredFontForTextStyle ( UIFontTextStyleSubheadline ) label . textColor = UIColor ( red : 0 / 255.0 , green : 128 / 255.0 , blue : 64 / 255.0 , alpha : 1.0 ) return label }() lazy var bodyLabel : UILabel = { let label = UILabel () label . font = UIFont . preferredFontForTextStyle ( UIFontTextStyleBody ) label . numberOfLines = 0 return label }() }
The lazy keyword indicates we want to instantiate and configure the labels at the point where they are first accessed in code. We use UIFont.preferredFontForTextStyle to set the font instead of hardcoding it so that we can accommodate Dynamic Type users. For the body label we set the number of lines to 0 so that it can expand vertically if its text is long. Next, let's add initializers to the class so that we can instantiate the cell from our table view:
override init ( style : UITableViewCellStyle , reuseIdentifier : String ?) { super . init ( style : style , reuseIdentifier : reuseIdentifier ) configureSubviews () } // We won't use this but it's required for the class to compile required init ?( coder aDecoder : NSCoder ) { super . init ( coder : aDecoder ) }
You might see an error in Xcode at this point because we haven't written the configureSubviews() method yet. We'll take care of that now. The configureSubviews() method will set add the labels to the cell set up the Auto Layout constraints. To make our lives easier while using Auto Layout we'll use the popular library SnapKit. SnapKit makes it easy to express complicated layout constraints using an easy to read DSL. Add SnapKit to your Podfile:
pod ' SnapKit '
Run pod install from the terminal and then build the project to bring in the new pod. Then import the SnapKit library at the top of MessageTableViewCell.swift :
import SnapKit
Now we can add the configureSubviews() method:
func configureSubviews () { self . addSubview ( self . nameLabel ) self . addSubview ( self . bodyLabel ) nameLabel . snp_makeConstraints { ( make ) -> Void in make . top . equalTo ( self ). offset ( 10 ) make . left . equalTo ( self ). offset ( 20 ) make . right . equalTo ( self ). offset ( - 20 ) } bodyLabel . snp_makeConstraints { ( make ) -> Void in make . top . equalTo ( nameLabel . snp_bottom ). offset ( 1 ) make . left . equalTo ( self ). offset ( 20 ) make . right . equalTo ( self ). offset ( - 20 ) make . bottom . equalTo ( self ). offset ( - 10 ) } }
The highlighted lines use SnapKit to create Auto Layout constraints for the two labels. The lines of code are pretty easy to read but a diagram might help picture what is going on:
As you can see in the diagram we're specifying constraints that allow Auto Layout to position the labels within the view. The constraints are created by specifying relationships between the sides of our views. We specified just enough constraints to cover how to position the edges of our views. The sizes will be determined by the content the labels contain at runtime plus the size and orientation of the device they're displayed in. With this code in place our auto-resizing table view cell is ready to be used in ViewController.swift . Plug In the Cell The first thing we need to do is tell the table view where it can find the message cell we created in the previous section. Add this line to viewDidLoad in ViewController.swift to register the cell's class:
self . tableView . registerClass ( MessageTableViewCell . self , forCellReuseIdentifier : "MessageTableViewCell" )
Now head to the tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath: method and replace it with the following code:
override func tableView ( tableView : UITableView , cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath : NSIndexPath ) -> UITableViewCell { let cell = tableView . dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier ( "MessageTableViewCell" , forIndexPath : indexPath ) as ! MessageTableViewCell let message = self . messages [ indexPath . row ] cell . nameLabel . text = message . author cell . bodyLabel . text = message . body cell . selectionStyle = . None return cell }
We also need to set one more important property on our view controller before we run the app. There's a property of SlackTextViewController called inverted that will cause messages to start from the bottom of the screen instead of the top. For this app we won't use it but it's something worth exploring in the future in your own apps. It's true by default so let's set it to false in viewDidLoad :
self . inverted = false
Run the app and you should see messages load into the channel using our new cell. Now that messages are displaying with the new SlackTextViewController let's explore some of the other features of the control. We'll start by hooking up the Send button so we can send messages. I Have a Message For You SlackTextViewController has a built-in Send button that we can wire up to send new messages to the channel. When the Send button is tapped the method didPressRightButton: will be called. Let's override that method in ViewController.swift with code to send a new message:
override func didPressRightButton ( sender : AnyObject !) { self . textView . refreshFirstResponder () let message = self . generalChannel ?. messages . createMessageWithBody ( self . textView . text ) self . generalChannel ?. messages . sendMessage ( message ){ ( result ) -> Void in if result != . Success { print ( "Error sending message" ) } else { self . textView . text = "" } } }
Run the application again and verify that you are now able to send messages to the channel. What's That Tapping Noise? For our last trick in this post let's enable SlackTextController's typing indicator. The typing indicator will display just above the keyboard and update whenever IP Messaging tells us someone is typing in the channel. The two methods in the TwilioIPMessagingClientDelegate
that we need to provide for this to work are ipMessagingClient(client:typingStartedOnChannel:member:) and ipMessagingClient(client:typingEndedOnChannel:member:) . When these are called they will pass in the channel name and the identity of the member who started or stopped typing. With that knowledge we can use SlackTextViewController's typingIndicator.insertUserName and typingIndicator.removeUserName to update the typing indicator for our channel. Let's add these methods to SlackChannelViewController.swift :
func ipMessagingClient ( client : TwilioIPMessagingClient !, typingStartedOnChannel channel : TWMChannel !, member : TWMMember !) { self . typingIndicatorView . insertUsername ( member . identity ()) } func ipMessagingClient ( client : TwilioIPMessagingClient !, typingEndedOnChannel channel : TWMChannel !, member : TWMMember !) { self . typingIndicatorView . removeUsername ( member . identity ()) }
We also need to let the IP Messaging service know when we begin typing. We'll override textViewDidChange and call self.channel?.typing() within it:
override func textViewDidChange ( textView : UITextView ) { self . generalChannel ?. typing () }
Ruby is small. If it's not your first programming language, picking up all the basic syntax in a weekend isn't out of the question. I've been writing and reading Ruby code for several years now, and figured I was closing in on at least familiarity with all the core concepts.
Of course, there's always more to learn, and there were more than a few very experienced Ruby programmers that learned about a new operator last week: the flip-flop.
Nithin's blog post gives a great overview of the syntax, so lets look at a more complicated example from Reddit:
1 2 3 4 5 6 a = b = c = ( 1 . . 100 ) . each do | num | print num , ?\r , ( "Fizz" unless ( a = ! a ) . . ( a = ! a )), ( "Buzz" unless ( b = ! b ) . . . ! (( c = ! c ) . . ( c = ! c ))), ?
end
This code clearly came from an obfuscation contest, and I'm not even going to attempt to suggest that I understood how this code worked after first reading it. But I was intrigued. Never mind the flip-flop operator, most of this code looks unfamiliar to someone used to reading idiomatic Ruby, and I wanted to know how it all worked. So lets break it down piece by piece, and see if some sense can be made.
Starting out with some assignment
The first line is perhaps the most normal. Chaining assignment is used frequently in many languages. And while many of the methods we use in Enumerable, like map , return something useful, the method is actually defined on the Range class, and just returns the range.
But the code above uses the a , b , and c variables before the iterator finishes, what is their value then? Let's run a simple test script to find out:
1 2 3 4 5 # a no-op each a = ( 1 . . 2 ) . each do | num | puts a . inspect # => nil end puts a . inspect # => (1..2)
Aha, it just is set to nil. Of course a variable that isn't first initialized will throw an error, so this first line is really just a short way of initializing the a , b and c variables to something, before the start of the iterator. Let's do out first refactor of the code then, to make it more readable:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a = b = c = nil ( 1 . . 100 ) . each do | num | print num , ?\r , ( "Fizz" unless ( a = ! a ) . . ( a = ! a )), ( "Buzz" unless ( b = ! b ) . . . ! (( c = ! c ) . . ( c = ! c ))), ?
end
This code works the same way, so we know it was really a refactoring, with no changes to the behavior of the code.
Fun with Printing
The next line is actually the entire body of the block passed to each : the print method takes multiple arguments, and notably, does not automatically print a newline at the end ( puts on the other hand, does always print a newline).
But what in the world does ?\r do? It turns out to be a poorly-documented character literal. It's one character shorter than creating a string, such as "\r" , but with the same result.
And what is "\r" anyway? It's a carriage return, the little known sibling of the newline. Even in the 21st century, our computer screens still basically behave like a typewriter. Advancing to the next line and moving the cursor to the start of the line are two distinct actions, and so they have distinct character codes. Of course, the fact that Windows requires both a carriage return and a newline character, whereas Linux and OS X systems assume a carriage return with just a newline, creates more than a little confusion.
So, in any case, what sort of behavior can a carriage return character give us? Let's run a few experiments:
1 2 3 print "hello" , " " , "world" , "
" # => hello world print "hello" , " \r " , "world" , "
" # => world print "hello" , " \r " , nil , "
" # => hello
How interesting! A carriage return lets us write some text, and then later while writing the same line, essentially decide to erase that text. Remembering the requirements of the Fizz Buzz problem, and how one must ONLY print a number when neither Fizz nor Buzz are printed, the utility of this behavior is obvious.
Finally, flip-flop
At this point we can easily describe the overall structure of the code: it loops through the numbers 1 to 100, using control characters to optimistically print the number, and then based on the logic of flip-flops, print Fizz and/or Buzz instead of the number when appropriate. But when is the “appropriate” time to print Fizz or Buzz? And how does a flip-flop and only three temporary variables achieve that? Lets take a look at just the first use of the flip-flop, on line 3 of the original code.
The first thing to note is that the conditions of the flip-flop operator are actually assignment. This took me a long while to spot, and indeed is a common source of bugs. In this case though, it's not a bug, its a feature.
The flip-flop operator is going to evaluate the “truthiness” of whatever expression is inside it, and remembering that the assignment operator in many languages returns a value, we can figure out what the flip-flop operator will do.
We know the initial value of a , b , and c is nil, so lets start there.
1 2 3 puts ( ! nil ) . inspect # => true puts ( ! true ) . inspect # => false puts ( ! false ) . inspect # => true
So each invocation of one “side” of the flip-flop will gracefully handle the initial nil value of the variables, and then swap them between true and false. The flip-flop operator consists of two identical expressions though, so what behavior will that produce?
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 a = nil ( 1 . . 9 ) . each do | n | puts " #{ n } #{ a . inspect } " "Fizz" unless ( a = ! a ) . . ( a = ! a ) # no output here, we just care about the changes to a end # => # 1 nil # 2 false # 3 true # 4 false # 5 false # 6 true # 7 false # 8 false # 9 true
So the flip-flop operator, with just a single state variable, is able to create a pattern that sets a to true every third time! This is exactly how often we want to print “Fizz”!
How does this happen? If the only operation used is negating a boolean, the boolean will return to its original value after an even number of operations. So how is an even number (maybe 2, 4 or 6) of operations squeezed into three runs of a loop? Lets investigate the value of a after each condition of the flip-flop, rather than once per loop. We'll use two simple functions to print within the conditions of the flip-flop:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 # given a value, print its negation, then return its negation def print_negate1 ( value ) puts "a #{ ( ! value ) . inspect } " ! value end #same as above, but print b instead of a so we can tell #which condition is being checked def print_negate2 ( value ) puts "b #{ ( ! value ) . inspect } " ! value ends a = nil ( 1 . . 3 ) . each do | n | puts " #{ n } " "Fizz" unless ( a = print_negate1 ( a )) . . ( a = print_negate2 ( a )) end # => # 1 # a true # b false # 2 # b true # 3 # a false
As can be seen in the output, the flip-flop operator does indeed cause print_negate to be called 4 times in every 3 iterations. How? The first time through, the first flip-flop condition evaluates to true (nil negated is true), so the second condition is checked, and a is set to false (true negated is false).
The flip-flop is now “open”. It will only check the second condition now. In the second iteration of the loop, the flip-flop checks if should “close”. False negated is true, so the flip-flop does close. Finally, in the third iteration, the flip-flop checks only if it should open. True negated is false, so it stays closed, and the cycle repeats.
There's one more complication: the flip-flop doesn't return based on the value of a , but on its internal state. A flip-flop starts “closed”, meaning it will return false. Once the first condition evaluates to true, it is “open”, and will return true until the second conditional returns true, “closing” the flip-flop. So what is the state of the flip-flop after each of the 3 cycles above?
The first time, it starts closed, opens, and then does not close. Because of the unless , this does not print “Fizz”. The second time, it starts open, and closes, but still returns true, since “Fizz” is again not printed. Finally, the flip-flop fails to open at all in the third iteration, and thus returns false. This allows “Fizz” to be printed, exactly when needed.
So an interesting property of the flip-flop is that it returns true if it starts open, but then closes.
Buzz!
After dissecting the logic for printing “Fizz”, we can describe without even reading the code how “Buzz” will be printed: two variables will be used with some flip-flops to create a cycle that repeats every 5 iterations of the loop.
But that description leaves a lot of the details, and in fact there's quite a bit more to be learned. Looking at line 4 in the original code, the first thing we notice is a new operator, or at least a variation: here there is a familiar flip-flop nested in the second conditional of what looks like another flip-flop operator at first glance. However It's important to note this flip-flop consists of three dots ( ... ) rather than the more familiar two ( .. ). What's the difference? Using our test code from above with this variant tells us:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 a = nil ( 1 . . 9 ) . each do | n | puts " #{ n } #{ a . inspect } " "Fizz" unless ( a = ! a ) . . . ( a = ! a ) end # => # 1 nil # 2 true # 3 false # 4 true # 5 false # 6 true # 7 false # 8 true # 9 false
This variant simply alternates between true and false, meaning it has an odd number of negations in every cycle. Theres not much Ruby documentation on the flip-flop operator, but the Perl documentation describes the difference:
If you don't want it to test the right operand until the next evaluation, as in sed, just use
three dots (“…”) instead of two. In all other regards, “…” behaves just like “..” does.
The Ruby flip-flop behaves the same way, and therefore will only ever perform one negation per iteration of the loop. Another way to describe the difference: the first flip-flop variant will allow itself to open and close in the same invocation, whereas the second will not.
Instead of instrumenting all 3 conditionals in the two flip-flops for this part of the code, lets see if we can just reason about it, and describe how it works.
First, we recognise the inside of the second conditional: its the exact same pattern as in the “Fizz” line, but with the c variable. We therefore know that it will cycle through returning true, true, false. However, its output is negated, so the second conditional in the first flip-flop is going to cycle through false, false, and true. Lets work through a couple iterations of the loop and see where this goes.
The first time through, b and c are both nil, and both flip-flops are closed. The first flip-flop will evaluate b = !b to determine if it should open. That will set b to true and return true, so the first flip-flop is now open. This flip-flop variant doesn't check if it should immediately close, so we're done.
The second time through, the first flip-flop checks the second conditional to see if it should close. We don't need to work through the logic of the second flip-flop, we know it will return false this time, and so the flip-flop stays open. Remember, the unless statement means we will only print “Buzz” when the flip-flop returns false(is closed)!
We also know the result of the third time through: the flip-flop is open, and again the second-flip flop will return false; the first flip-flop stays open, and nothing is printed.
The fourth time, the first flip-flop DOES close. However, remember that a flip-flop returns true when it transitions from open to closed, so once again we don't print anything.
On the fifth iteration, the flip-flop starts closed, b is currently true. The first conditional of the flip-flop is evaluated, and the result is false! This means the flip-flop doesn't open, returns false, and finally, “Buzz” is printed, exactly when we need it.
Fin
Wow, that was some serious thought for just a few lines of code. I've put all the example code on Github, feel free to fool around further.
Needless to say, while I enjoyed the exercise, like most of the Perl-isms in Ruby, I won't be using flip-flops in production code any time soon.

How would you like to save 40%-60% off hiking, backpacking, climbing, skiing, mountaineering, running, cycling, fishing and kayaking gear and apparel? There's a good chance that you already qualify for these kinds of discounts from dozens or hundreds of manufacturers, but don't know it.
What is a Pro Deal?
Outdoor gear and clothing manufacturers sell gear to employees and volunteers involved in outdoor recreation, emergency responders, law enforcement, outdoor related government agencies, the military, and media at wholesale prices ranging from 40-60% off MSRP. They do this because people in these professions or roles are likely to use the gear and recommend it to people who have to buy it from retailers at full price.
There are usually some strings attached:
Pro deals are intended for you alone, and not for friends and family.
You can't buy heavily discounted products and then flip them on Craigslist or eBay.
There may be limit on the number of products you can buy in one year.
Pro pricing is usually offered to full-time or part-time, non-temporary employees who work within the outdoor industry. There are some major exceptions to this, so keep reading.
Who Qualifies for Pro Deals?
While it depends on the manufacturer, if you work for an outdoor gear or apparel manufacturer or an outdoor retailer, chances are pretty good that you qualify for manufacturer pro deals. The same holds for accredited outdoor media professionals including reporters, producers, editors and writers and full-time employees that work for outdoor guide companies, outfitters, or are certified members of the following organizations, among others:
American Mountain Guides Association
Adventure Travel Trade Association Member
Professional Ski Instructors Association of America
National Ski Patrol
Association for Experiential Education
American Canoe Association Instructors
In addition, there are a lot of other groups that typically qualify for pro deals, including many that aren't directly involved in the outdoor industry, including:
Active Members of US or Canadian Military Services, including: US Army US Air Force US Coast Guard US Navy and Navy Seals US Marine Corps Canadian Army Canadian Navy Canadian Air Force
Fire and Rescue Professionals and Volunteers Paid and Volunteer Firefighters Search and Rescue Team Members
Law Enforcement Professionals Federal State Local
Department of Interior Employees
Forest Service Employees and Volunteers
Physical Education Instructor and Team Coaches, High School Level and Beyond
Yoga and Fitness Instructors
Tactical Hand to Hand and Weapons Instructors
NOLS Alumni, Instructors, and Employees
Outward Bound Alumni
How to Apply for Pro Deals
If you think you might qualify for a pro deal from a manufacturer, go to their web site and find the page that describes their Pro Deal application process. Applying for each of these programs can save you a lot of money if you get accepted. Here are a few examples:
ExpertVoice and Outdoor Prolink
Many outdoor companies also outsource their pro deal portals such as ExpertVoice.com or Outdoor Prolink. These companies have standardized the sign-up and approval process making it a lot easier for qualified individuals to apply to hundreds of pro deals with just one application!
For example, say you're an active duty serviceman in the US Army. You'd add that group as an affiliation in your user profile and you'll see that many brands offer pro deal discounts to eligible applicants. These range from tactical manufacturers like Leupold, Fenix, and Bushnell to mainstream outdoor brands including Big Agnes, Scarpa, Garmont, Suunto, Delorme, Gregory, Old Town, Raleigh and Diamondback Bicycles, Sawyer, Leki, Icelantic and Nemo Equipment, just to name a few.
So, check it out. You might be able to save a lot of money on outdoor gear if you qualify.

(JTA) – A well-known theater actor from Belgium told one of their country's best-read weeklies that they are infuriated by the “procreation policies of the Jews in Israel.” Wannes Cappelle, 37, made their remarks in an interview published Sunday, Jan. 1 in De Zondag. “Those procreation policies of the Jews in Israel, to name one example, is simply a crime. It infuriates me,” Cappelle was quoted as saying in response to a question on whether they can “understand fear of the other” following what the interviewer defined as “A Trump, a Brexit, the acceptance of the far right in Europe.” Before mentioning Israel, Wannes, who also is an award-winning musician, said, “Most of all I worry over overpopulation. The human race is too stupid to keep it under control.”
According to a 2014 study by the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, the Jewish state has “one of the highest birthrates in the developed world, with an average of three children per woman compared to an average of 1.7 children in the OECD,” the 35-member Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Israel, a nation of 8.5 million, has a “government policy that encourages births in various ways,” the report also says, noting that “the state provides a relatively supportive environment for working mothers, leading to relatively high participation in the workforce by mothers aged 25-44.” Israel is the only country in the world, according to the report, where insured female citizens who cannot conceive receive for nearly no payment an unlimited number of costly procedures aimed at achieving conception. This coverage, which is given to all citizens, Jewish and otherwise, is provided to women under 45 with fewer than two children. Arab women have a slightly higher birthrate than Jewish ones in Israel, according to Central Bureau of Statistics data from 2014.
Egypt, a nation of nearly 90 million, has a rising birthrate of 3.5 children per woman, according to an article published last year by The Economist.

The New York Times marked the same anniversary in a different way: by running a series of articles extolling the virtues of communism.

The death toll of communism, cited in “The Black Book of Communism,” is simply staggering: In the USSR, nearly 20 million dead; China, 65 million; Vietnam, 1 million; Cambodia, 2 million; Eastern Europe, 1 million; Africa, 1.7 million; Afghanistan, 1.5 million; North Korea: 2 million (and counting). In all, Communist regimes killed some 100 million people — roughly four times the number killed by the Nazis — making communism the most murderous ideology in human history.

Ghodsee writes that Communists had better sex: “Eastern women had twice as many orgasms as Western women . . .

Not the purges, not the gulag, but promoting the nuclear family.

In one telegram, reproduced in “The Black Book of Communism,” Lenin orders the Cheka (a predecessor of the KGB) to “Hang (I mean hang publicly, so that people see it) at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards, and known bloodsuckers.” (The telegram concludes with an eerie “P.S.

In another piece, “ Love Lives of Bolsheviks ,” they note that for Russia's Communists, “revolution was inseparable from love.” Except of course, when the KGB arrived in the middle of the night to separate them from their loves by hauling them off to the gulag.

A recent poll by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that just 36 percent of American millennials have a “very unfavorable” view of communism — the only American generation where this number is less than a majority. Worse still, 32 percent believe that more people were killed under George W. Bush than under Joseph Stalin. The ignorance is stunning. The first post-Cold War generation has been raised almost completely unaware of the evils of communism.
Czech writer Milan Kundera once described the struggle against communism as “the struggle of memory against forgetting.” Communist regimes did more than kill their victims; they sought to erase their memory and humanity. Shamefully, communism's crimes against memory and humanity are still being whitewashed by the New York Times.
Story highlights "You know they haven't been able to define waterboarding. They don't know if it's torture," Trump said
Trump has previously referred to waterboarding as "sort of the least form of torture"
(CNN) Donald Trump still isn't sure if waterboarding amounts to torture.
Despite previously acknowledging that the controversial technique is torture, the GOP front-runner appeared to backtrack on Thursday, saying that "nobody knows if it's torture."
"You know they haven't been able to define waterboarding. They don't know if it's torture. If it is, it might be a little too tough, we can't be nice," Trump said during a campaign event in Gaffney, South Carolina.
Trump has previously referred to waterboarding as "sort of the least form of torture" or "the minimal form." And in the last week, Trump has called for the U.S. to go beyond waterboarding and use other methods of torture in its fight against radical Islamic terrorism.
The technique, which gives the detainee the sensation of being drowned, has been classified as torture by experts, international non-governmental organizations and top officials in both Democratic and Republican parties.

The big Brexit challenge for Irish firms will be maintaining market share in the UK, according a senior trade policy analyst and ex-World Trade Organisation (WTO) official.
Stuart Harbinson said the prospect of the EU and the UK agreeing a free trade deal was high, given the amount of trade involved, which is said to be worth €600 billion.
This would mean Ireland and other EU countries have a good chance of retaining tariff-free access to the UK market after 2019, which is a priority for the Government here.
However, with the UK intent on exiting Europe's customs union and forging its own trade deals, the prospect of other non-EU countries being able to trade on more favourable terms with the UK is also high, Mr Harbinson warned.
This would have serious implications for Ireland in terms of increased competition in its largest export market and may result in the displacement of certain products that are currently protected by EU customs.
Most vulnerable to this type of outcome are Irish agricultural products such as beef, which rely heavily on the UK market and will struggle to compete with cheaper imports from the United States, the UK 's prime target for a post-Brexit trade deal.
Mr Harbinson, a former WTO chief of staff and special adviser to two directors-general, has recently taken up a role with Ireland's largest public relations firm, Hume Brophy, advising clients on the implications of Brexit.
 They are optimistic that a EU-UK free trade deal, separate from the formal divorce talks, can be forged within a relatively short space of time, even within two years. This is because there is already “free trade and full regulatory compatibility” between the EU and the UK.
However, they cautioned that a free trade deal was inferior to a customs union. In a customs union, once goods are inside it, they can move across borders tariff-free. For example, if a US good enters France if you can travel onwards to Italy or Germany without having to pay additional taxes.
Country of origin
However, in a free trade arrangement, non-EU goods coming into the UK won't be eligible for re-exporting into the EU because of strict “country of origin” rules. This is likely to prove one of the biggest headaches for the UK, they said. “The UK government has acknowledged the problem through stating its aim to have as seamless a border [particularly with the Republic] as possible and a new customs agreement with the EU.
“However, the technicalities are daunting and add yet another layer of complexity and the UK has not given any detail on how this might be solved,” they said.
A traditional sticking point in trade talks internationally has always been agriculture, Mr Harbinson said, noting previous EU free trade deals have included restrictions on certain agricultural products.
“This is because it is bound up with people's livelihoods, traditional ways of life and culture, so it's always been a very sensitive area, and of course people are very concerned about things like food safety.”
Currently about 37 per cent of Irish agricultural exports, worth €4.2 billion, go to the UK each year. The Irish Government understandably will be lobbying hard to ensure agriculture is not excluded from any tariff-free arrangement.
Nonetheless, future UK trade deals are likely to result in increased competition from Australia and New Zealand, as well as the US, which could affect the prospects for Irish exports to the UK and the EU, Mr Harbinson said.
Sacrificial lamb
“The phrase sacrificial lamb might take on a new and wider meaning for farmers,” they said, while noting Irish producers would still have the advantage of proximity, quality and freshness, “vital considerations for many agricultural products”.
They said food safety standards were likely to be an issue in any future US/UK trade deal. “Would the UK accept US exports of hormone-treated beef and ractopamine-treated pork? What about the use of GMOs?”
Given the asymmetrical relationship between the UK and the US, and the urgent need the UK will have to forge a post-Brexit deal, they said the UK was likely to prove more tractable on these issues than the EU has been up to now.
DirecTV and the Pac-12 Networks remain at a stalemate, six years after the network launched. In the Times' first installment of Pac-12 Hotline, Jon Wilner dives into why.
I spent years trying to locate Derek Chang, to no avail, and eventually gave up trying. But a tip from a source this summer — ”Last I heard, he's in Singapore” — re-started the search and led me, eventually, to Chang.
To the executive vice president for content strategy for DirecTV (i.e., it leads negotiator) prior to the launch of the Pac-12 Networks.
Turns out, Chang does not hate the Pac-12. In fact, he's a Stanford business school grad who took endless heat from classmates for not signing a carriage deal with the conference.
Pac-12 Hotline joins The Seattle Times You're reading the first installment of The Seattle Times' partnership with the Bay Area News Group, bringing Jon Wilner's Pac-12 Hotline to the Times and seattletimes.com. We're excited to welcome Wilner and their award-winning college sports coverage into the fold. Follow them on Twitter: @wilnerhotline.
[ Read Part 1 of Wilner's Pac-12 Networks series » ]
(During one of our conversations, Chang joked that the blowback was so severe, they were forced to leave the country for a new job.)
“I saw those guys a couple years ago at the (Pac-12) basketball game in Shanghai,'' Chang said of the conference brass, including commissioner Larry Scott. “We still have a good relationship.''
Locating Chang, who works for Scripps and is now based in London, was a breakthrough in my attempt to piece together the details of the stalled negotiations between the Pac-12 and DirecTV.
Even better: Chang agreed to talk on the record, to the extent that they could recollect, about the impasse that began in the spring of 2011 and remains in place today.
(To this point, the only DirecTV comments that I'm aware of are generic news releases and website postings.)
The account below is based on interviews with Chang, Scott and numerous other Hotline sources with direct knowledge of the Pac-12 Networks' negotiations with DirecTV (and other distributors) during the pre- and post-launch windows.
You can blame one side or the other — you can curse DTV or rail against Scott and the Pac-12 — but ultimately, both sides made decisions that served their best interests … and led them down paths that would never intersect.
The story begins long before the stalemate appeared on the public radar. It begins in the early months of 2011, a full year-and-a-half before the expiration of the Pac-12's media rights deal with ESPN and Fox.
“We didn't have a specific model for a TV network predetermined,'' Scott recalled. “We were the conference of champions. We felt we should have a platform for the student athletes. From a brand perspective and a DNA perspective, if we were the best in the country, we ought to show it.
“But the RSNs (Fox's array of Regional Sports Networks) were a mixed bag. A lot of games were not available regionally. There was a tremendous deficit of coverage of football and basketball. And outside of sports, we felt it would be great if we could create an asset for the conference — having control, not just licensor rights, had appeal.
“So we hired media advisors and tried to find the optimal balance between maximum revenue and maximum national exposure, but also create our own network. We went to the marketplace, and most people tried to dissuade us — they told us not to start our own network. But we were determined.”
Scott went first to ESPN and Fox and discussed a model similar to the Big Ten Network — a joint venture with financial guarantees and carriage leverage. They described the discussions as “meaningful” and even received proposals.
“We decided the best way to go was to unbundle the Tier 1 (content) from the rest of it. We felt that if we separated the content, our opportunities would be better.”
On May 3, the conference unveiled the $3 billion Tier 1 deal with ESPN and Fox — and, behind the scenes, immediately began courting partners for what would become the Pac-12 Networks.
First stop: Mr. Derek Chang.
“If you're going to launch a national network, the best place to start is with a satellite provider,'' said a source with knowledge of the Pac-12's strategy.
“(The Pac-12) started with Chang and said, ‘We'd like you to be our partner. Buy from us wholesale so you don't have to pay the retail rate.' This was long before there were any substantive discussions with the cable companies.
“Derek said no. They probably thought they would have a hard time getting off the ground and didn't want to drive up the cost.”
The same source went on to describe Chang as “one of the true gentlemen in the business.”
When viewed from DirecTV's perspective, Chang had good reason for balking: Programming costs were soaring, affecting the margins for distributors. “We were trying to hold the line,'' they said.
And to an extent, DirecTV was already paying for the Pac-12 content.
The $3 billion outlay by ESPN and Fox would, over the 12-year deal, be passed on to the distributors (like DirecTV, Comcast, etc.) in the form of increased subscriber fees.
And that was for the premium football and men's basketball games on the Tier 1 networks.
Now the conference, in the form of a direct partnership with the Pac-12 Networks, was asking DirecTV to pay for the second-tier content, as well.
“The packaging not quite right initially,'' Chang said.
So the Pac-12 moved on. In late July (still 2011), Scott announced the creation of the Pac-12 Networks with four founding partners from the cable realm:
Time Warner, Comcast, Bright House and Cox would guarantee the Pac-12 cash upfront (to pay for the launch costs), annual income and initial carriage into millions of homes.
But the cable connection added stress to the DirecTV discussions during the year-long run-up to the launch.
“They did a deal with Time Warner (and others), and that boxed them in, and it boxed us in,'' Chang said. “The way the deal was structured, the MFN, the packaging, how it was carried — it was difficult to get comfortable with.”
The key letters in that comment: MFN.
They stand for Most Favored Nation, the term used to describe a model for structuring carriage deals. MFNs guarantee the same fees for all distributors of given a content package, regardless of when they come on the scene.
(One source said MFNs are a way of making sure the initial carriage partner doesn't look like a schmuck when subsequent deals are cut.)
Working with the cable partners, the Pac-12 structured its pricing package into three tiers:
Tier 1, the most expensive at approximately $0.80 per subscriber per month, was for the primary DMA (Designated Market Area). For the Pac-12/Bay Area feed, for example, this would be San Francisco.
Tier 2, believed to be in the $0.50 range, was for the outer DMA (i.e., Sacramento).
Tier 3, in the $0.10 range (approx), was for the Out-Of-Market region: Outside the conference's six-state footprint.
This was a standard approach to pricing for the cable companies, which, because of their distribution method (i.e., the pipes into homes) have the ability to turn networks on or off.
Comcast could offer the Pac-12 Networks' national feed on one system in Pennsylvania, for instance, but not on another.
“But DirecTV didn't have the ability to do that, to turn it on and off,'' said a source familiar with DTV's reasoning. “So the economics didn't work for them.”
In other words, DirecTV would have been on the hook for $0.10 per subscriber per month for all 15 million (approx) of its customers outside the Pac-12 footprint — that's $18 million per year — whether those customers wanted the Pac-12 Networks' national feed or not.
And the satellite giant believed that most customers in the eastern half of the country didn't care about the content on the Pac-12 national feed.
By the spring of 2012, with the launch of the Pac-12 Networks just months away, the landscape had grown treacherous
DirecTV had emerged from a carriage fight with Fox in the fall of 2011 and was about to enter another with Viacom. It was also in negotiations for the upcoming, and expensive, Lakers channel on Time Warner Cable.
Against this backdrop stood the MFN hurdle for the millions of DirecTV customers outside the Pac-12 footprint.
“We were choking on the implications of the MFN,'' said Chang, who declined to discuss specifics of the pricing. “We left it at that. They figured they'd launch and force us to carry them.''
By mid-summer, Chang had stepped away as the lead negotiator. (He would leave DirecTV at the end of the year.) But their replacement, Dan York, held the line.
On Aug. 15, 2012, the Pac-12 Networks launched with a groundbreaking structure of one national and six regional feeds designed to super-serve local fans.
Two weeks later, the football season began with USC ranked No. 1 and no DirecTV distribution for the Pac-12 Networks.
The pressure for a deal increased by the day.
The Pac-12 seemingly had one option: Eliminate subscriber fees for DirecTV's customers in the the Tier 3 zone (outside the footprint). But because of the MFN, it would have been forced to do the same for all subscribers on all systems.
Concerned that the business model would sustain long-term damage, the conference declined, according to two sources.
But another person with knowledge of the negotiations downplayed the significance of that issue: “DirecTV was looking for ways not to carry it.”
Asked if the Pac-12 Networks' model … the MFN … was the source of the impasse with DirecTV, Scott responded:
“If you take DirecTV out of it, no other major distributor doesn't carry the networks. Nothing about the model creates an impediment to national distribution.”
One week into the 2012 season, the Pac-12 signed a carriage deal with DirecTV's primary competitor, DISH, which, crucially, had a different subscriber base.
“DISH has more of its customers out west, so it worked for them,'' a source said. “The out-of-market issue wasn't as big of a concern for them.”
At that point, one week into the season, DirecTV assessed the response of its customers: How many would cancel, or threaten to cancel, if the satellite provider did not carry the Pac-12 Networks?
The company would have to be pushed to the tipping point, where it would lose enough in subscriber fees to make a deal with the Pac-12 Networks — something in the neighborhood of $40 million – $50 million annually — worthwhile.
The ongoing stalemate suggests that point was never reached.
One reason — perhaps the reason: Content.
The conference's Tier 1 deal is structured in a manner that gives Fox and ESPN the premium football games:
As soon as the schedule is released, each network selects two games for broadcast. In other words, the Pac-12 Networks never have access to the four best matchups in any given season — the games that could be used as leverage.
Notre Dame at USC: Never on the Pac-12 Networks.
Stanford-Oregon (during the heyday of that rivalry): Never on the Pac-12 Networks.
Stanford-USC: Never on.
Oregon-Washington: Never on.
USC-UCLA: No chance.
After the four choice games are removed from the inventory pool, ESPN, Fox and the Pac-12 Networks make their weekly selections; the contract gives ESPN and Fox the top picks.
The Pac-12 Networks are always left with non-conference games involving FCS opponents and with the second-tier games once conference play begins.
That package of content has never been compelling enough to force enough DirecTV customers to switch, or threaten to switch, to a provider that carries the Pac-12 Networks.
SEC fans would erupt if they couldn't watch their favorite team play Northern West Central Oklahoma State.
Pac-12 fans? Not so much.
“(The Pac-12) thought if they did the deals with the cable companies, the situation with DirecTV would work itself out,'' a source said.
“They felt there was enough demand that DirecTV would agree. Did they miscalculate the market? Probably.”
AT&T, which has a carriage deal with the Pac-12 through U-verse and a wide-ranging sponsorship deal with the conference at large, acquired DirecTV in 2015.
Even that failed to end the impasse: AT&T's proposal for DirecTV carriage was so one-sided that the Pac-12 presidents rejected it by a unanimous vote.
And here we are.
“‘I don't expect any DirecTV carriage for the Pac-12 Networks,'' a source said. “Once you don't have a deal, and you don't have one for years, life moves on.”

As the Democratic National Convention swings into high gear, Michael Reagan tells Newsmax that President Barack Obama is fumbling to find an easier litmus test than the one their father posed in their successful race against then incumbent Jimmy Carter.“Forget are you better off today than you were four years ago? How about 'are you better off today than you were yesterday?' ” declared Reagan, the son of America's 40th president in an exclusive interview on Tuesday.Inspired by Ronald Reagan's winning 1980 election pitch, Republicans have urged voters to ask themselves "are you better off today than you were four years ago?"Uncomfortably for Democratic supporters, the question has elicited a dizzying array of responses from President Barack Obama's allies, first "no" then "sort of" and finally "absolutely."Republicans salivated at such rare campaign vacillation — no doubt sensing a much-needed advantage as polls continue to show a tight race ahead of November's election."Apparently, for the 23 million Americans struggling for work, things have improved greatly in the last 24 hours," crowed Republican operative Joe Pounder.The younger Reagan also took aim at reports that Democrats have abandoned the words “God” and “Jerusalem” from the party's official platform, which was adopted at the outset of the Democratic gathering in Charlotte.“I'm not surprised at all,” they said. “I mean I don't know why people would be surprised that the Democrat Party removed Jerusalem and God from the platform.”Reagan added, “I think every year they get more Godless anyway.”Reagan said they “certainly” hopes that Republicans never do the same in the spirit of political correctness.“If the Republicans ever remove God, as my father once said, ‘When we forget that we're one nation under God, we'll be a nation gone under.' And Democrats have proved that they're under.”The Democrats may have good reason to alter Reagan's famous litmus test with unemployment at 8.3 percent today as compared to 7.8 percent when Obama took office. Moreover, one in every 686 homes in the United States was in the process of being repossessed in July, according to RealtyTrac, a data provider.Forty-three percent of Americans say economic conditions are "poor," according to Gallup. Almost two in three think things are getting worse, while 49 percent of adult Americans describe themselves as middle class, down from 53 percent in 2008, according to the Pew Research Center.Reagan joked that there may be a reason why Obama chose former President Bill Clinton to introduce them at the DNC other than Clinton's popularity.“The only reason I think Bill Clinton is introducing them is nobody else wanted to,” Reagan quipped. “I mean the fact of the matter is Clint Eastwood had the first empty chair. Now you're going to see many more.”AFP contributed to this article.

By day, Alice Allen runs software and IT training programmes for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, in Washington DC. But in their spare time, they edit the world's largest registry for software in astrophysics and astronomy research — the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL).
Allen talked to Nature from the sidelines of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in Florida about the importance of maintaining code registries — and why they hope other disciplines will adopt them.
How did you come to edit the ASCL?
I've always been interested in astronomy. So in 2010, I started doing volunteer work for the website Astronomy Picture of the Day. I told one of the site's creators — Robert Nemiroff, an astrophysicist at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, which hosts the ASCL — that I had time for another project. We talked about an effort that they and John Wallin (now at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro) had started in 1999, to create a repository of astrophysics source codes — the old ASCL. The resource had gathered about 40 source codes, but lay fallow at the time for want of an editor. I took it over and have been working on it ever since.
I work on the ASCL in my spare time, mostly evenings and weekends, and I take vacations to speak about it at conferences. It's an all-volunteer organization: we have two developers and an associate editor, Kimberly DuPrie, a programmer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. The advisory committee is made up of astrophysicists who do this because they think it's a good idea. There's a lot of passion around this project.
Why is the site important?
It increases the discoverability of code used in research. Like many other sciences, astrophysics has become more dependent on software. And as software use has increased, the transparency and reproducibility of the science has actually decreased — you can read a paper and may not be able to see the source code that enabled the results.
The ASCL holds nearly 1,200 records of source codes that have been used in research in peer-reviewed publications. Each entry is citable with a unique ID and points to a website where the code can be downloaded; entries include a description of the code, its authors and some of the research it appears in. We also house some source codes. The site got more than 100,000 hits in 2014. It provides a way for journals to point to a software record — it has been cited more than 500 times since 2012, according to NASA's Astrophysics Data System Abstracts Service, which indexes it.
How do entries get added to the library?
For the majority of entries, Kim and I look through research papers specifically to find codes to register, and we e-mail the authors; we know that coders won't necessarily think to register their codes with the ASCL. But since a site redesign in 2014, about 40% of the listings have come from scientists submitting their own entries, which we verify. We don't look at the quality of the code, but it has to meet our criteria, such as being used in research and immediately available to download.
If a link goes bad, we track down the code's new home. Journals don't have to worry about references to websites going stale: their links will stay good because they point to the ASCL.
How is it funded?
It's mostly unfunded. We have in the past received a few thousand dollars to cover things like conference presentations and poster production costs, from organizations such as the AAS and the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies in Germany. Sometimes my travel to conferences is funded, but often it is not. Over the long term, the goal is to make the ASCL financially stable, although a large part of it will always be volunteer-based.
Do other science disciplines have equivalent code libraries?
There are lots of code registries and repositories online, but they're usually not science-specific. We index codes that are useful specifically in astronomy and astrophysics. There isn't one site for all science codes, and maybe there should be.
I've had several people approach me about creating a similar resource for physics. So in December, we started offering clones of the ASCL infrastructure (which runs using open-source software) to any discipline that wants to build a code registry of its own. A sample site is at scicodes.net, and Michigan Technological University is willing to host other science code registries for three years if people would like. Nobody has taken us up on this offer yet, but they are welcome to try it out.
Paige Comstock Cunningham helped pioneer an approach to fighting abortion that emphasizes protecting women from harm. “You can't just focus on the child and not on the mother and their needs,” they say. (Joshua Lott/For The Washington Post)
When the Supreme Court meets next week to hear its first abortion-related case in nearly a decade, the justices will consider the most significant challenge to an argument that has become central to the antiabortion cause: that abortion hurts not just a fetus but also its mother.
That idea wasn't always at the heart of the movement, which for years spent more time highlighting what it considered the plight of the unborn child. But as the social and legal landscape has changed, the focus on women has taken center stage. And that shift has paid dividends, with state legislatures across the country enacting laws in the name of protecting women from allegedly unsafe conditions at abortion clinics.
At issue in the court case is part of a Texas law that imposes strict new requirements on clinic facilities and the doctors who work in them.
But regardless of how the court rules, antiabortion activists say the woman-centered emphasis isn't going away.
“You can't just focus on the child and not on the mother and their needs,” said Paige Comstock Cunningham, a lawyer and longtime antiabortion activist who is a professor at Trinity International University in Illinois.  They are a former president of Americans United for Life, a Washington-based nonprofit that helped pioneer the woman-focused approach to antiabortion advocacy.

The group also helped promote an incremental strategy to opposing abortion, advocating a host of restrictions at the state level over wholesale targeting of the Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationally in 1973. Today, versions of its model legislation on matters from parental notification to guidelines for medication-induced abortion have been adopted in many states, including Texas.
Abortion rights groups call these regulations disingenuous attempts to severely limit and ultimately end access to legal abortion, which these activists call one of the safest medical procedures available.
Cunningham had retired from the brutal abortion wars when, they said, in 1993 they were called by their Christian faith to return to the work. “I came with a fresh vision that, for 20 years, we had really focused on abortion from the perspective of the fetus,” they said. “The vision I laid out was a desire that we wake people up to the fact that abortion hurts women, too.”
Others were coming around to the idea as well. Frederica Mathewes-Green, former vice president of a group called Feminists for Life, said they had long doubted that the American public would be swayed only by arguments focused on the suffering of the fetus.
“It took a long time [for the movement] to realize nobody is listening when you say that,” they said. “It's what they already know. What they want to know is, how is the woman going to get past that?”
The shift to a more incremental, woman-focused approach was strategic as much as anything, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and the author of “After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate.”
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, abortion rights groups were gaining support with their message emphasizing a “woman's right to choose.” Americans had become increasingly concerned with women's equality. The 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey — the last time the court considered an abortion case this consequential — allowed states to limit abortion but dashed hopes that Roe v. Wade would be overturned altogether.

Moreover, polling showed that, in the face of clinic bombings, attacks on clinic staffers and aggressive protests, the public was beginning to view the antiabortion movement as “hardhearted,” Ziegler said.
Antiabortion leaders started “recognizing this was a pretty serious public relations issue,” they said. Many were “women who actually believed pretty deeply that abortion hurt women, and the reason that wasn't getting out was that women didn't have as much of a voice in the pro-life movement.”
Not everyone in the movement favored the new focus, particularly those who saw the women as complicit in the killing of their unborn children, Cunningham said. “I had someone who called me and said: ‘Why are you doing this? I think every abortion should be fatal to the mother,' ” they recalled. “I was horrified.”
Groups such as Americans United for Life went on to amplify arguments that abortion causes a litany of harms to women and claimed the existence of a disorder called post-abortion syndrome — a version of post-traumatic stress disorder. They also began highlighting dangers they said women faced as a result of unsafe conditions and a lack of regulations in abortion clinics.
Abortion rights groups counter that abortion is one of the safest medical procedures available, citing research showing that abortions in the first trimester, when the vast majority of abortions occur, have very little risk of major complications that might require hospitalization.
Since a Republican sweep of legislatures and governor's mansions in 2010, states have enacted nearly 300 abortion restrictions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank. Many of those laws are predicated on possible harms that may come to women from unsafe conditions at abortion clinics.
The restrictions range from multi-day waiting periods and state-approved counseling to mandatory ultrasounds and regulations governing the physical nature of abortion clinics.
Among the questions the Supreme Court will ponder in the Texas case, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, on March 2 is: When considering such laws, do courts have to look at the scientific evidence supporting them? A lower court concluded that they do not and that legislatures have broad leeway to make these decisions.
One of the Texas provisions at issue requires abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers. Typically, abortions early in pregnancy are performed in settings more closely resembling doctor's offices.
Supporters of this rule say the invasive nature of surgical abortions suggests they must be done in hospital-like environments. Critics, however, with the backing of major medical groups such as the American Medical Association, argue that such requirements are unnecessary. They call this regulation a smokescreen to force clinics, particularly low-volume clinics in rural areas that can't afford to comply, to shut down.
The other provision in question requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals, which would allow the doctors to treat patients there in case of emergency. Supporters call this another common-sense measure to protect women. But opponents note that hospitals will accept any patient in an emergency. Moreover, they say abortion providers often can't get such privileges because they live too far away or because hospitals are unwilling to jump into the abortion debate, among other reasons.
Abortion rights activists say they have watched the evolution of the antiabortion strategy with deep skepticism.
“I think those who oppose abortion have been consistently opportunistic since the '80s and will promote whatever argument gets them closer to overruling Roe and, as a practical matter, making abortion unavailable,” said Dawn Johnsen, a law professor at Indiana University and a former Clinton administration official who long worked in the abortion rights arena.
These activists call the idea that women need protection from their own decisions condescending and deeply offensive.
“Women see right through it,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, chief executive of Whole Woman's Health, a chain of abortion clinics that is the plaintiff in the case before the Supreme Court.
They said 70 percent of the women who come to their clinics are mothers, meaning they are well aware of what it means to terminate a pregnancy. As they go through the hoops necessary to obtain an abortion in Texas — a state-approved counseling session, followed by a 24-hour waiting period and a mandatory ultrasound — they often become upset, they said.
“They get super-offended,” they said. “And it's because they know women are completely capable to face the moral and ethical ramifications of what they're doing. They don't need coddling or protection.”
Even as this strategy is being litigated, abortion foes are pushing a new raft of state bills, many of which echo the days when the fetus was more often at the center of their arguments. These measures gained momentum last summer after an antiabortion activist mounted an undercover “sting” targeting Planned Parenthood, the large women's health nonprofit and abortion provider, purporting to show that the organization illegally sells fetal tissue for a profit.
So far, state and federal investigations have turned up no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood, but a grand jury in Texas indicted the activists behind the project for falsifying government documents as part of their ruse.
Several states are considering bills to require “humane” disposal of fetal tissue, in some cases mandating that the material be buried or cremated.
Other states, citing concerns for the fetus, are considering bans on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy or earlier. Some states are cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood.
At least two states are considering bills that would bar women from obtaining abortions if the reason is a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. If enacted, these bills would create a paradox — allowing abortion if no reason is given but barring the procedure if the reason is the fetal anomaly.
The return to these types of laws is by no means a radical departure for the antiabortion movement, said Ziegler, the Florida law professor.
“The movement's ultimate focus has always been fetal rights,” they said. The anti-Planned Parenthood videos simply “reminded the movement of how much leverage they can get from fetal rights arguments.”
Cunningham and others acknowledge that, in their hearts, they believe in the full humanity of the fetus from the moment of conception and would like to see abortion ended in this country. But they object to the idea that the regulations are simply a means to that end.
“Why could we not care about how women are being hurt in abortion clinics and still be pro-life?” said Charmaine Yoest, current president of Americans United for Life. “It's designed to shut our voices down.”
Op-Ed: Where Is the Outrage for Gays Killed by ISIS?
Michael Lucas asks, where are the celebrities, LGBT leaders, and progressive politicians who decried Dolce & Gabbana's slights, yet remain silent over ISIS murders of gay men in the name of Islam?
The backlash against Dolce and Gabbana last week was immediate, brutal, and covered by news outlets from The New York Times to The Advocate to E! Online.
The gay fashion icons had made some decidedly unfashionable remarks about same-sex marriage and gay parenting, including “The only family is the traditional one,” along with a reference to “synthetic” children.
The negative response from both the LGBT community and straight people was, I think, quite appropriate. But it only deepened my frustration over the relatively modest amount of news coverage and the surprising absence of protest over an issue of far greater importance to gays, lesbians, and all people of good will: the executions of men suspected of being gay by Islamic extremists in Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere in the Muslim world.
In recent months ISIS has released photos and videos of its masked members dragging these men to the rooftops of tall buildings and pushing them off, to the apparent delight of crowds below. In several cases, the hapless victims reportedly survived the fall, only to be stoned to death by onlookers.
The murders, which have taken place in ISIS strongholds such as Mosul and Raqqa, are often preceded by a jihadi denouncing the Koran-prohibited “crime” of sodomy. And they're accompanied by cries of the Islamic phrase “Allahu akbar,” “God is great.”
Killing gays by making them plunge off high buildings is just the newest method used by Muslim radicals; other, more traditional means of murder are also in full force. Photos published on social media this month show the beheadings of two men for alleged homosexuality in the Nineveh province of Iraq, after a man described by a local official as an “Islamic State religious judge” read an indictment. Others have reportedly been crucified, and some mercilessly mutilated.
I ask you to envision a similar, horrific scenario in a very different location. Imagine if priests were tossing gay men off the top of St. Peter's Basilica into the square below, with jubilant crowds filling Vatican City yelling “Praise be to Jesus Christ” (or the equivalent in Latin or Italian).
It is considered brave to bash the pope or a cardinal, but when anyone does the same of Muslim clerics, that critic is called a racist, an Islamophobe, or prejudiced.
Wouldn't the Vatican scenario I described above be the headline on every American newspaper, the lead story on every newscast, the top trending topic on Twitter? Would not every LGBT leader, every human rights activist, every liberal and right-thinking person in the U.S. denounce the atrocities, as well as the religion that gave rise to such hateful actions? Would the streets of American cities not fill with protest marches and angry demonstrations?
Yet radical Muslims somehow seem to get a pass. Intensive news coverage and progressive protests apparently get detained at the border of Islam. Why is there this atrocious double standard?
There was worldwide revulsion when ISIS burned to death the caged Jordanian pilot, and decapitated Western journalists. But where is the outrage when Muslims publicly murder Muslim men for being gay, or stone to death Muslim women for adultery or for having been raped?
It's been called “the soft bigotry of low expectations,” this notion that Muslims can't be held to the same standards of behavior as those of other faiths. Liberal voices often compare conservative Christians or Jews with radical Muslims. But have longtime anti-gay preacher Pat Robertson or Judaism's Lubavitcher Rebbe ever advocated actual violence against gay “sinners”?
Of course not. Political correctness, however, forces us to tiptoe around the truth that Islamists today are slaughtering people for homosexuality, blasphemy, and adultery, not to mention for sketching pictures of Muhammad.
Some courageous voices in both the liberal and Muslim communities have spoken out against the recent barbarism.
The insightful books of Wafa Sultan and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, two personal heroes of mine, grace my bookshelves. Both women secularized so they cannot even be counted as Islamic voices and in fact they are no longer welcome in the Muslim community and have bodyguards when they make public appearances. Where are the celebrities, LGBT leaders, and progressive politicians who decry the slightest hint of homophobia, yet remain silent when gay men descend to their deaths at the hands of thugs who say they are acting in the name of Islam?
In speaking recently about Muslim terrorism, President Obama, who cannot even bring themselves to utter the phrase “Islamic extremism,” said, “Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.”
The president entirely misses the point. Christianity and Judaism have continued to evolve over the centuries. In the last few days alone, the Presbyterian Church became the largest Protestant group to formally recognize gay marriage. And a Reform rabbi became the first openly lesbian president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. Much of Islam, however, is like a mountain that has never moved during the thousand four hundred of years of its existence.
Seventy years ago, the average American citizen might have been able to say, despite sporadic news reports, that they or they were not aware of the evil that was taking place inside Nazi concentration camps. Today, none of us can make that claim about the evil that is radical Islam. Smartphones in the very hands of the killers show us their savagery, and we excuse or ignore it at our own peril.

Sen. Russ Feingold warned on Tuesday that Barack Obama's plans for Iraq and Afghanistan were too vague, too costly, and could -- in the direst of scenarios -- result in the weakening of U.S. national security.
In an interview with the Huffington Post, Feingold went to great lengths to praise the president for making dramatic changes to our international relations approach and diplomatic and military policy. "Certainly," they declared, "the Obama proposals are so much better than the previous administration that you have to at least acknowledge that."
But the Wisconsin Democrat, known for their willingness to buck party orthodoxy on issues of foreign affairs and civil liberties, did little to hide their concern about various aspects of the Obama approach to the two ongoing wars. Addressing Iraq first, Feingold said the decision to leave a residual force of 50,000 troops in that country past 2010 went "way beyond" what was needed and could have serious fiscal and national security implications.
"The first downside is that it is enormously expensive for the United States," said the Senator. "The president has talked repeatedly about the cost of the war. Maintaining 50,000 troops there is a drain on our economy and our ability to recover. But it also perpetuates resentment, in terms of people feeling that this is an occupation of a country. If we can eliminate that perception the better. I understand that where the troops will be place and how they will be viewed publicly will make that less of a problem. So I think that would be a good thing. But I think, basically having 50,000 troops in somebody else's country is not the way you want to go, after all these years, unless it is absolutely essential. And I don't think it is absolutely essential."
Feingold was even more wary of Obama's proposal for Afghanistan. Having expressed concern on this issue well before the election, the Senator repeated what has become for them a tried-and-true mantra: what is the mission?
"In some ways, I'm even more concerned about this proposal for Afghanistan than I am about the president's plans for Iraq," they said, "because I don't think the policy review and plan is in place to explain why these troops are going there. ... It doesn't really build an understanding of the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is the central problem. So to just put more troops into Afghanistan without a clear purpose, to me, is putting the cart before the horse and it is not the way to go."
In the worst of scenarios, Feingold warned, an influx of troops into Afghanistan would lead to the Taliban fleeing into neighboring Pakistan. "Think of the problems with Pakistan involving the Taliban," they said. Would the United States be obligated to move ground forces into Pakistan? And where were the "non-military aspects of trying to bring stability" to both those countries?
Through it all, the Senator punctuated their observations with broader compliments for the new direction the Obama administration was taking. They praised the president for an "historic departure from the lawlessness of the Bush administration, on everything from the announcement [of the closing of] Guantanamo and [the ending of] torture to the release of some of the key documents relating to some of the abuses." The new White House, in short, was a breath of fresh air.
But those accomplishments were not enough for Feingold to keep quiet their disagreements, among which they included the assertion of executive powers that boarded on exceeding the boundaries of the Constitution. The Senate expressed a mix of concern and mild disappointment with two recent moves by the administration. The first: to give the Attorney General the authority to determine the merit of a lawsuit against a telecommunications company involved in the government's warrantless wiretapping program (the administration was overruled by the courts). The second: to deny detainees being held in Afghanistan the right to legally challenge their detention.
The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has put together projects for two new metro lines to provide additional relief for Istanbul's congested traffic, especially on the shores of the Bosporus.
One new metro line will be between the Beykoz and Üsküdar districts on the Asian side and the other will be constructed between Beşiktaş and Sarıyer on the European side of the city.
The tender for the projects will be held on June 27.
The Beykoz-Üsküdar line will be 18 kilometers long. The construction of the line is aimed to be completed in about 10 months after the bidding. The line will shorten the time it takes to travel between the two districts to about 30 minutes. Currently, it can take more than two hours during times of heavy traffic congestion.
The Beşiktaş-Sarıyer line will be 18.4 kilometers long and the tender bid for its construction will also be held on June 27. After completion, this line will also join with the Kabataş-Mahmutbey metro line.

The Pokémon franchise revolves around 809 fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs and skills. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The designs for the multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything, such as inanimate objects, real-world animals, or mythology. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, only a handful of artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon. However, by 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.
The vast array of creatures is commonly divided into "Generations", with each division primarily encompassing new titles in the main video game series and often a change of handheld platform. Generation I refer to Red, Green, Blue and Yellow; Generation II refers to Gold, Silver, and Crystal; Generation III refers to Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald; Generation IV refers to Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum; Generation V refers to Black, White, Black 2, and White 2, Generation VI refers to X and Y; and Generation VII refers to Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, plus the two Mythical Pokémon introduced in Let's Go, Pikachu!, and Let's Go, Eevee!. Each Generation is also marked by the addition of new Pokémon: 151 in Generation I in the Kanto Region, 100 in Generation II in the Johto region, 135 in Generation III in the Hoenn region, 107 in Generation IV in the Sinnoh region, 156 in Generation V in the Unova region, 72 in Generation VI in the Kalos region, and 88 in Generation VII in the Alola and Kanto regions.
Due to the large number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into articles by generation. The 809 Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced at the time of their respective generations along with older generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100 species introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original 151 species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. Generation V is a notable exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex and is also uniquely numbered as number 0.
Concept [ edit ]
Pokémon An animated history of how Satoshi Tajiri came to conceive
The premise of Pokémon in general was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri—who later founded Game Freak—in 1989, when the Game Boy was released. The creatures that inhabit the world of Pokémon are also called Pokémon.[1] The word "Pokémon" is a romanized contraction of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā).[2] The concept of the Pokémon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, stems most notably from Tajiri's childhood hobby of insect collecting. Other influences on the concept include Ultraman, anime, and playing video games in general. Throughout their early life, Tajiri saw their rural, nature-filled hometown (Machida, Tokyo) transform into an urban center. The urbanization of their town drove away wildlife and they and others living in the area were eventually unable to collect insects. Through Pokémon, Tajiri sought to bring back this outdoor pastime and share it with the world.[1] The first games in the franchise, Red and Green, were released on 27 February 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy;[3] the games saw an international release as Red and Blue in September 1998.[4] The ability to capture, battle, trade, and care for numerous creatures catapulted Pokémon to international popularity[2] and it has become a multibillion-dollar franchise and the second-best selling video game series, only behind the Mario franchise.[5]
At the start of a main series Pokémon game, the player character receives one of three "starter" Pokémon, with which they can battle and catch other Pokémon. Each Pokémon has one or two "types", such as Fire, Water, or Grass. In battle, certain types are strong against other types. For example, a fire-type attack will do more damage to a grass-type Pokémon than a water-type attack.[6] This form of gameplay is frequently compared to that of rock-paper-scissors, though players have to strategize which Pokémon and which of their attacks to use against various opponents.[7][8]
Many species of Pokémon are capable of evolving into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to a wider variety of attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species. Some Pokémon have differences in appearance due to gender. Pokémon can be male or female, male-only, female-only, or genderless.[9]
Though the Pokémon franchise is primarily intended for younger players, each Pokémon has various complex attributes such as natures, characteristic traits, Individual Values (IVs), and Effort Values (EVs). These, according to Game Freak Board Director Junichi Masuda, are intended for people "who enjoy battling and want to go more in depth". These individual statistics were also included because the basic concept of the franchise is to train one's Pokémon. Designer Takeshi Kawachimaru stated that IVs and EVs "help to make each Pokémon in the game individual", as it adds unique aspects to them.[10] Each Pokémon game introduces a few "Legendary" and "Mythical" Pokémon that are powerful, rare, and hard to catch.[11] Pokémon Sun and Moon introduced "Ultra Beasts", which are described as "beings from another dimension" that appeared in the Alola region and are similarly powerful and rare.[12]
Design and development [ edit ]
(center) and its eight evolutions, collectively referred to as "Eeveelutions". Each one requires a different method to evolve and prominently represent the new type they don.[13] The evolution mechanic is most prominently displayed through Eevee and its eight evolutions, collectively referred to as "Eeveelutions". Each one requires a different method to evolve and prominently represent the new type they don.
Throughout development of Red and Green, all Pokémon were designed by Ken Sugimori, a long-time friend of Tajiri, and a team of fewer than ten people,[14] including Atsuko Nishida who is credited as the designer of Pikachu.[15][16] By 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. A committee of five people determine which designs are incorporated into the games, with Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida finalizing the look of each creature.[14][17] Furthermore, Sugimori is responsible for the boxart legendary Pokémon and all of the official artwork for the games.[14][18] According to Yoshida, the number of rejected Pokémon designs is five to ten times more than the number that are finalized in each game.[17] In rare cases, rejected designs are brought back and released in a later generation.[19] Shigeru Ohmori, director of Sun and Moon, admitted that creating new Pokémon has become a difficult task with the sheer number of creatures designed over the franchise's 20-year history.[20] Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.[21]

The designs for Pokémon are often highly analogous to real-life creatures, but also encompass inanimate objects.[21] Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno have stated that inspiration for Pokémon designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture across the world provide the basis for countless ideas to be incorporated into the franchise.[22] The environment a Pokémon would live in is taken into account when they are designed.[23] The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region of Sun and Moon.[20] Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason.[23] In some cases, the design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that.[24] Some designers look to game mechanics for inspiration, seeing where particular typing combinations could be interesting.[20] Typing assignment varies during the design process, sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created and other times they are designed around a particular type.[25] Each Pokémon has a specific height and weight.[26]
The simpler roots of designs in Generation I prompted greater complexity in later games.[21] Designs, in general, have become increasingly complex and thematic in newer games.[18] Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics.[27] New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France).[18] However, by the release of X and Y in 2013, Sugimori stated they wish for Pokémon design to return to the simpler roots of the franchise.[28]
Masuda considers the starter Pokémon to be among the most important in the franchise; Yoshida goes further and calls them "the face of that generation" and says that "they're the ones that should be on the packaging".[17] The three starter Pokémon of each generation are Grass-, Water-, and Fire-types, a trio that Masuda considers to be the easiest to understand for new players.[25] In an interview with GamesRadar in 2009, Masuda stated that simple Pokémon take around six months to design and develop, whereas Pokémon that play a more important part in the games (such as starter Pokémon) may take over a year. Masuda added, "We also want the designer to have as much freedom as possible, we don't want to narrow down their imagination by saying 'We want this kind of Pokémon.' When we talk to the designer we always stress that they shouldn't think of Pokémon necessarily, but should instead just be as creative as they can." After the Pokémon is designed it is sent to the "Battle Producer", who decides which moves and stats the Pokémon should have.[10]

Meltan and Melmetal [ edit ]
The Steel-type Mythical Pokémon Meltan was initially teased through Pokémon Go on September 22, 2018, appearing with the name "???" before transforming into Ditto once caught.[38] It was officially revealed on September 25, 2018. It is a small metallic creature composed of liquid metal with a hexagonal nut serving as its head.[39] Meltan can be caught in the wild exclusively in Pokémon Go after connecting with a copy of Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee!, but can be transferred over to copies of Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee![40] An evolution of Meltan, Melmetal, was later revealed on October 24; Melmetal can only be obtained in-game in Pokémon Go by evolving Meltan, but can also be transferred to copies of Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee![29]
Glitch species [ edit ]
In the Game Boy Pokémon games, Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, players were able to access a set of 105 glitch Pokémon. These species were not designed by the games' designers, but could be encountered in a small area of the game. Among these species is a glitch dubbed MissingNo., which became highly notorious.[41]
Notes [ edit ]
Studies conducted at several medical schools and institutions, shows that researchers may be closer to finding a treatment for ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. When neural stem cells were transplanted into multilevels of the spinal cord of a mouse model with familial ALS, disease onset and progression slowed, motor and breathing function improved and treated mice survived three to four times longer than untreated mice.
Results from a meta-analysis of 11 independent amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research studies are giving hope to the ALS community by showing, for the first time, that the fatal disease may be treatable.
Researchers say progress in treating ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, may be made by targeting new mechanisms revealed by neural stem cell-based studies.
“This significant research will help us better understand the mechanisms underlying motor neuron diseases,” said Yang (Ted) Teng, HMS associate professor of surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital and one of the study's co-lead authors. Teng is also director of the Spinal Cord Injury and Stem Cell Biology Research Laboratory in the Department of Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women's.
The research studies were conducted at Brigham and Women's, Boston Children's Hospital, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, UMass Medical School, Johns Hopkins University, SUNY-Syracuse, Columbia University and the VA Boston Healthcare System.
ALS causes nerve cells in the spinal cord to die, eventually taking away a person's ability to move or even breathe. A decade of research conducted at multiple institutions shows, however, that when neural stem cells were transplanted into multilevels of the spinal cord of a mouse model with familial ALS, disease onset and progression slowed, motor and breathing function improved and treated mice survived three to four times longer than untreated mice.
A summary of the findings from all 11 studies was published online in December in Science Translational Medicine.
The transplanted neural stem cells help by producing factors that preserve the health and function of the host's remaining nerve cells. They also reduce inflammation and suppress the number of disease causing cells in the host's spinal cord.
“This work sheds new light on detrimental roles played by non-neuronal cells in triggering motor neuron death, and these events should be targeted for developing more effective therapeutics to treat ALS,” Teng said.
The transplanted neural stem cells benefited the mice with ALS by boosting the health and function of their remaining nerve cells. The neural stem cells also reduced inflammation and suppressed the number of disease-causing cells in their spinal cords. The neural stem cells did not replace deteriorating nerve cells. Researchers observed improved motor performance and respiratory function in the treated mice. The neural stem cell transplant also slowed the disease's progression. Twenty-five percent of the treated ALS mice in the study survived for one year or more—roughly three to four times longer than untreated mice.
“This is not a cure for ALS,” said Teng, who is one of the principal investigators of Project ALS' consortium project. “But it shows the potential that mechanisms used by neural stem cells in our study have for improving an ALS patient's quality of life and length of life.”
Neural stem cells are the precursors of all brain cells. They can self-renew, making more neural stem cells, and differentiate, becoming nerve cells or other brain cells. The cells can also rescue malfunctioning nerve cells and help preserve and regenerate host brain tissue.
The transplanted neural stem cells helped the ALS mice, but not for the obvious reason that they replaced nerve cells missing in the ALS spinal cord. The biggest impact actually came from a series of other beneficial neural stem cell activities. It turns out neural stem cells produce protective molecules. They also trigger host cells to produce their own protective molecules. In turn, these factors help spare host nerve cells from further destruction.
A number of other positive events then take place in treated mice. The transplanted normal neural stem cells change the fate of the host's own diseased neural stem cells for the better. This change decreases the number of toxin producing, disease promoting cells in the host's spinal cord. Transplanted neural stem cells also reduce inflammation.
Researchers discovered that cell replacement played a surprisingly small role in the impressive clinical benefits. Rather, the stem cells changed the host environment for the better and protected the endangered nerve cells.
The research studies were primarily funded by Project ALS, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Christopher Reeve Foundation/American Paralysis Association, the Sanford Children's Research Center, the A-T Children's Project and the Zinberg Foundation.

Earlier this year, glam-poppers Panic! At the Disco generated headlines — and tons of community support — when they took on the controversial Westboro Baptist Church. After the homophobic organization announced plans to picket the band's Kansas City show (in protest of frontman Brendon Urie's comments to the press about their "sexual fluidity" and past sexual experimentation), the band struck back, by vowing to donate $20 to the LGBTQ charity Human Rights Campaign for every church member who showed up. When only 13 Westboro picketers actually arrived at the scene, the band simply rounded up their donation to $1,000; they gave 5 percent of that night's merchandise sales to the HRC as well.
Westboro retaliated with a poorly conceived Panic! At the Disco parody single, but clearly Urie and company won this battle. Sitting backstage months later, before their Yahoo On the Road show at the Comerica Theatre in Phoenix, Urie tells Yahoo Music that they have received nothing but positive feedback regarding the incident.
Photos: Panic! At the Disco performs for Yahoo On the Road
Read on as Urie talks about emotional teen fan responses, their own wild teen years (and how their very religious parents were always their biggest supporters despite all that), other causes near and dear to their heart… and if Panic will ever cover Westboro's funny flop single, "You Love Sin, What a Tragedy."
YAHOO MUSIC: What sort of response have you gotten from the whole Westboro feud? Are people mostly supportive?
BRENDON URIE: Yeah, it's encouraging and validating to see the positive response, because it gave us this attention for a cause that we already believe in. We already planned on donating to this charity of our choice, and it just gave us more attention. It kind of reinvigorated some hope for me for the future — because I haven't really gotten any negative feedback. It's all been positive. It seems like everybody agrees with us.
Really? You weren't bombarded with Twitter hate from homophobes, or anything like that?
No… I mean, I can go back and check! [laughs] I'd be curious now. No, we didn't. Everything was really positive. It was really cool to see that. When you make a move in that direction and you're not alone, it's a very validating feeling — that most people think what I'm thinking. That's really awesome.
Can you talk about any especially great responses you received from fans?
Oh, yeah. I got a couple of really moving tweets from a few fans, like maybe a couple days after the whole debauchery of Westboro. One in particular: A girl tweeted me a link to a Tumblr they had written, this whole thing, like, "You actually gave me the courage to come out to my parents and tell them who I am and what I believe in," all this stuff. That's a huge move. Because I remember telling my parents what I believed, and how terrified I was. Not having a support system can be so daunting. Psychologically, it takes a toll on you. You're like, "Am I worthless? What am I doing? Why do they not believe in me?" So it was really touching to see that I have, even if it's a small impact, some kind of impact. It's why I get to do what I do, because of fans. The fact that they show me such a positive response is, like, unreal.
What was it that you told your own parents that made you so terrified?
My family is very religious. So I remember when I was 17 and I had just joined the band... I was like, "Well, I just have to man up. I have to do this and kind of be a grownup. I need to sit down with my parents and act like an adult." And I sat down with them at the table in our living room. I said, "I'm so honest with you guys, and I want to tell you everything." So I went through it all: "I've been having sex casually. I've been dealing drugs on and off for the last few years." I laid it all out. And at the very end, I just laid the full atom bomb: "And I'm an atheist. I have been since I was 13. Just want you guys to know." That just crushed them. I felt terrible for years after that. But my parents were cool afterwards — as daunted as they were, and as shocked as they were and appalled at my information. It was really rough for like a few months, and then after that they were just like, "You know what? You're going to be who you're going to be, and regardless, we're proud of you." And that's a big move. They were so scared to know that instead of religion in college, I wanted to do a band. They were just like, "What are you doing? You're going to starve. You're not going to be able to make a living." But I am proud because the way they handled it was so cool. Because I was a maniac! I was a maniac as a teenager; I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I was crazy. But they were so cool about it.
North West Passage blocked with ice - yachts caught
North West Passage - showing ice blockages Environment Canada North West Passage - showing ice blockages Environment Canada http://www.ec.gc.ca/
by Douglas Pohl/Sail-World Cruising on 30 Aug 2013The Passage has become blocked with 5/10 concentrated drifting sea ice at both the eastern and at the western ends of Canada's Arctic Archipelago. At least 22 yachts and other vessels are in the Arctic at the moment. Some who were less advanced have retreated and others have abandoned their vessels along the way. Still others are caught in the ice in an unfolding, unresolved drama.The real question is if and when the Canadian Coast Guard(CCG) decides to take early action to help the yachts exit the Arctic before freeze-up... or will they wait until it becomes an emergency rescue operation?The first blockage area is at Prince Regent Inlet in position 73.7880535N, -89.2529297W which became blocked on 27th August with 5/10 ice concentration with 7/10 ice pushing.This effectively closes the 2013 Northwest Passage without Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker escorts for transit. The alternative is a very technical and risky southern navigation through Fury & Hecla Strait mostly blocked with sea ice.Currently there is a commercial cruise ship on a west to east passage which will reach Prince Regent Inlet in another day. It is unknown if there is a CCG icebreaker in the area to provide assistance since government ships do not provide Automatic Identification Service (AIS) to public AIS websites.Since one of the Canadian Coast Guard's prime missions is to provide icebreaking for commercial shipping it will be interesting to see if Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Government views this as an opportunity for good public relations to help recreational yachts transiting the Northwest Passage.Another choke-point stopping marine traffic is on the western Canadian Arctic at Cape Bathurst in position 70.6672443N, -128.2763672W which became blocked on 26th August with 2/10 ice concentration and quickly filled with 5/10 ice on 27th August and today has 8/10 ice pushing towards Cape Bathurst. Latest word is the ice is retreating at an agonizing 1 nautical mile per day northward.
There are a number of yachts known to be in the Cambridge Bay area heading west: ACALEPHE (CA), ISATIS (NEW CALEDONIA), LA BELLE EPOQUE (DE), LIBELLULE (CHE), NOEME (FRA), and TRAVERSAY III (CA). PAS PERDU LE NORD (DE) was ahead by 10 days and has already gone on to Arctic Alaska waters. While BALTHAZAR (CA) departed from Inuvik a month ago and is now on the hard in Nome Alaska.
The following yachts are enroute from the west to the east: ANNA (?), rowboat ARCTIC JOULE (CA), DODO'S DELIGHT (GBR), EMPIRICUS (USA). rowboat FAIRMONT's PASSION (USA), tandem-kayak IKIMAYIA (CA), in Russian sea ice is LADY DANA (POL), POLAR BOUND (GBR), rowboat ROWING ICE (FRA), in Russian sea ice is TARA (FRA), and a group of jetskis known as DANGEROUS WATERS (USA) reported east of Gjoa Haven.
Several updates on known others:
LE MANGUIER (FRA) is wintering over in the ice at Paulatuk. Motor Yacht Lady M II (Marshal Islands) was escorted by CCGS icebreaker HENRY LARSEN through Bellot Strait eastbound on 20130824. ARCTIC TERN (GBR) and TOOLUKA (NED) retreated to the east towards Greenland/Newfoundland away from Bellot Strait on 20130822 with the opinion that the Arctic ice was finished melting and freeze-up would prevent them from reaching the Northwest Passage finish line at the Arctic Circle in the Bering Strait.

Stephanie Schechter was having a pretty ordinary spring day, up until a sea lion pup jumped up onto their surfboard.
It was early April, and after class at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the student and model grabbed their longboard, which is painted to look like a watermelon, and headed to the stretch of beach behind campus.
It's pretty common for Schechter to see a variety of animals while surfing there -- like dolphins, which "get so close to the surfers that they brush beneath our feet," they say. "When the water is clear, I can see beautiful fish, rays, and sharks -- usually the kind that don't bite. One of the most breathtaking sights is to watch migrating whales pass through, but usually they're pretty far out to sea."
It's not even that odd to see seals and sea lions. "But it is rare for them to hop up on boards!" says Schechter.
This one didn't just hop up. The pup, which may have been abandoned by its mother and was in need of care, snuggled up close.
"I knew they must have been unwell, because they were quite a young pup to be away from their mother, but they didn't seem injured or sick! I coaxed them back into the water but they hopped right back onto my board, cuddling and nuzzling up to me, as if I was their mother," Schechter wrote in a blog post for Swell.com about the encounter. "A young boy and their father saw me, and paddled out. They too were excited, and the boy even asked me, 'are you a mermaid?!' They were also kind enough to use my camera to take a picture of me with the pup (my selfie attempts weren't working out so well)! When the young boy paddled up to my board, approaching the pup, they growled at him, and waddled over to me for safety. The boy and their father went in to look for help, but no one of authority was around!"
After a couple hours, Schechter contacted Paul Stark, a sea lion authority with the Santa Barbara Marine Mammal Center, who was able to come by and collect the pup. Schechter was, by then, calling the little grey animal Winifred the Pinniped.
Stark brought Winifred in for a month's worth of rehabilitation, before releasing Winifred back into the ocean. They tell The Huffington Post that it's actually fairly common for sea lions to "hang out on anything that floats," especially if they are young, abandoned by their mothers and malnourished like Winifred was.
This year, animal care experts along the Pacific Ocean in California have seen a spike in the number of ailing seals and sea lion pups, and they're not completely sure what the cause is. Stark says their group has rescued almost 300 marine mammals so far this year.
Several weeks after meeting Winifred, Schechter themselves even helped save another sea lion.
"I was going for a run on the beach before class. I came across another tiny sea lion sitting on some rocks," they say. "I saw that this pup was even thinner than Winifred, so I figured it was in the same situation, abandoned and starving. I called up the marine mammal center once again and actually got to assist in helping to load the pup into the truck!"
Stark cautions that it's important not to be seduced into thinking that anyone could just move to California and take up surfing, with the dream of finding a personal sea lion buddy. The adorable-looking animals can be "bitey and dangerous," they say, adding that Schechter was "lucky they aren't bitten."
Schechter does indeed feel lucky.
"I have always been a huge animal lover, so being able to form a special connection with an amazing marine mammal really touched me," they say. "Being able to help a sea animal in need allowed me to give back to the place I love the most: the ocean. This was absolutely the most incredible and special event that I have ever experienced."

The Magma Chamber was planned to be one of the most expansive game modes introduced to League of Legends. Riot had originally shared their plans for a new Field of Justice back in 2010, as the development team wanted to explore new ways they could build upon the MOBA genre. The community was excited to explore the new volcanic arena, but after multiple teases the new map was cancelled and its development ceased. Here are all the details on a map that briefly saw the light before being condemned to the darkness of League of Legends history.
The lore
The volcanic Field of Justice was sculpted deep within an obsidian mountain by the Institute of War in order to create the League's most intense arena. The Magma Chamber was built specifically to address the increasing number of disputes between Demacia and Noxus, while also stopping the violence from ravaging the surrounding land. Summoner's Rift may be the most commonly used Field of Justice in Valoran, but the Magma Chamber was by far the largest.
Hot magma oozed and cascaded throughout the arena, which forced champions to work together when pushing toward the enemy nexus. The molten landscape also created many options for those who enjoyed planning their attacks, but because of the map's size, coordinated team play was always essential to every victory. The League even prepared a host of new monsters that would inhabit the Chamber, and aimed to provide champions with their greatest challenge yet.
How it played
Magma Chamber was designed for 5v5 play, similar to Summoner's Rift, but it was intended to have a different feel and strategic approach. Unlike the Rift, which focuses on larger team fights in the mid to late game, Magma Chamber put emphasis on smaller, more tactical fights that required players to have excellent map awareness if they wanted to achieve victory in specific lanes. The map was much bigger than Summoner's Rift and featured longer lanes that actively discouraged players from roaming round as a team. The sheer size of the map meant that players also had to rely on their own skills in 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 scenarios, as receiving support from a fellow teammate would be a much rarer occurrence.
A failed gank in Magma Chamber would waste a lot of time and had a greater impact on the outcome of the game. In Summoner's Rift ganking has it risks, but you rarely lose multiple turrets when you're roaming to help a fellow teammate. It was hoped that the increased risk would lead to greater strategy and coordination between players.
The map concept art shows that Magma Chamber featured four static teleportation pads located between the lanes. These pads weren't designed with ganking in mind, but they did offer unique ways for players to quickly get back to their lanes and access key objectives. Riot had also planned a slew of new neutral jungle monsters that would buff the team who managed to successfully defeat them. Even League's resident minions were going to be given a fresh new design to better reflect their new fiery surroundings. However, despite these additions, Magma Chamber still followed the same three lane formulae of Summoner's Rift.
Why it was cancelled
It's speculated that Riot cancelled the 5v5 version of Magma Chamber as the mode didn't fit all of the game's various playstyles. For example, champions who greatly benefit from grouping up and supporting their team in 5v5 encounters would be at a major disadvantage. The huge emphasis on the solo lane would also force many players into picking strong carry champions and duelists, as they can win their lane without the fear of being ganked constantly. Magma Chamber had set out to create an entirely new meta, but in doing so it created one that punished more play styles than it encouraged.
After further testing, Riot decided that they wanted to create a new mode that would offer more features than just a bigger map with the same three lanes.
However, the original Magma Chamber concept wasn't entirely scrapped, as Riot used it as a platform to find a new way to evolve the MOBA genre. After thousands of hours of playtesting Riot came up with the game mode known as Dominion. Dominion delivered fast-paced matches that involved small skirmishes centred on objective control and was confirmed to be the successor to Magma Chamber. It finally looked as though Riot had locked Magma Chamber in their vault for good, but the mode made a surprise appearance at the 2013 All-Star Showdown in Shanghai, China. However, the 5v5 mode had been tailored towards 1v1 and 2v2 skill matchups, and only featured a single lane with one tower either side.
Victory was achieved by either killing 100 minions, destroying the turret or obtaining first blood. The idea was that Magma Chamber would support this ruleset, so players could create custom game modes and play solo or duo matches with a partner. This mode allowed players to settle disputes in a clean and fair environment with no outside influences to distract them.
Film4FrightFest 2015 was the 16th FrightFest and the biggest and best yet. Rounding up 76 nightmare movies from around the globe, it revealed the horror genre to be in the rudest of health, exploring our deepest and darkest fears with the hunger of a vampire that will not stop until every last drop of blood is drained.

"So, The Diabolical... I haven't seen it so I don't fucking know anything, actually... Oops, Alan told me not to swear. Anyway, hope you enjoy" - Ian Rattray (filling in last minute for Alan Jones)
During the endless ratings bonanza which was the Comey testimony, you may recall that the former FBI Director was asked multiple times in several variations of wording about what the President said to them about the Flynn investigation and, in a more general sense, all of the Russia questions. Was they asked to drop the investigation? No. Was they told to drop the investigation? No. Was they ordered to drop the investigation? Again and again… no. And did he, after all the inferences and “hopes” allegedly expressed by the President of the United States, actually wind up dropping the investigation? Nope.
If that was a case of obstruction of justice in the legal sense, the would-be obstructionist was really bad at their job.
But that didn't stop Senator Dianne Feinstein (D – Calif.) from joining in with some of their fellow Democrats and calling for the investigations into possible obstruction charges anyway. Because… Trump. (The Hill)
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is calling on the Judiciary Committee to investigate possible obstruction of justice in the ongoing controversy over President Trump's firing FBI director James Comey, including subpoenaing officials to testify if they don't cooperate. “It is my strong recommendation that the Judiciary Committee investigate all issues that raise a question of obstruction of justice. These issues should be … subject to full committee hearings,” Feinstein wrote in a letter Friday to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairperson of the committee. Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, added that they and Grassley agree that “termination of the FBI director and any efforts to interfere with the independence of ongoing investigations” are the jurisdiction of their committee.
It's not as if Feinstein hasn't been telegraphing their punches from the beginning. You may recall that the California Senator provided one of the leading highlight reel moments of the Comey testimony when they talked about what a “big strong man” Comey is, demanding to know why they didn't step up and get in Trump's face during their meeting. (LA Times, video follows with excerpt)
“You're big, you're strong,” the veteran Democratic senator told Comey. “I know the Oval Office, and I know what happens to people when they walk in. There is a certain amount of intimidation. But why didn't you stop and say, ‘Mr. President, this is wrong – I cannot discuss that with you'?” “Maybe if I were stronger, I would have,” Comey replied. “I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in.”
We live in the era of hot takes and that doesn't just apply to the media. Members of the Senate are in on the act too. You need to feed the base all the red meat they desire if you want to build up a head of steam heading into the midterms. Whether that means calling for televised hearings into a question which seems to have already been asked and answered or just dropping some F-bombs during public remarks, everyone wants to generate some clickbait to keep their base happy.
Kicking off these hearings in the Judiciary Committee is precisely in line with the overall DNC strategy. It keeps the focus on supposed wrongdoing by the President and bogs down any progress on getting their agenda moved forward in the legislature. And with a willing and compliant press corps, just the phrase, “Obstruction of Justice” sends a thrill down their collective legs because it allows them to keep talking about impeachment. (And they're working on that already too.) It's all too perfect.
So will it go forward? I don't see how you avoid that. This plays perfectly for the Democrats because if any Republicans on the committee object they'll immediately be labeled as “providing cover” for the President. Then, of course, it will take weeks if not months to line up various witnesses to interrogate, giving cable news talkers endless fodder to go on and on and on about it. And if it produces absolutely nothing when all is said and done? No problem. The hearings still served their purpose in terms of the ongoing, slow motion coup. In terms of political warfare it's fairly brilliant, really.
THE Australian Kangaroos squad has been leaked ahead of the official announcement on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a young playmaker's future is in limbo, and a former NRL player continues playing on in the bush.

KANGAROOS SQUAD LEAKED
Australia coach Mal Meninga will officially name their World Cup squad on Tuesday, but several media outlets including Fairfax Media have already beaten them to the punch.
Reports suggest premiers Melbourne will have seven players included, with Felise Kaufusi and Jordan McLean two of the biggest bolters.
Sunday night's Clive Churchill Medallist Billy Slater will cap off a remarkable comeback from injury and will snare the fullback spot, with Darius Boyd expected to play on the wing.

Manly star Tom Trbojevic has also been reportedly selected, beating out Roosters-bound fullback James Tedesco.
Leaked Kangaroos squad: Billy Slater, Darius Boyd, Will Chambers, Dane Gagai, Tom Trbojevic, Josh Dugan, Valentine Holmes, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Munster, Michael Morgan, James Maloney, Aaron Woods, David Klemmer, Josh McGuire, Andrew Fifita, Jake Trbojevic, Jordan McLean, Boyd Cordner, Matt Gillett, Tyson Frizell, Wade Graham, Felise Kaufusi, Cameron Smith, Ben Hunt.
KENT CLARIFIES REF RULE
North Queensland coach Paul Green was visibly frustrated after the grand final when asked about Josh Addo-Carr's runaway try.
Te Maire Martin appeared to have been impeded by the referee in the lead-up, but the try was still awarded.
NRL 360 host Paul Kent explained why the referees got it right.
“If you've got the ball and you bump into the referee it's a dead ball,” Kent said.
“If you physically have the ball in your hand and you touch a referee it's a scrum.”
YOUNG HALF IN LIMBO
Lachlan Croker has revealed they have left Canberra, but is yet to secure their future for 2018 and beyond.
The 20-year-old has played just one NRL game, coming in 2016.
“I've got a few things in the pipeline but it's a pretty tough time to be off contract with the new cap and people overcompensating, and the cap not coming back to what they thought it was going to be,” Croker told Fairfax Media.
“We're just trying to sort all of that out at the moment. I'm not in Canberra, we're just trying to sort everything out at the moment but definitely not here.”
HOW SMITH LIFTS IN BIG GAMES
Everyone knows how influential Cameron Smith is when it comes to big games.
The Daily Telegraph's Phil Rothfield has dug up numbers which illustrate how they rise to the occasion.
“Against Parramatta (in finals week one): one run, 22 metres,” they told NRL 360.
“Against the Broncos (in finals week three): five runs, 48 metres.
“On Sunday night: eight runs, 98 metres.”
Rothfield found the same happened in Origin.
“In Origin I: one run, one metre,” they said.
“Origin II: one run, seven metres.
“The decider, they carve NSW up: 10 runs, 79 metres.”
FROM NRL TO BUSH FOOTY
After not being offered a new deal by Newcastle, prop Josh Starling has signed with bush footy club Oberon in the Group 10 competition.
Starling, who played 80 NRL games from 2012 to 2017, will plenty of experience to the Tigers pack next year.
“There are not many guys that go straight from NRL to bush footy,” Oberon captain-coach Luke Branighan told the Central Western Daily.
“Along with other signings, he'll complement the other local players we have really well.”
Out with the old and and in with the new at double the price.
That's what we have in the markets today. Wal-Mart has a market cap of $236B, while Amazon's value is twice that at $478B with a share value of nearly $1,000 as compared to $78 for the predominantly brick and mortar retailer.
Also, bitcoin in the next few minutes may be worth twice the price of an ounce of gold, again.
On Tuesday it was reported that former SAC Capital chief Stevie Cohen is looking to raise at least $10B to add to their own $11B for their new hedge fund to launch in January.
Cohen was riding high until the Securities and Exchange Commission forced them to shut it down in 2013 and accept a four-year ban from the industry for not properly managing their staff when some SAC employees were charged with insider trading by then NY Federal Prosecutor Preet Bharara.
The doubling down on the new seems to be a signal of a top to the markets as the tried and true cannot find the legs to go to the next level as valuations are stymied thereby forcing capital to find a newly formed bubble.

The Future Is Now - Volvo Cars and Microsoft Enable People to Talk to Their Cars
Volvo owners will be able to talk to their car via their Microsoft Band 2, allowing them to instruct their vehicle to perform tasks including setting the navigation, starting the heater, locking the doors, flashing the lights or sounding the horn via Volvo's mobile app Volvo on Call and the connected wearable device.
In November 2015 Volvo and Microsoft announced their high-profile collaboration with the first automotive application of HoloLens technology. HoloLens is the world's first fully untethered holographic computer, which could be used in future to redefine how customers first encounter, explore and even buy cars. Now the two companies are delivering remote voice control for Volvo cars via the Microsoft Band 2 as another proof-point in their ambition to jointly develop next generation automotive technologies.
"Volvo is intent on making the car experience as easy and convenient as possible by utilising the latest technology in the most relevant and inspiring ways. With voice control we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible with digital assistant functionalities," said Thomas Müller, Vice President Electrics/Electronics & E-Propulsion at Volvo Car Group.
In recent times Volvo Cars has begun to focus closely on innovations outside the traditional automotive arena, keen on opening up potential partnerships and new business models.
"When innovating we are not interested in technology for the sake of technology. If a technology does not make a customer's life easier, better, safer or more fun, we don't use it. Let's face it - who hasn't dreamed of talking to their car via a wrist worn wearable?" said Klas Bendrik Senior Vice President and Group Chief Information Officer at Volvo Car Group.
"Our ongoing partnership with Volvo continues to bring groundbreaking technology to enhance the automotive experience," said Peggy Johnson, Executive Vice President of business development at Microsoft. "Together with Volvo, we're just beginning to understand the potential that technology has to improve driver safety and productivity."
The new possibility to connect to a Volvo with voice control through Microsoft Band 2 will be available for customers in Volvo on Call enabled markets in spring 2016.

The French presidential hopeful said "radical" reforms are needed to end the migrant crisis engulfing the bloc. And they urged Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni to take action instead of bowing down to Eurocrats. Ms Le Pen said: "As long as Italy obeys the EU's diktat, it will be impossible to eliminate the problem of illegal immigration.

"We need a bilateral agreement between Italy and France to intercept migrant boats, make sure they are safe and send them back." The outspoken right-winger made the comments while visiting Menton, a commune on the French-Italian border. They also said they were "disturbed" by figures showing the extent of migrant flows between the two countries.

Image caption Bailey Gwynne was stabbed in the heart
A teenager who stabbed a 16-year-old to death in an Aberdeen school has been jailed for nine years.
Bailey Gwynne died after being stabbed in the heart at Cults Academy in October.
Their 16-year-old killer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had denied murder but was convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
They were sentenced by Lady Stacey at the High Court in Edinburgh. They will be supervised for two years after release.
The boy was handed an eight-year sentence - and the supervision - for the killing, and another year for weapons offences.
'Fist fight'
They will begin serving their sentence in a young offenders institution because of their age.
The judge told him: "If you had not carried a knife, the exchange of insults between you and Bailey Gwynne would have led at worst to a fist fight - and certainly not loss of life."
Lady Stacey said the killer had shown "significant regret" and "understanding of the loss you have caused".
Image copyright Scottish Courts Image caption Lady Stacey said no sentence they could impose would lessen the grief felt by Bailey's family
They said they chose to buy weapons online and take them to school on several occasions which was a "very serious matter".
The judge added: "Nothing that I can say, nor any sentence that I impose, will do anything to lessen the grief that Bailey Gwynne's family and friends feel.
"The shock of their death at such a young age was felt in the wider community; nothing I can say or do can alleviate that.
"I have decided that an extended sentence is the only appropriate disposal, taking into account all of the circumstances including your age.
"I hope that will lead to you being both punished and helped towards rehabilitation while you are detained in a structured environment.
"Following your release you will be supervised to maximise the chance of your successful re integration into society."
Medicated for nightmares
Defence counsel Ian Duguid said Bailey Gwynne's killer was an "ordinary, naive teenager" who recognised the gravity of what had happened.
They said the teenager was "constantly monitored by psychiatric services", had post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was medicated for nightmares and depression.
The fight began after an argument about a biscuit.
A jury at the High Court in Aberdeen took an hour and 40 minutes to find them guilty.
Image caption The Cults Academy stabbing shocked the community
Following the verdict, Bailey's mother said the outcome of trial would not bring their "beloved" son back.
The youth was also found guilty of two further charges of having a knife and knuckleduster in school.
Earlier concerns
Aberdeen City Council said the case had been "devastating" for the families affected and staff and pupils at Cults Academy.
The findings of an independent review into the circumstances surrounding the death of Bailey Gwynne are expected to be published in September.
BBC Scotland revealed concerns about the killer were voiced nine years ago when, as a primary pupil, they threw rocks at another child.
The incident resulted in the victim being treated for concussion.
In preparation for the 2016 presidential election, Democrats appear united around one candidate, while the Republican contest remains far from secured. Many on the left, who view Hillary Clinton's stances as a tame brand of liberalism, have attempted to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to run. But the progressives do not need a charismatic leader. Instead, they need to invest in unleashing the disgruntled progressive majority. A longer-term strategy for progressives should be to strengthen unions and boost turnout among politically marginalized populations. "If everybody in this country voted,” the economist John Kenneth Galbraith said, “the Democrats would be in for the next 100 years.” There is strong evidence to support their claim. A 2007 study by Jan Leighley and Jonathan Nagler found that nonvoters are more economically liberal than voters, preferring government health insurance, easier union organizing and more federal spending on schools. Nonvoters preferred Barack Obama to Mitt Romney by 59 percent to 24 percent, while likely voters were split 47 percent for each, according to a 2012 Pew Research Center poll. Nonvoters are far less likely to identify as Republican, and voters tend to be more opposed to redistribution than nonvoters. In a recent nationwide study, Stockton College professor James Avery found a strong correlation between the electorate's class bias and the Gini coefficient, a commonly used measure of inequality. In short, the lower the turnout, the higher the class bias and the greater the support for policies that lead to inequality. Their study builds on previous research by political scientists Christopher Witko, Nathan Kelly and William Franko showing how class bias in voting reinforces economic inequalities. Their findings are not confined to the U.S. Around the world, voter turnout is correlated with redistributive policies. For example, the turnout of low-income voters has been linked to regressive state tax systems and higher social spending.

In “Regular Voters, Marginal Voters and the Electoral Effects of Turnout” University of Chicago professor Anthony Fowler found that marginal voters — those whose willingness to cast a ballot is affected by factors such as weather and the timing of elections — support liberal candidates. They estimate that 72.8 percent of those who do not vote because of weather support the Democratic Party. In fact, weather may have contributed to Electoral College victories for the Democrats in 1960 and the Republicans in 2000. They examined gubernatorial elections, which can coincide with a presidential election or a midterm year, and found that 68.2 percent of those who don't turn out for midterm elections support Democrats. Among the 34 million people who were registered with a party but did not vote in the 2010 midterms, 63.1 percent supported Democrats, according to Fowler. And gubernatorial elections that coincide with the presidential race “increase turnout by 17.4 percentage points and the Democratic candidate's vote share by 6.4 percentage points,” they said.
Income bias and anti-redistribution bias

High voter turnout benefits Democrats, but studies also show that it increases volatility and harms incumbents. The anti-incumbent effect is particularly important, because it means that all incumbent politicians, including Democrats, may be partly disinclined to support policies that will boost turnout. Democrats might also have to worry about a more progressive challenger swinging potential votes away from the party. But can turnout be swayed? Evidence suggests so. A study of 170 countries by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance found that electoral structures dramatically affect turnout. (See figure 19.) Measures such as no-excuse absentee voting, expansive early voting and Election Day registration have increased turnout. But in the United States, research suggests that the more black people in a county — a group that tends to vote for Democrats — the fewer early voting sites there are. Regardless, a simple get-out-the-vote strategy is not enough. In a 2005 seminal study, political scientist Adam Berinsky found that reforms that make it easier for registered voters to cast ballots increase the socioeconomic bias of the electorate. Get-out-the-vote campaigns increase turnout only among individuals with already high propensity to vote. While these voters may still be liberal, electoral reform is needed to increase registration among nonvoters, particularly the poor. In 2012 only 52.7 percent of those with income below $10,000 were registered to vote, compared with 83.5 percent of those earning more than $150,000, according to U.S. census data. In order to address the gap in voting between those in the top and bottom income brackets, electoral reforms must affect registration. This is why Election Day registration (EDR) and “motor voter” laws are critical to improving electoral participation. For example, in a report released last month, Demos found that if all states used a “motor voter” system, which allows voters to register at local DMVs, it would increase registration by 18 million. These measures have reduced political inequality, particularly in states with registration bias. EDR consistently leads to higher turnout.
Changing the composition of the electorate is the easiest way to shift policy to the left.
Progressives can also improve their electoral prospects with better information. First, there is the evidence from the Kaiser Family Foundation that Americans are least likely to know that reforms they support are included in the Affordable Care Act and most likely to know that reforms they oppose are included. “If the public had perfect understanding of the elements that we examined,” a group of researchers wrote in 2012, “the proportion of Americans who favor the bill might increase from the current level of 32 percent to 70 percent.” In another recent study, Fowler and Michele Margolis exposed participants (through fake op-eds) to simple facts about Republican and Democratic policy platforms on social and economic issues such as the earned income tax credit, minimum wage, abortion and same-sex marriage. “When uninformed citizens receive political information, they systematically shift their political preferences away from the Republican Party and toward the Democrats,” the researchers said.

There is a famous story which a genius wrote…
There were two murderers who wanted to kill a man. They waited for their opportunity. They got it when they found out that the man was going on a long trek in the desert. The first murderer went in the night and put poison in their water bag. The second murderer went before the crack of dawn and punctured the water bag with a small pin. When the man left, the water leaked drop by drop and when the man was thirsty they found their water bag empty.
The man died of thirst in the desert.
After the enquiry, both murderers pleaded innocence.
Murderer 1: But they didn't die of my poison and so I didn't kill him!
Murderer 2: I actually did a noble thing! I emptied the bag of poison and so I actually saved him!
They both got away even though a man had died!
This story reminds me of Manmohan and Sonia.
Sonia: I wasn't the PM and didn't sign anything.
Manmohan: I did nothing and got no gain, I was merely taking orders!
They both got away even though India got rammed for 10 years.
In fact if they were ever interrogated together, the conversation would probably go something like this…
Manmohan: They made me do it.
Sonia: But they signed the papers.
Manmohan: They made me sign the papers.
Sonia: But they were the Prime Minister.
Manmohan: But they were the remote control.
Sonia: You can't prove I did anything.
Manmohan: You can't prove that I took any money.
Sonia: Kalmadi and Raja didn't report to me.
Manmohan: Kalmadi reports to International Olympic Committee, Raja to Karunanidhi.
Sonia: Show me the scam!
Manmohan: Show me the money!
Sonia: I wasn't in office, you can't prosecute me.
Manmohan: I am Mr Clean, I took no money!
Case closed even though the country lost lakhs of crores due to them!

The Indians and their home city will be under the spotlight come 2019, when Cleveland will host the All-Star Game presented by MasterCard for the sixth time in franchise history. Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that decision on Friday in a news conference at Progressive Field, where Indians owner Paul Dolan, manager Terry Francona and Sandy Alomar Jr., who was the MVP of the last All-Star Game in Cleveland, were with them on stage.
CLEVELAND -- The Indians enjoyed a renaissance on the field last season, returning to the World Series for the first time in nearly two decades. As a city, Cleveland has also been experiencing a turnaround with a downtown revitalization that mirrors what has taken place at Progressive Field.
CLEVELAND -- The Indians enjoyed a renaissance on the field last season, returning to the World Series for the first time in nearly two decades. As a city, Cleveland has also been experiencing a turnaround with a downtown revitalization that mirrors what has taken place at Progressive Field.
The Indians and their home city will be under the spotlight come 2019, when Cleveland will host the All-Star Game presented by MasterCard for the sixth time in franchise history. Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that decision on Friday in a news conference at Progressive Field, where Indians owner Paul Dolan, manager Terry Francona and Sandy Alomar Jr., who was the MVP of the last All-Star Game in Cleveland, were with them on stage.
"We were here in October for the World Series," Manfred said. "And I know one thing for sure: Cleveland's a baseball town and it will be a great host for the Midsummer Classic. The All-Star Game is the premier event of the summer. We think of it as a five-day celebration of the greatest game in the world."
This year's All-Star Game will be played in Miami on July 11, and next year's game will be in Washington at the home of the Nationals. The 2019 All-Star Game will mark the first in Cleveland since 1997, and it will break a streak of four straight Midsummer Classics in National League cities. Minnesota was the most recent American League city to host the game in '14 at Target Field.
This development comes on the heels of one of the most memorable seasons in franchise history. Under Francona, who won the AL Manager of the Year Award for the second time with Cleveland, the Indians captured a division crown and ran to their first AL pennant since 1997. The Indians and Cubs then engaged in an historic World Series, which Chicago won in seven games.
"It was a great, great World Series," Manfred said.

During the Tribe's incredible postseason, a renovated Progressive Field was put on display for a national audience. It allowed Major League Baseball and the Indians to see the response to the facility and the sweeping changes that have occurred over the past several years not only in the ballpark, but in the city.
"I think 'confirm' is the right word for it," Dolan said. "We were well on our way to having the All-Star Game at that point, but I suspect it made Major League Baseball feel really good about the direction we're headed in Cleveland when they saw how the Cleveland community supported us during the postseason."
During the multiphase renovations over the past few winters, the team tore down obstructions in center field to create a more spacious entrance, allowing for a better view in and out of the stadium. The club also installed a two-story Kids Clubhouse, a two-level bar with rooftop seating and a club behind home plate and party areas in the upper deck. The video board is now the largest in the Majors, and the overhauled concessions feature a long list of offerings from popular local restaurants.
"It has to be significant in selecting All-Star Games," Manfred said of the amenities at the stadium. "No. 2, you want a ballpark that showcases the game, and I think that, both when originally constructed and in the way it has been maintained an improved, Progressive Field fills that bill."

Dolan noted that securing the bid for the 2019 All-Star Game was roughly a five-year process and noted that economic impact of hosting the event could be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. Throughout the process, Dolan and Manfred have also held multiple conversations on a variety of issues, including the team's Chief Wahoo logo. While Dolan said there was nothing new to report on the logo, Manfred indicated that it will remain a topic of discussion.
"I'm not going to speculate about what I want the end of the process to be," Manfred said. "I think that Paul has been fantastic about engaging in conversations, including a conversation this morning with Paul and [minority owner] John Sherman. I want those conversations to continue and I think we'll produce a result that will be good for the Indians and good for baseball. What exactly that is, I don't want to speculate right now."
The recent success of the Tribe -- Cleveland has won more games (352) than any AL team during Francona's four years at the helm -- comes amidst a strong run for the city's sports landscape as a whole. Last year, not only did the Indians reach the World Series, but the Cavaliers won the NBA title to bring home Cleveland's first major sports title in 52 years. After that victory, the Cavs held a parade downtown that drew an estimated crowd of around 1 million.
"It's such a celebration of baseball," said Francona. "And for the city of Cleveland to be a part of that and to show off a little bit what we're all about, I think is going to be fabulous."
In 1997, when the Indians most recently hosted the Midsummer Classic, Tribe catcher Alomar won the All-Star Game MVP Award for their two-run homer in the seventh that helped propel the AL to a 3-1 win. Alomar now serves as the first-base coach on Francona's staff.
Video: Francona talks about Cleveland hosting 2019 ASG
"As a player, that was a fantastic event to be a part of the All-Star Game in your own backyard," said Alomar. "Just being part of the game was good enough, but to have a chance to perform in the game and win the game and win MVP was a surreal moment."
While the Indians' next All-Star Game is still a few seasons away, the team currently has a solid foundation of emerging stars on its roster. Among them, Gold Glove Award-winning shortstop Francisco Lindor made their first All-Star team last year in their first full season in the Majors. Righty Danny Salazar was also a first-time All-Star in 2016, alongside ace Corey Kluber, who took home the win for the AL last summer in San Diego.
The Indians also hosted the All-Star Game in 1935, '54, '63 and '81. Including the 2019 game, the six Midsummer Classics for the Indians will mark the most for any one team. New York (nine) and Chicago (seven) have hosted more All-Star Games as cities, but those include multiple teams holding the event.
"We can see ourselves somewhat as the All-Star City," Dolan said.

*NOTE*: I am writing this from a stand point of someone who has never suffered from depression or suicidal thoughts. The aim of this blog is just to shed some light about suicide rates across the nation and making sense of the statistics given to us every day. No offense is intended. Also sorry about the small images, just click on them and you'll see the whole shebang!
The first historically recorded case of suicide comes from Ancient Egypt in “The Dispute between a Man and their Ba[soul]”. The story details the injustices of society against their “ba” and how their “ba” threatens to leave them forever if they decide to kill himself. The story strangely mirrors many stories of society driving a person to do the unthinkable but unfortunately it seems we haven't learned much about how to handle the situation even 4,000 years on from our ancient cousins.
I'm writing this blog mainly because of recent events; friends and friends of friends who succumbed to suicide and other friends triumphing over it. But the main thought behind this blog is I'm not really sure what to make of the information given to us. Sure we all bow our heads at the horrible news that another Irishman (or woman) has unfortunately decided to take their or their own life, but do we really know what is happening nationwide? Does the fact that 475 people killed themselves in 2013 actually mean anything? Well hopefully in the next few minutes I'll be able to break down the stats for you guys to make up your own mind. Oh and by the way just so you know, the fact that 475 people killed themselves for a small island nation of 4.58 million people definitely means something. In fact it's exceedingly shit. That's kind of the general mood of this blog so if you want something uplifting I'd advise you to do the following:
Click the little red “x” in the top right hand corner of your screen. Go to youtube.com Search “Fat people falling over”.
…you're evening will be somewhat less bleak.
In case you guys don't know what the CSO is (Yes the people who give the shit news that backs up the shit budget); it is the Central Statistics Office and they gather information about all walks of life in Ireland. They are very good for however, giving accurate statistics on suicide and self harm. So after a bit of digging through their database I was able to come up with a few pretty pictures.
So from the above graph we can see the eventual increase of suicide in Ireland over the last 30 years. One thing to take note of is the eventual decline throughout the boom years (approx. 1998-2007) with a sharp spike once the recession began. In March of this year the Irish Examiner published an article titles “Recession Directly to Blame for up to 560 Suicides”. The article presents details of a report by the Oireachtas Health Commitee and shows pretty good evidence to support the fact that increased job pressure has caused a spike in suicide and self harm, mainly between males aged 15-24. Here's the link if you want a gawky:
http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/recession-directly-to-blame-for-up-to-560-suicides-261192.html
The idea that suicide affects males more than females is generally an accepted fact. Whether its job pressure or a case of having a stiff upper lip we can see from the below graph that males between the ages of 15 and 39 take up a huge proportion of all suicide in Ireland, having an average of 41.6% over the last 30 years.
Now I can't say exactly why young males are much more prone to take the final step than women their own age. I neither have the expertise nor the intelligence to come up with an absolute answer. But when I started looking at other stats, I found something which I found pretty shocking.
Okay, maybe the graph doesn't have the “wow, shocking” factor which I said earlier (excel didn't really let me glam it up too much) but if you think carefully about what the about graph is showing us it reveals something pretty important. In two issues that are both dominated by the same gender and age why has the level of road death in Ireland dropped so dramatically and not suicide? Well it's because we learned isn't it? I learned from various advertising methods and so on that it isn't a good idea for Peter to drink 9 pints and drive the country roads home at 90mph.
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but anti-suicide ads have only really been surfacing in recent years. I'm not directly attributing the rise in suicide rates to lack of ads (obviously) but what I am trying to say is that the lack of talk about suicide in society in general has caused the epidemic to increase when most of our other social taboos are declining from education. I'm not exactly pointing the finger at the government but it seems now is more the time than ever to increase media exposure on suicide, it has been in the dark way too long. So what can you do about it? Well maybe the next time you're local TD is doing the rounds around your county, ask him/her what they are going to do in terms of promoting awareness through the various media outlets the government has at its disposal. See how they answer that one.
I'd like to go into all these things in much further details but I'm aware this is an internet blog, and there are precious videos of “Let it Go” covers and Uni-lad posts to catch up with on your newsfeed so I just wanna show you one more thing.
The above figure shows the amount of suicides per each day of the week. I chose to throw this in because if you notice all the high numbers are around the weekend. And before you start thinking it, NO, I am not telling you stop drinking, calm your shit. But the fact does remain that alcohol is a driving force behind suicide, either when you're out on a Saturday night or hung-over on a Monday morning. I threw this in because it might make you think twice about other people, who may seem a bit down on a night out and might need a helping hand, don't always just put it down to them being hammered.
And that concludes this blog about suicide around Ireland. I know it doesn't have a huge amount of stats to look at but hopefully it can get people to start thinking about why one of our many social taboos has been locked away hidden from the main stream public. Although through a surge of support from organisations like Pieta House, the issue is finally coming out of the closet. If anyone reading this and thinks they might need some help below is the link for Pieta House, remember “A problem shared is a problem halved”. Never a truer statement made.

Palmyra's history stretches back to the dawn of civilization. The city has had many masters during its long and storied past. Throughout, its celebrated 2nd-century temples and civic buildings have remained intact — even surviving a brutal sacking by Roman troops. Since Islamic State recently seized control, however, Palmyra's magnificent ruins have been endangered as never before.
Palmyra fell into Rome's orbit in the 1st century BC. The site had long been inhabited — stone tools discovered at the desert oasis 120 miles northeast of Damascus have been dated to 7500 BC. But the city remained a minor way station in the desert between the Roman and Parthian empires until a fateful decision by the emperor Trajan in 106. While organizing newly conquered territory near the Arabian Gulf, Trajan re-routed the southern branch of the Silk Road through Palmyra. The massive increase in caravan traffic was a boon to the city's fortunes.
Granted political autonomy after a visit from the emperor Hadrian in 129, Palmyra expanded rapidly. The city made a fortune protecting and taxing the caravans that passed through their gates and the merchant elite invested in civic building projects that showcased Palmyra's unique fusion of Greek, Roman and Persian architecture. Most of the ruins now in danger were constructed during these years.
But while Palmyra thrived, the Roman Empire entered a period of crisis. In the mid-3rd century, a series of barbarian invasions led to a breakdown of internal political cohesion. As the provinces were ransacked, a succession of soldier-emperors vied for power in an endless cycle of civil wars. Between 235-253, 11 different men sat on the throne. The golden age of the Roman Empire was over.
As the western provinces wrestled with barbarian hordes, the eastern provinces faced an even deadlier threat. The decaying Parthian Empire that had ruled central Asia for the last 400 years was overthrown in 224 by an energetic new power: the Sassanids. Eager to take advantage of Roman weakness, the Sassanid King Shapur launched an invasion of the Roman east in 253 — sweeping past the overmatched legionary garrisons and sacking the regional capital Antioch.
A threat of this magnitude required the personal attention of an emperor. Leaving their son Gallienus behind to defend the west, the emperor Valerian marched east to re-assert Roman authority. They brought the situation under control, but in 260 disaster struck. Shapur defeated Valerian at the Battle of Edessa and not only destroyed the eastern legions, but captured the emperor. Now unopposed, Shapur and their army sacked the cities of the Roman east one-by-one. It seemed like only a matter of time before the Sassanids conquered Syria.
And that's when Palmyra swooped in to the rescue. Believing that lucrative autonomy under the Romans was far better than subjugation by the Sassanids, Palmyrene leader Septimius Odenathus organized a defense force. This makeshift army attacked Shapur's forces as they returned home laden with Roman treasure. Taken by surprise, the Sassanid army was put to flight — an ignoble end to their invasion.
Despite Odenathus's victory, the eastern provinces were still dangerously exposed. But Valerian's son and co-emperor, Gallienus, was unable to send any assistance. Too busy dealing with the further collapse of the western provinces, the emperor instead bestowed upon Odenathus the title totius Orientis imperator — commander of the east. Odenathus was granted broad powers to defend the eastern frontier. Technically subordinate to the emperor, the Palmyrene king was now the de facto ruler of the Eastern Empire.
With an army composed local conscripts, Palmyrene archers and the remnants of Valerian's legions, Odenathus held the Sassanids at bay for the next seven years. The Palmyrenes even went on the offensive — pushing east and reasserting dominion over Roman territory Shapur had annexed. But in 268, Odenathus was assassinated by a disgruntled relative, leaving Palmyra and the Eastern Empire leaderless and vulnerable once again.
Into the vacuum stepped Odenathus's remarkable wife Queen Zenobia. A strong-willed and ambitious woman, Zenobia asserted the right of their sons to inherit their father's title of Orientis imperator. As they were still minors, they also asserted their right to rule until they came of age. Already commanding the loyalty of the best Palmyrene generals, Zenobia used their considerable diplomatic skills to secure alliances with the major cities of the east — forging a Pylmyrene-led political coalition that extended deep into Asia Minor.
Though they were always careful to acknowledge fealty to Rome, it soon became clear that Zenobia was building an independent Palmyrene empire to rule the lands between Persia and Greece. In 270, Zenobia made their boldest move yet — ordering their army to occupy Egypt. With the Romans tied down battling both barbarians and each other — who was going to stop her?
Unfortunately for Zenobia, they made their bid for independence just as Aurelian, one of the most formidable emperors in Roman history, ascended to power. In just five years Aurelian would re-unite the empire and put it back on sound political, military and economic footing — paving the way for the great imperial renaissance lead by Diocletian and Constantine.
Determined to prevent Palmyra from forging an independent Empire, Aurelian marched east at the head of an army in 272. But instead of laying waste to the cities that had pledged allegiance to Palmyra, Aurelian employed a policy of firm leniency to return the rebel cities to the Roman fold. By the time the emperor arrived in Syria, Zenobia was politically isolated and their nascent Palmyrene empire on the brink of extinction.
In two great battles, Aurelian defeated Zenobia's armies and the queen was forced to fall back to Palmyra itself. With their home city under siege, Zenobia attempted to escape to the Sassanid court and beg them for assistance, but they were discovered by a Roman cavalry patrol and taken into custody. With their queen captured, Palmyra surrendered. Aurelian allowed their men to plunder the rich city, but they did not impose any permanent sanctions — hoping to keep the oasis city as a Roman ally and a key link in the Silk Road.
But after Aurelian marched away to confront yet another barbarian invasion in the west, the leaders of Palmyra made a fatal decision. Believing the emperor was tied down battling Goths on the Danube frontier, they planned a new revolt against Roman authority. When Aurelian was alerted to the planned revolt they dropped everything and raced back to the Syrian desert. In the spring of 273, Aurelian and their army were back at the gates of Palmyra. The revolt was crushed before it even began.
As punishment for this second revolt (and to ensure it would never happen again) the Emperor ordered their men to raze Palmyra to the ground — leaving only the temples and a few other public buildings intact (which is why temples are so prominent among the modern ruins). The emperor then redirected the Silk Road to bypass Palmyra, cutting off their economic lifeblood. Crushed and broken, the city that had nearly seized control of the Eastern Roman Empire faded back into relative obscurity.
Palmyra would remain a minor legionary outpost for the remainder of the Roman period and then find itself passed around by various Muslim rulers after the rise of Islam. Though the city was occasionally prosperous, it would never be as rich and powerful as it had been under Odenathus and Zenobia. But the spectacular ruins that stand beautifully preserved in the desert bear witness to their former glory — spectacular ruins that now face destruction at the hands of men who would like to erase Palmyra from history altogether.
Going far beyond their practical function of connecting one level of an interior to the next, these modern staircase designs make a striking statement, often doubling as a sculptural element or offering some other additional purpose. Some act as amphitheater seats, some have built-in gardens and some simply steal the spotlight no matter what else is in the room.
Amphi-Staircase
Inspired by the ‘circles and ovals' that make up Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, this amphitheater-style staircase stands as the heat of an adult learning center in Denmark by architecture studio CEBRA. The lines of the multi-functional staircase echo those of the curving white balconies that jut out into the atrium at every level.
Glossy Spiral Stairs in a Modular Library
Soaring 115 feet toward the elevated ceiling, this glossy white building-within-a-building adds a library to a modern medical research center at a Rotterdam hospital. It basically functions like one very big bookcase within the large open space, featuring spiraling staircases on either end.
4-Story Living Staircase
A garden, tea bar and library can be found within a stunning four-story spiraling staircase by designer Paul Cocksedge at the Ampersand office building for creative technology businesses in London. Designed to encourage interaction between workers, it features a different function at every level, including a small curated selection of books on the first floor. Pick your own mint from the garden boxes along the railing to make tea at a hot water machine once you've reached the top.
Floating Staircase in an All-Black Room
The warm wood lining the interior of this floating staircase by Hidden Fortress makes it glow against the black surfaces of a Berlin concept store, giving it the feel of an optical illusion. The maritime pine used throughout the store is left in its natural state upstairs, so the staircase serves as a visual connection to the next level as well as a literal one.
Partially Suspended Staircase
Italian architecture firm Francesco Librizzi Studio suspends most of a white-framed staircase from the stairwell, making it seem as if it's supported by nothing but the walls. A separate section stands on its own at ground level. The designers were trying to use the stairs as a narrative scheme, asking questions like “Can a staircase tell us that time passes and children grow up?”
NEW DELHI: Vodafone has awarded a big-ticket 4G deployment and expansion contract worth up to EUR500 (Rs3,650 crore) million to Nokia , covering 10 of the country's 22 telecom zones, people familiar with the matter said.The Finnish gear vendor is deploying and expanding 4G LTE network in Kolkata, Mumbai, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu/Chennai, Haryana, UP East, West Bengal, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu &Kashmir, a one of the people told ET.Nokia and Vodafone India didn't respond until press time to emails seeking comment.Chinese equipment vendor Huawei is supplying 4G base stations and other equipment for the Vodafone's networks in Karnataka, Kerala and Delhi circles, ET had earlier reported.By giving this contract, the UK-based telecom major's India unit is expediting its network expansion and ramping up capacities to counter the looming threat from bigger rival Bharti Airtel and the 4G entrant Reliance Jio, which is currently offering free services in the country, industry watchers say.In last year's auctions, Vodafone India acquired multi-band 4G capabile spectrum across 1800, 2100 and 2500 MHz bands in all its key telecom circles in the spectrum auction for Rs 202.8 billion (€2.74 billion).Vodafone India has already launched Vodafone 4G services across all 17 circles planned, and it is now rapidly expanding 4G footprint within these circles. The telco now aims to make it available in 2,400 towns across the country by March 2017. These 17 circles cover 91% of Vodafone India's total revenues and 95% of mobile data revenues.Vodafone India, which commenced operations in 2007, has operations across the country serving over 200 million customers, including over 106 million in rural areas.The telco, in a recent statement, said that it rolled out one 4G site every 10-minute in the last 2-months. In each circle, Vodafone is aggressively growing their 4G footprint by adding new towns daily.Vodafone's latest 4G contract follows a recent multi-year managed services contract worth €200 million which the telco awarded to Finnish telecom gear vendor a few months back.The telco had previously awarded a three-year managed services and network operations deal worth $180-$220million to Chinese gear maker Huawei covering a few circles.Nokia has had a successful run so far in the country's 4G market, having already pocketed a a big-ticket 4G deployment and expansion contract worth around $500 million from Bharti Airtel, India's leading telecom operator.Under the deal, Nokia is deploying 4G technology in three new circles -- Gujarat, Bihar, and UP East -- telecom circle, in addition to six circles -- Mumbai, MP, West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab and Kerala circles -- it already serves.The Finnish gear maker recently told ET that it bagged a total 120 deals in 2016, and it had also claimed leadership in India's LTE (4G) market on the basis of all deals that concluded before and after the spectrum auction.“We are number one in terms of circles and number of base stations which are going to be rolled out. Our market share in 4G has been higher than 3G and 3G market share was higher than 2G. Similarly, we are number one in VoLTE solution, with a significant lead. It's almost 100% market share,” Nokia India head Sanjay Malik had told ET in a recent interaction.
A couple was left speechless after seeing a “ghost plane” fly over their car.
Richard Jephson and their wife were travelling through Rowsley at about 2.30pm last Monday when they saw the aircraft.
They said: “It was incredibly low – it appeared to be at the same height as the roofs and trees nearby – and it was almost wobbling from side to side.
“It was completely silent.
“As it moved out of sight it banked to the left and dropped.
“We both waited for the sound of the plane crashing but this didn't happen.”
When they got home, the couple looked online to see if anybody else had seen it.
Richard said: “When we got in and turned on the television, the news was on and they were saying that the last surviving Dambuster pilot had died.
“I said to Helen, ‘perhaps it was an enthusiast paying their respects', and Helen said, ‘perhaps it was him'.
“It's a complete mystery and it's left me speechless.”
Labour leader Ed Miliband has been urged by party activists to take action to ensure more MPs from ethnic minority backgrounds are elected amid claims some constituencies are excluding black and Asian candidates.
Labour has only nominated one non-white candidate to run in the May 2015 General Election out of the 34 seats where Labour MPs are stepping down.
The Conservative Party has selected five non-white candidates to stand in the 32 seats where MPs are retiring. While this presents a stark contrast with the Labour selection, the Tories recently came under fire after a Tory councilor suggested one candidate was not selected because they were non-white and female.
Furthermore, Labour has only selected a small number of ethnic minority standard-bearers in ultra-marginal seats, where Miliband stands a higher chance of winning new Labour seats.
David Lammy, the black Labour MP for Tottenham, said the latest figures were significantly worse than previous elections for the party, which has traditionally performed better than its rivals for the promotion of non-white candidates.
Lammy suggested in future Labour should guarantee at least one non-white candidate on the shortlist of constituencies with a poor record of choosing ethnic minority candidates.
They warned that the party may look “complacent” about its support from ethnic minorities.
“The party is in danger of looking incredibly complacent. Britain's ethnic minorities have traditionally voted Labour but parliament is a long, long way from reflecting the nation as a whole.”
“If we are failing to select enough on a regional basis over a period of time, we ought to think about black and minority shortlists, with at least one on the list,” they said.
Speaking to The Independent, a member of Labour's national executive committee called the party's record “shameful.”
The Conservatives have chosen standard-bearers from ethnic minorities in South Ribble, Havant, Hampshire North East, Wealden and Richmond, where retiring Tory MPs are leaving their successors with comfortable Conservative majorities.
However, the issue of race is proving damaging to the Conservatives, too.
In November John Barnes, a Tory councilor for Bexhill and Battle, came under fire after they told the Financial Times the combination of Suella Fernades' sex and ethnicity was a “handicap” which caused them to miss selection as a Conservative candidate. Fernades is of Mauritian and Kenyan descent.
The activist came third in the battle to replace Greg Barker MP in the safe Conservative seat, eventually losing out to Huw Merrimen, a local lawyer, who will stand for election in May 2015.
Barnes further said Fernandes put in a “wowzer performance on the night” after “battling three good men,” but added that “the double whammy of being brown and a woman probably handicaps them still.”
A Labour spokesperson told The Independent it had more ethnic minority MPs, MEPs and councillors than any other party, but admitted there was still work to be done.
“We know there is always more to do and we will continue to work hard to ensure that we break down the barriers to political participation.”

BENGALURU: The state Congress may have reason to cheer, A pre-poll survey conducted by a market research agency C-fore has given Congress an absolute majority with its opponents BJP and JD(S) struggling far behind.
The survey report, which has been put up in the agency's website and circulated by the Chief Minister's Office on Sunday, predicts 120 to 132 seats for Congress, well ahead of the magic number of 113 for absolute majority. A company representative, speaking to Express, stressed that the survey was not conducted at the request of any political party and claimed that the exercise was part of its normal operations.
According to the findings of the survey, BJP is expected to win 60 to 72 seats while JD(S) is left far behind with 24 to 30 seats. The Karnataka was conducted between July 19 and August 10 and covered 24,679 voters in 165 Assembly constituencies covering all the districts.
According to the report, Congress is expected to get 43 per cent of the vote share if polls are held now, much ahead of BJP at 32 per cent and JD(S) at 17 per cent.
Siddaramaiah enjoys the overwhelming support of the people of Karnataka as the most popular CM the state has seen in the recent past with 46 per cent voting them as the best.
B S Yeddyurappa of BJP and H D Kumaraswamy of JD(S) are nowhere near with scores of 27 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively.
The Goodyear NASCAR 500 race was run at the then new A$54 million Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne, Australia on February 28, 1988. The race was the first ever NASCAR event held outside of North America. Unlike Winston Cup races in the United States, the 500 was actually 500 kilometres which is only 310 miles (roughly the same length as a Busch Series race).
Headlining the race were a number of Winston cups and Winston West Series drivers such as Alabama Gang members Bobby Allison, who had won the 1988 Daytona 500 just two weeks prior (his third and last win in the event), and Neil Bonnett, who had won the previous weekends Pontiac Excitement 400 at the Richmond International Raceway. Other NASCAR regulars including Michael Waltrip (the younger brother of triple Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip and a future Daytona 500 winner) and Dave Marcis took on Australians new to Super Speedway such as Touring car drivers Allan Grice, Kiwi Jim Richards, and Dick Johnson, although Grice had previously raced in Winston Cup events such as the longest race in the series, the Coca-Cola 600 at the famous Charlotte Motor Speedway, the track on which Calder Park owner Bob Jane had modeled the Thunderdome. Grice had qualified 32nd at the 1987 Coca-Cola 600, becoming the first Australian to qualify for a NASCAR Winston Cup race. They would be classified in 35th place at the end of the 600 after their car suffered differential failure.
The most famous last name in NASCAR racing history was also represented. Kyle Petty, the son of NASCAR's "King" Richard Petty and the grandson of Lee Petty, the winner of the very first Daytona 500 in 1959, also made the trip down under for Australia's first ever NASCAR race. In a test session prior the meeting, Richard Petty set an unofficial lap record for the Thunderdome of 28.2 seconds for an average speed of 142.85 mp/h.
The race was broadcast live across Australia by the Seven Network, and was broadcast internationally through ESPN in the US and also throughout Europe, with commentary provided by their regular motor sport commentary team of Mike Raymond, Garry Wilkinson and Neil Crompton. Long-time motor racing and NASCAR journalist Chris Economaki, who had previously been part of Seven's Bathurst 1000 coverage in the late 1970s and early 1980s, also returned to Australia to be Seven's pit reporter and NASCAR expert during the race with local motoring journalist and race driver Peter McKay also doing pit reports. Seven utilised a number of Racecam units during the race with camera's mounted in several cars including those of Neil Bonnett and regular racecam drivers Allan Grice and Dick Johnson.
Qualifying [ edit ]
The race was 280 laps of the 1.801 km (1.119 mi) quad-oval Thunderdome (though it was generally referred to as a Tri-oval). Neil Bonnett driving their Pontiac Grand Prix for their Winston Cup team RahMoc Enterprises, won the $10,000 Goodyear-Parkroyal Pole Shootout with a time of 28.829 ahead of Allison driving a Buick LeSabre and the fastest of the Aussies, Allan Grice driving a Oldsmobile Delta 88 with a time of 28.871 seconds. Behind Grice, the highest placed Australian was Tasmanian speedway driver Robin Best who qualified 4th in their Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
During Friday's qualifying session, Bonnett was the fastest qualifier with a time of 28.71 seconds.

Race summary [ edit ]
Bonnett and Allison dominated the race, swapping the lead many times in the heat of the summer afternoon where cabin temperatures were reported to reach over 57° Celsius (135° Fahrenheit).
Bonnett led from the start, with Grice passing Allison coming out of turn 2 to move into second on lap 2. The Aussie then set out after Bonnet with Allison in hot pursuit and was looking likely to challenge the Pontiac, but came off second best in a touch with Allison's Buick coming out of Turn 4 which brought the races first caution after just 13 laps after Grice's Oldsmobile was sent spinning across the infield. While Grice had over 20 years of motor racing experience, their NASCAR experience was limited compared to Allison's who at that stage was a 27-year veteran of the sport with some 707 race starts and 86 Winston Cup wins so it was no surprise to see the American come through without a drama. For Grice, it sent them to the rear of the field for the restart and over the next 50 or so laps, their charge back through the field saw the brakes go away on their Oldsmobile.
Michael Waltrip had the inglorious honour of being the first to call into the pits at the end of the first lap for new tyres after a tap from behind had sent them into a half spin from which they quickly recovered. The tap also saw damage to the rear of Waltrip's Monte Carlo.
The race was marred by a multi-car crash at around lap 80 in turns 3 and 4 involving 8 cars, including the Ford Thunderbird of Dick Johnson and Grice who, after struggling with no brakes in their charge through the field, ran into the wreck at speed, heavily damaging both their and Johnson's cars in the process as it was the #17 Thunderbird that they hit. Grice suffered a broken collarbone as a result of the high speed accident, while both theirs and Johnson's cars were write-off's.
The fastest man at the Thunderdome, Neil Bonnett, won the race by less than a second from a fast closing Bobby Allison who benefited from a late race yellow flag pit stop which allowed them to change all four tyres without losing a lap. The Alabama Gang members dominated the race with Dave Marcis finishing 3rd giving the USA a 1-2-3 result and the trio finishing 2 laps clear of 4th placed Glen Steurer driving a Monte Carlo. In fact, the top 10 finishers were Americans, proving that experience in this form or racing was paramount. The first Australian to finish was the Monte Carlo of Robin Best who finished 13 laps down in 11th place.
Only 15 of the 32 car field finished the race.
Bonnett's win earned them A$59,000 (US$42,000).

The Democratic National Committee's leaders are in the hot seat. A Tuesday report revealed that the party committee and the Clinton campaign had helped fund research that resulted in the infamous "Trump Dossier," a dubious document containing obscene and lurid accusations against last year's eventual winner for president.
"Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in the decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization," spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said.
In contrast, Brian Fallon, who served as a spokesperson on the Clinton campaign, which also funded the same research, has embraced and defended those efforts in the hours after the Washington Post broke the story (though they maintain they were not aware of the project until after the election).
But not the DNC. Rather than offering an immediate defense, the organization sought to distance its current leadership from the project. Reporters Maggie Haberman and Ken Vogel of the New York Times reacted to the Washington Post story by accusing all the Democrats invovled of lying to the press for the better part of a year.
"Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year," Haberman tweeted. Vogel added, "When I tried to report this story, Clinton campaign lawyer [Marc Elias] pushed back vigorously, saying 'You (or your sources) are wrong.'" Elias also represented the DNC, according to the Washington Post.
By insisting on the "new leadership's" ignorance, the DNC has redirected questions back to its old leadership: Rep. Debbie Wassmerman Schultz, D-Fla., and Donna Brazile.
Though Fusion GPS's research had previously (at least reportedly) been funded by a still-unidentified Republican donor, in April of 2016, Fusion was retained by Elias' firm on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC, both of which continued to fund the research until late October of last year. That means the DNC funded the project during the tenures of both Wasserman Schultz and Brazile, the latter having taken over in late July of 2016 after Wasserman Schultz resigned.
Reports have indicated Democrats picked up and started funding the Fusion research around the time Trump secured the GOP nomination, after the GOP funder lost interest. "When the Republican donor stopped paying for the research, Elias, acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC, agreed to pay for the work to continue."
"The Democrats paid for research, including by Fusion GPS, because of concerns that little was known about Trump and their business interests, according to the people familiar with the matter," the Post reported. Dossier author Christopher Steele was not hired until after Fusion was retained by Elias on behalf of Clinton's campaign and the DNC, though sources insisted to the Post that neither the campaign nor the DNC directed "Steele's activities" at any point.
As far as the DNC's involvement in funding Fusion's contentious research goes, expect Wasserman Schultz and Brazile to face questions about what they knew in the days ahead.

Women seeking redress from Irish state after being ordered to work unpaid in institutions run by Catholic church from 1920s
Elderly survivors of Ireland's notorious Magdalene laundries are threatening to go on hunger strike if the Irish government fails to establish a financial redress scheme for women held in the institutions.
The Fine Gael-Labour coalition will receive a report on Tuesday that will establish the Irish state's role in a system that the UN Committee on Torture described as slavery.
Girls described as "troubled" or deemed to have been morally "fallen" – mainly unmarried young mothers – were ordered by courts to work unpaid in the laundries run by the Irish Catholic church. The workhouses operated from the early 1920s until 1996.
Steven O'Riordain, a representative of the Magdalene Survivors Together, has warned some women will go on hunger strike if the government does not meet their demands.
"There is a possibility that this will happen. Some of the women have said if they do not get proper redress from a state which was responsible for being abandoned in these institutions. Many of them say they are at that age now where they have nothing to lose if the government fails to set up a scheme that will give some compensation for what happened to them," they said.
In 2011, the UN Committee Against Torture called on the Irish government to set up an inquiry into the treatment of thousands of women and girls.
It has been estimated that up to 30,000 women passed through the laundries and had to wash clothing and bedding for bodies ranging from the Irish army to hotel groups in the republic without any pay.
Tuesday's report has been headed by Senator Martin McAleese, the husband of the former Irish president Mary McAleese.
Three orders of Catholic nuns – the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity, the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, the Religious Sisters of Charity and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd – ran the Magdalene laundries.
One of the Rockville High School students charged in a reported rape said the act was consensual.
Henry Sanchez Milian is being represented by attorney Andrew Jezic. Jezic said not only was the act with a teenage girl and another male consensual, but there may not be four years' difference between the victim's age and Sanchez Milian.
#BREAKING Montgomery Co Schools says it's received 100s of racist & threatening calls, including"shoot all immigrants.". @wusa9 #Rockville — Bruce Leshan (@BruceLeshan) March 23, 2017
RELATED: Rockville rape sparks questions and national attention
Police said the 14-year-old girl was approached by Sanchez Milian, 18, and Jose Montano, 17, in a school hallway earlier this month. When they refused to have sex, they forced them into a boy's bathroom stall at school, police said.
Montano and Sanchez-Milian are in the 9th grade at Rockville High School.
The incident has sparked outrage not only because of the reported act itself, but also because Sanchez Milian has an “alien removal case” pending.
The teen crossed the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Tex. In the Rio Grande Valley in August 2016, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Sanchez Milian's lawyer said they were fleeing from threats and gang violence in Guatemala.

They were detained at a refugee resettlement center for 12 days because they were a minor. Sanchez Milian was released and given notice to appear in immigration court, but a date wasn't set because they aren't a priority case. Priority court dates are given to illegal immigrants with criminal records or have a gang affiliation.
Sanchez Milian and Montano are both charged as adults with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense. They're being held without bond.
I often like to tell people that I have the best seat in the house at Camden Yards. My perch in the Oriole Park press box is right behind home plate, with perfect vantage of everything. On most nights it's perfect. But with the box positioned just above the top of the backstop netting, every once in a while, it can be hazard zone when foul balls zip into the press box.
Very rarely, foul balls lead to casualties. And in the ninth inning of Friday night's 13-3 Orioles loss, the 0-2 pitch off Pedro Alvarez's bat killed my laptop.
This is every reporter's nightmare, to be putting the finishing touches on a story that has to be sent right after the final out when fate takes away hours of work. On this night, I saw the foul ball coming straight for me, I ducked but selfishly didn't pull away my trusty laptop and the ball hit the back of my screen with a thud, knocking the screen covering off and turning the words on my screen into zagged cracks of nothingness.
I was lucky. I wasn't the one on deadline. My colleague, Peter Schmuck, was writing the game recap, and I was working on a postgame night blog for our website, something that could easily be rewritten from memory.
And yes, I've had my computer break down before. Every reporter has had to dictate their story on deadline. I remember one time covering a high school baseball game, getting kicked out of the field and begging my way into a closed restaurant so I could use their dial-up modem. The longer you've been in the business, the more stories you have.
Still, this is a situation you never want to be in.
The photo of my cracked screen made the rounds on Twitter, because who doesn't love the sight of total destruction on media. SBNation wrote a whole story about it, even coming up with conspiracy theories about the trajectory of the ball because to them, it appeared that the front of the screen was hit instead of the back.
There's no conspiracy. Trust me, I've been there before. In fact, Friday night was the second time in 10 months that my laptop took one for the team. The first time, when Gerardo Parra fouled a ball back at Camden Yards last Aug. 31, my laptop still worked.
This time, it didn't. Alvarez's foul ball not only left dent just to the left of where Parra's ball hit, but it completely destroyed the screen.
I was told that the exit velocity of Alvarez's foul ball was 76.2 mph, but when you see leather and seams coming at your head off the bat, it seems like it's 106.2 mph.
Like I said, foul balls coming into the Camden Yards press box are a way of life. But there are much more veteran reporters in the press box who have never had a ball come there way, let alone two in less than a year.
In baseball, they always say the ball will find you. And it did … twice. Maybe I did something to anger the baseball gods. Who knows?
But I can't help but, more than anything, be thankful that my laptop was there for me, because on two separate occasions, those baseballs were heading straight for my dome before my screen made the ultimate sacrifice.
Rest in peace, trusty laptop. May your successor be just as strong.

Queering Cameron's Britain
At long last, a US president supports same-sex marriage. ‘I think same-sex couples should be able to get married' Barack Obama told ABC News on Wednesday. That same day, Queen Elizabeth declined to mention it in their address to Parliament – despite promises made by the governing coalition (who had written the Queen's speech) about pursuing marriage equality legislation.
Fearful of alienating conservative voters, the Tories and Liberal Democrats had decided not to push the issue following their humiliating defeat last week in local elections. As a new arrival in the UK, from a decidedly homophobic eastern European country called Poland, I'm extremely disappointed. Why pander to domestic right-wingers, when highly educated immigrants like me are Britain's future? David Cameron owes me an explanation.
Thankfully, British parties that champion civil partnerships such as the Greens are maintaining their commitment to extending marriage rights to queers. MP Caroline Lucas' Equal Love campaign, which seeks to challenge the current UK ban on civil partnerships, is just the kind of bill Europe needs right now. Lucas MP will give a talk about their initiative at two PM this afternoon at the University of Brighton. Local Souciant readers are of course invited.
In 1959, Hannah Arendt wrote that “The right to marry whoever one wishes is an elementary human right.” Though they were writing about interracial marriage, there is no reason to doubt that the philosopher meant everybody. A universalist writing in the shadow of the Holocaust, if same-sex marriage had been on the American agenda, Arendt would have championed it. Indeed, today, the struggle to combat homophobia constitutes an equivalent struggle to that of racism in the US during the Cold War. Surely, such parallels do not escape President Obama.
Legislation isn't the only way to transform society. Cultural campaigning is just as necessary. Coinciding with today's talk by Caroline Lucas, Canadian art historian Lara Perry and Polish queer curator Pawel Leszkowicz have mounted a timely exhibit, Civil Partnerships: Queer & Feminist Art and Activism. Opening this afternoon, the show features the newest social and sensual, feminist and queer works by students and faculty of the University of Brighton and by specially invited international artists.
Consisting of three parts: queer and feminist portraiture, the homoerotic male nude, socially engaged art/LGBTQ visibility campaigns across Europe, particularly in Italy and Poland, the exhbition focuses on member states that refuse to consider recognition of same sex unions. The show also showcases Belgium's posters against homophobia in soccer, and Britain's Justin Campaign. According to Austin Scott, such shows find a natural home in Brighton.
The city of Brighton has a longstanding historical association with all things queer. It feels appropriate, then, that the city plays home to a n ascent collective of queer artists seeking to explore and push the boundaries of art and sexual orientation.
The Civil Partnerships show will be accompanied by a May 17 forum featuring such speakers as gender scholar Anne-Emmanuelle Berger who continues the work of French theory star Hélène Cixous, performance art scholar Lois Keidan, and lesbian painter Sadie Lee. Continuing the programming, on May 19, Europe's leading art museum, the Tate Modern, will host a Civil Partnerships symposium.
Why do we, gays, demand recognition from the most repressive of institutions, like the military, the police and the courts? We want to reinvent, reform, and humanize them. It is not just a historical curiosity that in the middle of the Middle Ages same-sex unions were recognized. Yale historian John Boswell has demonstrated what British writer Marina Warner dubbed “a historical precedent – nothing less than the blessing of the church – for male coupling.” Under postmodernity, marriage, as the recognition of relationships, belongs to the people, not to the church.
Ours is not an Elizabethan age, but an era of dark prejudices inspired by economic crisis. Keeping your subjects in debt and inequality is the policy of the UK's Thatcherite leadership. In such a political context, the Green Party's ambition to replace the current feudal ethos with a republican one is an especially radical one. Given the pressure exerted by President Obama's example, and the current cultural campaigning for equality here in England, it's only a question of time before the old order falls. Please help us topple it.

If you think Google is going to take over the world, you can at least rest assured they're going to do it in a green way. The internet giant has invested in yet another green initiative, pouring some serious cash into biomass fuel firm CoolPlanetBiofuels. The eco start-up is currently developing technology to produce fuel from inedible biomass such as grass and wood chips. So will Google bio- fueling stations be the next big thing?
The venture capital arm of Google hopes to capitalize on CoolPlanetBiofuels' process that produces a byproduct that can capture carbon and also be added to soil to improve crop yields, leading to what Google Ventures described as a “negative carbon fuel.”
Mike Cheiky, chief executive of CoolPlanet, said in a statement on Thursday, “While we have made significant progress over the past couple of years, this new infusion of capital, coupled with the expertise of the Google Ventures team, enables our team to scale even faster.”
Google's undisclosed amount of Series B funding follows a $42 million investment last month in a weather insurance start-up, and another investment in the power-saving energy conversion technology firm Transphorm.

Ukrainian soldiers at the southern edge of Luhanske told VICE News on Sunday that it was suicide to go any further down the road. As they spoke, incoming and outgoing mortar fire boomed just off to the east.
The 10-mile stretch of highway between Debaltseve and Luhanske is the only lifeline providing food and ammunition to pro-Kiev forces defending the city. The road is full of mines and flanked by rebel firing positions.
"A shell landed three meters from our vehicle," they told VICE News. "It's a miracle we're alive. The third truck got hit."
As they sped north through the no man's land between Debaltseve and the next Ukrainian position, they began taking fire from rebel artillery. A squad commander who goes by the call sign Jackson was in the first truck.
Seven trucks full of Ukrainian soldiers left the besieged town of Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine hours after the so-called ceasefire began Sunday. Only five made it back safely behind Ukrainian lines.

Seven trucks full of Ukrainian soldiers left the besieged town of Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine hours after the so-called ceasefire began Sunday. Only five made it back safely behind Ukrainian lines.

Ukraine ceasefire ignored as fierce battle for Debaltseve continues to rage. Read more here.
Near-constant rebel shelling had pinned down Jackson's men in the city, but they had run out of ammunition and supplies so they decided to make a run for it, they said. "If we had stayed there, we would have stayed there for eternity," they said grimly.
Fifteen soldiers from Jackson's unit made it out, including four wounded men. After arriving safely at the hospital in Artemivsk, about 30 miles northwest of Debaltseve, the grimy soldiers handed the injured down from the open-backed truck on stretchers and blankets.
'You should either fight, or you should take them out, but to leave them there as cannon fodder isn't right.'
Jackson's unit first deployed to Debaltseve in August. The city holds a key rail junction that rebels have been desperately trying to capture. By January, the rebels had surrounded the city on three sides and were shelling it mercilessly. On February 8, they drew the noose tight. Medics in Artemivsk said Sunday's convoy was the first to make it out of the city in the past week.
Debaltseve is the main reason why fighting has continued in eastern Ukraine despite the ceasefire, which took effect one minute after midnight on Sunday. In a television address announcing the truce, President Petro Poroshenko said the road to Debaltseve remained open and that the troops there had been resupplied with ammunition. But the story of the convoy's escape on Sunday shows that both those claims are essentially false. The rebels "had lots of equipment," Jackson said. "We stayed to the very end, but it wasn't viable to stay without weapons."

Thousands of Ukrainian troops remain trapped in Debaltseve, which some soldiers have compared to the bloody WWII battle of Stalingrad. Sixty percent of the city has been destroyed, and several buildings burn down each day from shelling, Jackson said. "You just get used to the constant shooting and explosions," they said. "We know what they're shooting at us just by the sound of it." Two of the men delivered to the hospital had bullet wounds, indicating the fighting is moving to close quarters.
A mass text message was sent to cell phones in the area urging the Ukrainian forces to surrender: "Parasha (Poroshenko) betrayed us. He's fucking lying there's no encirclement. We're going to the Donetsk guys. Captivity not death."

Kiev was likely banking on the ceasefire to provide a respite from shelling that could be used to evacuate or reinforce the troops in Debaltseve. But Alexander Zakharchenko, head of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic, said their forces would observe the ceasefire everywhere but near Debaltseve and would "stop any attempt to break out of the encirclement."
"There wasn't a word about Debaltseve in the [Minsk] agreement," Zakharchenko argued. "This means that Ukraine has simply betrayed the 5,000 people in this encirclement."
The sad part is they may be right. Poroshenko reportedly refused to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a "green corridor" to allow the Ukrainians to leave the city. Of the 16 hours the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia negotiated in Minsk, eight were spent arguing over whether Debaltseve was actually caught in a "kettle," the Russian term for a military encirclement, according to Andrei Kolesnikov, a Kremlin pool journalist who has been allowed extensive access to Putin in the past.
Ukraine ceasefire offers 'glimmer of hope,' though many issues remain unresolved. Read more here.
"Vladimir Putin insisted that it was, and that if a ceasefire was agreed, it would be strange if it wouldn't be violated: Those in the kettle will surely try to break out of it, and those who are boiling the kettle will try to gather the steam," Kolesnikov wrote in the newspaper Kommersant.
Despite posturing from many on the Ukrainian side that they won't give up Debaltseve, Jackson said many troops there want out. "We're all trying to leave," they said. "The only other option is death."
But Kiev has no way to rescue the thousands of troops hunkered down in trenches and dugouts around the city, not to mention up to 1,000 civilians who reportedly remain there. Both the highway and the fields north of Debaltseve are mined and under heavy rebel fire, according to a bearded Artemivsk ambulance driver with a braided ponytail who goes by the nom-de-guerre Kapulan.
'We're all trying to leave. The only other option is death.'
Those who try to get through the gauntlet can either follow the burnt-out carcasses of vehicles that already hit mines in the fields, or drive down the highway as fast as possible, hoping to spot the thinly covered mines there, Kapulan said. Their volunteer ambulance unit only has four working vehicles after mines destroyed two and shelling took out four.
The situation in Debaltseve is untenable because no one can resupply the fighters, said Alla Neschadym, a medic with the ambulance unit whose son Oleg is still fighting in the city. They blamed Kiev for failing to mount a mass military campaign to reinforce them or to negotiate a surrender or corridor for them to withdraw.
US claims Russian military equipment is being used for attacks in Ukraine ahead of ceasefire. Read more here.
"You should either fight, or you should take them out, but to leave them there as cannon fodder isn't right," Neschadym said.
They called on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Red Cross to participate in a humanitarian convoy to evacuate soldiers in the hopes that would prevent the rebels from shelling it, although neither of those groups is likely to take on the physical risk and political ramifications of such an operation. But something needs to be done, Neschadym insisted.
"We need an extraordinary solution," they said, "because there are many people still trapped there."

PELHAM, Alabama - Supporters of Carly's Law, the proposed Alabama law that would legalize a marijuana-derived medicine that could help control seizures and other health issues, are holding a rally in Pelham on March 1.
The rally to promote the legalization of the marijuana-derived cannabidiol, also known as CBD oil, will be from 2 to 6 p.m. at the Pelham Civic Complex and Ice Arena.
Speakers scheduled so far include state Rep. Mike Ball of Madison who sponsored the bill and Paige Figi, whose young daughter Charlotte Figi had suffered 300 seizures a week but dropped to a couple or so a month after using the marijuana-derived treatment.
"It's going to be a public awareness and educational rally to let everyone know what Carly's Law is about and who it can help," said the Birmingham area's Dustin Chandler, whose daughter is the bill's inspiration.
The 2-year-old girl suffers from uncontrollable seizures caused by a genetic disorder called CDKL5, also known as cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5. Carly's parents, Dustin and Amy Chandler, hope that CDB oil could help treat their daughter's violent seizures that happen multiple times each day.
"We're going to have hopefully hundreds of families there it might affect who can tell their story," Dustin Chandler said. "They're the face behind Carly's Law. There are real children and real people affected by the passage of this law."
The Alabama Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday gave approval to the bill by an 8-3 vote. The legislation's next step is consideration on the Senate floor.
"I think it shows good bipartisan support," Chandler said about the Senate committee's action. "I don't feel this is a red or blue issue. This is a human-right issue, a health issue."
Many Alabama families are calling on lawmakers to approve the bill so their children could potentially benefit from the marijuana-derived treatment that does not produce the drug's intoxicating effects. At least one family from Alabama has relocated to Colorado, which has legalized marijuana use for medicinal and recreational purposes, to help their daughter who suffers from violent seizures.
"We want to let people know what Carly's Law is about and who it's affecting," Chandler said. "We want to show the importance to the public and the politicians that there are faces behind this law that it will help and we are real people and we need help."
Chandler, who is a Pelham police officer, said they hope people will understand the importance of the law in Alabama.
"The parents that want to help their children are not criminals. It's an issue of doing the right thing for the children of Alabama. That's essentially what it is," they said. "To me, a vote no to the Carly's Law is a vote no to the people of Alabama."
The spittle running down the passenger window was the moment when Fiona Morley realised the cyclists in Surrey had gone too far.
The landlady of the Compasses Inn, Gomshall, acts as the unofficial supplier of hot food to the village's pensioners. Even during a midweek lunchtime, the pub is full of over-sixties tucking into steak-and-ale pie or the ploughman's.
And they feel quite protective towards their clientele: “One of my little pensioners came in here, and they didn't look well. They had just run into some cyclists — three abreast — and had tried to overtake, but they wouldn't move at all. Eventually they found an opening, and as they went past, they spat at them They were really shaken. The spit was still on the car. It's not just rude. I think that is the epitome of loutishness.”
These Lycra louts, as the army of amateur cyclists have been nicknamed, have started to flock to the picturesque roads around the Surrey Hills in vast numbers. From Richmond Park on the edge of London all the way down to Box Hill and across to Cranleigh, you cannot fail to encounter a group of Wiggo-wannabes, clad in skintight clothing, trying to emulate Sir Bradley, Chris Froome, Mark Cavendish and other world-beating British veloists. They come to Surrey as a direct result of the Olympics cycle road race that was held in this area last year.
“Olympic legacy” is a phrase spoken not with pride but with disdain by many in the county. And now the backlash against the bicyclists has begun.
Jean Hoblyn, who owns the Barn café at Newlands Corner, between Gomshall and Guildford, says: “If Wiggins came in here, I'd give them a piece of my mind. It's all right for them — they closed the roads when the Olympics were on. But these roads are dangerous, with 60mph speed limits and blind corners. I'm terrified there's going to be an accident.”
For Mrs Hoblyn, Mrs Morley and many other residents, enough is enough. “I didn't have a problem with the Olympics,” says Mrs Morley. “There was a great atmosphere. We were all proud of our country. The problem is that everybody now comes and practises on these roads, and their mindset is that they are in an Olympic race — riding four abreast and often over both sides of the road.”
At this point, James Nicholls, a customer nursing a pint of Surrey Hills ale, pipes up: “I like cycling. I cycle around the village a bit. But these louts have gone too far. They are obnoxious and completely oblivious to any of the traffic on the road. Why should we put up with it? We feel it is Londoners coming down, filling up our roads, with no benefit to us whatsoever.”
The issue came to a head this week, as preparations were under way for the Tour of Britain's arrival in Surrey today, with the professionals, led by Sir Bradley, riding a route similar to the one used at the Olympics. A petition entitled “Stop Surrey Being Turned into a Cycle Track” received 2,000 signatures within days of being launched. The petition has struck a nerve for a number of reasons.
Never have Britain's roads been so full of cyclists. In total, 6.8 million people cycle once a month, a rise of 1 million in four years, according to the organisation British Cycling — and a disproportionate number have ended up in Surrey.
All those extra two-wheelers taking to the road is great news for the health of Britain, and most are undoubtedly polite citizens, keen to get fit. But many residents around the Surrey Hills argue that a few of the “Mamils” (middle-aged men in Lycra) are plain rude — spitting, swearing and gesticulating at any car that dares to overtake.
Of equal concern is the infrastructure, which is inadequate for mass-participation cycling.
The region is distinguished by its postcard-pretty villages straight out of a Miss Marple tale — Holmbury St Mary, Abinger Hammer, Westhumble — and sharply winding roads that cut through copses and woods. Many are completely canopied by beech trees, creating stunning, shady, leaf-lined tunnels through which the cyclists hurtle — especially dangerous when they fail to wear bright clothing.
“So often you come across 150 cyclists racing down these roads, with no prior warning,” says Mrs Hoblyn. “These are not organised events, just club cyclists who have decided to have an impromptu race.”
However, the petition is supported not just by motorists, but by some cyclists, too.
Living on an idyllic farm off one of those tree-lined roads are Jane and David Biggins, who are in their seventies. They keep chickens, a few pigs and sheep, along with a Dalmatian puppy, Polka.
“I'm a cyclist myself, and go every day before breakfast. It's marvellous that it's become so popular after the Olympics, getting kids outside and tackling obesity,” Mr Biggins says. They proudly show me their tandem, which they partly built themselves and which they and their wife have used to go on cycling holidays.
Their objection is the draconian road closures sometimes implemented, with no consultation and little warning. “We're a farm with a drive leading up to the road. There's no pavement, so when they block the road, we can't get out at all. We have fields on the other side of the road, and we have to get permission to go there to see our sheep.
“We have had three road closures this year. One day it was closed from 6.15 in the morning to 6.15 at night. If I need to get to hay on the other side, there's no way I can put that off; you can't delay farming.”
Their view is echoed by Ian Huggins, the petition organiser. They profoundly object to some of the events organised in its wake, not least the Prudential Ride London-Surrey in August, championed by Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London. The event incorporated two separate races: one involving 16,000 amateurs in the morning, followed by 200 professionals in the afternoon. It is scheduled to become an annual event and be even bigger next year.
“I am not allowed out of my front door. It's a cul-de-sac. I can't go anywhere by car,” says Mr Huggins, who lives in Esher and runs a clay-pigeon-shooting school at weekends.
“Why, for a charity bike ride, should I be kettled in my home from 5am to 7pm, and not be allowed to pursue my hobby or pastime? This was in August during the school holidays.”
What really offends is the lack of consultation. “There was a leaflet put through our doors telling us that our cars would be towed away if we were parked on the roads,” they say. “It was a fait accompli.”
The road closures have been particularly onerous as many residents, reliant on their cars to go to relatives or shops, cannot leave their homes.
But it is a trend that is unlikely to go away, either in Surrey or elsewhere in Britain. That is because we are witnessing an explosion in events — in their broadest possible definition.
No other country in Europe invests as much time nor as much money on “leisure” as the UK. Last year, we spent £101 billion, a sum that has increased despite the recession and is even more than we spent on food and drink. For many, weekends are no longer about pottering in the garden, but joining a mass-participation event.
Triathlons, almost unheard of a decade ago, now take place on a weekly basis around the roads, lakes and parks of Britain; this weekend alone, there are more than 250 different 5km runs, 10km runs or half-marathons happening; local authorities are more willing than ever to grant licences to rock concerts, outdoor theatres, children's festivals and “winter wonderlands”.
The Royal Parks of London have — within a decade – been transformed from a place to walk or sunbathe to a venue for large-scale commercial events. Last weekend, much of Hyde Park was closed off for the ITU World Triathlon, prompting many businesses to complain about the disruption for an event watched by few people.
Tomorrow, the Tour of Britain concludes in central London, leading to significant road closures and transport diversions yet again in the capital.
I ask Mrs Morley what cyclists need to do before they would welcome them.
“Well, for a start they could learn some manners,” they reply.

Beneath the waves of the Pacific, powerful, gleaming tunas swim at such speeds that some species have earned the moniker “Porsches of the Sea.” But when hauled above the surface, the skipjack, yellowfin, Pacific bluefin, albacore, and bigeye most commonly fished in the region are valued largely for the estimated $6 billion in revenue they generate each year. This lucrative trade, though, comes at a high environmental cost: Alongside the vast annual Pacific tuna haul, countless tons of bycatch — sharks, rays, turtles, seabirds, and other non-target species — are reeled in, too.
It has been an intractable problem, but one small island nation in the western Pacific is attempting to do something about it. Palau — its 250-odd islands scattered like emerald confetti upon a turquoise sea — is launching a series of initiatives designed not only to sharply reduce bycatch in the tuna fishery, but also to create a vast, 193,000-square-mile marine reserve — covering 80 percent of its waters — where fishing and undersea mining will be banned.
For a nation so small — Palau is home to just 21,000 people — it's a bold move. And if it succeeds, this remote chain of small islands, whose government has been a regional leader in marine conservation, could claim its own sustainable brand of tuna and set an example for the rest of the Pacific.

After experiencing decades of rampant overfishing, a growing number of island nations in the Pacific, including Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia, also are creating marine protected areas and more closely monitoring foreign fishing fleets using satellite technology.
Sixty-five percent of the world's tuna is fished from the Pacific Ocean, and Palau lies in the heart of this hunting ground. A longline fishery operating in the nation's waters targets yellowfin and bigeye tuna, the latter favored by sashimi connoisseurs for its fatty flesh. But these migratory species have suffered the ravages of overfishing from foreign fleets. In 2006, the country caught about 3,000 metric tons of bigeye, and 2,000 of yellowfin. Last year, those numbers dipped to 115 metric tons and 148 metric tons, respectively.
Tuna populations in the Pacific have experienced significant declines since the advent of industrial tuna fishing in the 1950s. Pacific bluefin have been affected the most, their populations dropping by 97 percent from historic levels, according to estimates from the Pew Charitable Trusts. In the western and central Pacific, bigeye tuna populations have dipped to just 16 percent of historic levels, according to Pew. One investigation found that illegal, unreported, and unregulated tuna fishing could be depriving countries in the Indo-Pacific region of up to $1 billion in fishing revenue.
The beleaguered tuna industry also poses a threat to other species: One-third of Palau's tuna haul is actually bycatch, a medley of Olive Ridley sea turtles, rays, and blue and silky sharks. They are drawn to the fishery's endless hook-festooned lines of bait, which are intended for tuna, but snag other species as well.
One-third of Palau's tuna haul is bycatch, a medley of sea turtles, rays, and blue and silky sharks.
Ensnared below the surface, the hooked creatures often drown or suffer fatal damage from swallowed hooks that tear at their guts.
Now, this problematic trifecta of fishing method, hook, and bait is what Palau is trying to address. Palau's Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment, and Tourism has awarded a year's fishing rights to the non-profit The Nature Conservancy and a crew of fishermen: Together, they're chartering a boat that will experiment with a suite of fishing methods to help longlines target more of the right fish. “We're creating small changes in gear types, bait, and fishing strategies to find out whether we can significantly reduce bycatch, while [keeping fishing] economically viable,” says Mark Zimring, program director for the Indo-Pacific Tuna Program at the Nature Conservancy.
The three-phase experiment will start by testing whether differently sized circle hooks — designed to hook a fish in the lip, as opposed to J-hooks that end up hooking fish in the throat or stomachs — cause less bycatch. Research has shown the benefits of this technique, according to Michael Osmond, senior program officer for fisheries with the World Wildlife Fund and director of its Smart Gear competition, which seeks practical solutions to bycatch. Bigger circle hooks are also harder to swallow — added insurance against fatality.
The second phase will examine whether fish or squid bait is better for non-target species: Fish bait falls apart when eaten, making it more likely that turtles, in particular, will be able to consume the bait while avoiding the hook beneath.
Finally, the researchers also hope to test whether daytime versus nighttime fishing generates less bycatch, and if casting lines at different depths could help the fishery steer clear of non-target species.
All of this is taking place aboard the Chinese-flagged Shen Lain Cheng, a 79-foot, eight-crew longliner operated by Luen Thai Fishing Ventures, a company with multiple fleets in the region. “Luen Thai, we estimate, is responsible for about 25 percent of the global fresh sashimi-grade tuna market,” Zimring notes. The company has a mixed record: Greenpeace has criticized its fishing activities, and in 2013, some of Luen Thai's boats were found illegally fishing and finning sharks in the South Pacific — a practice the company's vice president, Derrick Wang, assures is now firmly in the company's past. “Our fleet is one of the most regulated in this Pacific region,” says Wang, adding that the company hopes to become an example of a sustainable fishing fleet.

The Nature Conservancy says there are benefits to collaborating with such a big company. “Working with a large industry player creates the potential for successful research fishing results to be implemented at scale, on a voluntary basis, across the company's regional operations quickly,” Zimring says.
A single hook and bait combination won't necessarily benefit all species equally, Zimring cautions. But this experiment aims to help refine a tuna fishery to sharply reduce bycatch. When the research results come out early next year, Palau will know if it's worked and whether to roll out changes across its longline industry.
The Pacific spans more than 60 million square miles, and its entire tuna industry is fraught with problems. The regional fisheries management organizations tasked with managing these fish stocks have come under fire for failing to do so. So while the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is required to manage the area's tuna stocks, in recent years Palau has taken the helm on its own marine matters.
Driving these actions is the realization that tourism is far more valuable to Palau than dead fish.
“We feel in spite of what the data has told us, particularly for bigeye and Pacific bluefin numbers, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission has done very little to address the issues,” says Umiich Sengebau, Palau's Minister for Natural Resources, Environment, and Tourism. In 2006, the government passed a law to ban bottom trawling in its waters, a destructive fishing method that rakes up the seafloor. The same year, it addressed shark bycatch by outlawing the use of steel wires in longlining fisheries and replacing them with monofilament lines, which are easier for unintentionally caught sharks to gnaw through and escape. Palau then created the world's first shark sanctuary in 2009, which kept its waters off limits to shark fishing.
Last year, in its boldest marine conservation move to date, the government announced it would convert 80 percent of is maritime territory into a giant, protected reserve by 2020. Fishing and mining will be banned in this region, and closely managed fisheries will be permitted only in the remaining 20 percent of Palau's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
The sanctuary is based on the Palauan concept of ‘bul,' in which overfished reefs are closed off for replenishment. “All science points to our pelagic resources, especially tuna, as being depleted,” says Keobel Sakuma, executive director of Palau's new marine sanctuary. “So instead of simply allowing more fishing in our EEZ, the people have decided to declare a bul on 80 percent of our EEZ. It really wasn't a question of ‘Why should we do this?,' but more a declaration of ‘How can we sit by and not do anything?'”
Driving these actions is the government's realization that tourism is far more valuable to the country than dead fish.

Tourism in the country has risen steadily in recent years, and today it accounts for roughly three-quarters of Palau's economic growth. Tourists visiting the country specifically to dive in its biodiverse waters contribute $90 million annually — roughly 40 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. By comparison, the fishing industry brings in just a fraction of that.
“Palau is marketing itself as a pristine paradise,” explains Sengebau, “and so we want an industry that is consistent with the kind of message we want to project to the rest of the world.”
The country's president, Tommy Remengesau Jr., is often quoted explaining that a single shark generates more than $1 million during its lifetime via dive tourism. So when bycatch strips the pristine waters of these iconic species, it leaves a large economic hole.
A more sustainable tuna fishery also ultimately supports the goals of the marine sanctuary. If the fishing experiment shows good results, it will shape the regulations in the 20 percent of Palau's EEZ that will be set aside as a fishing zone. Any vessels wishing to longline in this area may be required to use circle hooks of a particular size, to bait hooks with fish instead of squid, and to sink their lines at certain depths.
For a government with limited resources, enforcing these changes on vessels and safeguarding such a huge swath of ocean will be a challenge. But if fishermen comply, the tradeoff is that they could market their catch as the product of a progressive fishery, perhaps charging a premium for their catch. Vessels catching tuna in Palauan waters will also be required to land fish in Palau for processing and packaging, so that the country can generate as much revenue as possible from the fish before they are exported.
Conservationists hope the experiment will spread across the Pacific. Tuna are highly migratory species, and as other fisheries migrate along with them, bycatch will continue to occur in their wake.

“It's a regional challenge,” Zimring says.
There are signs of change elsewhere. The Federated States of Micronesia have recently joined a Nature Conservancy project to improve surveillance and management in its fisheries, and Kiribati has created a huge marine reserve that is being monitored using satellite technology.
Palau's leaders are hopeful. “If it works, and we can show it,” says Sengebau, the environment and tourism minister, “I think it's going to be a game changer in this industry.”

Murugappa Channaveerappa Modi (4 October 1916 – 11 November 2005) was an Indian ophthalmologist.[1]
Qualifications [ edit ]
Dr. Modi is believed to have performed a record half-a-million (five-lakh) eye surgeries. They travelled to remote villages and towns of India to hold mass eye camps. They were known for their dexterity as a surgeon and diagnostic acumen.[2]
Early life and education [ edit ]
They were born in Bilagi in Bagalkot district.  They are an alumnus of KLE U's Shri B M Kankanawadi Ayurved Mahavidyalaya Belgaum."Born of humble parentage – a Kannadiga from Bijapur district – Modi threw away a lucrative career in private practice after attending Gandhiji's historic prayer meeting at Bombay on August 8, 1942 where the Quit India resolution was passed. That meeting changed their lives. And Modi, the gifted ophthalmologist, dedicated their life to the sightless."I felt affected when I saw blind people begging. They just did not have money to go to doctors." Modi recalled."[3].It is also claimed that they heard the life-changing Gandhi's speech at Beelagi, a village near Bijapur, in 1942.[4]
Career [ edit ]
They were the pioneer of mass eye surgery in India. The Guinness Book of World Records lists Modi as the "most dedicated doctor," for performing the highest number of eye surgeries. They performed as many as 833 cataract operations in one day.[5] They visited 46,120 villages and 12,118,630 patients, and performed a total of 610,564 operations to February 1993."When my time comes I would like to disappear silently"he concluded.He meant that when death comes to them they would accept it wholeheartedly and die without troubling anyone with all the good and bad they did.
"Between their first camp held in 1943 at Pattan in Gujarat until their death in 2005, Murugappa Channaveerappa Modi examined over 10 million people and conducted over 7.8 lakh cataract surgeries with funds from philanthropists and donors." In 1980, Dr. Modi set up the M.C. Modi Charitable Eye Hospital in Mahalakshmipuram: initially functioning as camp-based eye hospital, it treated thousands of poor and needy patients with eye ailments over the years, and is now a super-speciality eye hospital. Today, the hospital is headed by their son, Amarnath Modi. [6]
"In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time. Ambidextrous, they perform delicate eye surgeries with their left hand. They do cataract operations, squint corrections and cornea transplants. Earlier, Modi used to perform 600 to 700 operations a day in their camps. But now in Karnataka, they operate on 200 to 300 patients every day."[7]
Dr. Modi was a nominated member of the Karnataka Legislative Council for a term in the 1990s.[8]
Dr. Modi set out to hold eye camps in the then Bombay State, which included parts of Karnataka. They travelled to remote villages and towns to hold camps, often with very little financial or medical support. They mobilised support from local voluntary organisations and people. They also received assistance from India and abroad for their mission. Those operated upon were being given spectacles free of cost.[9]
Awards [ edit ]
Dr. Modi's phenomenal contributions in the field of medical social-service has not gone unappreciated. The government of India has awarded them with its highest awards of the Padma Shree and Padma Bhushan. Helen Keller, the blind and deaf-mute American author, it is said, attended one of their camps in 1954, and asked him: "Have you insured your hands?" It is believed that through their mass eye camps, they have conducted 579,000 operations, and has examined over 5,000,000 (5 million) patients and given free food to over 10,000,000 (10 million) persons. [11]
Dr. Modi appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records in the year 1986, for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. These operations were conducted in Tirupati in 1968 over 14 continuous hours. They were fondly called "Modi, Kannukota anna", the brother who gave vision, by people in their native state Karnataka. This anna has performed all the eye operations free of cost.[12]
Quotes [ edit ]
Helen Keller, who spoke of them as "a light piercing the darkness with their selfless service".[13]
In their words – "Like a circus company I have toured all over India since 1943 to provide free eye relief service. In the process I have examined over 10 million patients and conducted over 700,000 eye operations, which I am told is a world record. Somebody compared me to Henry Ford, saying I had brought conveyor belt technology to the field of eye-care. My way of looking at things has not been affected by the ageing process at all. I am just an ordinary man. I will serve as long as God wants me to. For me, my patient is my god, the operating room is my temple and my instruments are my puja. My work has therefore been my pilgrimage."

Brazil boss Tite has delivered good news - and bad news - to Liverpool fans.
The good news is that they believe "now is Philippe Coutinho's moment" for the Brazilian national team.
The bad news is that the player Reds fans have christened 'The Magician' is now in line to play back to back World Cup qualifiers in South America against Bolivia and Venezuela, just four days before the huge visit of Manchester United to Anfield.

Coutinho has been competing with Chelsea's Willian for a place in the Brazil side but coach Tite said: "There's a reason they are called the Magician.
"With their passes, Coutinho opens the lines, creates space. I like their mobility, they were influential in both games when they came on (against Colombia and Ecuador last month when their introduction changed both matches).
"It was a difficult decision for me, but right now this is Coutinho's moment. And in football, you have to follow the moment.
“The two appearances by Coutinho... their moment, the composition. It is with mastery, not only because the opponent was tired."
Brazil face Bolivia at 1.45am tomorrow morning then travel to Venezuela for a 1.30am kick-off next Wednesday.
Brazil fans will be hoping the Magician replicates their Colombia and Ecuador form. Red fans will be hoping they come through safely without injury.
20 House members received more money for mileage than Aaron Schock last year Share This:
Do other House members have an Aaron Schock problem?
The recently-resigned Illinois Republican's accounting problems are now well-documented, but the surprisingly large reimbursements they pocketed for driving their car (which turned out to be owned by their campaign, and possibly driven by others) made us wonder: Are the charges they racked up really that unusual for members of congress?
Data Files: House members mileage reimbursement for personal vehicles Yearly Summary includes yearly mileage estimates
Line Itemizations each spending line item used in this story The annual summary file includes mileage estimates, both annually and per day, based on the historic federal mileage rate for cars for each year. For 2012, when the mileage reimbursement rate changed on April 17 (instead of Jan. 1), we used a weighted average. Travel that's listed as occurring in two years was counted towards the year it started in. The reimbursements are complete through the fourth quarter of 2014, though there may sometimes be a delay before these are filed. Source: Sunlight's House expenditure page, which processes the raw statement of disbursements. See more details in the documentation file.
Mileage reimbursements for members' official business are paid out of taxpayer dollars, and are different than most spending because they go directly to a representative's bank account. The government paid 57.5 cents a mile for official travel by car in 2015 (up from 50 cents a mile in 2010). Members can't charge the costs of their daily commute to the office — whether on Capitol Hill or in their district — to the government. They can, however, get the mileage allowance if they drive from D.C. to their district — though most members prefer to fly commercially.
Some members also get reimbursed for operating their own private planes — the rate for that is $1.29 per mile — or motorcycles. There is no way to tell from House disbursement records what kind of vehicle a member is using.
The most important restriction on mileage reimbursements is that trips cannot be for solely campaign purposes. Driving or flying to a fundraiser or a campaign event can't be reimbursed, although a lot of official business can look like campaigning. House disclosure documents, however, don't report the destinations, so it's impossible to tell where a member went. There's also not clear guidance on how often reimbursements should be filed; some members' entire annual mileage reimbursements are given in a single line item at the end of the year.
Our source for this data is the House's official statement of disbursements, which is published quarterly, and is current through the last quarter of 2014. Expense reports sometimes come in late, so miles traveled during 2014 but not filed yet are not included. And we've only included payments made directly to the members themselves and categorized as being for “private auto mileage” or “privately owned vehicle mileage.” Because expenses are sometimes mislabeled it's possible some of these totals are slightly higher than what we've found below.
So how does Aaron Schock stack up?
For 2014, there were twenty members who were reimbursed more than Schock, who filed for about $8,600 in mileage, though several months of reimbursements were missing. The top recipients for 2014 are listed below.
Reimbursements to members for private vehicle mileage in 2014
While a small number of House members billed remarkable amounts for mileage reimbursements, most didn't. Only 186 members billed for use of their own vehicle at all in 2014, and only twelve members were reimbursed for more than $10,000.
Some Representatives have been quite consistent in billing, which shows up more clearly in the longer-term totals below.
Reimbursements to members for private vehicle mileage from 2010 through 2014
Source: House statement of disbursements; summary file available here. Rep. David McKinley, who has been reimbursed more than any other member since 2010, represents West Virginia's 1st District, a safe Republican district that's between 200 and 300 miles from Washington, D.C. McKinley made it to the top of the list despite the fact that they only took office in 2011.
McKinley, who didn't return a call for comment, has had even higher personal car mileage reimbursements in the past. In 2011 they received more than $24,000 — more than 47,000 miles driven at 51 cents a mile that year. That breaks down to a daily average of 129 miles traveled each and every day — assuming they are driving.
In at least one case, however, the high reimbursements reflect the higher rate, $1.29, paid for operating a private plane. Rep. Collin Peterson, a Democrat who represents Minnesota's 7th District, has been reimbursed for about $88,000 since 2010. Their chief of staff, Allison Myhre, explained, “Congressman Peterson often flies their single engine, 1970s model Bonanza airplane to meet constituents in the 7th District, which is one of the larger districts in the country, encompassing 38 counties and more than 35,000 square miles. They also fly it to the Twin Cities to catch their commercial flights to DC and back.” They added that the member of congress had been reimbursed a total of $280,000 for travel over their 23 years in office.
While McKinley and Peterson file regular reports on their mileage, others handle this differently. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, filed all of their mileage reimbursements for 2013 during the first quarter of 2014 — a $12,008 line item covering travel from Jan 1., 2013, through Dec. 4 of 2013.
Vince McAllister, a Louisiana Republican who became known as the “Kissing Congressman” after video of them with a married staff member leaked, was first elected in a special election in 2013, and took office in November of that year. By the time they lost their bid for reelection in November of 2014, they still hadn't filed a single expense reimbursement for using their own vehicle. But reimbursement requests totaling just under $20,000 and dated the 18th, 24th and 31st of December, just days before they left office, brought them to number two on the list for 2014.

Sacramento—Watching state legislators construct fixes to the state's problems reminds me of those bizarre contraptions that the late cartoonist Rube Goldberg would devise, as they “invented” complicated, funny methods to achieve simple tasks.
In their haircut machine, a hyena laughs, thus insulting a blind mouse, who thinks the hyena is laughing at him. The mouse angrily runs off onto a disc, which triggers a series of levers that eventually push a starving Lilliputian goat to a man's head. The goat nibbles on the man's hair, then falls over into a cradle after it is full.
Goldberg's contraptions were delightfully ridiculous, yet strangely reminiscent of a state Legislature that can't come up with a straightforward approach to the simplest problems. One recent example: It took two years for it to pass a bill designed to make it easier for administrators to remove sex predators from the classroom. The final measure was filled with maddening complexities that would have made it harder to fire bad teachers. The governor rightly vetoed it. And that's what happens when legislators actually try to fix something.
Most problems—such as the state's unfunded pension liabilities, the nation's highest poverty rate, education failures and others detailed in the U-T's Fixing California series — are off the table given the power of status-quo-defending interest groups to derail actual solutions. So the reform blueprints get more complicated and far-fetched.
California officials have gotten the general-fund budget in order after voters approved large tax increases last year. But the fundamental crises still are festering, as was detailed in the Fixing California introduction:
“California now has the highest rate of poverty in the nation. ... The state government is awash in debt, hundreds of billions of dollars, much of it stemming from the Cadillac salaries, pensions and retiree health-care benefits paid to state employees. ... The state that historically was among the last to fall into recession and among the first to pull out it, has flipped ...
“The educational performance of California students now ranks near the very bottom ... . The state lost 33 percent of its industrial base from 2001-2012, declining 11 percent more than in the United States as a whole ... . State and local government regulatory agencies are strangling the efforts of small and large businesses to expand. ... Many local governments are also in financial peril.”
Solutions, though, won't be found in complex new rule-making or more spending.
What to do about the poverty rate? Unleash job creation by lowering tax rates and reducing the control of regulators. What to do about debt issues? Reduce the decade-long policy of pension and benefit enrichment, by holding the line in contract negotiations and by outsourcing services. One great idea: a proposed state pension-reform initiative that would let cities roll back pension benefits for current employees going forward.
What about the state's public schools? Instead of tinkering with an immovable bureaucracy beset by outdated work rules that quash innovation, the state should unleash competitive pressures through vouchers, expanded charter schools and a more aggressive “parent trigger” system.
Sometimes the leadership gets it, epitomized by Gov. Jerry Brown's support of hydraulic fracturing regulations that, although more cumbersome than necessary, allow this job-creating industry to grow. But such good news remains hard to come by.
As Professor Joel Kotkin, a Democrat, explained in a Fixing California installment published Oct. 27, California remains committed to a green politics that makes it tough for poorer people to get ahead. “Particularly damaging are steps to impose mandates for renewable energy that have made electricity prices in California among the highest in the nation and others that make building the single-family housing preferred by most Californians either impossible or, anywhere remotely close to the coast, absurdly expensive,” they wrote.
And California's tax code seems designed to minimize growth, argued economist Art Laffer in a commentary on Nov. 10. “California does have the sunshine, that's true, but to believe all your taxes are giving you a better quality of life and better public services is not true,” they wrote in the series about their 2006 move from California to Tennessee. They found that Californians enjoy poorer services because we overpay for them.
What California needs is amazingly simple — lower taxes to spur creative activity, a more reasonable regulatory climate, educational choice, less government intervention and more competition. These policies are not complex, but they are effective.
Instead, each Capitol session is reminiscent of a less-funny version of Goldberg. Officials assemble legislative contraptions that complicate state bureaucracies and add new hurdles for businesses. Then everyone wonders why the goat didn't do a good job cutting the man's hair. One day, though, our leaders might realize that the best solution involves a pair of scissors.

NSA deputy director admits to broader spying
By Eric London and Joseph Kishore
18 July 2013
At a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee yesterday, Deputy Director of the National Security Agency John Inglis admitted that the depth of the NSA surveillance program goes far beyond what the government had previously admitted.
The testimony concerns the agency's ability to access phone and Internet records seized from the major telecommunications companies. The first revelation from Edward Snowden concerned this program, exposing the fact that Verizon and other telecommunications companies are handing over to the government detailed “metadata” of phone communications of all their customers. This allows the government to construct social and political networks for nearly every individual.
Another program, revealed later in June, has allowed the government to collect similar records on Internet usage, including, according to a Guardian report, “the accounts to which Americans sent emails and from which they received emails” as well as “the Internet protocol addressees (IP) used by people inside the United States when sending emails—information which can reflect their physical location.” The Obama administration claims to have ended this program in 2011.
While these phone and Internet records were effectively collected on all Americans, the NSA claimed it looked at the records only of individuals who were “two degrees of separation” from a target of investigation. That is, they looked at the records of all individuals who communicated with a target, or who communicated with someone who communicated with a target.
In testimony on Wednesday, however, Inglis said that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court “has also given permission to do not just first hop analysis, meaning what numbers are in contact with that selector, but to then from those numbers go out two or three hops,” Inglis said.
The additional “hop” adds an order of magnitude to those whose records have been examined—it covers the target, anyone who has communicated with that person (potentially hundreds of people), anyone who has communicated with any of those people (hundreds more), and anyone who has communicated with them. By a conservative estimate, any single target could generate one million people whose data could be accessed.
As an example, say the NSA selects as a “target” an individual at Guantanamo Bay. This person may have contacted their lawyer at a civil liberties organization (one hop), the lawyer may have received an email from, for example, an ACLU mail list address (two hops), and this mail list may go out to hundreds of thousands of people (three hops). All of these people would then be subject to having their phone and Internet activity monitored by the NSA.
The selection of targets is itself entirely arbitrary and subject to the whims of NSA officials. It can involve anyone who the NSA—without any oversight—declares to itself that it has a “reasonable, articulable suspicion” of a connection to terrorism.
The FISA court granted 1,789 surveillance warrants in 2012 alone. At least these many individuals will fall under the “articulable” standard for the NSA to access metadata records.
In effect, this means that the NSA has declared the ability to review the phone and Internet records of nearly everyone.
Inglis' comments have vindicated whistleblower Edward Snowden's original statement, made to the Guardian in mid-June:
“[T]he NSA specifically, targets the communications of everyone. It ingests them by default. It collects them in its system and it filters them and it analyses them and it measures them and it stores them for periods of time… So while they may be intending to target someone associated with a foreign government or someone they suspect of terrorism, they're collecting your communications to do so. Any analyst at any time can target anyone, any selector, anywhere.”
Inglis' acknowledgement adds to the growing pile of evidence that could be used to indict leading Obama administration and congressional officials for perjury.
NSA Director Keith Alexander told the Senate on June 12 that Snowden's allegations were “false … I know of no way to do that.”
Republican Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Michael Rogers said that “[Snowden] was lying,” and that “[h]e clearly has over-inflated their position… It's impossible for them to do what they were saying they could do.”
When asked during the hearing whether or not the NSA had effectively been given a general warrant to spy on the American people, Deputy Attorney General James Cole said that the Fourth Amendment does not apply “because the phone data, according to the Supreme Court, is not something within which citizens have a reasonable expectation of privacy, it belongs to the phone company.”
“These are the kinds of records that under longstanding Supreme Court precedent are not protected by the Fourth Amendment,” Cole said.
According to the Obama administration, the surveillance program does not violate the First Amendment right of freedom of association, either. “These are issues that are looked at by the court in determining whether any constitutional rights are involved,” Cole said.
For the representatives of the national security apparatus, the past six weeks have been marked by a series of revelations detailing their deceitfulness. When asked if they thought it was possible to keep the domestic surveillance program from the public, Director of National Intelligence counsel Robert Litt said, “Well—um—we tried.”

You want how much?!?
When I finally sat down to put words to paper on Angry Birds Wii U, I was left wondering what else I could say that hasn't already been said. Angry Birds is the biggest thing in gaming right now. Love it or hate it, everyone knows it, and nearly everyone has played it. That made me wonder why it was so late hitting the Wii U, the console it seems most likely to fit on. The use of the touchpad along with the audience seems ripe for the picking, but then again it is also $50 for a set of games anyone can obtain for one tenth of that on other platforms.
For those in the cheap seats, Angry Birds is a game where players launch various fowl at stacks of pigs and knock them down. Sell that in a boardroom and convince someone it is going to make billions. Somehow it did though, and it has slowly made its way to every console and device imaginable. Wii U and Wii are the last stops, and frankly I wondered why they didn't make it into the console releases last year. Why it took nearly 12 months to port these games is an enigma in itself.
Still here we are, the Wii U is struggling and the Wii is dying, and Angry Birds is here, and to be fair while I had fun playing through it is for the 600th time, the charm is starting to fade. As one would imagine, the Wii U version allows players to play on the Gamepad, which makes it ideal for recreational (in-house) travel.
Angry Birds Trilogy contains a ton of content. It feels somewhat dirty complaining about the sheer amount of hours I could derive from this disc for the $50 price tag, but it is all about considering where else it is available, and how much it costs. Again anyone who owns a mobile device has likely played these games, and owned them all for under $10 new…years ago. That is where the problem arises, who is this collection for, the small installation base of Wii U owners that somehow haven't owned a tablet or phone in the past half-decade? It may sound snobbish, but let's be fair. Angry Birds didn't get popular by being a niche title.
A bird, a pig and a slingshot walk into a bar…
Still for those that somehow have missed out on the craze there is a ton of content here for the price. Wii U owners end up better off with the Gamepad options, but if you do own a smart phone I think there are easier, and cheaper ways to experience this phenomenon.

Nothing like getting a loli figurine in the mail… unless it's a GIANT loli figurine… a giant loli figurine that finishes a 3 piece loli set! BOO YEAH! As you can tell I was pretty excited to get this figurine. I can honestly say that there's not a heck of a lot TO this set of figurines but you'd have to be dead or cold and heartless to not think that all three of these figurines are freaking adorable.
I giggled like a moron going downstairs to grab this figurine off its shelf today to do this review, I'm not sure why but I just really love these figurines. For a 1/4th set of figurines they're just proportioned so well… you always seem to get the giant head syndrome in a 1/4th, or at least used to… This figurine is pretty much more of the same stuff so I really will not talk too much about this. Figurine is from the same series as the other two sculpted by the same person that did the other two as well and from my understanding at least, this is the last of the “set” if you can call it that.
 They are in a cuter pose than the other two, I really do think I like this one the best of the three actually, she's just so damn cute… it should honestly be illegal. You can almost see them running towards the water to play little splash games you see in the anime all the time >_<
Now its hardly a figurine review if I'm not talking about the good and the bad instead of prattling on endlessly about adorable lolis and such forth. So there is one thing I noticed that does bother me a bit and that's on their mid drift where the tummy meets with the bikini there's almost a separation. It's not game breaking but on a figurine that's 90% skin it is something that you will notice if you take a close look at it.
This figurine came back with the inner tube which I was pretty happy to see… however having only Hayate and Nanoha of the three figurines with inner tubes just makes Fate look a little lonely. I realize that they have other accessories but realistically I much rather would of seen all three of the figurines with inner tubes just for symmetry. All three of the figurines are great however… I love them all equally… yes…yes.. my harem of giant loli figurines yeessss… mwhahahahaah…
Talking about another thing that this figurine did a little bland as well, would be the top part of the bikini. Now this is just opinion… so take it with a grain of salt… But I feel that the bikini top is a little flat and boring something about it just doesn't pop out at me.. no this is NOT innuendo for flat chested haha.. just the colors seem duller and less articulated.
Also their bracelets are part of them as in welded to her… I'm a huge fan of figurines that everything on the figurine is separate except panties… If you wanted to break the figurine, you should be able to strip it down naked by taking all of its cloths off… it would just ruin it… but you should be able to. To see that even the bracelets on this do not move? Bothers me slightly.
All in all this figurine was a must-buy for my wife and I because we had the other two. We have mentioned previously that we are not collectors of 1/4th figurines and I personally do still feel that way. The reason why these worked out so well is mostly because they were lolis, so their scale as offset by that. Their price point really helped that matter as well, they were ~$100 each which for a 1/4th is a good price. They are basic but sometimes basic is good. If you're fans of the series I cannot speak to getting these or not because we have not watched any of it… But any fan of the characters would of course love them. Having a set of these three sitting on our shelf brightens up that particular shelf significantly with 3 cute little bikini girls! That's all for this week guys/gals as always thanks for reading and visiting, hit us up in another 2 weeks and we'll be reviewing some more awesome stuff! I leave you with another random AMV!

Ally Bank wants its customers to invent their own personal secret questions and answers; the idea is that an operator will read the question over the phone and listen for an answer. Ignoring for the moment the problem of the operator now knowing the question/answer pair, what are some good pairs? Some suggestions:
Q: Do you know why I think you're so sexy?
A: Probably because you're totally in love with me.
Q: Need any weed? Grass? Kind bud? Shrooms?
A: No thanks hippie, I'd just like to do some banking.
Q: The Penis shoots Seeds, and makes new Life to poison the Earth with a plague of men.
A: Go forth, and kill. Zardoz has spoken.
Q: What the hell is your fucking problem, sir?
A: This is completely inappropriate and I'd like to speak to your supervisor.
Q: I've been embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from my employer, and I don't care who knows it.
A: It's a good thing they're recording this call, because I'm going to have to report you.
Q: Are you really who you say you are?
A: No, I am a Russian identity thief.
So maybe you're a Niner fan, or a Steeler fan, or a Cowboy fan, or fan of some other storied franchise that has championships and likes to rub your good fortune into the #havenots fans faces. Good for you.
Alright, so maybe your hometown doesn't have a team and you are left to your own devices to choose from the menagerie of mascots, players, colors, or yes, teams that win the most. Maybe your uncle buys you a Packers hat every Christmas. Or your school mascot was the Edgar Allen Poe Middle School Writing Stallions so you had an affinity for the Broncos. Or maybe, you had just seen Madagascar and decided that the New York Giants was the team for you.Whatever the reason, you're an NFL fan. Good for you.
Or perhaps you were born into one of the sports meccas where sports success just came easy to you. I'm looking at you Boston. How many titles does your whole city have over the last decade plus, spread out over all of your major teams? More than ten right? How fortunate for you. And don't even tell me how lean the ‘90s were. If that's all you have to complain about, then good for you.
I was born in Utah in 1979. Didn't like it there, so I moved to Renton, Wa. when I was 3 and then to Snohomish when I was 4. I was immersed into Dave Krieg country and fully indoctrinated into the Rick Mirer awesomeness that was my impressionable early teens. I'm sure you can't relate to that. Good for you.
All I knew was that I am a hometown fan, dyed in the wool through and through.
So by your logic, an NFL fan is either a bandwagon lovin' emotional sychophant who is into sports for the sheer thrill of the moment. Or one blessed by the Grid Iron gods on Mt. Canton to be beholden to the spectacles of the team-you-root-for's greatness. That's some high level thinkin' there, good for you.
So to further this existential sports argument, I was not born into the circumstances that have afforded me the right to celebrate as much as you. The amount of emotion invested has not until recently equated to the elation received for my efforts. So with all your chirping, what you're basically telling me is that the place where you're from has more championships than the place where I'm from. Or even worse, the team that you're rooting for, from places unknown, has more championships than my team. Or is it even worse than that? Do fans not actually exist to teams that don't have a long history of championships? You egotistical son of a . . .
So is that the lesson I should learn? Should I only root for teams that have championships? Should I have grilled more Quinoa burgers or something? What more can I do to be like the fans who have more championships? Wait, isn't that bandwaggoning?
The joy you've received from sports should be enjoyed, savored even, but leave your troll laden vitriol about how every Seahawks fan has only been around circa 2012 in your pants. My pants however are nowhere to be found. I'm not all of a sudden an obnoxious wannabe because my team is suddenly winning. I'm enjoying the moment for what it is—sheer unadulterated championship basking after decades of shadow lurking. Fairweathered? Not even close. You just haven't been hearing my screaming in the national media until recently.
Are there bandwagon Seahawk fans? – Yes
Am I one of them? – No
Are millions of other 12s – NO
Get used to it. We aren't going anywhere, and it's only going to get louder.
If Hermione Granger Had Been Sorted Into Ravenclaw (YEAR ONE)
YEAR ONE:
Ron cleared their throat and said “Sunshine, daisy, butter, mellow–turn this stupid fat rat yellow.” They tapped Scabbers with their wand. Nothing happened. The two boys sat quietly for a moment while Harry tried to think of something nice to say.
“Well, glad no one was here to see that,” Ron said. They both reached for more sweets and chewed in silence for several minutes.
“I wish there was a way to fix my glasses,” Harry said.
………….
OR
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.
“Dumbledore again,” they said, “He was the first one I ever–”
They gasped. They stared at the back of the card. Then they looked up at Ron.
“I've found him!” they whispered. “I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here–listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for their defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and their work on alchemy with their partner, Nicolas Flamel!”
Ron's mouth hung open and their eyes were wide.
“Brilliant, Harry!” they said. “Now what do we do?”
Harry flipped the card over in their hands, then flipped it again. They looked up at Ron.
“I have no idea,” they said.
………….
OR
“You can't go out,” said Neville, “you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble. I won't let you do it. I'll–I'll fight you!”
“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don't be an idiot–”
They took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.
“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising their fists. “I'm ready!”
Harry and Ron looked at each other. They were sure that there must be some relatively peaceful–and quick–way to end the situation so they could get to the Sorcerer's Stone. Neither of them could think of one. After a shrug, Ron reared back and punched Neville in the face as hard as they could. Harry leapt on Neville too, and the sounds of the scuffle brought a crowd of sleepy Gryffindors down the stairs, who quickly broke up the fight. Ron and Harry were given instant detention for the rest of the night, and McGonagall gave very serious thought to expelling the both of them.
Three days later, Voldemort, fully returned to power, made their first public appearance.
………….
OR
Ron followed right away. They landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What's this stuff?” were their first words.
“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall,” Harry said.
It was only when Harry tried to stand that they noticed that the plant had already twisted snakelike tendrils around their legs and ankles. Ron was already bound tightly in long creepers too.
“What is this!” Ron yelled, trying to pry the vines from their legs as more reached for their wrists and neck.
Harry couldn't respond. Not only was the giant plant wrapping itself around their mouth like a gag, but it was squeezing every breath of air out of their chest. They struggled as hard as they could, but to no avail. Slowly, their vision went black.
Three days later, Voldemort, fully returned to power, made their first public appearance.
………….
OR
Harry thought they would be in the clear after the magnificent game of chess that Ron had just won, but they were wrong. They re-read the riddle once more, and then looked at the seven bottles on the table.
“Any ideas?” Harry said.
Ron shook their head.
“Then we'll just have to guess,” Harry said. Ron's eyes went wide.
“But Harry,” they said, “there's a decent chance we'll just end up poisoning ourselves!”
“What happens to us if Voldemort comes back will be even worse,” said Harry. Ron shuddered as they said the name, but Harry didn't give them a chance to interject.
“Besides,” they continued, “our only other option is to just stay in here until Snape passes through here on their way out with the Stone.”
“Right,” Ron said. “I'd rather take the poison.”
They both reached for a bottle. Harry's was a little rounded bottle, and Ron's was like a tiny glass pyramid with a stopper in the top. They clinked the glass together and drank.
“Lucky me,” said Ron. “Just wine.”
“Mine too,” Harry said. “Guess we'll have to try another set if we…” Harry trailed off. The room suddenly got very blurry. Their arms went completely numb.
“Oh,” they said as they fell to the floor. Slowly, the numbness was replaced by a warm fuzz, and Harry felt like they were drifting off into a peaceful sleep.
Three days later, Voldemort, fully returned to power, made their first public appearance.
………….
OR
“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes…
“First–to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
At last there was silence again.
“Second–to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Dumbledore raised their hand. The room gradually fell silent.
“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”
The congratulations to Neville were quiet. Everyone in the Great Hall was on the edge of their seats, locked on Dumbledore's every word.
“So,” Dumbledore said, “that's that. The new point total for Gryffindor is 432. Congratulations, Slytherin, for being this year's House Cup winners with 472 points.”
The Great Hall erupted with Slytherin's cheers. Malfoy looked so pleased and smug that Harry was even more crushed than they were a moment ago. Sure, they had defeated Voldemort once more, but for some reason this felt like a huge loss. The other Gryffindors were equally upset.
Three days later and for no apparent reason whatsoever, Voldemort fully returned to power and made their first public appearance.

Even ponies don't dream solely about happy things. Princess Luna sure could tell countless stories about the bigger and smaller nightmares that are haunting ponies' minds. Especially the most powerful nightmares often have their roots in buried memories, or memories that one wants to forget forever.I imagine Starlight Glimmer being such a haunted pony. No matter if the folks in their old village have forgiven her, no matter how their new friends think of them now, those old unwanted memories sure would surface now and then... especially with everypony constantly reminding them of their past.Another one of my dreaming ponies. It hurts me physically to have drawn them in such a miserable state, but I wanted to draw a pony having some kind of nightmare, and poor Starlight just got the short straw I guess.

Ukrainian military and separatist representatives exchanged dozens of prisoners under cover of darkness at a remote frontline location Saturday evening, kicking off a process intended to usher in peace to the conflict-ridden east.
One hundred and thirty nine Ukrainian troops and 52 rebels were exchanged, according to a separatist official overseeing the prisoner swap at a no man's land location near the village of Zholobok, some 20 kilometres west of the rebel-held city Luhansk.
A busload of Ukrainian soldiers in military fatigues was transported earlier in the day from the main rebel stronghold of Donetsk to a rural spot some 140 kilometres to the northeast, before joining up with other groups of fellow captives.
After arriving at the location near Zholobok, the troops were made to line up and listen to a speech by a rebel representative, who ordered the men to leave the territory claimed by the separatist movements in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
The soldiers — some of them using crutches, while one was carried on a stretcher — then walked for around 3 kilometres to a rendezvous point.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko wrote on their Twitter account that they were informed the process had begun by the national security service. Their spokesperson, Svyatoslav Tsegolko, later said one more Ukrainian soldier prisoner was to be freed in the coming days.
Rebels claim government maltreated prisoners
The peace agreement signed last week in Minsk foresees an exchange of all prisoners in the conflict. It is unclear how many are held in total on both sides, although the Donetsk separatists have said Ukraine is holding about 580 rebels as prisoners.
Rebels said the bulk of the Ukrainian soldiers being released Saturday were captured during recent fighting for the strategic town of Debaltseve, which was taken over by separatists in the past week.
There is not a single day in the Ukrainian conflict when we can feel sure what the next day will bring. - Heidi Tagliavini, envoy for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The self-styled Donetsk People's Republic added in a statement that most of the people handed over by Ukrainian authorities were civilians.
But "fewer than 50 percent of those exchanged (by the Donetsk People's Republic) were military prisoners," the statement said.
The rebel statement cited what it said were observers at the swap saying many of the prisoners released by the Ukrainian government showed signs of maltreatment.
"Some prisoners could not make their own way independently. Meanwhile, all of the military prisoners transferred to the Ukrainian representatives were in good shape," it said.
An Associated Press journalist saw at least one person released by government forces being pushed in a wheelchair.
Ukrainian soldiers subjected to physical and verbal abuse
Ukrainian authorities didn't immediately respond to the rebels' claims. They have earlier complained bitterly that their troops have been severely mistreated by their rebel captors. Ukrainian soldiers taken prisoner after the separatists seized the airport in Donetsk from government forces in January were forced to parade through the city and subjected to physical and verbal abuse by fighters and residents.
Video footage filmed and uploaded to the Internet by rebels earlier this month showed badly wounded Ukrainian troops attacked at a position near Debaltseve being beaten by separatist combatants.
Also Saturday, Ukraine's military and the Russia-backed separatist rebels accused each other of continuing to mount attacks a week after a cease-fire was called.
Ukrainian security spokesperson Col. Andriy Lysenko said that one serviceman was killed and 40 wounded in attacks over the past day. They did not state a total number of attacks, but said there were 10 mortar attacks on Ukrainian forces in the village of Shyrokyne on the fringes of the strategic port city of Mariupol.
Lysenko said rebels continued to move equipment toward Mariupol. Concerns persist that rebels aim to seize the city which would aid establishing a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Russia-annexed Crimea peninsula.
Shelling amid calls for peace
The rebels claimed Ukrainian forces launched 15 shelling attacks overnight, including on parts of Donetsk, the largest rebel-controlled city.
The agreement reached in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France called for the guns to go quiet on Sunday.
The warring sides were supposed to begin drawing back heavy weapons from the front lines on Tuesday, but international monitors say they've seen no sign of that yet.
Russian and Ukrainian military officials overseeing the hoped-for peace process announced Friday that the Ukrainian government and the rebels had worked out a plan to begin the weapons pull-out.
Heidi Tagliavini, an envoy for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who led the talks with Russia and Ukraine that also included rebel figures, remained cautiously hopeful.
"There is not a single day in the Ukrainian conflict when we can feel sure what the next day will bring," they said.
An exclusive interview with Chuck Daellenbach, co-founder of Canadian Brass
I'm so thrilled to be sharing this interview with you.
Chuck Daellenbach is someone that I've wanted to interview for years and I'm super pumped to announce that I recently had the opportunity to sit with Chuck and ask questions that I've always been curious about.
In this interview Chuck and I discussed:
The first gigs the Canadian Brass ever did
How the Canadian Brass played hundreds of concerts in their first few years
What characteristics they look for when recruiting new members
What Chuck would do if they were starting their career today
and tons more!
There are a lot of lessons to take away from this interview that include: what it takes to start your own group, the non-musical factors involved in careers, and so much more.
Enjoy!

Toni Martinez is doing their damned best to tell Slaven Bilic to give them a chance in the West Ham first team - again.
The 20-year-old Spaniard notched a fine treble for the Hammers U23s in their comfortable 4-2 win over Manchester United at the London Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
That took them on to eight goals for the season, added to 14 in the last campaign since they joined the club from Valencia last summer.
What more can they do to get a look in? Judging on their performance at the London Stadium, not very much. Their first goal was an instinctive finish and the other two were laid on a plate for him, but you still have to put them away. It's what he's paid to d and Martinez held up their end of the bargain.
The argument will be that playing against a Premier League defence is a bit different than a PL2 one. Well, fair enough but how are we supposed to find out if they can hold their own if they don't get the chance?
Martinez was given a first team squad number this season and filmed their funny little walk up things for Sky Sports, which led us to think maybe Bilic will give them a shot.

Martinez impressed in pre-season too, where they were a regular for the Hammers on their jaunts to Austria, Germany and Iceland. They particularly found form while in Germany with a couple of goals to theirs name.
And yet, they have been consigned to the Hammers U23s side so far this season and has seen the likes of other uber-talented youngster Declan Rice and Nathan Holland get Premier League minutes (in the formers case) and in the Carabao Cup.
Martinez is showing patience, just go on their social media channels and they preach the ethic of hard work and patience paying off, and now could be their time.
Why?
Andy Carroll is suspended for the visit of Burnley in the Premier League to E20 this coming Friday night. While I am not advocating that Martinez should start the game against Chris Hughton's men, they should be in the squad.
If he's not brought on then fair enough, they have Diafra Sakho and Andre Ayew ahead of them to partner Javier Hernandez but Martinez offers that something different.
Martinez loves to play on the shoulder of the last man constantly, trying to angle runs then spin in behind (hopefully beating the offside trap) and bear down on goal. He's good with both feet, they are excellent in the air and if you give them a chance, he'll bury it.
After seeing some of their other U23 star mates get the call up into the first team, Martinez has had to bide their time but surely, surely, it is going to come. Bilic can only keep ignoring the Spaniards goals for so long.
Should Martinez be given a chance in the first team? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.
When they wash the grotto's marbled altar and guard its silver lamps, they are watching over the cradle of the Christian world: the exact spot where Jesus Christ is believed to have been born.
Yet despite this sacred trust, a ten-year row between the different sects that manage the church has forced the Palestinian government's Muslim leaders to intervene to prevent the basilica's ancient lead roof from collapsing on its mosaic floors.
Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian national authority, has taken the unprecedented step of issuing a decree that the church must be repaired.
The move comes as the venerable but rather run-down building next to Manger Square in the centre of Bethlehem braces itself for its busiest time of year, when tens of thousands of pilgrims, including many from overseas, will converge there for a series of services.
"It is excellent news for Christians, not just here in the Holy Land, but all over the world," said Issa Kassissieh, a Christian member of the Palestinian government. "The Church of the Nativity represents much to the Palestinians as well as to the Christian world."
So tattered has the roof become that pilgrims inside the church were forced, during heavy rainstorms, to shelter under umbrellas and watch water cascade down the Crusade-era murals adorning the basilica walls.
But while the rafters rotted above them, the Armenian Orthodox, Franciscan and Greek Orthodox monks who share guardianship of the site fell to blows over the territory controlled by each sect.
In one incident, in 2007, the long-bearded monks scuffled, using fists, brooms and iron rods, simply because one group had tried to wash parts of a wall claimed by another.
That fight, however, was nothing compared to the dispute over the maintenance of the church. According to the World Monuments Fund, a United Nations body that listed the church as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world, the basilica's custodians have failed to collaborate on its repair for almost 1,000 years.
Furthermore, a botched repair, organised unilaterally by the Greeks a few years ago, only made things worse by accelerating the rate at which roof timbers rotted.
The Palestine Exploration Fund, a British charity founded in the 19th century to preserve the monuments of the Holy Land, described the roof's condition as "nothing short of a scandal".
Discreetly announced in a Jerusalem paper, Mr Abbas' decree was careful to say the three groups would be fully consulted by a special committee set up by the Palestinian authorities.
But there was no hiding the sense of frustration at the bickering between the sects that had threatened a shrine which is one of the greatest tourist attractions in the Holy Land.
Their intervention, however, appears to have worked where religious harmony did not: the heads of the three churches have agreed to put aside their squabbles and accept the planned renovation.
Architectural and archaeological experts expressed their delight at the news of the presidential decree.
"That is really wonderful, a very positive step after so many decades of nothing," said Rupert Chapman, of the Middle East department at the British Museum.
But while the decree represents progress, the Palestinian government is aware of the acute sensitivities involved and wants to make sure that no one country, organisation or faith takes control of the work.
To that end, a special "blind" fund will be set up, and donors will be able to contribute funds anonymously to pay for a full survey of the church and the eventual restoration.
Theophilos III, patriarch of the local Greek orthodox church which traces its roots back to the earliest Byzantine Christians in the Holy Land, said preserving the church was of critical importance. "This Holy Place is associated not just with the birth of Jesus Christ but with the later birth and growth of Christianity," they said from their office in the patriarchate inside the Old City of Jerusalem.
"It played a central role in the history of Christianity and that role has gone on for two thousand years until even today."
Unilateral action by the local authority is not unprecedented in Bethlehem to get around problems between the three Christian communities.
In the early 1920s, the local British military commander responsible for the Holy Land, Sir Ronald Storrs, decided to take action after the three groups could not agree on an unsightly wall built by the Greeks in front of the altar at the Church of the Nativity.
They simply invoked their authority as the local governor and had the wall taken down.
Visitors today have Sir Ronald's chutzpah to thank for the unblocked view of the altar. And future visitors who will no longer need umbrellas inside the church might come to owe a similar debt to Mr Abbas.

What's Brewing in the Garden
I don't need to read tea leaves or get out my crystal ball to figure out what is trending in the horticulture world, just a glossy stack of 2014 seed catalogs cascading off my bookshelf. While the wind is howling and there is talk of polar vortex, I brew up a cup of hot tea, gather my reading material, and snuggle in. Here is a lowdown on what is new, what is hot, and what people are really thinking about when they plan ahead, and order their seeds for the upcoming growing season.
1. Grafted Vegetable Plants
Grafted plants are relatively new, but I have only seen grafted tomato plants. A grafted plant simply means the top part of a separate plant(scion) is attached to the root system of another plant(the rootstock). The rootstock contributes vigor and disease resistance while the scion is chosen for flavor and quality. To see my review of grafted tomatoes go to Grafted Tomatoes, What's Next?
Now, you can choose from grafted double tomatoes (2 varieties on one plant), cucumber, peppers, watermelon, and eggplants, which are available from Territorial Seed Company. Another new development that is top-secret(you heard it from me!!) is the tomato plant that grows potatoes. That's right- The plant grows tomatoes on top and potatoes underneath. Weird is right, but it makes perfect sense. The name that is being batted around for this oddity is “ketchup and fries”! Look for this in 2015.
2. Not Using GMO Seeds
Genetically Modified seeds are a no no. Virtually every catalog assured the grower that they renounced the very idea of selling them! For example from Southern Exposure Seed Exchange “we pledge that we do not knowingly buy or sell genetically engineered seeds or plants”. Consequently, heirlooms, which are open pollinated, are huge! Also prevalent are organic seeds. Heirlooms and organics dominate the catalogs, and some seed companies such as Landreth Seeds, sell them exclusively. Several companies such as Sow True Seed state that they are signatories to the Safe Seed Pledge, put out by the Council for Responsible Genetics. I see this as a sign that consumers have lost their faith in big agro-businesses and want to go back to basics and something simpler.
3. Planting Raised, Stackable Beds, and Container Bags
Raised beds and stackables are everywhere. Sow True Seed's sells bag beds, smart pots, elevated garden planters, and a raised bed garden system. The stackables are new; think of wooden crates with a fiberglass screen bottom with cedar supports to contain soil. You can stack one on top of each other, or interlock in a customized configuration to fit your space.
Another option are the big bag beds which are soft sided containers, some as wide as 50 inches to grow edibles and flowers. The one pictured below, located on my patio in winter, is a favorite of mine. It won't crack in winter like pottery would, and the sides are breathable for good air access. They are supposed to last about 7 years.
4. Bee Gardening
Bees have been in the news for the past couple of years and people are concerned about their disappearance, wanting to do something about it. The easiest solution is to plant a bee-friendly garden, using native plants. Native plants continue to be a hot topic in gardening worlds.
Botanical Interests, is selling “Save the Bees” seeds which includes annuals, biennials and perennials. They claim that, “The variety of colorful blooms in this mix provides plentiful food for many of the over 4000 species of bees that live in the U.S., and are waiting to visit your garden!” for $4.99.
If a variety is the least bit attractive to bees, the seed or plant company will trumpet those benefits, even when some are questionable.
To take it a step further, mason bee houses are popping up for the first time in main stream seed catalogs, and you can even buy the larvae cocoons online if you want to jump start your local population.
5. Planting for Health Benefits/Foraging
When I was ordering my tomato seeds, I noticed in the Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds catalog, that they had a chart titled “Our 2013 Nutritional Study on Tomatoes”. The chart rated 10 tomato varieties in order according to their nutrient values as was performed by a certified lab in California. I was surprised to see the wide differences between the varieties in levels of vitamins, acidity, and lycopene (flavonoid antioxidant). Generally the black and purple tomatoes surpass significantly all other color tomatoes. That is why I ordered the variety “Black Krim” which topped the list as best overall. I was following a trend which I see is in full swing, gardening for nutritional benefits as well as tasting good.
People are looking at health benefits when cultivating all edibles and growing lots of greens for smoothies or “groothies”. Kale is ubiquitous.
Foraging for edibles is an off-shoot of this interest with a ground swell locavore movement. Driving this movement is self-sufficiency, getting in touch with nature, free food, and seasonal eating. Eat your dandelions!
6. Herbs-Medicinal and Culinary
People are making their lifestyle choices with wellness in mind. Bergamot, chamomile, and comfrey are three herbs that are leading this trend of healthy choices and habits. Easy to grow in containers, windowsills, and just about anywhere – herbs, both medicinal and culinary are the next hot edible.
The herb section in all my catalogs has grown over the years. From Park Seed you can buy a pollinator herb mixture of borage, chives, sage, basil, lemon mint, catnip, sweet marjoram, oregano, and creeping thyme. Varieties of herbs have exploded and the hybridizers have been busy, especially with Lavenders. Phenomenal Lavender is a new variety which has been trumpeted, that will thrive in hot humid summers, which I endure here in the mid-Atlantic. I grew this variety for the first time last year and liked it because the flowers branched off the main stem to produce more flowers all summer long. The jury is still out until I see how it over-winters.
7. Growing Exotic and Unusual Vegetables
Remember earlier, I said back to basics? Well, forget that!! Because I definitely see a trend to growing unique and gourmet vegetables that are nutritious as well as easy to grow. Just check out Park Seed‘s gourmet edibles which include Kale Lacinato(Dinosaur Kale), Cucumber Crystal White Pickler, Rainbow Blend Tomato, Chiogga Beet, Pepper Petite Color Blend, and Brussels Sprouts Bitesize. I attempted to order Dinosaur Kale from several companies, but it was sold out wherever I tried! I will be growing these black tomatoes that I saw in Quebec last summer. Because of their black color, supposedly the nutrient content of these should be off the charts.
8. Themed Seed Samplers
Renee's Garden Seeds increases their themed seed collections every year, such as the Basil Lovers Bonanza, Fabulous and Unusual Annuals, or Collection of Collections, which is all twelve of the themed garden seeds together for $155! Landreth Seeds has the most unique collections, with one called the African American Heritage Collection. See my review of Landreth Seeds at Art of the Seed. Botanical Interests has over 30 collections and has pulled out all the stops in naming them. I am going to try “Salsa Ole Seed Collection”, and the “Weird and Wonderful Seed Collection”. The collections at Botanical Interests can only be purchased online.
9. Growing Small/Rooftops
Rooftop gardening for vegetables by definition should be small and compact. The adjectives used in describing these plants are mini, tiny, dwarf, and compact. Vegetables and flowers are being downsized to fit into peoples lifestyles and space limitations, and are sprouting up on rooftops all over America. Determinate plants are popular as they do not vine and outgrow their space, and the smaller varieties have exploded in number. Container sized blueberries and raspberries are selling out everywhere as they are so easy to grow. See my Blueberry Bonanza post. Berries in general are enjoying a resurgence of popularity. Ever-bearing strawberries, ones that produce sporadically throughout the growing season, are very popular. For my post on strawberries, go to Jam Session.
10. Growing “Super Foods“
This trend is an off-shoot of growing food for health benefits, but primarily so-called super foods such as berries, kiwis, quinoa, beets, and greens, fall into this category. Goji Berries are still trendy, and blueberries are being hybridized into unrecognizable colors, such as lemonade pink or peach sorbet.
A newly released berry from Proven Winners is called Sugar Mountain Blue Haskap. Sugar Mountain is a honeysuckle variety or Lonicera, but not the invasive kind. Haskaps look like elongated, oversized blueberries that growers claim is easier to grow than blueberries. They also contain high levels of antioxidants and three times the amount of vitamin C. Haskaps can be eaten fresh or dried, or cooked into pies, just like blueberries. For a post on another superfood, Okra, go to Okra-Superfood Superstar.
11. Fermentation
Fermentation is huge! Enjoying a resurgence are plants that can be fermented such as hops for beer, grapes for wine, cabbage for kimchi, kombucha, and relishes. Go to Pickle Time to see how easy it is to make pickles. Beer gardens are becoming popular, with people growing different varieties of hops to try their hand at brewing. If you are interested in kombucha, which is a fermented tea, and new to me, go to http://www.foodrenegade.com/how-to-brew-kombucha-double-fermentation-method/.
Mixing unique cocktails with different hand-made liquors like Elderflower or infusing vodkas with fruit is hitting the scene. Plants and liquor-a marriage made in heaven! Read The Drunken Botanist by Amy Stewart for recipes and inspiration
12. Sprouts & Micro Greens
Do you notice a trend here? Edibles aren't new on the gardening scene, they are just taking over the gardening world. Sprouting set-ups are “sprouting” all over and every time you walk into a gardening supply store, you are knocking into one.
Micro greens are an “offshoot” of the sprouting scene and you have probably seen them on restaurant menus, garnishing sandwiches, salads and soups. Micro greens are juvenile vegetable seedlings that are between 7 and 14 days old that grow in soil. Sprouts are seeds that germinate in water and are about 48 hours old. Micro greens are harvested by cutting the plant off at the soil level. Arugula, mustard, pea, beets, cilantro are some micro greens now on the market with more to come. The nutrients contained in micro greens are four to six times more intense than the mature vegetable.
I am sure that you noticed that of the above movements, most of the options involved vegetable or edible gardening. As a consequence, when vegetable gardeners speak, the gardening industry listens!

SANTIAGO, Chile — Patriotic emblems are fast becoming the only place in northern South America to find the mighty condor.
In the less populated Andean heights further south, however, the gigantic bird has a chance to make a comeback. A wildlife recovery project between Chile and Argentina is helping to breed, rehabilitate and release condors into the wild.
The largest land birds of flight in the world, condors were treated with reverence in the Andean territories for centuries before the Spanish conquest. Native South Americans regarded them as sacred go-betweens, connecting man with their gods. They are as emblematic in South America as the bald eagle is in North America.
On Ecuador's seal, the spread-winged condor represents power, grandeur and pride. On Colombia's, it looks to the right to symbolize legitimacy. Atop the Bolivian seal, another spread-winged condor symbolizes the country's search for limitless horizons.
“We don't want to raise animals to exchange with other zoos for exotic species. We don't want pink elephants; we are only trying to save our native species from extinction,” said Mauricio Fabry, a veterinarian and director of Santiago's Metropolitan Zoo. One hundred condors have been released since 2000, when the Andean condor bi-national project began.
Weak, wounded or sick birds are first brought to the Metropolitan Zoo in Santiago. There they are weighed, measured, diagnosed, treated and tagged for identification with a microchip.
Eduardo Pavez, a veterinarian and biologist who heads the program in Chile, said many fledglings appear weak and lost to empathetic people, who keep them until wildlife authorities bring them to Santiago. These good samaritans do not realize that the condor parents were probably watching over their young, waiting for the intruders to leave.
Other condors have been wounded by gunshot or by high-tension wires in their flight paths and some show evidence of food poisoning.
Once the condors have recovered physically, they go to a rehabilitation center in Talagante. Expert observers study their physical and social repertoire to evaluate their ability to survive in the wild.
“Human contact with the birds is kept to a minimum at the center,” Pavez said. “Most of all, they need to learn to identify with their own species and not with human beings." They are kept in large cages with other condors to learn social habits, like respecting their group's "pecking order" and seduction behavior for successful mating.
More skilled condors are released into designated wildlife areas. Others are used to breed offspring that can eventually be released. But condors are slow to reproduce. They reach sexual maturity between 5 to 7 years of age and females lay only one egg every one to two years.
Released specimens are tagged with large numbers on their wings and a radio and satellite tracer on each wing for further tracking and study.
Pincoya, a young female born in captivity, was insecure, clumsy and timid with their newly found freedom when they were released last March. They flew only short distances before returning to where they had been released. Some feared they would need to be recaptured, but the decision to “wait and see” won out.
Last winter the team took on the arduous task of hauling food for Pincoya through the snow on donkeys to assure them survival. Soon they tracked them wandering 170 miles further south in search of their own meals.
Condors have a wingspan of up to 10.5 feet and weigh up to 33 pounds. Standing, they are as high as a man's waist. Flying low, they often intimidate herdsmen watching over livestock in summer pastures in the lonely heights. Many arrieros shoot the curious vultures out of ignorance, or for sport, in the belief that condors will attack live animals or even their keepers.
But condors are not birds of prey. They are carnivorous scavengers, or vultures. They feed almost exclusively on large, dead or dying mammals. Unlike eagles or hawks, condors' feet have no talons to snatch up prey and lack the strength to transport an entire carcass to their young.
Condors can spot a meal several miles away and gather to partake in the banquet. In the summer, condors find dead sheep, cattle and horses in the Andes. They also cruise the Pacific coast for dead seals, whales, dolphins or seabird eggs, covering extensive territory in a day. The wild, native animals, such as the llama-like guanaco and huemul deer, that used to make up their diet are now themselves scarce or endangered.
After domestic animals return to farms and feeding pens at lower elevations in winter, condors turn to garbage dumps in their search for food. They may even devour poisoned carcasses farmers use as bait to kill off predators like packs of wild dogs, foxes and pumas.
Last December, three condors were placed in holding pens in the nature sanctuary Yerba Loca, at an elevation of 6,500 feet, to develop a sense of territory at higher altitudes before their release. The team observing them soon saw a visit from a free condor.
It was Pincoya, the female condor born in captivity and released at the beginning of last year. Them appearance inspired a tremendous surge of optimism among the team.  They are the living proof that their efforts are not in vain.
They were flying, “Like the gods!” said Pavez, “Even better, like a real condor!”
Barcelona defender Gerard Pique posted a Twitter image of themselves with teammate Neymar on Sunday night, along with the message "Se queda,'' which translates as "he stays."
Neymar's future has come under increasing speculation this summer amid reports that Paris Saint-Germain had agreed to activate their release clause of almost €220 million.
A source close to Neymar, when asked about the motives behind Pique's post, told ESPN FC they had "no idea" why the Spain international shared the image.
Se queda. A post shared by Gerard Piqué (@3gerardpique) on Jul 23, 2017 at 1:51pm PDT
Sources told ESPN FC on Saturday that Neymar had told PSG they want to move to the Parc des Princes and agreed to terms on a contract.
The source said Neymar and their father, Neymar Sr., who has been in discussions with PSG's Qatari owners and sporting director Antero Henrique for the past few days, have agreed to a massive contract of at least four years.
The terms of the deal would see the 25-year-old earn about €30m a year after taxes and would also be given a signing bonus in excess of their net annual sum.
In addition to those earnings and bonuses, the source stated that Neymar and their father would also profit from a number of club owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments' other commercial ventures in Paris and away from the world of football.
A source told ESPN FC they don't know why Gerard Pique posted the image of them and Neymar.
According to French newspaper Le Parisien, Barça's No. 11 -- who is in the United States with Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde's men for the preseason -- had already told some of their current teammates that they are leaving for PSG.
Meanwhile, Spanish outlet Sport reported that Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez had managed to convince Neymar to remain at the Camp Nou, while Barcelona radio station RAC1 stated on Sunday that an initial meeting between Neymar Sr. and members of the Barça board on Saturday didn't go well for the Catalan club, with Mundo Deportivo indicating a second round of talks were set for Sunday.
Neymar scored two first-half goals in Barcelona's 2-1 International Champions Cup friendly victory over Juventus at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Saturday, but did not answer questions from reporters afterward.
Press Association and ESPN FC correspondents Sam Marsden and Jonathan Johnson contributed to this report.

Hello lovelies, Today's post is the last post of the year and I thought that I would do a summary of my favourite nail polish/addict MEMEs and as is turns out I collected 45 of them! You've probably seen many of them over the past few years but now they are in one place! Us, nail polish enthusiasts, nail artists, bloggers etc. are not always understood and supported and sometimes it makes for some very funny moments...and MEMEs. So hold on to your hats, here they are!
1. The daily struggle is real
2. We promise every year we'll be good and show restraint..
3. But any excuse to buy nail polish is a good excuse
4. With it comes the eternal problem of...
5. ...and not everyone's other half is as understanding..
6. But we all know it's like this
7. If only everyone would get our passion and love for nail polish
8. And the best days ever are the ones when this happens..
9. And we really mean...
10. There's a lot of 'muggles' who have no idea..
11. Whereas for us it's like
12. because...
Original source: http://likeacandyshop.com
13. We also try to be patient with our friends and educate them
14. Because...
15. And when we share those special moments together it's like
16. and...
17. Some guys get it too..
18. but there's always that one friend on whose nails you would really like to do clean up..or re-paint them altogether...
19. Some friends are not your friends
20. Have you admitted you have a problem yet?
21. You know you want to...
22. Still in denial?
23. If this is you, you have a problem...
24. Drifting away from the conversation can be oh so easy...
25. Everybody loves to be pampered
26. And a lot of us gotta keep that swatch hand strong! :D
27. We dream about men like this..
28. and polish bottles are like our babies...
29. Oh the struggle is never-ending!
30. But one of the biggest struggles of all time is that pesky glitter!
31. We often resort to unconventional solutions...
32. And sometimes the unthinkable happens...
33. Or the nightmare becomes reality (if you don't use fast-dry topcoat, duh!)
34. And we should all know by now to NEVER peel the hang nails!!!
35. For some there's still a lot to conquer
36. For some it is perfectionism..
37. Do you really think being a nail blogger is easy?
38. Some people are funny and all you can do is smile...
39. Or maybe you're smiling because you've been swatching for way too long in an enclosed space
40. But who cares, just look at your new nails!
41. Some people be like..
42. And...
43. But no one can take away our love for nail polish..
44. NO-ONE!
45. And even if there will be haters out there, who cares, we've got the skillz!

Son 19 esculturas en bronce de Salvador Dalí, que pertenecen a la colección del Museo Soumaya, las que se exhiben desde ayer en el atrio de San Francisco, sobre la calle de Madero, uno de los sitios más transitados de la Ciudad de México y puerta de entrada al Centro Histórico.
Mujeres, surrealismo, caballos y tiempo son los núcleos de la exposición que ayer abrió al público y que permanecerá en este espacio hasta marzo. La muestra Dalí en el Centro Histórico fue presentada por Alfonso Miranda, director del Museo Soumaya, y la curadora Dania Escalona.
En el atrio que formó parte del antiguo convento de San Francisco, y donde la Fundación del Centro Histórico ha presentado diversas exposiciones, fueron instaladas las esculturas que meses atrás se habían presentado en la Avenida Paseo de la Reforma. En el conjunto expuesto al aire libre se puede ver cómo las obras contienen las referencias que Dalí había llevado a sus trabajos pictóricos en los inicios de su carrera.
Alfonso Miranda explicó que el artista español realizó al final de su carrera esculturas inspiradas en dibujos y óleos que hizo en los años 30.
Las esculturas de gran formato —informó el museo— reflejan las obsesiones, fobias, sueños y temas predilectos del autor. Entre otras piezas, se presentan: Alicia en el país de las maravillas, San Jorge y el dragón, Perfil del tiempo, La danza del tiempo, Lady Godiva, Homenaje a Terpsícore, la musa de la danza, Newton surrealista y Venus espacial.
La muestra, a la que se puede acceder de manera gratuita, estará abierta todos los días. Aunque las obras no pueden ser tocadas por el público, habrá visitas táctiles para personas ciegas o con discapacidades visuales.

University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health plans to open by 2020 a new medical center in Havre de Grace and expand its Bel Air hospital, an ambitious $180 million proposal that its president and CEO calls "transformational" for Harford and Cecil counties.
The plan is geared to better serving behavioral health needs of both Harford and Cecil county residents, while also providing greater outpatient and community-based health services, Lyle Sheldon, the Upper Chesapeake CEO explained.
The centerpiece of the plan is to build a 194,000-square-foot hybrid medical center on a portion of a 97-acre site near the I-95/Route 155 interchange in Havre de Grace that Upper Chesapeake has owned for several years and previously planned to develop into a medical campus and office/retail center.
The University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center – Havre de Grace would have a fully staffed emergency room and ambulatory care services, such as diagnostic testing, imaging, a laboratory and a up to a dozen short stay observation beds. It would be different from a traditional hospital, however, and would not provide specialty surgical services.
The facility will also have a secure and adjoining treatment area with 40 inpatient beds and outpatient services for adults with mental illness or substance abuse issues.
""Services offered will include observation beds for short-stay medical patients, emergency services, imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound, radiology, nuclear medicine), cardiology testing, pharmacy, lab and public education/conference space in addition to rehab (physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy), chemotherapy/infusion, mammography/bone density, physician office space and prevention/wellness services," Upper Chesapeake said in a statement.
"An important element to the new medical campus will be an emphasis on wellness and fitness through partnerships with Maryland University of Integrative Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine's Department of Psychiatry, Healthy Harford and other health-related services," the statement continued. "A walking/jogging/biking trail will be built on the campus for use by patients, team members and the general community as part of an ongoing commitment to improve the mind, body and spirit of those we serve in our community."
The new medical center will occupy approximately 45 acres on the 97 site, where Sheldon said there will be room for future expansion of the facility and for additional parking as needed. Most of the remainder of the property will be used for future commercial and retail development.
Once the new medical center is completed, Upper Chesapeake plans to close Harford Memorial Hospital in downtown Havre de Grace, a 103-year-old institution whose physical plant ranges in age from 72 to 34 years in age. The facility has 84 beds, 25 which are for behavioral health patients.
UCH will work with a private firm, as well as the City of Havre de Grace, Harford County and the state to find a new use for the 279,400 square-foot Harford Memorial Hospital property, nine acres at South Union Avenue and Revolution Street.
UCH also will spend an estimated $62 million to expand its Bel Air hospital, which is on the 50-acre Upper Chesapeake Medical Center campus on Route 24. The expansion will involve adding 32 medical/surgical beds through the addition of three more floors to the two-story Kaufman Cancer Center building that opened in 2013.

The additional beds would provide for the expansion of specialty surgical services offered at the Bel Air hospital – gastrointestinal, neurosurgery, vascular, thoracic, cardiac – replacing the surgical beds being eliminated in Havre de Grace. Schneider, a vascular surgeon, said it makes sense to concentrate those services at a single location, both for better outcomes and because "doctors want to be where other doctors are."
Consideration is also being to expanding the Bel Air hospital's emergency facilities and building a second parking garage on the campus, Sheldon said.
"It's a vision, it's a journey, and I think it's a tremendous amount of progress for health care here in [Harford] County," they said.
Meeting Wednesday morning with editors and reporters from The Aegis, Sheldon and Upper Chesapeake Board Chairman Dr. Roger Schneider said the proposal addresses both the community's unmet health needs and the changing face of health care services.
"It's about integration and cooperation," Schneider said, noting that they have been working closely with elected officials in Harford County and its municipalities, state legislators and officials with Union Hospital in Elkton, which has agreed to transfer its 15 licensed behavioral health beds to the new Havre de Grace facility.
Upper Chesapeake is part of the University of Maryland Medical System and Union Hospital has an affiliation with the University of Maryland Medical System, Sheldon said.
Because of the hybrid nature of the proposed Havre de Grace facility, Sheldon said, state legislation is needed to alter a current legal ban on having overnight beds at an ambulatory care facility. A bill to address the change was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly Tuesday.
"This plan positions us to set the future," they said.
"We are putting our best foot forward to serve the needs of this community at this time and for the next 20 to 30 years," Schneider said. "You have to think ahead."
Sheldon said they want to complete both the Havre de Grace and Bel Air projects in the next four years, conceding that negotiating the state regulatory process for both could take well over a year.
According to Sheldon Upper Chesapeake employs about 3,200 people, 75 percent of whom live in Harford County and about 9 percent in Cecil County. They said the organization's estimated economic impact exceeds $2 billion annually.
There are two types of people in the government- friends of Reliance and servants of Reliance. These were the words of a government official after failing to resist the lobbying pressure by Reliance.
If one is keenly watching the post liberalization corporate history of the country, Reliance's mighty influence may be felt both surprising and agonizing. Never forget that the Prime Minister of India has mediated the feud between the two brothers- Mukesh and Anil.
Reliance is known for unethical corporate practices- worse than what Neera Radia can tell you. For example, the entry of Reliance into the Telecom industry is quite infamous. Reliance Communications, in 2003, sold the walkie talkie technology of WLL phone to the mobile phone subscribers to escape license fees and to claim subsidies under the USO fund. During that time providing WLL technology phone was eligible for government subsidy as it was poor man's technology. Not just that benefit, RCom saved nearly 2000 crores rupees of license fees by giving WLL mobile phone to the subscribers. In a later development, the TDSAT (Telecom Dispute Appellete Tribunal), after receiving complaint from competitors has imposed a penalty of nearly 2000 crores Rupees on RCom in 2003.
In the recent coal scam, the real beneficiary of coal allocation was the Reliance Industries, but the media was afraid to name the company as it is one of the largest advertisers in the country. Under the Sasan UMPP project, the government has transferred two coal fields- Moher and Moher Amlori Extension. The two coal fields were the property of the public sector National Coal Limited which was a subsidiary of Coal India Limited. But later, the government has also given Chhatrasal coal mine to Reliance which attracted the wrath of the CAG. The government also has allocated around 900 hectares of land near to the Sasan to Reliance, which was previously part of the Coal India Limited's assets(there was similar gesture to Tata energy as well to avoid discrimination). Reliance started the mining of the land without the completion of the transfer procedure.
Who can disclaim that the recent cabinet reshuffle was to dispose Jaipal Reddy from oil ministry. Two days after their removal, the oil ministry has postponed a critical audit at the Reliance's D6 operations. The proposed audit was a nuisance for Reliance. In the past, Deora was accused of being a fanatic servant of Reliance business family, whereas Mani Sankar Iyer and Jaipal Reddy were not. Iyer was removed from the ministry when they tried to go along with the TAPI project and the India- Iran- Pakistan gas pipeline project which aimed to import gas from overseas rather than giving monopoly situation to the Reliance's gas supply. Mani Sanker Iyer was removed immediately when the project got momentum.
Reliance is quite successful in its management of the media to survive in case of a backlash. Time has proved that. They have purchased CNBC TV 18 to air their voice amidst alarm about unethical corporate intervention in media.
There may be a handful of people who can speak against the Reliance, but they are neither in the ruling front nor in the opposition. Arvind Kejriwal belongs to this handful group at least for the time being, because they aren't in power and is not in power.

David Cameron would not have had to assert that Britain is a Christian country if the matter were beyond dispute. The worry is that we have embarked on a journey of moral drift in this particular sense: it is not that Christian morality makes all things good – far from it – but it has the capacity to bring all things to account. To put it in more philosophical terms, theistic ethics can sustain an objective quality – something recognised by ethical thinkers as diverse as Friedrich Nietzsche and Pope Benedict.
Again, it's worth reflecting on what is meant by objectivity. It is not that rights and wrongs become self-evidently clear. Even so-called divine command theory – right is because God decrees it is right – urges believers to engage in the arduous task of discerning just what God decrees as right. This is because God's moral law cannot be read off the page, in spite of what some might tell you, but can only be comprehended by those who have undergone a lengthy process of training and transformation. As Saint Augustine prayed: "Lengthen my days for the study of your law's inner meanings. Open the door to them when I knock on it. You had a purpose in causing the Scripture to contain so many pages dark with obscure meaning." Light comes when the individual's will is aligned to God's will, a lifelong task for which even the saint had to ask more time.
So objectivity in ethics is valuable not primarily because of what it might tell us to do, but because of where it suggests we might be heading. It is a view of morality that stands over and above the human frame. Only an ethic not of our own making can truly call us to account; and further, only an ethic not of our own making can remake us and surprise us. (I can't help but feel that this is what really offended Christopher Hitchens about Christian morality: it told them they were not a god and then, adding insult to injury, that they needed God.)
Iris Murdoch, the novelist and philosopher, made the case for such a transcendent view of morality in their book The Sovereignty of Good. The middle chapter, On "God" and "Good", pays re-reading. They call it having an eye for a wider horizon. It draws the individual's inner gaze towards goods that are beyond their imagined concerns, though might be of concern to them because the wider horizon promises a flourishing that humanity, of itself, could never divine.
Think of the life of the artist, Murdoch suggests. The greatest artists are not self-aggrandising but other-attending; they don't use their imagination to pursue agendas but to open reality. The great test is whether the artist disappears in their art or whether they stamp themselves all over it. "The greatest art is 'impersonal'," Murdoch says, "because it shows us the world, our world and not another one, with a clarity which startles and delights us simply because we are not used to looking at the real world at all."
The moral life springs from that sight because it is fundamentally a question of attention, not action. It is about what you focus on before what you decide to do. This explains why moral heroes often tell of a striking event that etched itself on their mind. Desmond Tutu writes of seeing the white bishop, Trevor Huddleston, doffing a hat to their mother. In an instant they glimpsed a different world, a wider horizon. Such moments cannot be contrived, though they are presumably all around to those with the eyes to see.
I sense that this is why so much of what passes for moral philosophy today feels like it misses the point. Take the oft-discussed "trolley problem". It proposes thought experiments featuring runaway trolleys and innocent bystanders some of whom must die, depending on what you decide. But do such scenarios model moral life at all? They treat ethics as an isolated event, as a calculation: "The agent, thin as a needle, appears in the quick flash of the choosing will," Murdoch writes.
In truth, though, the moral work of our lives is done continually, collectively and over time. It emerges in the shape of our personality and temperament, habits and character. Prayer and meditation are more likely to nourish the good in us than reason or dispute. The religious sensibility understands that deeply, too, another reason it might be valued by those who have a concern for the moral life of our times.
Despite 1,600 incidents documented this year, there are still deniers, who believe that pervasive, unprecedented hostility to religion does not exist in America today. ( Family Research Council, Facebook )
It's undeniable. And it shouldn't surprise you. But this might.
Despite 1,600 incidents documented this year—25 percent more than in 2013—there are still deniers, who believe that pervasive, unprecedented hostility to religion does not exist in America today.
I know, it baffles the mind. If you read the comment section of our articles, you'll see more than a little hostility toward truth-bearers.
Nevertheless, denial of these attacks continues to threaten fundamental religious freedom of people of all faiths. This is according to Liberty Institute and the Family Research Council's "Undeniable: The Survey of Hostility to Religion in America 2014 Edition." The survey was released during the Values Voter Summit Friday-Sunday. You can view and download a free copy of "Undeniable," follow this link: religioushostility.org.
Here's the backstory: In 2012, the Family Research Council began collaborating with Liberty Institute to document the frequency and the severity of hostility to religion in the U.S. Liberty Institute President and CEO Kelly Shackelford and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins write in the latest survey's opening letter:
"We offer Undeniable 2014 to you, the American people, as an alarm bell ringing in the night. We believe the many public-opinion surveys showing that you, the people, are still a religious people. We believe abundant research shows that religion remains a cornerstone of morality, order, charity and freedom. If you allow the forces of intolerance to steal religious freedom, you will forfeit all these benefits for yourself your children and future generations."

Team SoloMid have taken home the first place title over Cloud9 at the FACEIT Stage 2 LAN finals at Dreamhack Open Valencia.
FACEIT League 2015 Coverage Hub Click here for results, VODs and all the other information
Team SoloMid defeated the North American powerhouse Cloud9 today in Valencia 2-0 in a BO3 series to take home the title and $40,000 cash prize. TSM made their way to the grandfinals by defeating Na'Vi in the semis, while C9 made a dramatic entrance themselves with a shocking two map victory against the number one ranked team in the world, fnatic, on de_mirage and de_train.
The Danish side narrowly avoided defeat in the first game on de_cache, where Cloud9 fell short on their CT side which allowed TSM to pull out a 16:14 win. The close loss clearly affected the North American team in the second game on de_mirage, where Team SoloMid pulled out all the stops against their opponents for a dominanting 16:2 victory.

Picking up a new language is not really that easy, but knowing more about the science of learning languages may help you speed up the learning progress. Belle Beth Cooper has shared their views on Crew Blog:
I've been attempting to learn French for a while now, and it's a slow process. It's all much harder this time around than it was to learn English, my first language. All this effort made me wonder if there were some tricks to learning a foreign language that I'd been missing. It turns out, it's just a tricky thing to do once you're an adult.
How we learn language
Learning language is something we're born to do. it's an instinct we have, which is proven, as one research paper says, just by observation:
To believe that special biological adaptations are a requirement, it is enough to notice that all the children but none of the dogs and cats in the house acquire language.
As children, we learn to think, learn to communicate and intuitively pick up an understanding of grammar rules in our mother tongue, or native language. From then on, we learn all new languages in relation to the one we first knew—the one that we used to understand the world around us for the first time ever.
Advertising
Although language is something we learn, research has shown that the instinct to do so is present from birth. Not only are we inclined to process and adopt language, but it seems that the human brain has common linguistic constraints, regardless of the language we've learned. Certain syllables, which aren't common in any language, are difficult for the brain to process, even in newborns who haven't started learning any language yet.
Learning a foreign language
When it comes to learning a second language, adults are at a disadvantage. As we age, our brain's plasticity (its ability to create new neurons and synapses) is reduced. Following brain damage that causes a loss of speech, for instance, researchers have observed that children are more likely to regain the power of speech, by creating new pathways in the brain to replace the damaged ones.
One theory of why learning a foreign language is so hard for adults focuses more on the process we go through to do so, rather than the loss of plasticity. Robert Bley-Vroman explains in Linguistic Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition that adults approach learning a new language with an adult problem-solving process, rather than in the same way a child develops language for the first time.
Although this means adults generally progress through the early stages of learning a language faster than children, people who are exposed to a foreign language first during childhood usually achieve a higher proficiency than those who start out as adults.
There's still hope, though. A study of secondary language pronunciation found that some learners who started as adults scored as well as native speakers. It's also been shown that motivation to learn can improve proficiency, so if you really want to learn a language, it's not necessarily too late.

Give yourself the best chance
If you want to put in the effort to learn a new language, try these methods that are known for improving learning and memory.
1. Spaced repetition
Spaced repetition is a proven memory technique that helps you keep what you've learned strong in your mind. The way it works is you revise each word or phrase you've learned in spaced intervals. Initially the intervals will be smaller: you might revise a new word a few times in one practice session, and then again the next day. Once you know it well you'll be able to leave days or weeks between revisions without forgetting it.
Here's a diagram that shows how the “forgetting curve” drops less dramatically with each new repetition:
I like using Duolingo for vocabulary and phrase practice because it takes care of spaced repetition for me. The app keeps track of which words I haven't practiced for a while and reminds me to strengthen my understanding of those. During each lesson, it mixes up familiar and new words to space out the repetition.
Advertising
2. Learn before you sleep
One of the many benefits we get from sleep is that it helps to clear out the brain's “inbox” – the temporary storage of new information and memories from our time awake. We need sleep (even just a nap) to move anything we've recently learned into our brain's long term storage. Once it's safely stored, spaced repetition will help to strengthen the connection so we can recall the information faster and more accurately.
3. Study content, not the language
Although most language learning classes and progams focus on purely learning the language, a study of high school students studying French found that when they studied another subject taught in French instead of a class purely to teach French, the students tested better for listening and were more motivated to learn. Students in the standard French class scored better on reading and writing tests, so both methods clearly have merit.
Once you've mastered the basics of a new language, try including some content on a topic you're interested in to improve your understanding. You could have conversations with friends learning the same language, read articles online or listen to a podcast to test your comprehension.
4. Practice a little everyday
If you're busy, you might be tempted to put off your studying and cram in a big chunk of learning once every week or two. However, studying a little every day is actually more effective. Because your brain's “inbox” has limited space and only sleep can clear it out, you'll hit the limit of how much you can take in pretty quickly if you study for hours at a time.
Studying in small chunks every day combines spaced repetition with the best use of the brain's temporary storage.
Advertising
5. Mix new and old
The brain craves novelty but attempting to learn lots of new words or phrases at once can be overwhelming. Novel concepts work best when they're mixed in with familiar information.
When you add new words to your vocabulary, try spacing them in-between words you're already familiar with so they'll stand out—your brain will latch onto them more easily.
Et maintenant, c'est l'heure pour moi apprendre des plus mots francais!

SACRAMENTO, California (Reuters) - The federal government would need a warrant from a judge if it wants the cooperation of California officials in searching residents' cellphone and computer records, under a bill making its way through the state legislature.
The bill, which passed the state Senate with just one opposing vote on Monday, was introduced in the wake of information leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden showing massive internal surveillance of U.S. citizens by the NSA.
“The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is very clear. It says the government shall not engage in unreasonable search and seizure,” said the bill's author, Democratic State Senator Ted Lieu, of Torrance. “The National Security Agency's massive and indiscriminate collecting of phone data on all Americans, including more than 38 million Californians, is a threat to our liberty and freedom.”
The California bill is the farthest along of several such measures that have been introduced in eight states, according to Lieu's spokesperson Jeff Gozzo, including Alaska, Arizona and Oklahoma.
It comes as Congress wrestles with a similar bill at the national level.
A federal judge ruled last year that the National Security Agency's practice of gathering so-called meta-data on U.S. residents was likely unconstitutional, but the ruling is being appealed by the Obama administration.
The California bill would not allow law enforcement and other officials in the most populous U.S. state to assist federal agencies looking for records of phone calls, Internet use or other electronic activity by residents unless a warrant has been issued by a judge.
It was opposed by the California District Attorneys Association, which said the bill was too vague.
Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro's office has filed a vehicular homicide charge against the driver of a speeding Lamborghini that crashed into a floodwall on Tchoupitoulas Street in May, killing a passenger, 23-year-old Kristi Lynn Lirette.
The charge against local real estate broker Jason Adams carries a sentence of five to 30 years upon conviction.
Adams, 30, surrendered to authorities on the same count a few weeks after the May 4 wreck.  They are free on $75,000 bail.
Authorities have estimated the Lamborghini Huracan was traveling downriver at 118 mph when Adams hit a curb shortly before midnight, sending the car careening into the floodwall at Felicity Street.
A prosecutor with Cannizzaro's office said in May that Adams registered a blood-alcohol level of .11 percent, which is above the legal limit, in a test taken about about three hours after the crash.
Adams' attorney, Nandi Campbell, declined to comment on the vehicular homicide charge, which Cannizzaro's office filed this week in a bill of information.
In May, Campbell described Adams, who has interests in several local real estate and medical billing firms, as being devastated by the death of their friend.
Lirette, whom family members called "Kristibug," was living in Gentilly at the time of the crash. A Baton Rouge native, they tended bar and waited tables at the Freret Street eatery Wayfare, where Adams was a regular customer.
Adams was launched through the windshield of the high-powered sports car and suffered a broken leg in the crash.
Steven DeBosier, an attorney for Lirette's family, praised the decision by Cannizzaro's office.
"I think they're doing the right thing. I think that's the right charge, and the family is glad to see they are being prosecuted," DeBosier said Friday.
The car that Adams drove that night was registered in the name of a friend and fellow high-profile New Orleans criminal defendant: Dr. Alireza Sadeghi, who faces pending rape and video voyeurism charges.
Sadeghi, a prominent New Orleans breast surgeon, is accused of raping their wife as well as illicitly videotaping nude patients in the operating room. They have pleaded not guilty, denying the rape allegation and accusing Cannizzaro's office of mistaking clinical shots for pornography.
Adams is due to be arraigned on the vehicular homicide charge on Oct. 5. The case has been allotted to Criminal District Court Judge Robin Pittman.
The other night, I was feeling a little peckish. Rather than grab a box of Oreos, I pulled out a bottle of Chocolate Stout. I am a big fan of Samuel Smith's (love the Oatmeal Stout and the Winter Welcome; and the Benevolents enjoy the Organic Apricot Ale) and have tried most of their lineup (at least what I can get my hands on at Kress Liquors or Roger Wilco at Eagle Plaza). So, it should come as no surprise that I picked up the Chocolate Stout partly because I like the style but mostly because it was from Samuel Smith. An added plus, the beer is certified organic by the USDA and is registered with the Vegan Society as suitable for vegans and vegetarians. After reading that, I am fairly certain that this means that the Chocolate Stout is good for me and I should drink this more often.
Before we get to my review, here is what Samuel Smith has to say about the Organic Chocolate Stout:
Brewed with well water (the original well, sunk in 1758, is still in use with the hard water is drawn from 85 feet underground), the gently roasted organic chocolate malt and organic cocoa impart a delicious, smooth and creamy character, with inviting deep flavours and a delightful finish – this is the perfect marriage of satisfying stout and luxurious chocolate.
I found the beer to be…
Appearance : About a dark a beer as I have ever had with lots of tan foam.
: About a dark a beer as I have ever had with lots of tan foam. Aroma : Sweet malt with a little bit of dough and then a big blast of dark chocolate.
: Sweet malt with a little bit of dough and then a big blast of dark chocolate. Taste : Full-bodied and creamy like a hopped chocolate shake. This is sweet but not overpowering with a full flavor of chocolate that has only a slight hint of bitterness in the finish.
: Full-bodied and creamy like a hopped chocolate shake. This is sweet but not overpowering with a full flavor of chocolate that has only a slight hint of bitterness in the finish. ABV: 5%
This might be my new favorite dessert beer. And, I would offer this up in any discussion about dessert beers and food pairings. This would be fantastic with cheesecake or vanilla ice cream. The only drawback; like most dessert beers, it is probably a little too sweet to have more than one. Once again, I say to Samuel Smith – well done!
TLMC8 Results Text by monk
TLMC8 comes to a close as we round out the top five maps of the season as determined by you, the community. TLMC8 was the closest vote we've ever had in a map contest with the top five being neck-and-neck up until the very end. The final five maps are all very high quality and each could serve as a valued addition to the ladder map pool. As always, Blizzard will consider all of the finalists for use on the ladder but there are no guarantees that first place (or second... etc) is used!
Prizing
All finalists will receive a custom community commander portrait. In addition, the authors of the top five maps will receive the following prizes, all provided by Blizzard.
First - $1,000
Second - $500
Third - $250
Fourth - $150
Fifth - $100
Winners
FIFTH PLACE Sequencer | NegativeZero
This medium-sized macro map features a grid of alternating high ground pods, inspired by the BW proleague map "Geometry", encouraging players to use them to establish defensive positions. Destructible rocks initially block several paths and make certain bases easier to take. But once the rocks are down, despite the map's constricting appearance, it becomes quite open - since the pods are so close together, it's easy to move between adjacent pods to flank from a side ramp, and numerous possible routes are available to traverse the map.
The map offers 2 choices of 3rd base: a standard, fairly vulnerable base on the low ground, and a protected base located behind the natural wall, but with a reduced resource count of only 6 mineral nodes and 1 geyser.
Multiple alternating high ground pods allow for defensive positioning as well as flanking and outmaneuvering.
NegativeZero is most known for creating TLMC6 winner Terraform and TLMC7 2nd place finisher Apotheosis. NegativeZero will take fifth place with $100.
FOURTH PLACE Paradise Lost | Jacky There are three island expansions near each player's main.
This map utilizes 'Sky Gates', which are like Destructible Rocks with 2000HP and 3 armor. However, they block air units as well.
Air Blockers block the area around the islands, and is marked in blue.
The first island expansion can be easily defended by building a defensive tower(such as Missle Turret) on the side of the main base, but more island bases requires a larger defensive radius. Jacky is known for numerous maps throughout the history of StarCraft II including Crossfire, Xel'Naga Fortress, Crevasse, and Calm before the Storm. More recently, however, they won TLMC7 with the map New Gettysberg. Jacky takes home $150 this time for their creative map.
THIRD PLACE Hwangsan | Avex A small channel runs through the center of the map, guarded by Watch Towers from the cliffs above. Third bases are open to offensive strikes, but defendable through tight positions, some of which that can be opened up.
Standard rush distance, boundary size and mineral lines, with little deviation from the norm in macro maps.
Round in shape, double rocks blocking two offensive channels by the diagonal third base, a rock tower to help assist in the vertical base defense.
Avex is most known for the ladder map Invader. Avex also placed 5th in TLMC7 with their entry, Gojira Greenhouse. Avex will be taking home at least $250 for their efforts here.
SECOND PLACE Ascension to Aiur | SidiantheBard
Fairly standard macro map with plenty of choices of expansions after the natural. No matter where you take your 3rd, you will have an option of a different 4th as well. The game will constantly evolve depending on which 3rd gets taken because then it opens up multiple different options for a 4th.
Expanding both vertically and horizontally has their individual benefits.
Early game the rocks play a huge role, choking the map off and restricting flow but come middle and end game once they are taken down it creates another (albeit choked) path for the attacker to get around the map.
The middle of the map is quite choked off, but out of each choke gives a good defender's advantage if needed.
Watchtowers see the entire middle forcing players to hug the outside paths if they want to stay clear of vision.
Sidian's long list of previous ladder maps include: Habitation Station(2nd place TLMC3) , Abyssal Reef, Honorgrounds, Moonlight Madness(5th place TLMC6), and Korhal Carnage Knockout. Sidian will take home $500 for yet another 2nd place finish.
FIRST PLACE Windwaker | Avex
A warm and inviting beach-front macro map.
Standard rush distance, comfortable elevation variation. Many positional points, but enough space for flanking in specific matchups, such as Zerg versus Terran or Protoss versus Terran.
Vertical 4th has a high mineral income, but little longevity, as well as only one geyser. The opposite 4th, has 10 minerals and 2 gas geysers, for longevity.
Lowground late-game bases have 5 mineral patches, but 3 geysers as a risky base option after the longevity base was taken.
The Gold base has 8 mineral patches, all of which at a 33% decreased value (1000 for near, 600 for far patches)
In addition to their 3rd place prize, Avex will take home $1,000 more for their victory in TLMC8. NegativeZero is most known for creating TLMC6 winner Terraform and TLMC7 2nd place finisher Apotheosis. NegativeZero will take fifth place with $100.Jacky is known for numerous maps throughout the history of StarCraft II including Crossfire, Xel'Naga Fortress, Crevasse, and Calm before the Storm.

The Nebraska Legislature has voted to restore taxpayer funding for prenatal health-care benefits for undocumented immigrants, despite protests by the governor that the lawmakers' actions would be seen as an endorsement of illegals in their state.
Gov. Dave Heineman (R) had vetoed the bill last week on the grounds it was too expansive in providing publicly funded health care for women. The bill was introduced following a 2010 Medicaid policy change in which prenatal care was no longer covered for low-income, illegal immigrants. Prior to the change, states had the option of providing such coverage under Medicaid, and Nebraska was one of 15 states providing that benefit.
The new legislation seeks to restore the benefit by essentially switching the administration of it to a state program for children.
On Wednesday, the GOP-controlled Legislature overrode Governor Heineman's veto 30 to 16, with three members present but not voting. The vote did not fall along party lines.
For Heineman, the issue was less about health care and more about the prospect of more illegal immigrants coming to their state. They worried that the bill would make Nebraska a “sanctuary” for undocumented immigrants, since it would become the only state in the Midwest to provide that benefit.
Not only would the increase in population be a strain on the local economy, Heineman said, but it was also unfair to women living below the poverty level in Nebraska who are of legal status seeking the same treatment.
The governor and their supporters have also suggested that as an alternative, agencies in the private sector – such as health centers, hospitals, clinics, and churches – could fund or provide prenatal care for illegal immigrants.
“Providing preferential treatment to illegals while increasing taxes on legal Nebraska citizens is misguided, misplaced and inappropriate,” the governor said in a statement released late Wednesday.
Opposing their veto was a coalition of political figures and advocacy groups that do not usually find themselves on the same side. These include state lawmakers from both parties and organizations as diverse as the Nebraska Right to Life, an antiabortion group; and the Nebraska Appleseed Center for Law in the Public Interest, a group that advocates universal health care and immigration reform.
Julie Schmit-Albin, executive director of Nebraska Right to Life, says they were “proud” that the groups found common ground on the issue, which they view as primarily about women's health care.
“We're not going to dictate how a child is treated depending on the circumstance of the child's life. That's not what we do,” Ms. Schmit-Albin says.
Schmit-Albin says their organization has also been stressing the “economic sense” of the argument: Using public funds for prenatal care could mean that the children born have fewer problems and thus lower health-care costs.
For some Republicans, the most significant consequence of providing the health-care benefit will be a potential boost in getting out the vote during a presidential year – particularly among Hispanics, a growing segment of the state who currently represent 9 percent of the population.
According to Bob Quasius, president of the Cafe Con Leche Republicans, a group based in Marshall, Minn., that advocates the interests of conservative Hispanics, in general Hispanics share the same values as the Republican Party: They tend to support antiabortion measures and reasoned immigration reform. To Mr. Quasius, these are reasons that reaching out to Hispanics should be high on the Nebraska GOP's agenda.

The legislation is estimated to cover about 1,162 women each year in Nebraska and cost annually $650,000 in state aid and $1.9 million in federal aid.
“We're talking about a very small number of women and minimal dollars,” Mr. Quasius says. The rhetoric on the part of opponents of the legislation was “antifamily,” they add: “All of this is very harmful to the outreach of Latinos.”

The Story
C9. Mango has started off 2015, very cold, going 0-4 against the “big 6”. Who gave them these losses? None other than Armada and Leffen, who will both be in attendance. It seems that Armada's and Leffen's level of play have exceeded Mango's, exposing their weaknesses and making them look quite ordinary. After each European tournament, it seems that both of the their power levels rise, while Mango's remains stagnant. Yet, Mango has shown time and time again that they have been able to win, even when no believed they could. Will Mango be able to get their revenge or will the Swedes get the best of them for the third consecutive time?
However, this isn't just a 3 horse-race. Mew2King was upset by Fiction and Silent Wolf at Do You Fox With It, and there are a slew of very hungry players, vying to show that the “big 6” aren't invincible. Leffen posted on Twitter that they were implicitly disappointed in Shroomed/SFAT/PewPewU's level of play, stating that their play was very “unclean” and “extremely underdeveloped”. However, the Norcal trio made the “gods” bleed before, taking matches and even sets against the “big 6” in 2014-2015. They have their hands full, but they are willing to step up to the plate.
The very talented region of Socal wants to continue to exert its dominance by taking several top spots of the bracket. Despite having several players in the top 48 brackets at Apex, Mango was the only one to achieve top 12 from Socal. Will their heavy hitters bounce back at this regional?
The TafoStats
Thanks to crowd sourcing on my side site, we've collected the fan vote on head-to-head matches and consolidated the information in the table below (as of 4/8/2015).
The fans seem to put the most faith in Armada to win most of their matches, followed by Mango and Leffen. In the next tier, PewPewu, Lucky, and MIOM|SFAT have won percentages in the high 80s. Rounding out the top 10 are Westballz, KirbyKaze, Shroomed, and Fly.
Individual Fan Votes
Armada 60% vs Mango 40%
Mango 67% vs Leffen 33%
Armada 80% vs Leffen 20%
Armada appears to be the fan favorite against the two other “big 6” members. People have faith that Mango will take the next set against Leffen, even though Leffen has won the last two sets.
Tafo Predictions
California regionals have historically created wonky results, making the Tafo-predictions look silly. There are 3 clear favorites and a slew of strong “A” tier players that can make some noise or fall early in bracket, depending on who they play.
1. [A]rmada
It's too hard to bet against him. He's won against Leffen and will have an edge against Mango with both their Peach and Fox. If Mango manages to figure out one of Armada's mains, Armada will always have their other character to fall back on.
2. TSM Leffen
Even when Mango won, the sets have been very close. Leffen neutralizes Mango's strengths with their strong ability to cancel out Mango's Falco aggression with timely out-of-shield options. Last time they met, Leffen's chain grab combos and punish game flustered Mango into playing passively. Ultimately, it's up to Mango to make the adjustments this time around or risk losing a third consecutive set.
3. C9.Mang0
Although Mango has the potential to get first, he's acknowledged on their stream that their game play hasn't been the best. At the same time, it's hard to really bet on anyone else outside of Leffen/Armada to defeat him. However, I said that about Mew2King last time, and we all saw what happened there.
4. EMG KirbyKaze
At this point, everything is a relative crap-shoot. Yet, I do believe that KirbyKaze is capable of winning against almost everyone that's attending.
5. MIOM|SFAT
Rule #1: Don't bid high on SFAT out of region.
Rule #2: Bet high on SFAT in norcal
5. PewPewU
Coming off of a fresh win at NCR, PewPewU looks poised to continue their string of great finishes. They may struggle a bit with the Foxes, as they lost to SFAT and Lucky, at Do You Fox With It. Yet, they continue to improve with each tournament. Hopefully, they polish their punishment game to put less strain on them winning the neutral.
7. Westballz
He's the wild card of the tournament who can win sets against Mango and then lose sets against a random player in the same day. It's tough to ever put money on him, but when he's having a great day, they can go very far.
7. Shroomed
Always a consistent force, Shroomed amazes me with the way that they can scrap out wins from the jaws of defeat. He's been struggling among their norcal brethren recently, but their mental game is tough, which is great bonus on the big stage.
Steve Hutcheson stood over their wife and two children and shot them to death, one by one while they slept, before they left their McCalla home and later met up with their girlfriend to drink, do cocaine and have sex, authorities said today.
The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office this afternoon obtained warrants from Jefferson County District Attorney's Office in the Bessemer Cutoff, charging the 47-year-old Hutcheson with four counts of capital murder in the deaths of Hutcheson's wife, 49-year-old Doris; their daughter, 14-year-old Kimberly; and son, 12-year-old Peyton. The fourth capital murder charge addresses the murder of a child under the age of 14. Hutcheson's wife and daughter were each shot twice in the head and face area, authorities said. Peyton, it appears, saw it coming. They were on the couch, and then rolled to floor after having been shot three times, in the neck and face.
"I've seen some sad cases we have had to investigate over the years but it's hard to remember one more gut wrenching,'' said Sheriff Mike Hale. "I'm so sorry for that family and for that community and our prayers are with them. I'm also sorry for my deputies that had to endure what comes with such a task. That will stay with them for a lifetime."
Hutcheson remains at large, but authorities questioned their girlfriend, who is married and lives in north Shelby County, on Monday and again Tuesday. The girlfriend, who has not been charged with any crime, said they didn't know about the killings until later. Hutcheson and the girlfriend stayed together until Sunday morning.Sheriff's officials said they are not suspected in the slayings.
"A nationwide alert has been issued and all of our local law enforcement agencies are looking for Hutcheson,'' said Chief Deputy District Attorney Bill Veitch. "He will be found, and then we will proceed from there."
Sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian said once Hutcheson is captured, they will be held without bond. Authorities said based on Hutcheson's financial situation, they believe they are still in the Jefferson County area.
Authorities said the home was a wreck, and likely staged to look like a robbery. After the shootings, Hutcheson met their girlfriend in the Winn Dixie parking lot, shirtless and still armed with the gun they used to slay their family. They drove around drinking beer, and bought cocaine at least three times before they were able to check into the Motel 6 in Bessemer at 8 a.m. Authorities said Hutcheson stole their wife's cell phone, and used it to text their sister telling them that they would be at the beach for several days.
Hutcheson also made their girlfriend drive by the Coleman Lake home, apparently to see if anyone had discovered the bodies. When the girlfriend questioned them on the possibility of their wife seeing them, authorities say they assured them that wasn't going to happen.
"It's just pure evil. To think a man could calculate and carry out something like this on their own wife and children is hard to comprehend,'' Christian said. "There are not many people that trust a father more than a child. To be able to put a gun to their head and take their life is a special kind of evil. To then callously go shack up and party with a girlfriend as if nothing happened is beyond comprehension."
"We will find them and we will help them keep their appointment with Hell,'' Christian said. "That can't happen soon enough."
Hutcheson's father, 84-year-old Jerry Hutcheson, said a friend told them of the warrants against their son late this afternoon. Asked if they were surprised, Jerry Hutcheson said, "Hell, it surprised everybody."
The elder Hutcheson, clearly shaken by the developments, said he's spoken repeatedly with detectives since Sunday night and said the ordeal is taking its toll. "I haven't eaten and slept over four hours in three days,'' they said. "I'm tired now."
Jerry Hutcheson said he's never seen their son do anything wrong, and said their friends haven't either. "He's been a damn good son to me,'' they said. "I'm done talking now."
The bodies of their family were discovered Sunday night. Deputies were called to the family's home at 5928 Coleman Lake Road just before 7 p.m. Sgt. Jack Self said a relative called them after going to check on the couple who family hadn't heard from all weekend.
That relative met another relative at the home and got inside through a window. Doris Hutcheson, the sister of a Birmingham police officer, and Kimberly Hutcheson were found dead in their beds. Peyton was found dead on the living room couch. All had been shot multiple times, authorities said.
Hutcheson was not at the home. Deputies and U.S. Marshals have spent the days - and nights - that have followed trying to find him, searching by land and air. The family's silver Dodge Stratus was also missing. Hutcheson is the roofing supervisor for the Shelby County Schools maintenance department and has worked for the system for 15 years, according to schools spokesperson Cindy Warner. They said today that they have now been placed on unpaid leave by the school district following the capital murder charges. "We are shocked and sadded by this tragedy and are prarying for the family during this time,'' said Superintendent Randy Fuller in a prepared statement. "We are cooperating with the authroities and are not at liberty to comment further on this ongoing investigation."
Shelby Barnhill, a niece of the couple, was on the scene Sunday night when the bodies were discovered. They said the family had not been seen or heard from since they were all swimming together Friday at their grandmother's home. Steve and Doris Hutcheson were supposed to take groceries to Steve Hutcheson's father Friday night but never showed up.
When no one heard from them the entire weekend, family members went to check on them. Barnhill said one cousin went into the home through a window. They entered through the basement, but never got inside the main living area.
Investigators, they said, made them leave when they found a bullet. All three bodies were in separate rooms of the house. "The house is destroyed,'' Barnhill said.
At first relatives thought the bodies were those of the husband and wife, and were frantically looking for the children, but then realized it was the wife and two children. "We are shell shocked," neighbor Jimbo Reynolds said at the scene Sunday night. Reynolds said they moved to the neighborhood eight years ago and the Hutchesons were already there. "They kept to themselves and didn't bother anybody," Reynolds said.
Family members, who said they had no knowledge of problems between the couple, have repeatedly tried to reach him, but to no avail. "When we call their phone, it goes straight to voicemail,'' Barnhill said.
Barnhill said their cousin Kimberly loved to sing. Peyton, they said, loved to build things with their father. Them aunt - Doris Jean Hutcheson - would do anything for anybody.
"They were sweet. I don't understand who could have done it and why," they said. "I don't think it was my uncle. We're just puzzled. We don't know where my uncle is or who would have him."
"Whoever did it better hope the cops find them before the family does,'' they said Sunday night.
Doris Hutcheson's family members declined comment this afternoon.
The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information about their location is asked to call the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office at 205-325-1450 or Crime Stoppers at 205-254-7777.

Plymouth Argyle have re-signed their former goalkeeper Luke McCormick on a one-year deal.
The 29-year-old, who was released by League Two club Oxford United earlier this week, had been
McCormick was sacked by Argyle in 2008 after causing the death of two children in a car crash.
They served about half of a seven years and four months jail term, but
They and made 15 appearances for the club.
Luke McCormick Played 157 games for Plymouth Argyle
Made their debut in a 0-0 draw with Rochdale in May 2001
Their last Argyle game was a 1-0 loss at Wolves in May 2008
"Although Luke made a dreadful mistake with unthinkable consequences, they have served their time and is totally remorseful," said Argyle chairperson James Brent.
"While I respect others who have alternative views, from a moral standpoint, the board and I think Luke is entitled to rehabilitation.
"John Sheridan wanted to sign them and the club is totally supportive of that," Brent added.
The club says McCormick will also donate a 'significant sum' to a local children's charity and donate time to support it.
Meanwhile the club have also re-signed their longest-serving player Paul Wotton.
The 35-year-old has agreed a one-year extension to their deal and will work with the club's youth academy.
They have made 475 appearances for the club, the third-highest in Argyle history, and also had spells at Southampton and Yeovil Town.
"I'm like every other player - I want to play in the first team on a Saturday, and I will be doing everything I can to get in the team," they told the club website.
"At the same time, I have got a role in the academy which I am looking forward to.

ROME (Reuters) - Harry's Bar, the famed Venice watering hole where Ernest Hemingway held court over hearty food and stiff martinis, is offering a discount to “poor” Americans suffering from a weak dollar and subprime blues.

The decision by the owner of the restaurant, one of the most expensive even when the U.S. currency is strong, underscores the growing concern about the weak dollar among tourism operators in Italy and elsewhere in Europe.
A sign posted outside the restaurant at the weekend reads:
“Harry's Bar of Venice, in an effort to make the American victims of subprime loans happier, has decided to give them a special 20 percent discount on all items of the menu during the short term of their recovery.”
When the euro was introduced as the continent's common currency in 2002, a dollar bought about 1.10 euros. Today it gets about 64 euro cents, making prices seem astronomically high for most Americans.
“Since the start of January, we noticed a drop in (American) customers of between five and 10 percent and now that we are in April its looks really frightening,” Arrigo Cipriani, 76, Harry's owner, told Reuters by phone from Venice on Monday.
ENIT, Italy's national tourism board, said in a report this month that the “strong devaluation of the dollar compared to the European currency and signs of a recession are currently the greatest obstacle to American tourism toward Europe.”
Harry' Bar was founded in 1931 when Giuseppe Cipriani, a bartender at a Venice hotel, opened it with money an American named Harry Pickering had given them to pay off a loan.
They named the bar and their first son Arrigo (Italian for Harry) — the current owner — in Pickering's honor.
Hemingway made Harry's Bar their Venice headquarters. They mentioned it in “Across the River and Into the Trees,” which was published in 1950 and which they wrote on the lagoon island of Torcello while living in an inn owned by the Cipriani family.
Cipriani, whose family company owns high-end restaurants and food shops in New York, Venice, Hong Kong, London and Sardinia, says even well-heeled clients look for discounts.
“You would be surprised how people like to have a discount on their bill whether they are rich or poor,” they said, adding that a full meal with wine at their Venice restaurant could set someone back more than 200 euros ($314.5).
Cipriani, who said the discount will apply only to the restaurant part of the tab and not the bar, said Americans in Venice need not bring their passports to their restaurant in order to get a discount.
“We will judge by the accent and if we make a mistake, we will give a 20 percent discount to the English as well,” they said.
Gravity and the gravitational field
Geophysicists utilize slight variations in gravitational force to characterize the mass of subsurface features. Particularly useful in petroleum exploration, subtle gravitational field differences can help identify solid subsurface plutonic bodies or fluid filled reservoirs.
1n 1687, English physicist Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) published a law of universal gravitation in their important and influential work Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). In its simplest form, Newton's law of universal gravitation states that bodies with mass attract each other with a force that varies directly as the product of their masses and inversely as the square of the distance between them. This mathematically elegant law, however, offered a remarkably reasoned and profound insight into the mechanics of the natural world because it revealed a cosmos bound together by the mutual gravitational attraction of its constituent particles. Moreover, along with Newton's laws of motion, the law of universal gravitation became the guiding model for the future development of physical law.
Newton's law of universal gravitation was derived from German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler's (1571–1630) laws of planetary motion, the concept of "action-at-a-distance," and Newton's own laws of motion. Building on Italian astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei's (1564–1642) observations of falling bodies, Newton asserted that gravity is a universal property of all matter. Although the force of gravity can become infinitesimally small at increasing distances between bodies, all bodies of mass exert gravitational force on each other. Newton extrapolated that the force of gravity (later characterized by the gravitational field) extended to infinity and, in so doing, bound the universe together.
Newton's law of gravitation, mathematically expressed as F= (G)(m 1 m 2 ) /r2, stated that the gravitational attraction between two bodies with masses m 1 and m 2 was directly proportional to the masses of the bodies, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between the centers of the masses. Accordingly, a doubling of one mass resulted in a doubling of the gravitational attraction while a doubling of the distance between masses resulted in a reduction of the gravitational force to a fourth of its former value. Nearly a century passed, however, before English physicist Henry Cavendish (1731–1810) was to determine the missing gravitational constant (G) that allowed a reasonably accurate determination of Earth's actual gravitational force.
The force exerted by a gravitational field on a body, such as forces produced by Earth's gravitational field, is called the weight of the body. The weight of a body is equal to the product of its mass m and the acceleration due to gravity g, (w = mg). Weight should not be confused with mass, which is an intrinsic property of matter that is not altered by an change in the gravitational field (i.e., the mass of an object on Earth is the same in the lower gravity environment on the Moon ).
Newton's second law states that the net force F acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object m multiplied by its acceleration a (F = ma). Freely falling bodies experience acceleration (g) due to Earth's gravitational field. The force of this field is directed towards the center of Earth. By applying Newton's second law to freely falling bodies, with a = g and F = w, the weight of the body is given as w = mg. Because weight depends upon the gravitational field, it varies with geographical location. Because g decreases with increasing distance from the center of Earth, bodies weigh less at higher altitudes than at sea level. Because of this, weight, unlike mass, is not an inherent property of a body.
The value of "g" (9.82 m/s2) is the average measure of the strength of Earth's gravitational field (i.e., the acceleration produced on a mass regardless of the composition of the mass.) The value of "g" can vary locally depending on subsurface mass (e.g., plutonic bodies) and so the value (9.82 m/s2) is an average. Using "g" the gravitational field can then be expressed as force per kilogram exerted by Earth's gravitational field. Although Earth's gravitational field extends to infinity (i.e., as do all other objects with mass in the universe, Earth's gravitational field affects all other entities with mass), because the magnitude of the force of gravity declines as the square of the distance between objects, the force drops dramatically as objects move away from Earth.
Astronauts orbiting Earth do not experience weightlessness because of a lack of gravity. Rather, the apparent weight-lessness in a decreased Earth gravity environment results from uniform acceleration toward Earth in such a way that the spacecraft and all objects in it are constantly falling toward Earth in a manner akin to the objects inside a free-falling elevator. In order to achieve orbit, rockets must be powerful enough to achieve escape velocity, the velocity that, at a minimum, allows their vertical "fall" to match the falling away of Earth spherical surface beneath them. Earth's escape velocity measures 6.959 mi/s (11.2 km/s)—more than 25,000 mph.
Weight is usually expressed in pounds or grams. Although weight and mass are not synonymous terms, they are often used interchangeably. One concept associated with weight is Archimedes' principle that states that a body immersed in a fluid is acted upon by a force equal and opposite in direction to the weight of the displaced fluid. This principle explains the buoyancy of ships, as well as the rise of helium filled balloons.
Another important property associated with weight is specific gravity. The specific gravity of a material is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of that substance to the weight of an equal volume of water . For example, because of the salt, the specific gravity of a saltwater solution is greater than one. This high specific gravity gives saltwater its large buoyancy power because the weight of the volume displaced by an object in the ocean is larger than the weight of the volume displaced by the same object in freshwater .
The molecular weight of a substance is usually expressed in atomic mass units which is exactly 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom .
Although Newton's law of gravitation offered no fundamental explanatory mechanism for gravity, it's usefulness of explanation lies in a higher level of cause and effect. An explanation of gravity continues to elude physicists. The two great theories of modern physics—relativity theory and quantum theory—explain gravity in very different ways. According to relativity theory , gravity is a consequence of the fusion of space and time. Quantum theory proposes that graviton particles (as of yet undiscovered) act as bosons (carriers) of gravitational force.

University student charged under 'revenge porn' laws for allegedly targeting teen girl
Updated
An Illawarra university student has become one of the first people to be charged under New South Wales' new "revenge porn" laws after allegedly using images sent to them to procure sex with a teenage girl.
Jarrad Pavric, 20, appeared in Wollongong Local Court on Thursday charged with two counts of threatening to distribute intimate content without consent, intentionally distributing images without consent and procuring a child for unlawful sexual activity.
Police alleged Pavric got a 14-year-old girl to send them intimate pictures of themselves via social media.
They then allegedly threatened to publish them online if they did not perform sexual acts on him.
In a statement of facts tendered during a bail application, police alleged Pavric received photos of the girl and then asked them for sex.
When they refused, Pavric allegedly told them if they wanted them to delete their pictures from their phone they had to come to their house and perform a sex act on him.
Days later, Pavric allegedly sent two of the pictures to another person, saying: "I was going to post these photos on Instagram."
Police were informed on Tuesday and began an investigation. Computers, mobile phones and electronic equipment at their Horsley home were seized for forensic examination.
Pavric was arrested at 3pm on Wednesday and charged at Lake Illawarra Police Station.
In opposing bail, police said the alleged victim's parents were concerned Pavric would contact them
Further, Pavric would likely face a custodial sentence if found guilty.
Imad Abdul-Karim granted Pavric bail on the condition they live at an address in Horsley, not use the internet and only have one mobile phone, which police can inspect up to five times a week.
An interim apprehended violence order was also made.
Pavric will reappear in Wollongong Local Court in November.
Laws criminalise revenge porn
Laws to criminalise the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, known as "revenge porn" came into effect in August.
Offenders who shared or threatened to share explicit images without consent face up to three years in jail and an $11,000 fine.
The penalties apply to adults and those under 18 and cover photos and videos of a person's private parts or a person engaging in a private act like undressing, showering or having sex.
Courts can also issue "take down" orders requiring offenders to delete or destroy images taken or distributed without consent.
"It's not the victim's fault when a revenge porn image goes viral. Victims might have consented to the image being taken in a private moment, but that doesn't mean they want it shared with the world," NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman said in August.
Research by RMIT University indicates that one in five Australians have experienced image-based abuse.

“I continue to be amazed by our bodies' ability for self-repair. Our bodies want to be healthy, if we would just let them. That's what these new research articles are showing: even after years of beating yourself up with a horrible diet, your body can reverse the damage, open back up the arteries and even reverse the progression of some cancers. So it's never too late to start exercising and never too late to start eating healthier.” Michael Greger, MD
A graduate of Cornell and Tufts University School of Medicine, Dr. Greger has published in a litany of scientific journals, testified before Congress and lectured at countless symposiums and institutions, including the Conference on World Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. They were even an expert witness in the infamous Oprah Winfrey meat defamation lawsuit and has appeared all over television on shows like Dr. Oz and The Colbert Report.
By day, Michael Greger, MD, FACLM can be found crafting high level policy initiatives as Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for the Humane Society of the U.S. But more often than not he's traipsing the globe, hopping from podium to deliver one of the hundreds of lectures they serve up annually.
By night, Dr. Greger scours thousands of medical journals in search of the world's best, most objective nutrition research to bring you free videos and articles every single day as chief wizard behind NutritionFacts.org– the world's most authoritative, non-profit online destination for all things nutrition, health and disease prevention.
If you've never before visited this site, I highly suggest you check it out immediately. A comprehensive clearinghouse that inspects every imaginable facet of nutrition and health, NutritionFacts.org features hundreds of impeccably researched, easily understandable and straight to the point videos — always my first stop when I want to get to the bottom of any question I have about food, diet and disease.
Apparently Dr. Greger doesn't sleep. Because amidst all of this, they still found time to write a new book that hits booksellers everywhere this week. But How Not To Die isn't just any book — it's a straight up game changing must read. Clocking in at over 600 pages, it's an exhaustive, heavily researched, encyclopedic examination of how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can help prevent and even reverse the 15 top causes of premature death in America.
Not only has Dr. Greger delivered a ground-breaking tome for the ages, 100% of fees and proceeds they receive from speaking and book sales are donated to charity.
Quite a powerful testament to this man's level of selfless service to humanity.
If you are a long-time listener, you know Dr. G and I go way back. They were one of my very first guests on the RRP. Now he's back to talk more about their life, their research, and How Not To Die – a subject I think we can all get behind.
Specifics covered include:
the core idea behind How Not To Die
the daily dozen foods to focus on
the fifteen leading causes of death
confirmation bias in nutritional research
conflicts of interest in scientific studies
independent studies & objective criticism
reconciling reductionism with holistic analysis
auto-immune disorders
organic vs. non-organic foods
GMOs and excessive pesticides
evolution of the food pyramid
how to reward doctors for keeping people healthy
Dr. Greger is one of my very favorite people on the planet. I'm delighted to share their message with you today and I sincerely hope you enjoy the listen.

In what police described as a horrific tragedy, a 9-year-old boy was shot and killed in their family's Mattapan apartment by their 14-year-old brother Friday morning, anguishing neighbors and prompting a plea from the city's mayor for residents to surrender unwanted guns.
Just before noon on a school day, the older brother was playing with a gun when it fired, striking the younger boy in the chest, police said. The boy was rushed to Boston Medical Center, where they were pronounced dead.
The older boy left their Morton Street home, but was apprehended nearby still carrying the weapon police said was used to shoot their brother.

“He was very remorseful for what they did,” William Evans, the city's police commissioner, said at the scene, adding that the boy appeared to have panicked. “I think they realized the gravity of what they had done.”

The victim is the youngest person killed in the city since 2010, when 2-year-old Amanihotep Smith was shot in their mother's arms after a home invasion in Mattapan.
David L Ryan/Globe Staff Police investigating the fatal shooting of a Mattapan boy outside the Morton Street home where they were shot.
The mother of the boys was not home at the time of the shooting, Evans said. It was not clear why they were not at school. The younger boy, found by police lying on their back in the hallway of their home, was in the fourth grade at James W. Hennigan Elementary School in Jamaica Plain.
The school notified parents of the shooting in a voice mail and counselors were on hand for students.
Authorities charged the 14-year-old with unlawful gun possession and involuntary manslaughter, saying that they were handling the gun recklessly when it fired.

There was no evidence that anyone else in the home knew they had the gun, they said.
Authorities were quick to call the shooting an apparent accident, but homicide detectives continued their investigation Friday.
Last June, police responded to the same address for a domestic violence report in which the 14-year-old allegedly slapped their younger brother in the face and threw them to the ground. Their older teenage sister told police that they then pushed their mother to the ground and threatened to kill them
In a police report on that visit, the sister stated the brother had “been very aggressive toward the family lately and that this was not the first time the police were called to their residence.”
The mother also told police that it was “not the first time” they had problems with their 14-year-old, according to the report. The older brother was charged with assault in the June incident.

Neighbors and police also said that officers had been previously called to the three-decker on Morton Street because of loud parties and, in one case, a shooting.
A law enforcement official briefed on Friday's shooting said that “everything we are looking at it indicates it was accidental.”
“The brother was playing with the gun, pulled the magazine, and there was one bullet in the chamber,” said the official, who spoke on the condition their name not be published.
Authorities were attempting to determine how the brother acquired the gun and whether they knew a bullet was in the chamber.
The name of the older boy was withheld by authorities because of their age. Investigators also did not release the name of the victim.
Evans said they arrived at the home just as emergency responders were rushing the younger child to an ambulance.
“To see a young boy, curly hair, with so much life to live,'' Evans said, their voice wavering with emotion. “Having three children myself, it just breaks your heart.”
Evans said the boys' mother was “extremely distraught.”
In a prepared statement Friday, the Department of Children and Families, the state's child welfare agency, declined to say whether it had any involvement with the family.
At the scene, Mayor Martin J. Walsh called the death a tragedy and urged residents to turn in guns to police.
“A 14-year-old should not have access to a gun,” they said. “There are far too many guns in our streets.”
“I'm calling for the community to step up to the plate and report these guns. Parents, siblings — we need to get these guns off the street,” they added.
Daniel Conley, the Suffolk district attorney, said investigators would work to determine how the boy acquired the weapon.
“In the meantime, I want to make something crystal clear: If you know about an illegal firearm in this city, help us prevent another tragedy like this one,” they said.
The 14-year-old was scheduled to be arraigned Monday in a closed hearing in juvenile court.
US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz also said members of the community need to do more to track down guns in their homes and turn them over to police.
“You have to get the message out into the community that we share a sense of responsibility,” they said.
“The solution is not just law enforcement. The community has to be involved, do what they can, and cooperate with police.”
State Representative Gloria Fox, who represents Roxbury, visited the home with a grief counselor, saying the tragedy underscores the need for stricter gun control measures.
“I don't know where that gun came from, but it should not have been in that young boy's hands,'' they said. “We've got to stop the trafficking of guns into our neighborhoods.”
In a neighborhood long plagued by gun violence, the death of a boy so young touched off a wave of grief and anger.
“Why would someone so young have a gun?” said Debra Brown, 54. “Why weren't they in school? Where were the parents? It shouldn't have to be this way.”
On Morton Street, residents decried the easy availability of guns, even for young teenagers, and the fear that pushes them to buy weapons.
“The sad thing is it's so easy to get a gun in Boston,” said Nelson Martinez, 43. “He probably didn't have to look very hard.''
Cosandra Harrigan, 44, said there have been numerous shootings in the neighborhood in recent years, including one last summer in front of the same Morton Street home.
“Last summer they had a wild party, and somebody got shot in front of the same house, too, and died,'' said Harrigan. “I've been here 17 years, and I've witnessed a lot of shootings.''
“That's the second shooting that has happened here,'' said Ebony Rhodes, 20, of Dorchester. That's crazy. It's shocking.”
The shooting recalled for some the 2007 death of Liquarry Jefferson Jr., a first-grader who was shot to death by their 7-year-old cousin while they were playing with a gun left inside their apartment by a relative.
Jefferson was 8 when they were shot on June 24 of that year. They and their cousin had found a loaded 9mm handgun in the dresser drawer of Jayquan McConnico, an older cousin.
Despite the cold weather Friday, neighbors gathered near the home where the shooting occurred, saying they were struggling to come to grips with what had happened.
Celia Gabadon, 72, said that police are doing what they can and that change has to come from the community.
“Police are doing a good job,” they said. “We are to blame.”
Correction: Because of incorrect information provided to the Globe, an earlier version of this story misstated the age of the victim. They were 9.

A bill introduced in the Minnesota House on Thursday would keep any videos recorded by police body cameras private, alarming those who say it would hinder efforts to hold police accountable.
Sponsors say the cameras are likely to record embarrassing personal information about people dealing with police at extremely traumatic points in their lives.
But others say if the videos are kept secret it defeats the purpose of the cameras, which is to record how officers interact with the public — and serve as a check on police abusing their authority.
A handful of police departments across Minnesota already are using body cameras.
• November 2014: Minneapolis police start using body cams
State law requires body camera video to be accessible to the public. But some lawmakers say it should be private to protect the public from embarrassing situations.
"You could have a half naked housewife that's been beat up with a bloody face, half naked kids running around," said state Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center. "You could have a gun collection. That information needs to remain private."
Cornish, chair of the House Public Safety Committee, introduced a bill that would classify the video from body cameras as private data accessible only to law enforcement and the subjects of the video. They said privacy concerns and the cost of redacting data are the reasons to keep the videos confidential.
"Naturally, it's going to be something other than public," Cornish said. "You aren't going to have huge amounts of footage of innocent people, put into storage or a hard drive and allow people to walk in and get it."
Cornish's bill also requires police departments to destroy any data not involved in an active or inactive criminal investigation after 90 days.
• In Minnesota: Police data show many circumstances lead to deadly force
State Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, agrees that body camera video should be private. Latz, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Legislature needs to act with urgency because some police departments already are using body cameras.
"I don't think we have much of a choice but to struggle to get our arms around it," Latz said. "Here's a case where technology is out a little bit ahead of public policy."
The Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association supports Cornish's bill. But several groups are lining up in opposition.
Ben Feist, legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, said body cam video should be public. They said that's the only way the public will know if a police officer crosses the line.
"Our concern is that if you make it too private, the whole idea that we are able to use the body cameras to watch the police, to turn this around and say this is surveillance of law enforcement, really falls by the wayside," they said.
Feist said he's open to keeping some video private, including footage taken in a private residence or pictures of a police informant.
But Minnesota Newspaper Association lobbyist Mark Anfinson said all the video should be public. Anfinson, who has represented several news organizations including MPR News, said there already are privacy protections in place that address Cornish's concerns.
"The more you talk about this and think through the ramifications of what sort of video may actually be acquired, it does get complex," Anfinson said. "But you know what? You can't let complexity paralyze you."
Others worry over what police will do with the video. State Rep. Peggy Scott, R-Andover, said police could look up, copy and share certain video. Scott points to a case where a state Department of Natural Resources employee looked up their driver's license data and that of others.
"It's not a good feeling to know that you're the subject of something like that" Scott said. "I don't distrust law enforcement but I know human nature."
Lawmakers hope they can compromise before the end of session. But some are already suggesting a commission may be established to study the issue if no agreement is reached by May.

University of Kentucky quarterback Jalen Whitlow, who has started 15 games in two seasons, is transferring to play their preferred position elsewhere, the school announced Wednesday.
Coach Mark Stoops said they met with Whitlow on Tuesday and broke down the Wildcats' quarterback situation, with first-year student Drew Barker and sophomore Patrick Towles, both former four-star recruits, having drawn high praise from the coaching staff this spring.
Stoops asked Whitlow to move to wide receiver, but the junior said they want to continue playing quarterback at another school.

SPRING FOOTBALL: QB Drew Barker impresses coaches, teammates at scrimmage
"We respect Jalen and their decision as we want the best for him," Stoops said in a news release. "I thank Jalen for their contributions to the team during their time at Kentucky. I want everyone to understand how hard they have worked and the effort they have given since our staff has been here."
Whitlow threw for 1,834 yards, rushed for 663 yards and accounted for 19 touchdowns in two seasons. They split time as a sophomore with Maxwell Smith, who made starts in UK's other games. Smith, who's recovering from an injury this spring, is also in the quarterback race with Reese Phillips.
"I appreciate the University of Kentucky and what the coaching staff and administration have done for me," Whitlow said in the news release. "I also thank the community and the fan support I have received here. I wish the coaches and my teammates the best of luck."
Whitlow will finish this semester at UK before transferring for their final two years of eligibility.
Stoops said he's disappointed that Whitlow's leaving, "but ultimately we want to throw the football."
The line was snaking out around the building, and yet even more people were arriving. It was 10am, and neither hot nor cold. Five people ahead of me, Captain America was patiently holding their son's hand. Two boys dressed as stormtroopers ran past.
I didn't know there were this many people in Adelaide.
Last weekend Adelaide played host to the first Oz Comic-Con. Organisers predicted 5000 attendees on the first day. They were very, very wrong.
There was anime, comic books, board games, computer games, vast amounts of every kind of geeky merchandise you could ever want, all of which was scattered in amongst the guests, panels and special events, all of which which were happening throughout the day.
Attendees included couples, teenagers, reluctant drag-alongs and families – including baby Hulk and baby Yoda who stared around peacefully from inside their prams. There were also an inordinate number of people dressed as Link.
There were costume societies, Firefly societies, and stalls where you could play Yu Gi Oh. In one corner there was a life-sized Tardis – metres away from the functioning remote controlled R2D2 which was getting more photo time than the man dressed convincingly as Rorschach. One girl dressed in a gas mask looked as though she'd stepped straight out of Doctor Who's ‘The Empty Child'.
There was also a strong hint of The Big Bang Theory everywhere – from t-shirt stalls having entire sections devoted to Sheldon-themed t-shirts to the pop culture quiz requiring a contestant to sing ‘Soft Kitty' in its entirety. I lost count after spotting 23 men wearing ‘Bazinga!' t-shirts.
The full list of guests can be seen here, but the main drawcards for me were Sean Astin and Jewel Staite.
In their (extremely crowded) panel, Astin recounted their time on the Lord of the Rings set, and then spoke fondly of all the characters he'd played in their long career. Some very complex, some…less so. They explained how irrespective of film quality, they loved each of their roles because of what they represented to them in terms of where they were in their life when they played the role. When asked what they thought of them, they liked to think of them in terms of how they would all interact in a room together. They bantered well with the crowd, and, right near the end cracked out at least one “Mr Frodo!”
Jewel Staite's panel the next day was even more crowded, again underscoring how sad it is that Firefly got axed. As a result of the unprecedented success of the event, seats ran out half an hour before the panel started. However, at least fifty people stood, craning around the side of the bleachers for the entire hour, listening to Staite talk about their time on Stargate Atlantis, as they joked about their food blog and about Nathan Fillion's undying plans to resurrect Firefly. They handled some left field questions very well (“hey, so, how did you gain weight to play Kaylee?”), always veering them towards somewhere interesting or funny.
While the event was great, the fact that the numbers had been very badly misjudged did mar some of the events. Panels didn't accommodate anywhere near enough to match interest, and some people waited in line for close to two hours in order to gain entrance to the event itself. However, as the inaugural event, I guess this is to be expected – things to be ironed out before next year.
The next stop for Oz Comic-Con is Melbourne, held over June 30th and July 1st. It probably won't be worth going to be though, as guests will include such small time names as Patrick Stewart, Armin Shimerman, Tia Carrera and Stan Lee.
…Bazinga.

My fiancee's great uncle died last night. They were 89 and, as far as I know, not much of a Bears fan, having been born out of state and spending much of their life out of the country.
But their death has me thinking about the importance of Bears pride.
Not talent.
Not wins.
Pride.
2013 to 2014 was arguably the roughest two-year stretch Bears fans ever endured. I was in my sports fan prime in 1997 and 1998, back-to-back 4-win seasons. That was statistically worse but emotionally tolerable. We knew those teams were bad.
I've heard all about the Abe Gibron years and Jim Dooley's 1-13 debacle in 1969, and I'm sure back-to-back losing seasons under Papa Bear in 1952 and 1953 were no walk in the park.
But Trestman & Emery turning a 10-6 near-playoff club into a sluggish 8-8 squad and then a burning-building 5-11 walking nightmare tops them all.
The issue wasn't just the losing, or even, as Rashied Davis called it, the regression. It was the sense that as those 32 games wore on, players did not want to be part of it. Like they were arrestees on a perp walk shielding their faces from gluttonous cameras.
The worst moment of the two years -- and this is saying a lot -- came during the 2013 season finale, when the Bears had a chance to make the playoffs by knocking out Green Bay, and the defense allowed the Pack to score on an offensive fumble recovery because they seemingly decided that, Eh, this play is dead.
What hurt most for me wasn't just the seven points (in a game we lost by five) but the image of the Bears defenders standing listlessly around a live ball. It was shocking, since we so often see players scoop what is obviously a dead ball and run it more than 50 yards to cross the goal line even after the whistle has chirped repeatedly.
Watching ex-Bears tweets that day (and WCG commenters), I wasn't alone.
@aotheprince93 @JerryAzumah @spiceadams best thing Lovie instilled in us who played D for him, pick up the rock! The ball is the game! — Mike Brown (@21MB30) December 29, 2013
I run the gamut of emotions on that play, but guess what: that would NEVER happen to a Lovie Smith coached defense. #Bears — Hunter Hillenmeyer (@hthill) December 29, 2013
Whether the guys on the field for that Boykin play -- including Julius Peppers and Lance Briggs -- lacked at worst pride and at best awareness, it was a play that epitomized the disintegration of structure. No matter what else happened with the Bears from 2004 to 2012, fans always knew that a Lovie Smith-coached team would bring the heat defensively.
We would create takeaways (Lovie's preferred term -- not "turnovers"). We would hit with ferocity. We would, in the immortal words of Bill Cowher, rush the quarterback.
In other words, we would take pride in the basics. We lost that the past two years. We've got it back now.
I wrote two weeks ago about "hinge games" and "vision games." Hinge games are games upon which a season rotates -- losses and wins that determine your finish.
Vision games are games through which you see the future.
Time will tell if these past two weeks, a 2-point loss to Denver and a 4-point win over the Packers, were hinge games, but they were most certainly vision games. And what I saw was not simply talent, competitiveness and coaching, but pride.
That pride filled this tweet from Kyle Long, psyched up about the importance of playing the Packers:
Got dressed at Halas Hall, ate dinner at Lombardi's Steakhouse. Tomorrow the Chicago Bears play the Green Bay Packers. Football. — Kyle (@Ky1eLong) November 26, 2015
And after the game, the pride rang in the words of first-year Bear and captain Pernell McPhee, who took umbrage with the Packers scheduling the Bears for Brett Favre Night:
"This game, it can get real personal. When you (win), it's all fun, and when you lose, it's very personal. ... (Rodgers) said they loved beating up on us. Who do they think we are? We ain't that team of last year or two years ago, three years ago. It's 2015 Chicago. A lot of guys took it personally, especially when somebody said 'I love beating up on your brother.' I ain't going to let nobody come beat my little brother up."
The pride was there in the locker room, as the Bears celebrated not just a W but a W over the Packers, as evidenced by these IG's from Christian Jones and Josh Bellamy:

Those two videos feature the 60-year-old John Fox up in the mix (As Bellamy wrote, "We Got Coach Fox Wit Us"), dancing with their ecstatic team. As Dane covered after the Packers game, (and as Adam Jahns details here) this really is Fox's team.
It's also a team that is 5-6, with an outside chance to make the playoffs. Yet even if they watch the 2015 playoffs from home, this will forever be remembered as a restorative season. I know we have five games to go, and anything can happen -- including, mathematically, another 5-11 year. Perhaps they'll make me eat my words.
Somehow I doubt it. From Pace on down, this team feels different, certainly than the last two years. I love the new vets on defense, all of them leaders, McPhee and Rolle and Porter and Acho. I love Cutler's smarts and Forte's resilience. I love Langford's speed and Zach Miller's surprises. I love Robbie Gould's steady greatness and Kyle Long's leadership and Willie Young's enthusiasm and Alshon Jeffery's everything.
Not every season ends in a championship. Hell, in Chicago, we've gone 30 years without one.
But every week, the players play and the fans hunker down to root-root-root for the home team, and hopefully when we meet our end, wrinkled 89-year-olds with passion to spare, we'll recall not just the seasons that gave the city a trophy but seasons that gave the city life. And we will sit, smiling, quiet, cheering, ready to go, and say this was our team.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He's surrounded themselves with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he's being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.
Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that they have no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” they tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he's been lying to us the whole time.
An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what they received as a result of interaction with Russian business people. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.
Trump has reaped huge profits off their business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”
The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while they turn a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin themselves has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.
The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.
“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don't read books. They don't go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?
When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow's annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, they could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We'll be looking at that, yeah we'll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.
These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put their personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it's that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow them and their Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

Mohammad Ibrahim Mohammad Al-Sahlawi (Arabic: محمد ابراهيم محمد السهلاوي‎; born 10 January 1987) is a Saudi Arabian footballer who plays as a striker for Al-Nassr and the Saudi Arabia national team. Al-Sahlawi won the best player of the league twice in a row in 2013–14 and 2014–15
Club career [ edit ]
Al-Sahlawi was 17 years old when their talent started to become clear, during their participation in the "Karkiz" Championship which led to Adel Body (the administrative of Al-Qadisiya Handball) registering them in Al-Qadisiya, so they signed for SR40,000 and a car. After only two seasons, specifically in the 2006–07 season (when Yasser Al-Qahtani moved to Al-Hilal with the largest deal ever at that time), Sahlawi broke into the first team squad so they had to assume responsibility of the Al-Qadisiya attack alongside their teammate Yousef Al-Salem. Following administration issues, Al-Sahlawi experienced a difficult period where they were relegated to the bench, while at the same time they were leading the Saudi Olympic team.
Following Al-Qadisiya's relegation to the first division and the departure of most of the star players in the team. Al-Sahlawi was lent to Al-Fateh and played five matches scoring one goal. Despite other offers, they returned to Al-Qadisiya. In their return season, they scored 18 goals and registered 8 assists. At the end of the season, they signed a new deal with Al-Qadisiya for three years for a contract worth SR3 million. They ended the 2008 season as the Top Goalscorer in Saudi First Division.
They moved to Al-Nassr in 2009 for SR32 million ($8 million), breaking Yasser Al-Qahtani record transfer as the largest deal in Saudi football history.
In their first season with Al-Nassr, Al-Sahlawi scored 21 goals in 36 matches and received the Young Player of the Year award from STC.
In 2015, they were selected as one of the world's best top goalscorers by the IFFHS.[3]
In 29 March 2018 it was confirmed that they will spend three weeks training with Manchester United in order to sharpen up their game ahead of the World Cup in Russia.[4]
International career [ edit ]
Youth [ edit ]
Al-Sahlawi scored their first goal for the national team in the 2006 AFC Youth Championship against Iraq U-20 in the 52nd minute. The game ended in a draw with a score of 2–2. Their second came against Malaysia U-20 within 13 minutes, and they won with a score of 2–0, although they lost in the quarter-finals against Japan U-20 1 goal to 2.
Senior [ edit ]
On 3 September 2015, Al-Sahlawi scored their first senior hat-trick, in a 7–0 defeat of Timor-Leste in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier. They scored another 5 goals on 17 November 2015 in a 10-0 drubbing of Timor-Leste.[5]
In May 2018 they were named in Saudi Arabia's preliminary squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.[6]

North Dakota bill would make it illegal to wear masks in public Copyright by WCMH - All rights reserved Video
BISMARCK, ND (KFYR/NBC News) A bill before North Dakota's House Judiciary Committee would make wearing a mask in public illegal at most times.
For months during the summer, Dakota Access Pipeline protesters used masks to conceal their identities while protesting.
"If you're going to express your First Amendment rights and you have no intention of committing a crime, then why do you need your face covered?" state Rep. Todd Porter argued during debate over the bill.
Opponents say bill specifically focuses on occasions when masks would most likely be used as an expression of "First Amendment" ideas and would be declared unconstitutional in federal court.
"Although the mask bill provides at least 8 exemptions that would not criminalize a North Dakotan who wears a mask or hood in public, it specifically forecloses the wearing of masks, at the exact times when a mask would most likely express First Amendment ideas," said Jennifer Cook, ACLU of North Dakota.
Trae Waynes might be the final key that unlocks the Minnesota Vikings defense.
With talent at all three levels of the field, the Vikings defense could sport Pro Bowlers at every major position group on the defense — cornerback Xavier Rhodes, defensive end Everson Griffen and safety Harrison Smith are leading their respective positions as vote-getters while Linval Joseph and Anthony Barr are well-known enough to earn a spot, especially as former Pro Bowlers.
But defenses are not always built on how bright their stars are, instead requiring the consistent performance of the role players around them. The 2010 Vikings sent four defenders to the Pro Bowl and strong cases could have been made for Chad Greenway and Jared Allen, both of whom made the Pro Bowl the following year. Not only that, Pat Williams was playing well despite ending the season at 38 years old.
With all that talent, they ranked 18th in points allowed. Weaknesses at safety — Madieu Williams and Husain Abdullah played at levels far below their peaks in Cincinnati and Kansas City, respectively — and one cornerback spot — Asher Allen — meant that all their pass-rushing and run-stopping prowess wasn't worth much.
The 2017 Vikings defense could have been faced with similar problems. Question marks at safety, nickel corner and left cornerback were legitimate and though it appears that Andrew Sendejo has improved yet again at the position while the rotation of Terence Newman and Mackensie Alexander at the nickel position seems fundamentally sound, the biggest worry might have been the play of Trae Waynes.
With Xavier Rhodes shadowing the offense's top receiver, Waynes has had to deal with the consistent threat of opposing #2s.
Sometimes that's not particularly intimidating — the former Michigan State product ended up locking down Josh Bellamy in Chicago and virtually erased Rashard Higgins against Cleveland. At other times, it's meant going up against Jordy Nelson, Desean Jackson or Martavis Bryant.
For much of the year, teams trusted that matchup more than they trusted their top receiver shadowed by Xavier Rhodes. In the first seven weeks of the season, Trae Waynes was the most targeted defender on the Vikings in pass coverage and the fifth-most targeted cornerback in the NFL, per Pro Football Focus.
The decision to target Waynes worked for offenses, too. They gave up the sixth-most yards per snap in pass coverage and gave up receptions more often in coverage than all but two cornerbacks. When targeted, they allowed a completion rate of 69.4 percent, 11th-worst in the league.
The offense always has the advantage of getting to pick who they attack, meaning that a weakness in the defense can make many of the other players irrelevant, and it seemed like offenses had determined that that weakness was Trae Waynes. Waynes was responsible for 28.9 percent of all the passing yards that the Vikings gave up in the first seven weeks of the season — that's the third-worst rank in the NFL.
Much of this is a credit to the players surrounding Waynes. Having Xavier Rhodes on a team's top receiver is equivalent to turning them from an 80-100 yard-a-game juggernaut to a 45-yard-a-game role player. Harrison Smith is the top safety in the league and the Vikings have generated solid coverage capability from their linebackers.
But Waynes themselves hasn't impressed when targeted — which is why they were among the league leaders in completion rate allowed and why opponents were so comfortable targeting their matchups than they were playing strength to strength and testing their top receivers against Xavier Rhodes.
Since Week 8, however, that's changed pretty significantly.
Above is a chart that gives us a two-game average for both Xavier Rhodes and Trae Waynes. Rhodes has predictably spent most of their time this season in highlight territory among NFL players, Waynes had been below average until the middle of the season.
The markers for 5th percentile, NFL average and 95th percentile represent what the upper tiers, mid-range tiers and lower tiers of cornerback play in two-game stretches looks like, with the top two-game averages looking a lot like Xavier Rhodes' game four to game five result — they allowed four yards in 65 snaps, or 0.06 yards given up per snap in coverage.
Though Rhodes does suffer a little bit in the last two games — which includes a pass to Marvin Jones that feels unevaluable — it's clear that he's been performing at a high level throughout the season while Waynes had been a liability until about the midpoint of the season.
I asked Ian Wharton, who does deep-dive film work on players in the secondary for Bleacher Report, about whether or not they thought there was any improvement from Waynes from their perspective this season.
They thought so, and elaborated on Waynes' technique to that end.
“Waynes has seemed to learn how to mitigate their physical limitations by refining their footwork in coverage,” explained Wharton. “He'll always be stiff in the hips, but he's offset that by taking smaller strides and quicker steps to help them change direction. He's much improved recognizing routes and tendencies, leading to far fewer blown coverages.”
Early in the season, Waynes definitively struggled with recognition and overextension. In Week 1, this snap against Ted Ginn (at the top of the screen) is a good combination of both problems.
Recognition was a somewhat persistent problem, and resulted in either opening the gate too soon or waiting too long to figure out the route pattern, like against Chicago (bottom of the screen).
Those naturally don't represent the totality of snaps — their interception against the Buccaneers was excellent cornerback play — but they do explain why they were targeted so often early in the season.
The improved route recognition and shorter steps show up in the below clip (top of the screen), and when he's in press, he's done a better job of feeling out routes and anticipating receivers.
At the top of the screen in the below clip you can see them keeping a hand on the opposing receiver and staying close with them throughout the route, even as the route breaks inside — an issue they had early in their career and in college.
As a result of this recent improvement in play, their cumulative yards per snap on the season is creeping closer to the league-average of 1.08. Currently, their season average is 1.5 yards, but since Week 8 he's averaged 1.18 yards given up per snap in coverage.
If Trae Waynes has finally improved from liability to asset, the Vikings defense itself can move beyond good to great.

The ANU's Professor Hugh White warns Australia should recast its relationship with the US to avoid being seen as an enemy of China. Picture: Gary Ramage
AUSTRALIA needs to recalibrate its relationship with the US and consider mandatory Asian language studies in schools to better prepare for the rapid rise of China, India and other Asian powers, experts say.
The Australian National University's Hugh White said Julia Gillard's sweeping review of Australia's engagement with Asia should articulate “practical things that can be done” to ensure the nation benefits from the coming “Asian Century”.
The ANU's Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies professor said Australia needed to recast its relationship with the United States to prevent it being seen as an “enemy” of China.

“I think it's a matter of Australia thinking very carefully about the extent to which it supports the US,” Professor White told The Australian Online.
“The US policies are designed to contain China and if we continue to support US policies we won't have the kind of relationship with China that we want.
“China won't buy iron ore from us if it sees Australia as an enemy and that's what's at stake here.”
They said they would be surprised if the government's upcoming white paper didn't recommend the study of Asian languages in schools.
“I think (that) is easy and I would be very surprised that the review doesn't come up with things like that,” Professor White said.
“It would be quite hard to implement practically but it's an easy thing to see that we should be doing. It's just obvious really.”
Julia Gillard yesterday announced that former Treasury secretary Ken Henry would draft a white paper on “Australia in the Asian Century”, to be handed to the government and considered by the cabinet early next year.
The Prime Minister said the paper would probe the domestic, economic and social opportunities and challenges of the Asian century for Australia, and would examine opportunities for a deepening of engagement with Asia in the areas of economy, science and technology, clean energy, education and culture.
Story highlights Trump accused China of creating global warming concept
China says Republicans supported first climate change talks
(CNN) Beijing has turned the tables on US President-elect Donald Trump over their accusation that climate change is a Chinese hoax, claiming that it was the Republican's own party that initiated global warming negotiations.
Trump in 2012 infamously claimed China had created the concept of climate change to make America's manufacturing sector less competitive, dubbing the global phenomenon "bulls**t" and "non-existent."
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012
We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming. China is thrilled with us! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2012
During international climate change talks in Marrakech on Wednesday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin reminded reporters that climate change negotiations began with the UN's International Panel for Climate Change in the 1980s, supported by the US Republican-led administrations under Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.
It was the EU and the US who brought full climate change awareness to China, they said, according to notes sent to CNN by a Chinese delegate traveling with him.
Liu reiterated that climate change was not a hoax and that it was possible for Republicans to continue to support the process of addressing it, the delegate said.

In 2012 and 2013, they made headlines for their long walks from the Maritimes to eastern Canada, raising money for veterans and awareness for post-traumatic stress disorder and now she's getting ready for their final ‘Long Way Home.'
Former soldier Kate MacEachern will walk from Nipawin, Saskatchewan to Chilliwack, British Columbia starting May 1st and she's expected to finish their walk on July 24th for the Wounded Warriors weekend in that community.
The entire path is over 3,000 kilometres.
“It's the longest one we've ever done and step by step, it's the longest one that anyone's actually ever done,” they said.
In 2012, they walked from CFB Gagetown to their hometown of Antigonish, NS, which was 576 kms in full military gear, while raising $20,000 for the military group Soldier On.
The next year, the trek was from Cape Breton to Ottawa, an 1,876 km walk over 45 days for Military Minds.
The 36-year-old's final challenge is scheduled for 85 days, including multiple stops in Alberta, hitting Calgary on June 6th.
“Between training and actual walking kilometres, when I hit Edmonton, I'm going to have passed 10,000 (kms) in three years,” they said.
But their three years of advocacy work has come with serious criticism, including from former soldiers and friends.
During their first venture, they had full backing from the military and then-Minister of Defence Peter MacKay walked with them on their last leg and praised their advocacy work.
“Your compassion, your passion for your friends, your colleagues, your comrades, to undertake this enormous journey on their behalf is such a living tribute to those who wore the uniform, who continue to wear the uniform,” they said at the time.
However in 2013 when they were planning their next trip, MacEachern and their superiors could not come to an agreement on giving them the required time off, as soldiers are allowed 25 days off annually.
The news didn't come as a surprise to MacEachern who said at the time they knew their career was likely over, because they felt the advocacy work was too important to give up.
But their decision angered many in the military, including soldiers who called them a quitter.
“Unfortunately they're still gone,” they said. “We had a lot of people reaching out actually and taking us apart, it got to the point that we had to pull down our website, pull down our Facebook page, pull down everything because we had some very strongly-opinionated people, that had the opinion that I'm a quitter, that I was never a soldier, I was never this, I was never that.”
Despite the backlash, MacEachern holds no ill will towards the military and has no regrets.
“The relationship I have with the military is actually very positive,” they said. “I left my career to continue on with everything I had learned while I was still serving, integrity, morality, standing up for those that can't necessarily stand on their own.”
The goal for this year's walk is hefty, as MacEachern and their team are hoping to raise $100,000 for four charities, including Paws Fur Thought, The Nash Project, Alpha K9 and Wounded Warriors Weekend.
The charities help soldiers and veterans with PTSD, which MacEachern themselves suffers from, stemming from a horrific training accident in 2007 in which they suffered life-threatening injuries, including a broken neck, spinal cord damage and a fractured skull.
Through the recovery, the symptoms, the criticism and the challenge of the walks themselves, MacEachern said the work has been completely fulfilling and although this will be their last journey, they will continue to work on behalf of veterans and soldiers in some capacity.
While she's still figuring out what they and their 12-year-old son Tyler will do after their upcoming venture, the final walk will be a fitting end to the physical portion of their work.
“I lost a fair bit of friends that I had, but the true ones, they stayed right with me,” they said. “My brothers and sisters in Alberta, I cannot wait to get out there.”
“Walking back onto CFB Edmonton, it's going to be the first time I'm going to see them again since I left my career, so it's been a really mixed year, but with everyone that I've lost, I've gained 10.”

While the kidnapping of three Israeli settler youth in early June unleashed two military operations, Operation Brothers' Keeper in the West Bank and Operation Protective Edge in Gaza, what emerged out of the destruction, killing and suffering was the stark realization that Israel has nowhere to go politically. Having deliberately and systematically eliminated the two-state solution, having rendered its occupation a permanent fact of life, unable to extend citizenship to the millions of Palestinians under its control yet equally unable to control them indefinitely, the Netanyahu government is merely lashing out in all directions, as if pure and overwhelming violence will finally “teach” the Palestinians that resistance is futile.
The assault on Gaza was blind atavistic violence on a macro scale. The demolition of three Palestinian apartment blocks in Hebron in early hours of the morning August 18th, “punitive” retaliation against the suspected culprits in the kidnapping and dozens of innocent people, represented pointless violence and suffering on a micro scale, yet a micro event that, multiplied thousands of times over the days, weeks and years of occupation, adds up to what has been called “incremental genocide,” in the sense of destroying a culture and its ability to survive.
And the “punitive” demolitions were pointless and, indeed, counterproductive, even by Israel's own standards. Over the years the Israeli authorities have demolished some 40,000 Palestinian homes, either as “collateral damage” in military incursions (10,000 were destroyed in the latest round of fighting in Gaza) or because, since 1967, Israel has refused to grant building permits to Palestinians, who are then forced to build “illegally” and face demolition. In virtually none of these cases was “security” the reason for demolition, as testified by the fact that none of the owners were ever arrested.
A third category of demolition was “punitive,” the idea being that Palestinians hold their homes sacred, so if a terrorist knew their or their family's home would be destroyed if they or they committed an attack, it would act as an effective deterrent. In fact, it grew out of the British Emergency Regulations of 1945, referred to as “Nazi” regulations befitting totalitarian regimes by none other than Menachem Begin, who tried to have them cancelled during their years in the Knesset. When Prime Minister Moshe Sharett argued that “all laws are laws,” Begin replied:
Not so! There are tyrannical laws, there are unethical laws, there are Nazi laws…. The law which you have employed [the British Emergency Regulations] is Nazi, tyrannical and unethical. An unethical law is also an illegal law…. The existence of such regulations raises questions regarding the fundamental rights of every Israeli citizen.
Nonetheless, hundreds of homes were demolished under this policy in the Occupied Territory, many of them while Begin themselves was in power. Between 2001-2005, according to B'tselem figures, 664 Palestinian homes were demolished as forms of punishment. Some 4,182 innocent people were displaced, many of them neighbors of the suspect's family, and this often on the basis of suspicion alone. This policy of collective punishment without any due process of law was blatantly illegal on both counts.
In February, 2005, a military committee convened by then-Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon and headed by Major General Udi Shani, concluded not only that the policy of punitive demolitions was ineffective in deterring terrorism, but it actually incited additional attacks. The Chief Military Advocate General, Brigadier General Avi Mandelblit, formally announced that the policy would be discontinued.
Until today. Nothing has changed. Mandelblit currently serves as Netanyahu's Cabinet Secretary, Yaalon is the Minister of Defense and no new information has come to light attesting to the effectiveness of punitive demolitions. Yet, despite the fact that the suspects have not yet been arrested, yet alone tried and convicted, Yaalon ordered the demolition of entire apartment buildings housing the Abu Eisha and al-Qawasmi families, and sealed off the home of Marwan Qawasmi, a third suspect, by pumping it full of concrete. Eight families, relatives of two of the kidnapping suspects plus other families, have been rendered homeless, including 22 children. They will not be allowed to rebuild.
The Palestinian families have known for well over a month that the demolitions were imminent. Hamoked, an Israeli rights organization, filed three separate petitions in the Israeli High Court, arguing that “demolishing a family home was a cruel and inhuman act of doubtful efficacy, and that demolishing the homes of the suspects' families constituted a deliberate attack against innocent people, in violation of international humanitarian law, which prohibits collective punishment and destruction of property.” HaMoked also noted that the planned demolitions did not meet the test of proportionality even of the draconian Regulation 119 of the Defense (Emergency) Regulations of 1945, which sanctions such punishment. Finally, HaMoked objected to the demolitions because the Israeli military only “uses the regulation only when the attacker is a Palestinian and the victim is a Jew, demonstrates extreme discrimination.”
The High Court of Justice's rejection of HaMoked's arguments in favor of the Israeli military not only represented a continuation of collective punishment policies and the suppression of basic human rights granted to the Palestinians under international law, but also delivered a blow to the rule of law by setting dangerous precedents and perpetuating a dual-system of law for Israelis and Palestinians. The High Court Justices Yoram Danziger, Issac Amit, and Noam Sohlberg (the last a settler) ruled against all evidence, including that of the IDF itself, that the demolitions were essential to deter acts of violence – particularly given “the significant deterioration of the security situation.”
Of course, as the legal unit representing the Palestinians argued, the ruling is discriminatory in that Israel does not demolish the homes of Jewish terrorists, as evidenced most starkly by the case of those arrested for brutally murdering Mohammed Abu Khdeir, the Palestinian teenager who was kidnapped, forced to drink flammable liquids and burnt alive in early July. Yosef Haim Ben-David, an Israeli from the illegal settlement of Adam in the West Bank, explicitly stated in their confession to the kidnapping and murder that, “We planned to hurt a soul, meaning to kill… to torture them and kill him,” and continued onto say that, “to [let Muhammad Abu Khdeir know] that they were about to die as a sacrifice for the Jews that were murdered.” In reference to the demand to demolish the houses of the Jewish terrorists (an act, it should be noted, that ICAHD would also oppose), Justice Danziger responded, “I'm not overlooking the shocking case of the murder of the teenage boy Mohammed Abu Khdeir, a case that shocked the country and sparked wall-to-wall condemnations, but this was the rarest of rare occurrences.” Rare? Since 2006 there have been 2,100 attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
After 47 years of Israeli military occupation of the West Bank, the Palestinian families were far from shocked at the court's decision or the violent way in which their homes were destroyed or by the considerable collateral damage the explosions caused, leaving more families displaced than what the court has ordered. But it is yet another micro events attesting to the injustice, cruelty and ultimate unsustainability of an Occupation that must end NOW.
Although downloading applications and games directly to our mobile devices has become par for the course for most smartphone users, that might change sometime relatively soon. According to a new report from The Information, Google last year secretly acquired a startup called Agawi, which has previously created certain technologies that would allow users to stream mobile apps and games from the cloud to mobile devices.
Agawi, which stands for “any game, anywhere, instantly”, actually had partnerships with a number of companies before the acquisition. While the acquisition has not been previously reported, TechCrunch explains that Agawi has not only ceased as a live business, but also three former employees of the startup are now listed as working at Google on their respective LinkedIn pages.
This could be Google's big push away from native apps
So why did Google acquire this company? The report states that this could be the search giant's first big step in moving users away from downloading apps natively and bringing them back to using the web for most entertainment purposes, which is where Google makes its money. Not only that, but Google could also use these new technologies to implement a “try before you buy” system with apps, allowing folks to test applications from the cloud before downloading them to their mobile devices. If this system is put in place, it would help developers make more money and help users' phones run much smoother, which would both make Google happy in the long run. Details are pretty scarce regarding the rumored acquisition at the moment, though it absolutely makes sense as to why the company would invest in such technologies.
We might have to wait some time before we see Agawi's tech roll out to devices, and these rumors might not even prove true. Even so, it's still an interesting concept that's worth some speculation.
CIA director John Brennan gave a press conference on Wednesday afternoon defending the agency from the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the CIA's use of torture during the Bush administration. During the speech, Sen. Dianne Feinstein — the leading force behind the report — fact-checked Brennan's assertions. And it was devastating.
For example, when Brennan said it was "unknowable" whether torture was necessary to produce useful intelligence, Feinstein pointed out that the CIA's own records show that the best intel was obtained without torture:
Brennan: "unknowable" if we could have gotten the intel other ways. Study shows it IS knowable: CIA had info before torture. #ReadTheReport — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 11, 2014
When Brennan said the CIA didn't mislead Congress, Feinstein cited CIA sources saying otherwise:
Former CIA General Counsel Preston says CIA provided inaccurate information. #ReadTheReport — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 11, 2014
When Brennan said torture provided "useful intelligence," Feinstein pointed out that — even if that was true — this wasn't nearly enough to justify its use in legal terms:
"Useful information" was not the legal policy standard for EITs. #ReadTheReport — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 11, 2014
Brennan said that tortured detainees provided "useful intelligence" in the hunt for bin Laden. Feinstein points out, correctly, that torture played no role in finding the al-Qaeda chief:
Study definitively proves EITs did not lead to bin Laden. Page 378. #ReadTheReport — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 11, 2014
Feinstein also went off on the CIA's use of torture more generally, dismantling the agency's legal and practical case for the program as well as its attacks on the report's credibility:
No evidence that terror attacks were stopped, terrorists captured or lives saved through use of EITs. #ReadTheReport — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 11, 2014
Executive summary backed up by 6,700-page classified report, 38,000 footnotes. Every fact based on CIA record, cables, etc. #ReadTheReport — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 11, 2014
Numerous abuses never brought to the attention of DOJ or CIA IG. #ReadTheReport — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 11, 2014
The whole feed is pretty devastating.
The rise of the automobile transformed modern society. It changed where we live, what we buy, how we work, and who we call friends. As cars and trucks became commonplace, they created whole classes of jobs and made other professions obsolete.
We are now on the cusp of an equally transformative technological shift in transportation: from vehicles driven by humans to vehicles that drive themselves. The long-term impact of autonomous vehicles on society is hard to predict, but also hard to overstate. The only certainty is that wherever this technology becomes ubiquitous, life will be different.
Google and other companies have been testing self-driving cars for several years now, with good success. These autos process vast amounts of sensory data from on-board radars, cameras, ultrasonic range-finders, GPS, and stored maps to navigate routes through ever more complex and rapidly changing traffic situations without any human involvement.
Consumer use of vehicles with autonomous capabilities, however, is just beginning. Adoption will proceed gradually, through the steady implementation of increasingly intelligent safety and convenience features in otherwise ordinary cars. Some models, for example, already offer hands-off parallel parking, automatic lane-keeping, emergency braking, or even semi-autonomous cruise control. Last October, Tesla Motors made available a software package that enables a limited form of self-driving operation for owners of its vehicles to download.
This trend is likely to continue as such technology matures and as legal and regulatory barriers start to fall. A half-dozen states have already authorized autonomous road vehicles, and more have plans to do so. Discussions are well underway among auto insurers and legislators about how to apportion liability and costs when self-driving cars get into crashes, as they inevitably will—although it is widely expected that these cars will prove to be much safer, on average, than driver-operated cars are today.
There is plenty of room for improvement on that front. In the United States, crashes and collisions claim more than 30,000 lives and cause some 2.3 million injuries annually. Self-driving systems may have bugs—the software that runs them is complicated—but they are free from the myriad distractions and risk-taking behaviors that are the most common causes of crashes today. In the near term, semi-autonomous safety systems that engage only to prevent accidents, but that otherwise leave the driver in charge, will also likely reduce the human cost of driving significantly.
Far more profound transformations will follow once cars and trucks can be trusted to pilot themselves routinely—even with no one inside. Exclusive car ownership could then cease to be the necessity of modern living that it is today for so many people. Shared cars and driverless taxi and delivery services could become the norm. This transition might help the aged and infirm—an increasing fraction of the population—to “age in place” more gracefully. Shared programmable vehicles could reduce the need for local parking structures, reduce congestion by preventing accidents and enabling safe travel at higher speeds and closer following distances, and unlock numerous secondary benefits.
Like every technology, autonomous vehicles will involve drawbacks as well. In some distant day, commercial driving may no longer be a sustainable career. Shared vehicles raise some thorny privacy and security concerns. In some regions, increased affordability of car access may greatly exacerbate traffic and pollution problems rather than easing them. But the many benefits of self-driving cars and trucks are so compelling that their widespread adoption is a question of when, not if.
This is part of a series on the top 10 emerging technologies of 2016, developed in collaboration with Scientific American.
During the entire match Karlović had no break points, while facing only one break point by the opponent
Croatian tennis player Ivo Karlović made a victorious start of the new season, defeating Ukrainian Ilja Marčenko 7-6 (5), 7-6 (0) after an hour and 35 minutes of play in the first round of the Doha ATP Tour, Jutarnji List reported on January 3, 2017.
This was the second encounter by Karlović and Marčenko and the second win for our veteran which they snatched without once breaking the service of the opponent. In fact, during the entire match they had no break points, while facing only one break point by the opponent.
In the first set Karlović won only three points facing Marčenko's service, but in the tie-break they won four points on the Ukrainian's service and compensated for their somewhat weaker serving.
The only break point for Marčenko in the match was in the sixth game of the second set, but Karlović wiggled out of the situation and went on to dominate the tie-break completely, 7-0.
In the second round Karlović will play Russian Karen Hačanov.
By this point, we're all acutely aware that the tech industry has a problem with diversity. The average startup employee is a straight cisgender (cis) white man — and that's a problem not only for your company, but for your product as well. In 28 states, you can still be fired for being LGBTQ . Research has shown that diverse companies outperform their competitors , yet LGBTQ folks are rarely included in diversity conversations. By working together, tech companies and queer folks can create a more inclusive and diverse workplace and tech community. LGBTQ folks' unique struggles should be acknowledged in tech companies, creating an opportunity to move diversity and inclusion forward in our space.
Feeling unwelcome in a traditionally non-queer space
Many queer folks with skills that are valued in the tech community do not apply for positions, even though they would be a good fit for the role. Tech companies still give off an unwelcoming vibe for LBGTQ folks. In order to take that first step and apply for a position at the startup of their dreams, applicants need representation.
The next time you see an About page or a job description making the rounds on Twitter, chances are it features a handful of cis white men playing foosball or drinking microbrews. Representation needs to be visible and accessible, or it can't be found by potential applicants.
When thinking about whether or not to apply to a position, applicants will scour your company's website for a mirror image — one that gives them the impression that they'll feel safe, accepted, and welcomed at your company. Without seeing themselves represented on About pages, LGBTQ potential applicants will turn away from your company thinking “maybe this isn't the place for me”.
Representation and empowerment at your company
LGBTQ representation to potential applicants isn't easy. You can't simply put a queer person on your homepage and pat yourself on the back. We don't have easily identifiable group characteristics — we don't always wear rainbow patches on our sweaters. Queer representation has to come in a deeper and more committed way. It requires action that your company can take to show that LBGTQ representation, growth, and empowerment really matters to them.
Forward thinking companies who care about diversity and inclusion have diversity groups that focus on creating a safe space for employees, advocating for team members, and creating conversations that focus on moving the company forward. They create codes of conduct for the company and for external events, extending a safe space philosophy beyond their internal groups.
For this article, I interviewed two queer women at a top Boston tech startup. I'll refer to them as Kim and Nadia. In their company's code of conduct, Kim explains, “is an explanation of what microgressions are. We're bringing it to onboarding new people”. Diversity groups hold talks, events, create awareness, and challenge the company's norms, hoping to build a stronger and more community oriented company by doing deep dives into what's often overlooked or not talked about.
“I joined, in part, because there were two women on the leadership team — I may not have otherwise”
Representation sends a message. When your company doesn't have any minorities in leadership positions, that says something to a potential candidate. Kim joined their tech company right out of a non-profit. “I joined, in part, because there were two women on the leadership team — I may not have otherwise”. That representation tells a candidate that minorities are valued at the company. A homogenous executive team sends warning flags for applicants who want to grow and feel welcome at a company that will value them.
Don't make folks check a box
When LGBTQ folks do make it to your application page, don't push them away by making a binary gender selection mandatory. Queer and gender nonconforming folks who do not wish to identify as “male” or “female” will instantly leave your application page and never look back. Creating a space that is welcoming to LGBTQ folks means creating an application process that does not force applicants to put themselves in a box they don't feel like they belong in. Eliminating the gender box entirely, or adding options that fit the queer community sends a message that the company folks are applying to is cognizant of LGBTQ issues and truly wants to create a safe space for folks right from the very beginning.
John Kershaw's Open Gender Project is committed to codifying the complexities of gender in a tech world that is mostly non-inclusive to the LGBTQ community. They're working on building a company that will guide other startups in creating a website and/or product that is cognizant of gender and welcoming to everyone.
“Finding ways to describe your gender can be challenging in formal contexts. This is important work, and there's not a lot of information out there on how to do it”. The Open Gender Project offers free consultations and is working to raise awareness of gender in software and how companies can move forward in inclusivity.
Advocate for diversity
Many companies have realized the diversity issue in today's tech industry and have created internal diversity groups that exist to challenge status-quo notions, help the company create better diversity and inclusion policies at work, and welcome diverse candidates. Diversity groups are made up of company employees who believe that this is something they want to get involved in voluntarily. However, in these groups, some folks may become stuck in feeling that because they are a part of a certain minority group, they are their only advocate and must be very active in the group, or no-one else will speak up for them.
Nadia, who I interviewed over coffee, describes some of the struggles of being a constant representative for diversity and inclusion. “It's so important to me and I feel this sense of urgency about it. To them it's just like oops, I didn't think about that. I'm like why aren't you thinking about this all the time? Because I experience this, it's on me, and it is more top of mind for me”.
Diversity groups at today's tech companies need to be focused, goal-driven, and present in all company processes. Getting employees from the white cis male majority to participate in these groups is important to the company's overall diversity success. It opens folks up to the experiences of minority groups in tech and minimizes the chance of minority employees of feeling like tokens in a group.
“It feels like every day you have to be advocating for diversity and inclusion goals or else they don't happen”, Nadia says. “It's balancing the fact that I look [queer], so then people think of course I'm pushing this agenda. I don't know that people think that, but it feels that way. We need more allies”.
“It's balancing the fact that I look [queer], so then people think of course I'm pushing this agenda. I don't know that people think that, but it feels that way. We need more allies”
Make inclusivity a priority
Changes your company can make to be more inclusive
Inclusivity at your company can move forward with some actionable changes. Make these a priority to foster a more inclusive and diverse company and be a role model for the tech community at large. Thanks to the folks who talked with me about the changes they'd like to see it tech spaces:
Maria Jose Balbontin, HootSuite: “Single stall or gender neutral bathrooms are a super easy way to show queers you care”. Gender neutral bathrooms take away a trans or gender non-conforming person's anxiety around something that others take for granted. Shout out to the folks at MozCon 2016 for creating a safe experience for all attendees.
Nadia, Boston tech company: “Recruit from queer spaces”. Meeting people where they are is a great way to let folks know that the company truly values having folks from a diverse background contributing to their product.
Make gender pronouns the norm. When hosting company events, ask employees and attendees to wear name tags with their preferred gender pronouns. This will decrease the risk of uncomfortable corrections if someone misgenders another person.
Kim, Boston tech company: “Remote work lets queers build different lives in different places and still stay connected to a company”. Creating a remote work policy will allow folks who may not be able to come into the office every day because of location, disability, family situation, etc. be a part of the company of their dreams.
John Kershaw, Open Gender Project: “Finding ways to describe your gender can be challenging in formal contexts”. Use inclusive language on your website and job descriptions, as well as in your product.
Finding your queer tech community
Interview your company
Coming into a new tech community can be a scary process, trying to maneuver around a space where folks may not feel immediately welcome. Remember that you're interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you. Use tactics that will help you determine whether the company you're interviewing will be a good space:
Reach out to fellow queer techies and see which companies are queer friendly. Word travels, and others in the community will be happy to help you.
Look at About pages and Company pages that talk about the culture of the company. Notice the team activities they do together and whether folks on the team page represent diversity.
Ask about their benefits package. Does it include trans health care? Is language around their parental leave policy inclusive?
If you're out and open to it, be straightforward and say that you're queer. Ask if there are other queer folks on the team. See how your interviewers react. You have nothing to lose. If you find out that the company is a bad choice for you, you've actually done yourself a favor.
Ask to speak to employees who won't be working on your team. Tip from Kim — “it's good to meet folks in person and speak to them so you can get a good feel for the culture instead of relying solely on the website or your interviewer”.
If folks make assumptions in the interview process, use gender non-inclusive language, pick up on that.
Check out your local queer groups, such as Queer Exchange Boston or Lesbians Who is a Tech. These folks can help with questions, past experiences, and community, as well as job postings.
Although the process of finding a company that's right for you can be hard and tumultuous, understand that the tech community is a place for you. You can make the industry better with your presence. There's a whole community behind you.
Snowden's Lawyer Interrogated By UK Authorities At Heathrow Airport
from the not-a-one-off dept
One of the most chilling moments so far in the Snowden saga was when Glenn Greenwald's partner David Miranda was held and interrogated for nine hours at London's Heathrow airport by the UK authorities, in a series of moves worthy of a tinpot dictatorship. And in case you thought that was a one-off, they've done it again -- this time, to Jesselyn Radack, a lawyer who represents Snowden and has spoken on their behalf several times. Here's what happened, as described by Kevin Gosztola on their Firedoglake blog: Jesselyn Radack told Firedoglake they were directed to a specific Heathrow Border Force agent. They "didn't seem interested" in their passport. They were then subjected to "very hostile questioning." After asking what they would be doing in London, and establishing that they would be meeting with Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy, the border agent moved on to other issues, and showed a surprising knowledge of their recent movements: "Why have you gone to Russia twice in three months?" Radack said they had a client in the country. "Who?" They answered, "Edward Snowden."
"Who is Edward Snowden?" asked the agent. Radack said they are a whistleblower and an asylee. Then, the agent asked, "Who is Bradley Manning?" To this, they answered, "A whistleblower."
For whatever reason, the agent asked, "Where is he?" "In jail," Radack told the agent. (Now, they are known as Chelsea Manning.)
The agent said, "So he's a criminal?" Radack corrected the agent, "He's a political prisoner." The agent asked if they represented Manning and they said no. Then they followed up, "But you represent Snowden?" They replied, "Yes, I'm a human rights lawyer." The questions are clearly concerned with one topic -- whistleblowers -- and give the impression that the person asking the questions already knew the answers, but just wanted to put pressure on Radack: They were "stone face cold" during the interrogation but afterward was shaking and in tears. "How did they know to bring up those names?" This blatant attempt to intimidate Snowden's lawyer, who was informed that they were on an "inhibited persons list," comes in the wake of news that a US law firm was spied upon as it advised the Indonesian government in a trade dispute with Australia. It confirms that for the US and UK governments, nothing is exempt from their total surveillance, not even information traditionally covered by attorney-client privilege.

It began with a whir, not a whistle. The Union Pearson Express shook off its training wheels Saturday as it revved into its first full day open to the public. But while the “Tier 4” diesel power is the latest in emissions-reducing technology, the joys of riding a train are timeless.

It takes about five minutes to hustle from the subway to the gleaming platform, on the skywalk connecting the Via Rail departures area with the Rogers Centre. While waiting for the train, I nosed around the kiosks: coffee and treats at Balzacs, hip souvenirs at a mini Drake General Store and even draft beers at a Mill Street stand. A mini introduction to the tastes and habits of Torontonians. Trains pulled into the station every 15 minutes, as advertised. About 50 people milled about on the platform, most of them suit-and-tie types there for the grand opening, which featured balloons and a cake shaped like the train. At 10:10 a.m., a few travellers disembarked, and I hopped on. The train cars are so fresh, they have that brand-new car smell — the scent of luxury. I took a comfy seat, spreading out into a row all my own. The car was only about a quarter full and there was plenty of storage for suitcases. The only real hiccup arrived when I went to buy my round-trip ticket. Passengers can pay their fare on board with a credit card, for a $2 surcharge, but the machine had trouble printing my receipt.
The journey took the as-advertised 25 minutes, which flew by peacefully. The backyards and trainyards of Toronto are hardly worth writing about, but the free wi-fi was fast. It's not a long enough trip to warrant much entertainment, anyway. At Pearson, it's very easy to get from the train to your flight. Either walk to Terminal 1, or take the free LINK train to terminal 3. But while the train is ready and willing to shuttle travellers, most of the passengers on board Saturday seemed to be riding the rails just for the novelty. “The girls wanted to go on the train,” said Todd Somerville, family in tow. “We've been watching the Weston station getting built over the past few years.”

At $27.50 each way for an adult fare (reduced to $19 with a Presto card), the ride may prove too rich for many Torontonians, especially those living far from one of the four stations. From my Queen West neighbourhood, it would take at least another half-hour to get to Union Station or Bloor. From Scarborough, the time savings become negligible. But for out-of-towners not familiar with the TTC, the train is a good bargain. Grant Matheson and their wife just flew in from Saskatoon, and with the senior discount, their trip cost just $23.40 each.
Normally, they would take a shuttle to their downtown hotel, for about $26 each. “But there wasn't one, so they said we had to take the train,” Matheson said. Although a roundtrip cab wouldn't cost much more than two tickets, Matheson said they prefer a train. “It's a quick way downtown.” When my colleague David Bateman travelled to Pearson just a few weeks ago, it took 35 minutes to drive from Union to Pearson at around noon, when traffic was light. If you're catching a cab anytime near rush hour, it's easy to see how the train could save lots of time, with a smoother ride. My trip back to Union was as uneventful as the way there. Since I'd bought a return ticket, they simply swiped a barcode on board. As the train pulled backwards into Union Station, I caught a glimpse of the CN Tower. The UP Express had arrived.

In the wake of protests at the University of Missouri, students of color at Guilford College are rallying against perceived racism on their campus. Guilford College is in Greensboro, North Carolina.
Like their compatriots in Missouri, the protesting students have released a list of demands. If they are “not met within a week,” protesters promise they will rally on campus again.
Among other things the students want, they are pushing the college to have professors, administrators, and staff to admit they are racist, that no black people should be in any marketing campaigns for the time being, and an investigation into Yik Yak, a smart phone app similar to a localized online bulletin board.
“We want black bodies out of marketing campaigns until Guilford addresses its diversity issues,” reads the first demand. They continue later, “We demand a plan for the end of exploitation of black male athletes. The college must not be able to profit off of black bodies while putting minimal effort into the education and retention of those same students,” it continues.
The group then writes, “We demand that school administrators, professors, staff, and student leaders acknowledge their racism, be it overt covert or passive.” They then demand “that faculty and staff [be] protected and able to voice solidarity with students and/or frustration with administration.”
They also demand Yik Yak be investigated: “We demand an investigation to the extent of the school's ability into [sic] hateful Yik Yak posts and comments. Should these posts and comments turn overtly violent, the students demand the School takes it to the proper authorities and promise the safety of black students on campus. These should be treated no differently from other anonymous hate crimes.”
UWO, FVTC make new aviation management emphasis collaboration official
Standing beneath the airplanes as they came in for landing, the roar of the engine and the size of the airplane had 3-year-old Kodye Shier hooked. They said it was then they knew they wanted to fly.
Now, at 22, Shier has already made their dream come true – they graduated from Fox Valley Technical College with a degree in aviation in 2011 – and is a pilot rated for commercial single and multi-engine land and airplane instruments. They can fly.
But that isn't stopping Shier from wanting to learn more.
In spring 2012, Shier will begin their aviation-focused coursework at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh to earn a bachelor's degree. The coursework is part of a new agreement between UW Oshkosh and FVTC that allows students in aeronautics pilot training and aircraft electronics programs at FVTC to transfer credits into a UWO aviation management emphasis. The agreement was solidified with signatures from UW Oshkosh Chancellor Richard H. Wells and FVTC President Susan May July 12; the signing appropriately took place at the Experimental Aircraft Association Museum in Oshkosh.
The agreement between the two institutions presents a package to students not available through traditional, four-year flight schools.
“The UW Oshkosh program is 100 percent online, so I can gain flight hours while I work and I can earn my bachelor's degree at the same time,” Shier said.
In addition to the online format, for Shier, the decision to attend UW Oshkosh was largely based on cost and the ability to transfer their credits.
“Other schools are a lot more expensive, and at FVTC they offer the same thing, if not more,” Shier said. “You actually get more ratings at FVTC, and the fact that they have the transfer agreement with UW Oshkosh really saves a lot on cost.”
Shier is currently enrolled in the Leadership and Organizational Studies online bachelor's degree program at UW Oshkosh, and said they want to enroll in the aviation management emphasis.
“I plan to take the aviation emphasis because I have such a drive for aviation,” Shier said. “It is easier to go to school for something that you really want — it makes retaining information a lot easier.”
The transition from hands-on classroom learning to online learning was an adjustment for Shier, but they said their instructors were very flexible and easy to work with.
Shier continues to work full-time as a flight instructor intern while taking classes, which they said has challenged them mentally, but it wasn't more than they could handle.
“I've talked to a lot of pilots who went through the FVTC aviation program and they said there is a lot of downtime in the hotels when you're flying for work,” Shier said. “What else are you going to do besides schoolwork — you've got to keep yourself busy.”
After Shier completes their bachelor's degree, they hope to continue in their career path as a pilot.
“The main reason I chose to go on for my bachelor's degree is I want to work for a legacy airline, such as Delta or Southwest airlines. They require a bachelor's degree,” Shier said.
While a bachelor's degree isn't required to become a pilot, most companies are using it as another way to filter their applicants, according to Shier.
As they continue to work toward their goal of working for a legacy airline, Shier said it means a lot to them to be able to show people how close they are.
“There were people who didn't believe me when I said I wanted to go to school to be a pilot,” Shier said. “So, it's pretty cool to go back home and show my friends that I am achieving my goals and living my dream.”

How men and women really DO see things differently (or why the wife's more interested in the price of the bikini and the husband the contents)
The old advertising adage that 'sex sells' may be recognised worldwide, but new research has revealed exactly how men and women are drawn into looking at a sexy ad.
A study of where men and women look on a 'sexy' advertisement gave a fascinating insight - with men found to be first interested in the attractive woman's face rather than their toned physique.
Using two ads featuring attractive women posing for H&M and Reebok trainers, researchers analysed where the eyes of men and women were drawn at first glance.
Hot spots: The colour splashes shows where men, left, and women tend to look at the same bikini ad. Red indicates which part of the poster generates most interest and green the least. In this instance, attention ti the face is evenly matched between the genders. But women are much more interested in the model's toned stomach and the price of the bikini. Men to prefer to focus squarely on their breasts and crotch - rather than their surrounding physique
Sexy: The H&M advert, featuring a tanned, toned woman on a beach in a bikini, which men and women looked at Some of the results were not at all surprising - both men and women were drawn to the woman's legs and torso before the advert's information and branding. RELATED ARTICLES Previous

Next Bond, Vladimir Bond: Putin fury after Russian PM's face is... Share this article Share And in the Reebok advert, where an attractive female stands wearing nothing but a pair of white trainers, mens' eyes were drawn to the model's body and barely to the shoes at all.
Surprising: Contrary to expectations, women - and not men - looked at the model's breasts first. The numbers indicate the order in which both genders viewed the key areas of general interest
I like your face: Both men and women are drawn to the top of the woman's body, but more women look at the torso then men
But there were also more interesting findings in the study of 50 men and 50 women.
Analysts found that men spent 40 per cent more time than women looking at the face.
Research: In the study by Eyetrack Shop, men and women viewed this provocative Reebok ad
Bad news for the shoe firm: The trainers were the last thing either gender viewed. And men, perhaps preoccupied by the fact that the model was otherwise naked, paid barely any attention to the footwear, as the colour splashes indicate
Men were also found to have noticed the woman's face before they paid attention to their body in both examples.
And in an H&M campaign featuring a toned, sexy woman posing on a beach, women looked first at their torso and then at their face.
A third advert, showing a silver Saab, was also used in the research.
The Saab car advert featured a picture of the car, some product information and a brand logo
Role reversal: A 'visual evaluation' study found that men looked first at the car's information before the vehicle itself, while women went straight for the car
Analysis found that men went straight to the car's specification, before looking at the car itself and finally the logo in the bottom corner.
Individuals' actions are driven by motives under a multitude of circumstances. Some are propelled by altruism, fame, loyalty, or an incessant desire with underlying greed. To achieve a perceived selfish need, others' well-being and safety may even be compromised. Greed often breaks the trust of those presumptively held close, destroying relationships and potentially leading to the greatest depths of isolation. The incredible 1996 film “Fargo” directed by the Coen Brothers explores this premise to significant extremes. The initial betrayal and slimy deal setting the film's plot in motion takes place in the dead of winter in the title city – Fargo, North Dakota.
The pathetic character Jerry Lundegaard (Academy Award nominated William H. Macy) works at a Minneapolis Oldsmobile dealership owned by their wealthy father-in-law, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnall). Jerry has embezzled $320,000 and is in some trouble, to say the least. In a not-so brilliant idea, they orchestrate the kidnapping of their wife (Kristin Rudrud) to extort money from their father-in-law. They have hired the nearly silent sociopath Gaear Grismsrund (Peter Stormare) and the “funny lookin' fella” Carl Showalter (one of my favourites, Steve Buscemi) to carry out the task. This seemingly straightforward kidnapping dismantles and becomes extremely complex. In steps the likeable and pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Academy Award winner Frances McDormand), stringing the pieces of the complicated, plot-twisting kidnapping puzzle together.
This film combines so many crucial yet distinct elements to create a perfectly balanced work of art. The minor key folk music sets a sombre tone, and the setting of the film in a harsh winter climate serves to enhance that tone. The vast distance and sense of semi-isolation can create frustration in terms of resources needed to solve such a convoluted case. As well, violent crimes are not habitual in rural areas. This in addition to the portrayal of graphic violence heightens the shock factor of the film, reminding viewers of the unfortunate dark side of humanity. In spite of this, I feel that the positive side of human nature is quite evident in the film. Many of the characters are decent individuals, living their lives and wanting to help the police solve heinous crimes. The distinct accents, conversational yet memorable dialogue (Academy Award-winning screenplay), and the raw environment elevates the film's timelessness. Without giving away any spoilers, the ending creates a sense of normalcy and hope. I feel that the message conveyed indicates that most humans at their core are driven by altruism, loyalty, and a sense of decency.

This weekend at Newport Folk Festival, Ryan Adams will debut a new acoustic band with The Infamous Stringdusters and Nicki Bluhm joining the fold. The ensemble made a surprise debut at Telluride Bluegrass Festival back in June, performing a host of Adams classics like “To Be Young,” “Let it Ride,” “Oh My Sweet Carolina” and more obscure cuts “Pearls on a String,” “Trains,” “Bartering Lines” and a cover of Dio's “Holy Diver.”
While this may seem like a unique and out of the blue collaboration, Chris Pandolfi of the Dusters says that while it was a bit “out of left field” for the bluegrass rockers, Adams' music contains that “old school bluegrass” element that will make it a seamless transition. “It's going to be rootsy string band meets Ryan Adams with a dash of bluegrass on top,” they say.
Read the rest of Pandolfi's thoughts below as we check in with them prior to the first gig in Telluride.
This seems like a rather unlikely collaboration, so let's start with how it all came together.
It was a little out of left field for us and it wasn't necessarily something we were pursuing or on our radar screen. Needless to say, we're always up for a cool and different collaboration. This wasn't something we were seeking out.
Nicki has been doing some work with Ryan and, from what I understand through talking to Nicki, they have some solo gigs booked and was sort of thinking maybe I want to go in a different direction with this. They had this idea that they wanted to have an acoustic band. At the time, I think through their connection with Nicki, they were soliciting some advice and information from them and through their connection with us they suggested The Dusters which is cool because Nicki has been around our scene and she's played with all the acoustic bands.
We were definitely flattered by that and just psyched. Ryan is, to me, I know he's known as a songwriter, he's hard to classify as an artist. He's someone who just has this intense and really noticeable force, just this energy behind their songs. They do other forms of art as well, too. He's hard to classify. He's someone who just really makes quality stuff. That was one of the big things that attracted us to the opportunity, not to mention the fact that, some of us were definitely Ryan Adams fans predating news of this. Just to team up with someone who is a real integrity artist and really cares about making something quality and all those good things I associate with Ryan.
Similar to things that I associate with old school bluegrass. It's really about the art form and perfecting this beautiful thing regardless of whether or not people loved it or if it was viable in popular sense. There are a lot of reasons were excited, but essentially the opportunity came to us through Nicki and we're excited to get to work on it.
What's the back and forth been like between all parties thus far as it relates to song selection and show structure?
I have had some back and forth with Ryan about what songs we're going to do and what might sound good in this setting. The list is still big and needs to be trimmed down, but I think there is some brand-new stuff on there that nobody's ever heard and some classic Ryan Adams.
It's cool, as far as the direction of the music and sound of the band in talking to Ryan, it's become really clear that they know bluegrass. They know the Stanley Brothers and they know the Carter Family and they know what quality picking sounds like and the harmonies and the structure of the music and how plaintive, but also just deep and powerful it can be. Some of their musical groove, they say the Carter Brothers and the Stanley Brothers were around a lot growing up. They know their stuff and I think musically it's going to be rootsy string band meets Ryan Adams with a dash of bluegrass on top.
I feel like a lot of people forget that they grew up in the hills of North Carolina and has recorded with people like Dave Rawlings, etc.
Absolutely, people associate with them with much more of this hip, hipster strain of music, especially with the covering of the Taylor Swift album and things like that. He's got old school bluegrass in them too. If you listen to their music, it's country rock essentially. It's rock and roll but it's got those tones and it's got a twang, an edge, that brings the music to life. Taken out of context, I don't think people really associate that with the larger country roots movement because of where their music has appeared. If you just listen to it and judge it just based on what it is, it fits great with a string band. It has all those essential elements, sort of old school essential rock and roll.
You mentioned some of you guys are fans—how do you turn off that fan mindset and focus your approach?
Like any gig, we're going to learn the stuff and be ready to do whatever. I think one of the reasons that the Dusters make a lot of sense for this is because we were a quick study and we've got influences that run a real live gamut. Unlike some other bands, who are really specialized in playing mainly their own music, one thing we've shown over the years is there's a lot of versatility and a lot of flexibility. We can do a lot of different things with just our acoustic instruments.
We're learning the stuff, but as far as the musical approach, I think we're all going to wait until we're all in the same room and try some things and the hope is that it's all just very natural and we don't have to reach very far to find the thing we all sort of mutually agree is just sitting right there for us. We just got to plug it in and make the music.
Are you one of the Ryan Adams fans in the band?
Oh yeah, he's awesome. I don't know all of their stuff but there are a few albums, mainly Easy Tiger, that I have listened to a lot and sing all of the words, that kind of thing. He's so good you don't even have to be a diehard Ryan Adams fan to have had a phase where you probably deeply ingested their music. That's sort of the case for me, I remember hearing that first time and, “Oh man, this is good.” Next thing I know, it had crept onto my all-time list.
Going back to the relation between bluegrass and their music, as someone who has extensive experience in the genre, how prevalent are some of those influences to you?
I noticed a lot, but what I've mainly noticed about their music and I think this is one of the really special thing about it is, the first thing you notice is, it's Ryan Adams, he's got their own sound. I think a lot of that is, of course, predicated on the songwriting but also on their voice, their singing is something really, really special. I think it's equal parts uniquely their own, but also, it has those elements.
It was really on these listens though here, getting ready to do this project. There's music that I listen to that falls into this category of music I play and then there's a lot of music that you listen to that falls into a another category. When I'm listening to the old school bluegrass or even more modern stuff, I say, “Oh, I can relate to that because it's the music that I play.” Then there is this other school of music, that is not as tied to what I do and I would have originally put them in the latter. The music that I listen to as it's going down, I'm not hearing the solos out of context, I'm not thinking what the chord changes are, and I'm just hearing it. It's funny now that we're getting ready to play this stuff and I'm learning it and I'm going back and I'm thinking, “Oh man, this is like, could be quintessential Stringduster music or bluegrass or country.” It's in there but you got to kind of look pass what the first thing that is so unique about their stuff, which like I said, it's Ryan Adams music. Once you delve in there and start checking it out, it's got a lot of that old country rootsy stuff and on these current listens is when I really sort of realized a lot of that.
As you study the material, what are some of the most challenging aspects?
It's less chord changes and more that sort of ever constant question of, how do I take what I do and add it to what this music is to make something great, to make something better, make it better than it was before. Like any music it's all about the song. For me personally, what is the ideal role of the banjo here? What can I do to really support the music? That's the challenge.
It's sort of enhanced this time around with Ryan's music because these songs are so strong, so tried and true. They're songs that are already in your head. Man, how do I bring what I do as a musician to this? It's challenging because it's not readily obvious like it is on a lot of bluegrass stuff where you just plug in and play and do your role. It's more constantly searching for, how do I support the music and how do I add to this and make it better? How do I take this song and make it great?
It's the same challenge as a lot of music, it's just now applied to some really tried and true stuff. It's not like we're learning and writing new Stringdusters songs. We're playing some of the most awesome music that's been written in the last ten, fifteen years. There's a responsibility there, there's a challenge there, we embrace that.
Danny "zonic" Sørensen is the last member of mTw's squad, team manager Alexander "VanDyk" van Dyk has revealed.
The Danish veteran called time on an illustrious playing career in March 2012 following a brief spell with mousesports - the team they joined after spending four years with mTw.
In July, they returned to the scene to coach dignitas' team, for whom they also acted as a substitute in online competitions, and many believed that it would be a matter of time before they made a U-turn on their retirement decision after mTw announced plans to recreate the famous Danish roster.

As the exponential growth of technology speeds ahead, so must the complexity of the gaming industry. Almost 60 years ago, the brown box console came out. The incursion of quarter slot arcades presented a market for at home consoles, and then five decades later, the endless myriad of freemium apps came to market. Some games along the way are most notable for their groundbreaking achievements, presenting an aspect of gaming that left all other aspects inferior. Golden Eye 007 for the Nintendo 64 provided a local muliplayer first-person shooter platform that revolutionized the industry. Games like Mortal Kombat and Grand Theft Auto pushed the limits of acceptable stimulus and forced companies to obey the newly founded ESRB rating system. When Halo: Combat Evolved came out, it single handedly was responsible for the successful launch of the XBOX, and it's no surprise that an anniversary collection with Halo 5 muliplayer beta was released for the Xbox One.
Games like these and many more created a standard for gamers. The expectations of the gaming generation become exceedingly higher with each new franchise or published sequel. Once Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games hit the scene, like World of Warcraft and EVE, a subtle shift occurred. Multiplayer became the corner stone of gaming, and while many games stuck to very long solo campaigns, the replay value became rather stagnant. The cost of hosting the servers for these games was an unforeseeable challenge, but luckily, monthly subscriptions and expansion packs made the gaming industry billionaires.
Although the standards for the hardcore gamer were exceeding the limits of small time gaming publishers, a new marketable demographic came to the scene: the casual gamer. Previous generations who thought of the gaming world as too complicated found themselves increasingly addicted to Wii Sports, Sims, Solitaire, and Free Cell. Social media made this ever more prevalent. Games like Farmville and Candy Crush on Facebook have our parents forcefully entangled in competitive level completion.
So, why would this cause a problem? Just because micro-transactions in games exist for experience points or extra lives, doesn't mean it can derail the evolution of gaming, right?
These micro-transactions add up, and like the ever entrapping addiction of a casino, these same aspects appeal to the most vulnerable of psyches and can be downloaded to any mobile device in the world. Lets do some math. Currently, the cost of all of the expansions to World of Warcraft is about $120. Initially, the original was $60 and each expansion $40. That includes vanilla World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, Mists of Pandaria, and now Warlords of Draenor. The monthly subscription of the game is $15 a month, and if you buy 6 months in advance, you can lower the cost per month to $12.99. Essentially over the 11 years of its existence, one out of the millions of players would have spent roughly $260 for all of the expansions and game, $1,980 for the total subscription, and this doesn't even include the upkeep on the desktop or laptop computing needs to run the game.
Is this an acceptable amount of money to pay to play a game?
As long as the game is constantly updated with significant content, I am sure World of Warcraft players don't mind. With the addition of each expansion, a new level cap was added, new areas and dungeons to explore, and new quests became available to grind for experience. That being said, games outside the MMO experience like console games are now in the digital pre-order era. That's right folks! Back when the demands for games were so high that the publisher couldn't ship them out fast enough, pre-ordering made sense. Those days are long gone. Now we have digital pre-order downloads, where gaming companies are receiving millions of dollars for pre-orders on games they don't even release on the announced release date. Or to make matters worse, games are released that aren't even ready. Games like Star Trek, released in 2013 had such a bad review, J.J. Abrams attributes the release of this game to hindering their box office sells in Star Trek: Into Darkness.
The Halo Anniversary for the XBOX one had to wait weeks — not days — but weeks for the servers to handle the amount of incoming information and the sheer demand. People spent $500 on the console, another $60 for the game, and couldn't even play the announced feature that made the game in demand in the first place. Another recently released game, Evolve for PS4, XBOX One, and Desktop has over $135 dollars listed in downloaded content. Why spend $60 dollars on a game that isn't fully completed? It's one thing if the downloadable content is cosmetic or significant, but another thing if the released game only has eight hours of material and expects you to spend more out of pocket.
Freemium games that incorrectly exploit the DLC structure are by far the worst. These free to download apps are marketed in such a way that kids find them exceptionally entertaining. If the parent isn't technology savvy, a credit card without parent lock can be established in the Google Play Store or iTunes and the child will spend hundreds of dollars without knowing the consequences. A freemium game called Clash of Clans had a story published about how a child was spending their father's money to upgrade their fort and revive their minions. After spending more than 3,700 pounds, the family obviously was in shock. Because of the exculpatory clause listed at the bottom of the transactions, the family had no grounds to sue, and lost the case.
One of the worst DLC ever released was in 2007 on a game called Beautiful Katamari. The game was rather short, and a lot of players complained on how quickly they were able to beat the game. It turns out the publisher created a firewall on content already published on the game disc. The DLC was a release code for the content already created. Freemium gaming is rather devious and deceiving at first. It grabs your attention with a mildly entertaining flash of brilliant colors and actions. You get somewhat interested in the game, and then you realize you have to pay to win. Some of these games have timing allocation in which you cant play for 2 hours, or you could pay money to have an in game currency that you could exchange for more play time. With what we have already seen, these games demographic are largely represented by the younger generations, as their concept of “spending money” has no real ramifications until the family finds out.
We are partly to blame for the gaming industries business strategy. If we didn't participate, it wouldn't have worked. But now that everyone and their grandmother is hooked on Candy Crush, this digital age of instant gratification could be our financial downfall. Luckily, the effects of freemium gaming have spawned a new “Pay Once and Play” concept. Apple has taken the initiative to advertise games who specifically have no other hidden micro-transactions within them. As time goes on, it will be interesting to see the increased complexity of pay once and play games. Is it possible to market a MMO game on the pay once and play section without charging monthly subscription fees? Only time will tell.

As soon as I hit my senior year of high school I started getting the comments.
“I bet you can't wait to get out of your house.”
“Once you graduate, move out and gain some independence!”
“I love living on my own. There is so much freedom and no more parents telling you what to do. I totally recommend it.”
To be honest, I liked living at home and didn't really see a reason to move out. My friends were all moving out, going to college, and loving their newfound freedom. They couldn't understand why I wanted to continue to live at home after my eighteenth birthday.
Community, accountability, protection, friendships and so much more that comes with the home and family environment.
Fast forward in time. I just turned twenty-six, and guess what? I still live at home. I'm not here because my parents are control freaks and won't let me leave. I'm not here because I'm lazily sitting around, shoving bonbons down my throat and watching hours of TV.
So why am I still choosing to live at home?
Because I love it! I love the community, accountability, protection, friendships and so much more that comes with the home and family environment. Looking back I realize that I almost wasted the opportunity that comes with living at home. I feel like God has given me a second chance to truly invest in my younger siblings and to be the example I should have been all along.
Stop the Countdown Timer
My prayer is that you can learn to view your current years at home as a blessing and something to take advantage of. Don't put the timer on and count down the hours and minutes until your “escape.”
I want to give three reasons why I think living at home is a great idea and why I think you should view these years in your house as a blessing and not a curse.
Instead of viewing your eighteenth birthday as the escape route to “Freedom at last, baby!” maybe you can learn to view your family the way that I have learned (and am still learning) to view them.
3 reasons your home is a great place to be:
1. A Chance to Give and Receive “True Love”
Living with my family has taught me what true love really looks like. First Corinthians 13:4–7 says:
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
I have had sooooo many opportunities to learn and practice this kind of true love by living at home. Patience is one of my weaknesses, and God has given me more opportunities by living at home to work on that.
Wouldn't you agree that your home is a great place to work on true love qualities like patience, kindness, forgiveness, and perseverance? Even if you don't always receive true love at home, you can show it to your parents and siblings. This is a great opportunity to grow in your character and learn to love with a true and lasting love.
2. A Place of Community
Living with my family has provided an awesome community for me to be a part of. I'm forced to interact with people on a daily basis instead of totally keeping to myself. I have to listen to stories from my younger sisters and hear about the crazy adventures my brothers have. It forces me to keep an outward focus instead of letting life completely revolve around me.
Your family are people you can learn from, invest in, and build lifelong relationships with.
I realize that it's possible to live at home and still hideaway and ignore your family. That's what I'm hoping you won't do though! I hope you will see your family as people you can learn from, invest in, and build lifelong relationships with. Your friends will come and go, but your family will be forever!
3. Somewhere to Serve
One of our life goals as Christians should be to become more and more like Christ. One of the character qualities that marked Jesus' life was service.
That's why Mark 10:45 says, “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give their lives as a ransom for many.”
Living in a family provides never-ending opportunities to serve. There is always cleaning, laundry, babysitting, cooking, listening, playing and so much more that can be done every single day. If we truly want to become like Christ and follow Their example, our home are amazing places to practice that.
Don't Waste It!
I want to challenge you to think through those three areas and ask yourself if you have that mindset. Do you view your family as place to learn true love? Do you view the people in your family as eternal beings and people you can make an impact on? Do you view your family members as people whom you can serve like Jesus did?
Don't waste these years that God has given you with your family. They probably won't last forever and will more than likely end faster than you are expecting. Don't make the mistake that I almost made by viewing this time as something to “tolerate.” View them as a blessing from God and this time as something you can use to truly bring glory to God.
Here are three questions to make this personal. I'd love to hear your answers in a comment below.
B.C. cord cutters take note, Telus has announced it will begin charging Internet customers who exceed their monthly data allowance.
In a release posted on its website, Telus says, starting March 30, the company will automatically charge customers for additional “data buckets of 50 gigabytes as needed” if they zoom past their data allowance.
That first 50 GB “bucket” will cost you $5 with subsequent buckets costing $10 each up to a monthly maximum charge of $75.
The new Internet data fees are similar to those charged by U.S. communications giant AT&T, which charges customers $10 for each additional 50 GB data. AT&T, however, provides its users with two warnings and only charges customers when they exceed the monthly data plan a third time.
Telus's new charges are not being received warmly on social media.
Telus already has monthly data caps built into their various Internet plans — but had never charged customers for exceeding them. The data allowances start at 30 GB a month for their Internet 1 service and go up to 500 GB for their top Internet 100 plan (See full chart on the right).
Shaw Internet has similar data allowances tied to their various plans but, at this point, do not penalize those who exceed monthly caps.
When you stream a Netflix movie in standard definition you are using about 1 GB of data per hour — or 3 GB per hour for high definition video.
Netflix provides information on how to adjust your data usage HERE.
Watching Optik TV does not count as data, but certain Optik applications, such as Netflix, TED Talks, Karaoke, National Film Board, Weather Network, TumbleBooks, Facebook, Twitter and Santa Tracker, do contribute to data usage.
The new charge means online gamers will need to keep a close eye on their data usage. Most of the downloadable games for the new generation of consoles — Xbox One and PlayStation 4 — are in excess of 25 GB each.
National Post game columnist Chad Sapieha explained in a 2014 column that a single game update — just a patch, not a full game — used 13 GB in data.
“We've entered an era in which the monthly caps of 50 to 60 GB that seemed almost limitless not all that long ago may not even suffice for a single download-heavy day,” said Sapieha.
Unless you're already among the minority who've already switched over to a pricier plan with higher limits, a bigger monthly bill from your ISP is simply the new cost of using home game consoles. We're going to need to get used to it. — Sapieha
Telus customers can pay $30 per month for the company's Unlimited Data Usage plan. Customers who also subscribe to Telus TV can get the same deal for $15 per month.
The new MyTelus website allows customers to track their data usage and provides an overview on activities that consume a lot of data:
• Up/downloading very large files (over 100 MB)
• Video conferencing, e.g. Skype, FaceTime (200 MB / hr)
• Online gaming, e.g. Xbox, PlayStation (75 MB / hr)
• Downloading games or updates (Sizes vary. Check before downloading.)
• Downloading movies (700 MB)
• Streaming audio, e.g. Songza, Internet radio (Up to 100 MB / hr)
• Watching Netflix in Standard Definition (1 GB / hr)
• Watching Netflix in High Definition (3 GB / hr)
Telus customer service says notification letters will be emailed out to customers when they reach 75% of their monthly data plan.
About
REM is the passion of 20+ creatives in the Denton filmmaking community. We are collaborating to create something beautiful, and – we hope – something that will speak to the core of everyone who comes into contact with this story.
Remington Blake, a young vacuum salesperson and heir to a great fortune, is having recurring dreams of their own death. Strangely enough, they are also having dreams of a beautiful woman whom they have never met. As the dreams increase with intensity and frequency, so do their feelings for this mysterious woman.
Remington's brother, Everett, prepares to marry the ever spunky Emily Dodd, however the violent and foreboding nature of Remington's dreams begins to put a shroud over their relationship and the upcoming event. When Remington meets the woman they have been dreaming about in real life, their relationship propels them towards the events of their death, leaving them with an impossible decision between love and life.
REMINGTON BLAKE
Remington is the main character.  They are in their early 20′s. He's distracted, reserved, tidy, and organized. Undriven. They work as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesperson and lives with their brother Everett.
NORA PAISLEY
Nora is the love interest.  They are in their early twenties, dressed in vintage and punk.  They are undisciplined, artistic, isolated, and a bit snarky. She's trying to do them best, though, amidst it all.
EVERETT BLAKE
Everett is Remington's older brother – facetious, overbearing, but caring. They dress a bit 90′s, is a bit sloppy, and can't avoid a good bit of sarcasm.
EMILY DODD
Emily is Everett's lively fiancée and friend and confidante to Remington.  They are spirited, fanciful, elegant, and factual.

We've come to Kickstarter to ask for your help to fund our film. Movies take a lot of money. Our crew and cast are doing all of the work for this film for free. Every cent is going to the quality of the production. We are raising funds for purchasing and renting gear, wardrobe, set decoration, props, and countless other administrative costs that go along with filming.
That's where you come in. We're asking for $8,000. This isn't the friendly, breathing-room number, either. This has been hacked down to the bare bones that we can do this film for and still do it justice.
We believe in you, though. As much as we hope you believe in us. That's why we've created extra goals. We believe we can go beyond the $8,000 mark. We feel like you've got that. That's cake. Let's really make this dream a reality. Help us blow the world away with what Denton can do in film!
THE BARE BONES - $8,000
This is the hacked and slashed budget that we fought hard to get to you. We don't want to play any games; we're serious about making this film. We don't need to eat; we don't need to sleep. We'll stretch our bones to stretch this budget as far as the film will take us.
THE BUDGET - $12,000
This is the actual budget we originally came up with when we sat down to detail out everything that we'd need for the production. To have the breathing room, margin, and better equipment that this budget allows would be immense. You would get a better quality film, things would run much smoother, and we would all be prouder to call this a Denton-made film.
THE PROMOTION - $16,000
A film is only good if it's seen, right? This budget includes all the fees, travel fares, and marketing costs necessary to participate in a proper film festival circuit. This would put Denton on the map, as well as share the story of REM to a much wider audience.
THE PAYCHECK - $20,000
This is, quite simply, where we pay our actors. These talented individuals are coming from all around the area on their own dime. This budget provides them with modest pay, better on-set food, better wardrobe, and other accommodations. This film hinges on their success. Let's give them some drive!
THE DIRECTOR'S CUT - $30,000
This is the film we'd really love to make. This would give us much better equipment (lighting, sound, lenses – everything that makes a movie beautiful) and all around better creative control to make a film that would blow even our expectations out of the water. It would be gorgeous. Think about it.
THE BLOCKBUSTER - $50,000
Now, we know $50,000 is actually pretty modest to call something a "Blockbuster." But we feel we can create a truly remarkable product with the resourcefulness that we used to plan the film with only $8,000. With this budget, we would also sow into future productions, creating a full-fledged production company.
CLOSE West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin says 14 people have died during devastating flooding in the state. AP

The bodies of three more victims of West Virginia's historic flooding were found overnight Saturday, according to county authorities, raising the death toll to 26 from torrential rains and high water that has destroyed more than 100 homes, washed out scores of roads and bridges and knocked out power to tens of thousands of people.
On Saturday, President Obama declared a major disaster for West Virginia and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the counties of Greenbrier, Kanawha and Nicholas.
The Kanawha County sheriff's office said Saturday that one man was found in a home in the Clendenin area and two females were found in a home along the Elk River. The officials said it is presumed that all three had drowned.
At least 23 others, including an 8-year-old boy who was wading in a foot of water, were killed in the torrential flooding after as much as 8-10 inches of rain fell in six to eight hours in parts of the state on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. This amount of rain in such a short time is likely a "one-in-a-thousand-year event," the weather service said.

It was the third-deadliest flood on record in West Virginia, according to the West Virginia state climatologist Kevin Law. Only the Buffalo Creek flood in 1972 (when 125 died after a dam break) and a November 1985 flood (when 38 died from a combination of Hurricane Juan's remnants and another storm) killed more in the state, Law said.
Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin told reporters Friday that damage is widespread and devastating. Saying search and rescue missions are still a top priority, Tomblin issued a state of emergency for 44 counties and deployed 150 members of the National Guard to help emergency responders.
They called the flooding "among the worst in a century" for some parts of West Virginia.
Tomblin's chief of staff, Chris Stadelman, said 14 deaths had been confirmed by the state medical examiner. But local sheriffs and rescue workers across the state confirmed others not yet included in the state's official tally, the Associated Press reported.
Sheriff Jan Cahill of Greenbrier County, one of the hardest-hit areas, said at least 13 were killed there. Three were killed in Kanawha County and one each in Ohio and Jackson counties.
The heavy rains and rising water swamped towns, inundated a two-century old resort and trapped 500 people in a shopping center when a bridge was washed out. The storm also knocked out power to 66,000 West Virginians, and forced the shut off of gas in the town of White Sulphur Springs, Tomblin said.
The governor said 60 roads were closed, many of them destroyed, bridges were knocked out, and homes were burned down and washed off foundations. They said water rescue teams searched devastated areas looking for possible victims.
"It's been a long 24 hours, and the next 24 hours may not be any easier," the governor said.
Greenbrier County Sheriff Jan Cahill described "complete chaos" in their county from the flooding, according to the Associated Press.

Chris Stadelman, the governor's communication director, said some areas were “probably looking at flooding that's going to be the worst in 100 years." Tens of thousands of people were without power, and several roads were impassable, the Associated Press reported.
The body of Emanual Williams, 8, was recovered in Big Wheeling Creek in the Elm Grove area of Wheeling, The Wheeling Intelligencer reported.
The newspaper said the boy was walking with their sister and mother in a foot of water in the creek when they slipped and was carried away by strong currents.
One of the 500 people stranded overnight at a shopping mall said rescuers used a rope to help them and others down a steep slope behind the Crossings Mall in Elkview, about 12 miles from Charleston.
Eric Blackshire, who is 48, said that they decided to get a hotel room at the mall on Thursday because a rock slide had blocked their way home to Walton. Then the bridge to the mall washed out during heavy rainfall, stranding people there overnight.
In Nicholas County, much of the town of Richwood was inundated by high water from the Cherry River, forcing the relocation of a nursing home. In nearby Greenbrier County, the grounds of the 238-year-old Greenbrier Resort, a National Historic Landmark, were partially flooded by water from Howard's Creek.
“We've got houses washed away, people trapped in automobiles and people trying to swim to get out of harm's way,” Jim Justice, owner of the resort, said on MetroNews Sportsline. “It's really, really, really bad.”

One river, the Elk River at Queen Shoals, West Va., rose to an all-time record height of 33.37 feet, breaking the previous record of 32 feet, set in 1888, the weather service reported.

Ca. 20 hours ago, I dropped the following comment on Facebook:
Currently trending is that the Philae lander has perhaps found life on a comet… yeah, if that turns out to be verified and not just media mis-reporting of one lone nut with an incredibly tenuous association with NASA I will physically eat my shorts.
Now, I should reiterate that as I wrote that I had read absolutely nothing about the story on the Philae lander. I had no idea about the specific claims made. All I knew was the phrase “Trending: Philae: Comet That Spacecraft Landed on Could Have Alien Life, Scientists Say”. That's all.
How much of it did I get right without even looking? Well, it's obvious innit?
The pattern has become so predictable it was possible to get pretty much all of it right from seeing the mere fact that the story was trending. “Found alien life”? No. Just no. “Scientists say”? Nope, it was one lone nut, namely Chandra Wickramasinghe. “Evidence”? Smevidence.
The only thing I didn't get right was “tenuous association with NASA” – not surprisingly, Philae is an ESA project, not a NASA one (idiot – though perhaps I just had the EmDrive on the brain). Still, that tends to fit the pattern; since it employs nearly 20,000 people and is associated with countless others, it's not hard to have a connection with NASA, and “NASA claims” makes a pretty headline no matter the article content.
Still, the story trended anyway.
ALIEN LIFE? Astronomers say there are signs of possible alien life on Comet 67P, after studying data from the European Space Agency's Philae Lander.
….ABC7 News said.
Philae's comet may host alien ‘life': astronomers
….Some other guy said.
Scientists have spotted what some believe to be evidence of life on the Philae comet.
….I Don't Fucking Understand the First Thing About Science said.
….
…said the Daily Mail because for the last few months I've set AdBlock to kill anything from that site and my life has been so much better ever since. Although I'm told their article was on form.
Mere hours later, the refutation articles finally caught up. Bullshit, called Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy (in a near-identical reflex-action to mine). Nope nope nope said Rachel Feltman in the Washington Post. What a croquembouche of solidified emu excrement declared… well, pretty much anyone who knows even the first thing about the subject.
Why do we even bother with the refutation articles? The pattern is quite literally that predictable. Why not just write the generic post – titled “No, Scientists Didn't Do The Thing You Read About” – and point to it? We can have a few set phrases like “It turns out that the evidence they presented has a more simple, parsimonious and perfectly expected explanation” and “No, the scientist in question wasn't actually associated with the research project” and absolutely certainly “The claims weren't published, they were just mouthed off in an email to the press desk” and words to that effect.
It would save so much time.
— Note, profanity begins here —
Mainstream popular science right now is a fucking shambolic piece of cunting horse bollocks. We thought it was bad before, but it hasn't got much fucking better. The rise of the internet and – buzzword alert – social media has given us easier and more ready access to experts than ever before, but still these fucking fucktarded fucking newspapers, sites and the people who read them still gobble up any old shite guffed up by fucking moron that tells them something.
Lone Nut: “Hey, I've got a fucking PhD, kind-of, doesn't matter that I've spent the years since plucking shit-covered morsels of Wrong out of my hairy anus and flinging them at the fucking internet, I have a crank theory for you to post!”
Shitty Newspaper: “Oh, sweet, dude, just what we needed! We haven't undermined the public's trust in science for fucking ages!”
Lone Nut: “Yeah, you take that sweaty morsel of shit I just told you!”
Shitty Newspapers: “Yes, sir, please feed me more of your shit! I love it because I'm a filthy fucking whore!”
That's basically what happens. Each. And. Every. Fucking. Time.
It has been over a decade since Andrew Fucking Wakefield shat all over our collective consciousness with their outright fucking fraudulent claims about autism and measles jabs – and now people are starting to fucking die because of it – and the shitting papers still haven't learned their fucking lesson about basic fucking fact-checking before jumping to publish some trumped up fucking dingo's kidneys coming from some twat-mouthed cockwomble.
Just fucking admit it you cunts – you're not fucking writing science articles, not even fucking popular science articles. You're writing fucking clickbait for shit's sake! Or worse, you're trying to fuck about with peoples' perceptions of what science even fucking is so that when you publish your own fucking horseshit like “vaccines cause AIDS” and “climate change isn't real” people will believe your version of events because “Hey, scientists thought there was life on a comet! What idiots!”
Something needs to fucking change. Fucking pronto.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Pediatricians Thursday called for the strictest possible regulation of gun sales, as well as more education for parents on the dangers of having a gun at home, to prevent deaths of kids and teens.
In a policy statement published in the journal Pediatrics, researchers representing the American Academy of Pediatrics said the number of gun-related deaths in youth has dropped nationally since the mid-1990s, but is still many times higher than rates in other wealthy countries.
The report was released to coincide with the AAP National Conference and Exhibition in New Orleans.
Its most important purpose, according to co-lead author Dr. Robert Sege from Boston Medical Center, is to reiterate that kids and teens are at risk if they have access to guns.
"Most children who get injured or killed from firearms get their firearms from home," they told Reuters Health.
That is because young kids are by nature curious, they said, and teenagers are by nature impulsive - including when it comes to guns.
"There's new, better data that although the safest home for children is a home without guns, that parents can protect their child simply by keeping a gun unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately," Sege said.
They and the rest of the AAP's Council on Injury, Violence, and Poison Prevention Executive Committee found that as of 2009, between 11 and 12 of every 100,000 older teens were being killed every year by gunshots. About two-thirds of those were homicides, with suicides and accidental deaths accounting for the rest.
Guns were responsible for almost 85 percent of all teen homicides that year, the researchers added. They were also the most common method of teen suicide.
SUICIDE LINK
The high death rate in suicide attempts using guns - compared to pills or sharp objects - makes at-home access to firearms especially dangerous for impulsive teens, according to the pediatrician group.
"For 98 percent of families every year, whether you have a gun or not is irrelevant. Most of the time nothing happens, the way that most of the time when you ride around without a seat belt, nothing bad happens," said David Hemenway, head of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Boston. They were not involved in drafting the policy statement.
The AAP committee also called for restoration of a controversial U.S. ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004. President Barack Obama suggested at a presidential debate earlier this week that they would renew a ban on assault weapons - a position not backed by their Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.
Assault weapons include military-style guns designed to fire rapidly and from close range, such as semiautomatic AK-47s.
The AAP cited the cost of gun-related assaults and homicides at over $17 billion a year, due to lost productivity and medical bills. But Hemenway said the true financial burden is much higher.
"When guns are used for homicide it can destroy not only someone's life and their ability to work and so forth ... but it can destroy communities," they said. For example, businesses do not want to move into communities that have had a few shootings, and families that can afford to will move out.
They said the consensus among injury researchers has been that the best thing to do for a child's safety is to keep guns out of the house. But each family has to make that decision on its own.
"If you decide to have a gun, and it's an individual choice, what you really want to do is store it safely," Hemenway said.

Many corporations reportedly decided not to support the Republican National Convention to distance themselves from the GOP nominee.
Unfortunately for the Democrats, some have also declined to help bankroll the official festivities in Philadelphia. Walgreens, for instance, was a top player in funding convention host committees, or the entities that help organize the events, in earlier years. In 2008, the company gave $100,000 to both conventions (it was also a big donor that cycle, ponying up more than $506,000 in federal contributions).
This year, the pharmacy giant declined to donate to either the Republican or Democratic host committees. But it turned to other ways to celebrate the moment, instead hosting off-campus events at both conventions.
We got a peek at Tuesday afternoon's “Celebrating Women of the Democratic Caucus.” A stone's throw away from City Hall, Walgreens decked out the third floor of its store (yes, it's three stories) with pink popcorn (apparently “summer carrot and beet” flavored?) and beauty stations where representatives offered to apply the best Revlon products to partygoers' faces. Caterers passed out prosecco and white wine beneath elaborate gold chandeliers.
Walgreens did not respond to a request for comment about this year's funding decision. It's still happy to ante up for its lobbyists, though: Walgreen Co. has spent $1.2 million lobbying this year so far and $2.1 million last year to make its case in Washington.
Other sponsors of the party included Revlon and the International Council of Shopping Centers, as well as women's rights groups such as Your Life Your Voice, AmerisourceBergen, Running Start, They Should Run and the Women's High Tech Coalition.
Some of this support went to stocking reusable bags for attendees stuffed with hygienic and makeup products such as Olay moisturizers and a Revlon highlighting stick (a smaller version valued at $14.49 online).
Navigating gift rules can be tricky, but Walgreens attempted to do its due diligence: Next to the goodie bags sat a sign that read, “State and municipal elected officials and staff should consult with their respective ethics offices before participating in the event or accepting giveaway bags.”
Among the attendees included Karen Hinton, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's former press secretary, sporting a “Mayors for Hillary” button, alongside their husband Howard Glaser, longtime top official for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The couple chatted animatedly with Juanita Scarlett of lobbying firm Park Strategies and Violet Moss, former New York senior staffer and current lobbyist at Bolton St. Johns. Revlon and Walgreens execs mingled on the floor as well.
Also spotted was Juliana Stratton, the Democratic nominee for an Illinois House seat; they defeated incumbent Kenneth Dunkin in the primary. Stratton, the director of a University of Chicago research center, is running unopposed in the general election. And the crowd included Rita Norton, senior vice president of government affairs at AmerisourceBergen Corp.
Nametags for a number of lawmaker invitees, including Reps. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y), Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Judy Chu (D-Calif.) hadn't yet been picked up. A Walgreens employee excitedly informed OpenSecrets reporters that Oprah Winfrey's infamous best friend, Gayle King, stopped by the store the day before, so they received an invite to Tuesday's reception.
A half-mile away, law and lobbying firm Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney entertained lobbyists and Pennsylvania politicians in an invite-only reception overlooking the city. At R2L, an upscale restaurant on the 37th floor of one of Philadelphia's tallest buildings, guests mingled and enjoyed an open bar along with hors d'oeuvres such as crispy risotto with parmesan foam.
Attendees were greeted by a lifesize cardboard cutout of Hillary Clinton wearing a Buchanan Ingersoll button, next to a chocolate sculpture of a Democratic donkey.
Among the reception's guests was Shelley Rubino, vice president for global government affairs at Airlines for America, who made headlines last year for their romantic relationship with House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.). Also in attendance Tuesday was Shuster's brother, Bob, Buchanan Ingersoll's co-chair of federal and state government relations. Several state politicians — members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly including Rep. Dan Frankel (D), along with Rick Gray, mayor of Lancaster, Pa. — were spotted at the reception as well.
Buchanan Ingersoll's employees have a history of donating to Dems, with more than $470,000 given so far this cycle.
Headquartered in Pittsburgh, last year the firm took in more than $2.6 million in federal lobbying income, representing Comcast, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, a slew of Keystone State interests (public and private) — oh, and Walgreens, proving once again that everything in money and politics is connected.

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - At least 20 members of the Libyan National Army (LNA) have been killed and 40 injured in two days of fighting in the eastern city of Benghazi, a hospital official said on Wednesday.
The clashes come as the LNA, a force loyal to the country's eastern government, tries to extend its grip on the port city and dislodge the Islamist-dominated forces it has been battling for more than two years.
Led by Khalifa Haftar, the LNA has made major gains in Benghazi this year but still faces pockets of resistance. On Monday, it launched a fresh offensive in the Guwarsha and Ganfouda districts, carrying out air strikes and saying it had made some progress in ground fighting.
War planes could still be heard over Benghazi on Wednesday morning, and ambulances ferrying casualties raced through the streets. Roads were shut leading to western parts of the city where clashes were continuing.
At least seven militants were killed in Guwarsha on Wednesday, military spokesperson Fadel al-Hassi said. Earlier casualty figures for the LNA's opponents were not available.
On Tuesday, a car bombing near a vegetable market at the eastern entrance to the city left 14 wounded, a second hospital official said.
Libya slid into political turmoil and conflict after long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising five years ago. In 2014, rival parliaments and governments were set up in Tripoli and eastern Libya, both backed by loose alliances of armed groups.
Haftar has become the dominant figure for factions based in eastern Libya. So far, they have opposed a government backed by the United Nations that arrived in Tripoli in March.
The grassroots came together in a big way to urge Sen. Udall to take an incredibly rare opportunity to make the CIA torture report public. Bill of Rights Defense Committee, Blue America, Code Pink, CREDO, Daily Kos, Demand Progress, Digby's Hullabaloo, Fight for the Future, Just Foreign Policy, The Nation, RH Reality Check, RootsAction.org, USaction, and Win Without War members responded with almost 200,000 petition signatures in a mere two weeks.
Sen. Udall's staff assistant Genevieve Clough received the petition which was hand-delivered by Shahid Buttar of Bill of Rights Defense Committee, Nathan White representing Demand Progress, Medea Benjamin and Alli McCracken representing Code Pink and Carissa Miller of Daily Kos (that's me). Clough stated that they had been expecting us and that on behalf of Sen. Udall they were happy to see the number of supportive signatures.
As a group we reiterated our support for Sen. Udall taking what would be a historical action, as important as the Pentagon Papers released by Dan Ellsberg in 1971. Allowing the American public to see exactly how torture has been used in the past by the CIA will be a powerful argument for ensuring that torture is never used again.
Also there to help with the delivery was Greg Thielmann, Senior Fellow for the Arms Control Association and former member of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (2004-2009). After the delivery they spoke with us about the clear argument against torture: it doesn't work. The American's people perception of it has been distorted as they are told that it is necessary to get important information fast.
Torture in fact is used over the course of weeks to break a person down in hopes that toward the end they or they will give up information. And many victims of torture do give up information, to make the pain stop, in fact more than not they say whatever they think their interrogators want to hear just to escape the hellish conditions they are living through. Which means that not only does it not result in quick intel, it also results in bad intel.
Sen. Udall can make sure these inhumane, ineffective practices are never used by the CIA again. Our message to him: Before leaving office, please submit the Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report to the Congressional Record. We know that you are considering undertaking this heroic and courageous act, and we and countless others will support you if you choose to do so.
Bernie Ecclestone has said Formula One's 2014 engine regulations will be tweaked because a rule that says cars must run on electric engines only in the pit lane would mean "people could be killed".
With the engines being downsized from the current 2.4-litre V8's to a 1.6-litre V6 turbo, there are also a number of other new regulations that have been agreed such as a more powerful KERS unit. As a result, article 5.19 in the preliminary technical regulations states 'The car must be run in electric mode (no ignition and no fuel supply to the engine) at all times when being driven in the pit lane.'
Ecclestone, however, said that the danger posed to those working in the pit lane by a lack of engine noise means that article will be removed.
"Formula One is absolutely not the right place to have electric engines," Ecclestone told the Daily Express. "It's like having ballet dancers with sneakers. More comfortable, but it doesn't work... There's no way that it will be electric in the pit lane. People could be killed because they won't hear the cars coming."
Following criticism of the new rules, Ecclestone defended current FIA president Jean Todt, saying it was actually a result of their predecessor Max Mosley's recommendations.
"We can't blame Jean Todt because this was started by Max [Mosley]. It was Max's original idea. Their idea is what is being promoted now."

The Challenge: Can you figure out why a 59-year-old woman keeps gaining weight?
Every month, the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to try their hand at solving a medical mystery. Below you will find the story of a woman who has been gaining weight despite years of work to lose it. Was this, as the patient worried, a result of menopause, or was there something else going on? They were frustrated and aggravated, but should they be worried?
Below I provide much of the information available to the doctor who made the diagnosis. Regular readers may assume that this, like so many of my cases, is the zebra. But is it? The first reader to offer the correct diagnosis, along with the missing piece of data that helped the doctor get there, will receive a signed copy of my book, “Every Patient Tells a Story,” and the satisfaction of solving a real life case.
The Patient's Story
“I just can't seem to lose weight,” the 59-year-old woman said quietly. She'd done everything, they told the young doctor. Weight Watchers. Exercise. They drank more water. They ate more vegetables. They tried eating less fat, then only “good” fat. They kept food diaries, downloaded calorie counters. She'd done it all. And not only was they not losing weight, these past few years they just kept on gaining. Despite all of their hard work, she'd put on maybe 50 pounds in the past year.
More Than Skin Deep?
They decided to go to Dr. Donald Smith, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She'd seen the doctor years earlier in a documentary on weight loss surgery on TV. The fact that they were an endocrinologist made them a doubly good choice for them because they worried that the real cause of their weight gain was hormonal. They first met with the doctor in training who was working with Dr. Smith as part of their endocrinology fellowship. She'd never been skinny, they told the young doctor. But she'd never been heavy like this before, either. They were 5-foot-4, and throughout their 20s and 30s she'd weighed 170 to 180 pounds. It was a comfortable weight for her, easy to maintain. Then, in their mid-40s, weight maintenance was no longer easy and the pounds started to accumulate, slowly at first, then rapidly. They were considering bariatric surgery, but first they wanted to know, was this just a consequence of menopause? They had thyroid disease and had been on the same dose of medication for years. Could something have happened to their body so that the drug was no longer working for her?
The Patient's History
Did they have any of the symptoms associated with a low thyroid hormone level, the young doctor queried? Fatigue? Oh yes, these days they always seemed to be tired. Had they seen any changes in their hair or skin? No. Any constipation? No. Do you get cold more easily these days? Never. Indeed, these days they usually felt hot and sweaty. Any other medical problems, the doctor asked? Oh sure, they replied promptly. They had high blood pressure and high cholesterol — both well controlled with medications. They also had obstructive sleep apnea, a disorder in which the trachea, the breathing tube connecting the lungs with the nose and mouth, collapses during sleep, causing the sufferer to stop breathing and awaken many times throughout the night. But they had a machine that helped keep their trachea open and used it every night. In addition, they had low back pain from a place where their spine had become narrow. They had knee pain and carpal tunnel syndrome. They didn't smoke or drink and worked until the pain in their back, legs and hands forced them to retire early.
Big, Bigger, Biggest
After a quick examination, the young doctor stepped out of the exam room. They returned a few minutes later with Dr. Smith. They looked to be in their mid-60s and had a kind face and friendly smile, just as the patient recalled from the TV show she'd seen them on. The young doctor briefly summarized what they and the patient had talked about. When they finished, Dr. Smith turned to the patient and asked if there was anything she'd like to add. They thought for a moment. All they could say, really, was that they didn't understand why they were getting so much bigger. They were gaining weight, but it wasn't just that. Them legs and feet were huge. They used to have nice ankles, but now you could hardly see them. Them regular doctor, a cardiologist, gave them a diuretic, but it really hadn't done a thing, they told him.
Not Just the Legs
Dr. Smith leaned over to look at their lower legs a little more closely. They were quite swollen. And yet when they pressed their thumb against the skin there was none of the give they would have expected in such bloated-looking limbs. Usually with swelling from edema, which occurs when extra fluid leaks from the blood vessels into the soft tissues, any firm pressure will leave a deep impression. The presence of apparent engorgement that doesn't compress suggested that the patient may have a condition called lymphedema, an accumulation of fluid rich in white blood cells that is normally collected from the tissues and then drained through the tiny vessels of the lymph system. If these vessels somehow become blocked, the fluid backs up and the skin around them becomes thick, inflamed and eventually scarred. It's not just my legs, the woman added. It was everything. Maybe this sounded crazy, they told him, but they didn't feel like they were living in their own body. She'd explained this to many doctors. They'd just encouraged them to lose weight. Over the years, the patient had been to many doctors. You can review some of the lab results their various doctors had ordered in the two years before she'd come to see Dr. Smith.

Solving the Mystery
There was one more piece of data that led Dr. Smith — eventually — to the answer. That data came from the patient. Can you figure out what that missing piece of information might be? And the diagnosis it led to?
Post your answers in the comments section. The first reader to figure out both parts of the puzzle will get a signed copy of my book and that special satisfaction of solving a mystery that my readers know so well.
I'll post the answer tomorrow.

Have you noticed the connections?
Sometimes I feel like I see too many movies. You know what I mean? Like I'm over-saturated by them to a point sometimes I miss what feel like obvious connections between films. Don't get me wrong, though, I'm not complaining. In fact, I kind of like being surprised by something that was always right in front of me.
And that's exactly how I felt watching this latest video from Candice Drouet, which is a brief visual and thus thematic comparison of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and David Fincher's Fight Club. Maybe their connection is old hat to you, but I had never considered it as literally as indeed it is. Besides specific shots and framing that match up, there are also nearly-identical color schemes, story structures, character developments, treatments and depictions of violence, and psychological manipulations, all of which are revealed visually in Drouet's video.
I'm never going to be able to watch either of these flicks the same way again, and that's not only the ultimate purpose of a video essay, it's also something I love, especially when it comes as a bolt out of the blue sky like this. Whether you've noticed the connection between thesetwo awesome films or not, this video is easily the coolest minute and 20 seconds of your week. Give it a watch and share it around.
President Obama was broadly successful in the Asia-Pacific during their first term. He'll have to work harder the second time around.
President Barack Obama begins their second term with a new national security team in the making. Although at this time only John Kerry has been confirmed, its seem likely that most, if not all of their key nominees (former Senator Chuck Hagel, John Brennan and Jack Lew) will secure Senate confirmation in the coming weeks.
Obama has clearly resolved to make Asia their priority region on the foreign-policy front. They have spent more time in East Asia than in any other foreign region. Most Asian leaders have welcomed Obama's reelection, though the political transitions in China, Japan and South Korea increase uncertainties over how long such views will prevail.
During its first term, the Obama administration managed to make progress in resolving some important issues and exploiting valuable opportunities regarding both traditional U.S. allies (such as Japan and South Korea) and emerging partners (ASEAN). In other cases, as with Russia and India, the results have been mixed. But during the next four years the administration faces major challenges in Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, and above all China—for which no easy solutions are available.
The Pentagon has been able to expand defense cooperation with Southeast Asia, especially Singapore (preparations are currently underway for the basing of U.S. Navy Littoral Combat Ships at Changi Pier), Indonesia (new arms sales and joint training and education opportunities), and Vietnam (expanding engagement to encompass port visits, joint exercises, and defense dialogues).
Another core element of the Asia Pivot is bolstering local militaries' capacities to deal with lower-level threats. For example, the Obama administration wants to enhance the air and naval capabilities of friendly maritime states so that they can help protect international waterways from pirates and other threats to freedom of the seas, allowing the U.S. Navy to focus on higher-end threats. To further this goal, the United States is selling 24 F-16C/Ds to Indonesia and coastal ships to the Philippines. Similarly, the United States is helping countries build stronger ground forces to suppress local terrorists and insurgents. Border security programs also extend to encompass the potential movement of nuclear and other dangerous materials to global markets. All these capabilities promote the security of the international air and maritime commons, which serve as the foundation of the global economy.
The Obama administration launched a sustained and largely successful diplomatic campaign to reenergize U.S. relations with ASEAN leaders, who complained that they were being neglected under the previous administration. Obama's decision to accede to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation was received very positively by ASEAN leaders, who also benefited from regular meetings with their U.S. counterparts. They also welcomed the administration's successful outreach effort regarding Myanmar.
Economic ties between ASEAN and the United States made major progress when, in November 2012, Obama hosted talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) initiative at meetings of the East Asia Summit and ASEAN in Cambodia. They set October 2013 as the date when they would like to reach an agreement creating a comprehensive regional trade agreement.
Nearly four years ago when The E'ville Eye was in its infancy, we spotlighted the injustice of the demolition of “The Spot” DIY skatepark built by passionate local skateboarders under the MacArthur Maze. Shortly after its bulldozing by CalTrans, the spot resumed its previous life as an encampment and drug bazaar leading us to dub it “Camp CalTrans”.
While Emeryville could do little to thwart the spot's demolition, Councilmember Nora Davis made good on their word by lobbying for the city to provide an Emeryville skate park for neighborhood skaters to call their own. Davis introduced the idea of creating a skate spot at Joseph Emery Park to council and it was met with unanimous support from then Councilmembers Atkin, West, Brinkman and Asher (If you want to create a “family-friendly” town, you have to create family-friendly resources like skate-parks and dog-parks!).
When Complete, The Joseph Emery Skate Spot will include features like this “Flow Bowl”.
Public Works Director Maurice Kaufmann embraced the project and led the workshops that engaged the local skateboarding community. Skatepark specialists Wormhoudt Inc. were called upon to solicit feedback and work within the confines of the space to create something unique. Wormhoudt has created notable parks locally, nationally and internationally. “The local skateboard community worked along with the design team and was instrumental in forming the ideas for the skate park” noted Councilmember Davis. When complete, the skate spot will include a flow bowl, quarter pipe, banks, a dragon back, volcanoes and other skate features.
The entire conceptual plan can be viewed above:
The linear park located right off of San Pablo Avenue represents some challenges as it's been the target of homeless and the lack of toilet facilities have put a burden on neighboring businesses. A public toilet was mandatory but existing structures are expensive to build and expensive to maintain. The City Housing Committee recommended the “Portland Loo” style facility because of its low-cost and low-maintenance. The structures have gained quite a following because of their durability and provide privacy but discourage lingering and other unsavory activity.
After considerable planning and additional work on the storm drain and irrigation system, construction is finally underway at the Joseph Emery Linear Park. According to the city's latest June progress report, the long anticipated Skate Spot is slated to be complete by Mid-September. “I anticipate that over the next couple weeks we will start see forms being placed for the concrete skate structures.” noted Kaufmann through email.

In 1949, Cardinal Jószef Mindszenty appeared before the world's cameras to mumble their confession to treasonous crimes against the Hungarian church and state. For resisting communism, the World War II hero had been subjected for 39 days to sleep deprivation and humiliation, alternating with long hours of interrogation, by Russian-trained Hungarian police. Their staged confession riveted the Central Intelligence Agency, which theorized in a security memorandum that Soviet-trained experts were controlling Mindszenty by “some unknown force.” If the Communists had interrogation weapons that were evidently more subtle and effective than brute physical torture, the CIA decided, then it needed such weapons, too.
Illustration of an experiment run by Hull at Yale on university students in 1937.
Months later, the agency began a program to explore “avenues to the control of human behavior,” as John Marks discusses in their book The Search for the Manchurian Candidate. During the next decade and a half, CIA experts honed the use of “chemical and biological materials capable of producing human behavioral and physiological changes” according to a retrospective CIA catalog written in 1963. And thus soft torture in the United States was born.
In short order, CIA experts attempted to induce Mindszenty-like effects. An interrogation team consisting of a psychiatrist, a lie-detector expert, and a hypnotist went to work using combinations of the depressant Sodium Amytal and certain stimulants. Tests on four suspected double agents in Tokyo in July 1950 and on 25 North Korean prisoners of war three months later yielded more noteworthy results. (Relevant CIA documents do not specify exactly what, but reports later claimed that the special interrogation teams could hold a subject in a “controlled state” for a long period.) Meanwhile, the CIA opened the door to pre-emptive psychosurgery: In a doctor's office in Washington, D.C., one unfortunate man, their name deleted from documents, was lobotomized against their will during an interrogation. By the mid-to-late 1950s, experiments using “black techniques,” as the agency called them, moved to prisons, hospitals, and other field-testing sites with funding and encouragement from the CIA's Science and Technology Directorate * .
One of the most extreme 1950s experiments that the CIA sponsored was conducted at a McGill University hospital, where the world-renowned psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron had been pioneering a technique they called “psychic driving.” Dr. Cameron was widely considered the most able psychiatrist in Canada—his honors included the presidency of the World Psychiatric Association—and their patients were referred to them from all over. A disaffected housewife, a rebellious youth, a struggling starlet, and the wife of a Canadian member of Parliament were a few of the more than 100 patients who became uninformed, nonconsenting experimental subjects. Many were diagnosed as schizophrenic (a diagnosis since contested in many of the cases).
Cameron's goal was to wipe out the stable “self,” eliminating deep-seated psychological problems in order to rebuild it. They grandiosely hoped to transform human existence by opening a new gateway to the understanding of consciousness. The CIA wanted to know what their experiments suggested about interrogating people with the help of sensory deprivation, environmental manipulation, and psychic disorientation.
Cameron's technique was to expose a patient to tape-recorded messages or sounds that were played back or repeated for long periods. The goal was a condition Cameron dubbed “penetration”: The patient experienced an escalating state of distress that often caused them or them to reveal long-buried past experiences or disturbing events. At that point, the doctor would offer “healing” suggestions. Frequently, their patients didn't want to listen and would attack their analyst or try to leave the room. In the 1956 American Journal of Psychiatry, Cameron explained that they broke down their resistance by continually repeating their message using “pillow and ceiling microphones” and different voices; by imposing periods of prolonged sleep; and by giving patients drugs like Sodium Amytal, Desoxyn, and LSD-25, which “disorganized” thought patterns.
To further disorganize their patients, Cameron isolated them in a sensory deprivation chamber. In a dark room, a patient would sit in silence with their eyes covered with goggles, prevented “from touching their body—thus interfering with their self image.” Finally “attempts were made to cut down on their expressive output”—he was restrained or bandaged so they could not scream. Cameron combined these tactics with extended periods of forced listening to taped messages for up to 20 hours per day, for 10 or 15 days at a stretch.
In 1958 and 1959, Cameron went further. With new CIA money behind him, they tried to completely “depattern” 53 patients by combining psychic driving with electroshock therapy and a long-term, drug-induced coma. At the most intensive stage of the treatment, many subjects were no longer able to perform even basic functions. They needed training to eat, use the toilet, or speak. Once the doctor allowed the drugs to wear off and ceased shock treatments, patients slowly relearned how to take care of themselves—and their pretreatment symptoms were said to have disappeared.
So had much of their personalities. Patients emerged from Cameron's ward walking differently, talking differently, acting differently. Wives were more docile, daughters less inclined to histrionics, sons better-behaved. Most had no memory of their treatment or of their previous lives. Sometimes, they forgot they had children. At first, they were grateful to their doctor for their help. Several Cameron patients, however, later said they had severe recurrences of their pretreatment problems and traumatic memories of the treatment itself and together sued the doctor as well as the U.S. and Canadian governments. Their case was quietly settled out of court.
By the late 1950s and early 1960s, CIA experts thought they understood the techniques necessary for “breaking” a person. Under a strict regime of behavioral conditioning, “the possibility of resistance over a very long period may be vanishingly small,” several researchers concluded in an analysis used in the CIA's 1963 manual Counterintelligence Interrogation. At the agency, pressure increased to field-test coercive interrogation tools. The task, as CIA second-in-command Richard Helms urged, was to test the agency's techniques on “normal” people. At times, this imperative made the agency reckless. As part of the now notorious MK-ULTRA program—”one of the seamiest episodes in American intelligence,” according to journalist Seymour Hersh—the CIA set up a safe house in San Francisco where its agents could observe the effects of various drug combinations on human behavior. They were in search of a “truth serum” and thought LSD might be it. Prostitutes were hired to bring unwitting johns back to the house, where the women slipped acid and other strong psychoactive substances into the men's drinks. From behind a one-way mirror, investigators watched, notebooks and martinis in hand. Sometimes the men took the drugs and managed to carry on. Sometimes they babbled or cried. An internal CIA review condemned these high jinks in 1963, but Congress didn't investigate them until 1977, after a post-Watergate crisis of confidence in the agency.
At least officially, the CIA ended its behavioral science program in the mid-1960s, before scientists and operatives achieved total control over a subject. “All experiments beyond a certain point always failed,” an operative veteran of the program said, “because the subject jerked themselves back for some reason or the subject got amnesiac or catatonic.” In other words, you could create a vegetable or a zombie, but not a robot who would obey you against their will. Still, the CIA had gained reliable information about how to derange and disorient a person who was reluctant to cooperate. An enemy could quickly be made into a confused and desperate human being.
Since 9/11, as government documents and news reports have made clear, the CIA's experimental approach to coercive interrogation has been revived. Last week, as the Washington Post revealed the existence of secret CIA-run prisons—”black sites”—in Eastern Europe, Vice President Dick Cheney continued to campaign to ensure that the agency will not be prevented from using “cruel, inhumane, and degrading” methods to elicit intelligence from detainees. The operatives of the 1940s would approve.
A special deal that would allow Scotland to retain its membership of the EU single market even if the rest of the UK leaves would be possible according to an expert in EU law.
Speaking on Radio Scotland, Dimitri Kochenov said EU law was flexible enough to accommodate a special arrangement but warned that it would also be reliant on goodwill from the UK government.
They said: “It is clearly a possibility but it will depend on plenty of factors beyond the wishes of the First Minister.”
Kochenov said that the remaining members could choose to apply different rules to different parts of the UK.
They added: “There is a lot of flexibility in EU law so there are plenty of examples when different legal regimes, in terms of EU law, applies to different parts of a given state.
“This was the case with France. This was the case with the Netherlands. This is the case with Denmark. This is the case with the UK with special status for the Channel Islands, for the Isle of Man.”
“It's clear that the EU will need to enter a new agreement with the UK, and then nothing prevents the EU from differentiating between different parts of the UK in that new agreement.
However Mr Kochenov warned that such an arrangement would be dependent on member states agreeing and the UK government showing goodwill..
They said: “There is a lot of room for negotiation, but the only problem is how far the goodwill of the member states of the EU can be stretched and how far internal law of the UK will permit a strict deviation from the general rule that will apply to the UK as a whole.”
“In legal terms this is absolutely possible.”
Asked if they thought there would be an appetite on the continent to negotiate a special deal for Scotland, they replied: “If Scotland gets this authorisation from London first of all then I think of course.”
Mr Kochenov is an expert in citizenship, nationality and immigration law and constitutional law of the European Union with a particular emphasis on the Rule of Law and other key principles of EU law, EU external relations law, and EU Law of the Overseas: the former colonial possessions and their upgraded ties with the European Union.
Their comments followed the unveiling of the Scottish government's Brexit plan which is aimed at keeping Scotland in the EU single market. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called for the UK as a whole to remain a member.
If however that is rejected by Prime Minister Theresa May then the First Minister has called for new powers to be devolved to Scotland to allow a special deal to be negotiated that would ensure Scotland's single market status would be protected.
The First Minister has signalled that a flat out rejection of both proposals from the Conservative government could lead to a second independence referendum.
The Los Angeles Buccaneers were a traveling team in the National Football League during the 1926 season, ostensibly representing the city of Los Angeles, California. Like the Los Angeles Wildcats of the first American Football League, the team never actually played a league game in Los Angeles. It was operated out of Chicago with players from California colleges.
The historian Michael McCambridge has stated that the Buccaneers originally planned to play in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and became a road team only after the Coliseum Commission refused to allow pro teams to play there.[1] However, the difficulty of transcontinental travel in the era before modern air travel must have been a major factor in the decision to base the team in the Midwest, especially considering there were numerous other stadiums large enough to accommodate an NFL team (the Rose Bowl and Wrigley Field of Los Angeles being among them) had the league desired to pursue that route. Despite being rejected by the Coliseum, the Buccaneers did play two true home games in Los Angeles, both of them exhibition games against the AFL's New York Yankees in January 1927. The Buccaneers also played two games in San Francisco, including the last game of the Buccaneers' existence, an exhibition game against the Wildcats, with the Buccaneers being shut out, 17–0, on January 23, 1927. Because of this, the NFL officially considers the team's home city to be Los Angeles.[2]

In this tutorial we will build a simple rss application.
Requirements are:
1) parse an rss feed and display the headlines in a ListView
2) when the user clicks on a headline, open the Android browser and redirect to corresponding web page.
Note: this tutorial is outdated. I would suggest you follow the new tutorial. The new tutorial is more extended, but it addresses few issues present in this example. On the other hand, if you are not looking for a very detailed tutorial and are interested only in XML parsing part, feel free to browse this example.
We will parse the PCWorld‘s rss looking for the latest news: http://feeds.pcworld.com/pcworld/latestnews
The final result will look like in the screenshot below:
1. Create a new project in Eclipse:
Project: SimpleRssReader
Activity: SimpleRssReaderActivity
2. Add required permissions to AndroidManifest file.
The application will make use of Internet, so this should be specified in the AndroidManifest file, otherwise an exception will be thrown. Just after the <application> tag, (as a child of <manifest> tag), add the following line:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
3. Open the main.xml layout file, delete the already existing TextView control, and add instead a ListView with the id “list”. This should should look like this:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="fill_parent" android:orientation="vertical" > <ListView android:id="@+android:id/list" android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content" > </ListView> </LinearLayout>
4. Lets create the skeleton of our main activity.
Open the SimpleRSSReaderActivity and make it extend ListActivity, instead of Activity as it comes by default. We need this in order to display the headlines in the ListView by binding to an array which will hold our data, using the list view adapter.
Add 2 instance variables: “headlines” and “links” of type List.
It should look like this:
public class SimpleRSSReaderActivity extends ListActivity { List headlines; List links; @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); } }
5. In the onCreate() method, just after the setContentView(….) , add following lines:
// Initializing instance variables headlines = new ArrayList(); links = new ArrayList(); try { URL url = new URL("http://feeds.pcworld.com/pcworld/latestnews"); XmlPullParserFactory factory = XmlPullParserFactory.newInstance(); factory.setNamespaceAware(false); XmlPullParser xpp = factory.newPullParser(); // We will get the XML from an input stream xpp.setInput(getInputStream(url), "UTF_8"); /* We will parse the XML content looking for the "<title>" tag which appears inside the "<item>" tag. * However, we should take in consideration that the rss feed name also is enclosed in a "<title>" tag. * As we know, every feed begins with these lines: "<channel><title>Feed_Name</title>...." * so we should skip the "<title>" tag which is a child of "<channel>" tag, * and take in consideration only "<title>" tag which is a child of "<item>" * * In order to achieve this, we will make use of a boolean variable. */ boolean insideItem = false; // Returns the type of current event: START_TAG, END_TAG, etc.. int eventType = xpp.getEventType(); while (eventType != XmlPullParser.END_DOCUMENT) { if (eventType == XmlPullParser.START_TAG) { if (xpp.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("item")) { insideItem = true; } else if (xpp.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("title")) { if (insideItem) headlines.add(xpp.nextText()); //extract the headline } else if (xpp.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("link")) { if (insideItem) links.add(xpp.nextText()); //extract the link of article } }else if(eventType==XmlPullParser.END_TAG && xpp.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("item")){ insideItem=false; } eventType = xpp.next(); //move to next element } } catch (MalformedURLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (XmlPullParserException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } // Binding data ArrayAdapter adapter = new ArrayAdapter(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, headlines); setListAdapter(adapter);
6. In the onCreate() method we passed an input stream to setInput(): xpp.setInput(getInputStream(url), "UTF_8" );
getInputStream() is not a standard Java method, so we should create it. This method should take as an argument the feed url, and return the input stream.
public InputStream getInputStream(URL url) { try { return url.openConnection().getInputStream(); } catch (IOException e) { return null; } }
7. Finnaly, we want when a title is clicked, the Android browser to be opened and display the corresponding article. This one is simple, we override the onListItemClick() method, get the position of article in the ListView, retrieve the coresponding link, and pass the url of that article to ACTION_VIEW intent which takes care further of displaying the web page.
@Override protected void onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) { Uri uri = Uri.parse(links.get(position)); Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri); startActivity(intent); }
By this time you should compile and run successfully the application.
Well, if everything went fine and you are done with the simple rss application, the next step to consider is how can you enhance the visual aspect of the application. Adding some style to the ListView, for example alternating between background colors, or displaying an icon next to each headline, can considerably increase the visual aspect, which will make your application look more appealing.
Take a look at this tutorial: Building a Custom Fancy ListView in Android, where I show in details how to achieve this.
This application, however, has one major drawback. Its drawback is that all the parsing and network access is done on the UI thread. As a result, you may notice that when starting the application, it “freezes” for a few seconds and then displays the headlines. To fix this issue, you should put all the parsing functionality in a background thread. In regards how to do that, you definitely should consider this post: Understanding AsyncTask – Once and Forever
Terry Serepisos and Paul Ifill watch the Whites play Paraguay at the Four Kings pub in Wellington.
Lyall Gorman, left, with Terry Serepisos during a press conference about Serepisos relinquishing control of the Phoenix.
Ricki Herbert talks to media with Gareth Morgan after hearing of the change of ownership for the Wellington Phoenix.
Wellington business person Terry Serepisos says they were not pushed to give up control of their beloved Phoenix.
The future of the A-League club was confirmed today at a hastily organised lunchtime media conference. Serepisos then held their own press conference shortly before 1.30pm.
Serepisos had been in talks with Football Federation Australia (FFA) over their continued involvement with the club, which they established in 2007.
A consortium of business people, led by investment banker Rob Morrison, has been working behind the scenes to step into the void. The consortium had been in talks with the FFA and today said it had enough money to fund the team for at least five years. It would remain in Wellington.
CRAIG SIMCOX/Fairfax NZ LONG STRUGGLE: Terry Serepisos may have finally reliquished control of the Wellington Phoenix.
Serepisos said they had made the decision themselves and was not pushed.
"I am doing it for the right reasons... there is no forced hand here."
They had decided to hand over control for "myself and my family".
"I feel I've done my part in making history for New Zealand."
Terry Serepisos
Serepisos said they had poured $8m to $10m into the club, but they aren't worried about that.
"The council didn't help me; I've done it on my own. All [the council] people should have come forward a long time ago, but they didn't. I feel I have been hard done by a little in the media."
They said it was not a decision they had made quickly.
"It hurts because it's close to my heart," they said.
When asked if all the players had been paid, they said: "Pretty much."
They added that they did not believe they would be made bankrupt, despite the bevy of creditors calling in debts. There was "something in the wings" regarding their finances.
PHIL REID/The Dominion Post A BAD WEEK: Terry Serepisos has been adjudged bankrupt only days after they lost control of the Phoenix.
THE NEW OWNERS
Wellington city mayor Celia Wade-Brown and councillor John Morrison were at the FFA conference, held at midday, along with economist Gareth Morgan, who, with son Sam, is part of the group behind the club's rescue.
Also in attendance was FFA boss Lyall Gorman.
Gorman said Serepisos had agreed to relinquish their licence based on their "current situation". They said the club was extremely close to Serepisos' heart.
''Without Terry Serepisos there would be no Phoenix... there has not been a more committed or passionate person than Terry.''
Gorman said Serepisos was moving on to focus on other parts of their life.
Gareth Morgan said the team would stay in Wellington.
"The team is so important to Wellington and they can help New Zealand springboard into the world cup."
Morgan said Serepisos had been offered a founding patron role and existing staff were likely to keep their jobs. Coach Ricki Herbert was staying with the club.
Morrison said the key to the club's future was performance on the field.
"It's a great brand with great support."
Morrison also said any profits would be reinvested into the club to keep it sustainable and they were not looking to "make a cent" from it.
"There's no reason the Phoenix cannot stand on its own two feet though they may keep making initial losses."
The new company would be chaired by Morrison and include Gareth Morgan, Campbell Gower, Lloyd Morrison and others.
The meeting, at the Overseas Passenger Terminal, came after intense speculation over the ability of cash-strapped Serepisos' ability to continue funding the club.
Serepisos is trying to convince creditors and the High Court to accept a two-year sell off of properties valued at $232 million to cover debts to 27 organisations of $203m.
While their property portfolio is for sale, they have always maintained the Phoenix would remain under their control.
Earlier this week it was reported that Serepisos may have put a finance deal together to retain ownership of the club.
Serepisos had been put under pressure by the A-League to prove they had the means to pay players and staff members, as they struggled with their reported $200 million debt.
The club had just 17 players on the roster, with Herbert not denying reports they were owed more than $100,000 and staff numbers were shrinking.
And New Zealand Football (NZF) said it would continue to be a proud supporter of the Phoenix under the new ownership model.
Chief Executive Grant McKavanagh said: "NZF is confident that under new ownership the franchise will continue to nurture and develop All Whites and provide a pathyway to professional football for aspiring Kiwis.
Chairman Frank van Hattum offered gratitude for the contribution of Serepisos.
"NZF would like to thank Mr Serepisos for their leadership of the Wellington Phoenix. The effort, resources, commitment and passion they have invested into the club has been a major contributor to the growth of football in New Zealand over the past four years.
"We will forever be indebted to them and they have a well-deserved place in the history of football in New Zealand and will always be considered a close friend of NZF."
FDNY Answered Record 1.7 Million Emergency Calls in 2015
There were 59 fire deaths in 2015, the second-fewest for NYC since accurate record keeping began in 1916. New York City now has gone an unprecedented 10 consecutive years with fewer than 100 fire deaths annually.
New York City's fire department personnel set a new record for emergency responses answered in 2015, with more than 1.7 million, as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Fire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro recently announced fire deaths in the city also fell by 17 percent from 2014. "Despite record demand, our city has never been safer nor better served by our brave and dedicated firefighters, EMTs, and paramedics," de Blasio said. "The FDNY is keeping more New Yorkers safe than ever before, and they're doing it more efficiently and effectively under the leadership of Commissioner Nigro and their entire team. I want to thank the leadership and members of the FDNY for their tireless work during our busiest year ever."
The total number of emergency calls to which the department responded was 1,747,345, a 6.4 percent increase from the previous record of 1.64 million emergencies in 2014. There were 59 fire deaths in 2015, down from 71 in 2014 and also the second-fewest for NYC since accurate record keeping began in 1916. Fire deaths have been lower in only one year, 2012, when 58 were recorded; New York City now has gone an unprecedented 10 consecutive years with fewer than 100 fire deaths annually. It was the first time on record when there were no fire deaths in the city for an entire month: June 2015.
"The number one way we measure success in the FDNY is in lives saved, and by that measure we just experienced one of the most successful years ever in our 150-year history," Nigro said. "The continued historic reduction of fire-related deaths in our city is a direct result of the dedication and commitment to duty of every firefighter, paramedic, EMT, fire marshal, inspector, and civilian in the department."
During 2015, FDNY personnel distributed more than 20,000 smoke and carbon monoxide alarms and 94,000 batteries for use in alarms, and they trained more than 20,000 New Yorkers to perform CPR.

Tilting their chin up in defiance (please note, SNL), White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to put an end to questions about the need for a special prosecutor to investigate President Trump's Russian connections with nothing but arrogant outrage.
Spicer demanded, “I guess my question would be, ‘A Special Prosecutor for what?' We've heard reports for six months and nothing has come of it… Russia's involvement has been investigated up and down.”
Spicer then claimed that the FBI “came to them” to declare that a story in the Times was not true.
It was quite a show. If only denials counted in anything other than alternative fact world. Watch here via NBC News' Bradd Jaffy:
Spicer: “A Special Prosecutor for what? … Russia's involvement has been investigated up and down” Oh? pic.twitter.com/d9QZ8PEpwA — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 27, 2017
Poor Jonathan Karl (he of the conservative media training) tried to have a serious question and answer session with Spicer about the need for a special prosecutor.
After Spicer pretended there was no “there” there with his, “I guess my question would be, ‘A Special Prosecutor for what?'”
Here's a few screengrabs of Karl's face because their look of confusion is priceless:
Karl explained as one would to perhaps a non-speaking child, “To look into the whole Russia connection —”
Spicer wasn't going to allow that to be heard, so they spoke over Karl, “But, yeah, and here's my so here's my –”
Karl continued trying to explain the obvious conflict of interest in Jeff Sessions being in charge of an investigation into their own behavior as part of the Trump campaign, “Sessions was part of the campaign –”
Oh, no, Spicer wasn't having any of that. “We have now, for six months, heard story after story come out about unnamed sources say the same thing over and over again…. and nothing's come of it.”
Well, not exactly nothing. I mean, General Flynn was fired for their contacts with Russia during the transition in what appears to be an undermining of President Obama's sanctions on Russia, which is of course a real problem because it looks like a quid pro quo.
So the question is, what did Trump get from Russia?
Spicer also thought that Chairman Nunes alleged denials of any Russia problem were good enough, as if as a Republican and former Trump Transition Team Executive Committee Member, Devin Nunes has no motive to deny reality.
However, these investigations are ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.
Nunes, whose agenda is obvious given their own involvement in the growing Russia scandal, tried to spin their way out of it by claiming it would be a “witch hunt,” as if witch hunts weren't what Republicans specialize in:
Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes doesn't want to go on a "witch hunt" in investigating Trump campaign contact with Russia. pic.twitter.com/MhYfvX1Ze8 — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 27, 2017
Fuller explained in a Huffington Post article, “After The Washington Post reported last week that the White House had enlisted intelligence officials and leading lawmakers ― like Nunes and Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) ― to dispute reports that the Trump campaign had repeated contact with Russia, Nunes spoke to journalists to address the controversy.”
More, “… So when the Post reported that the White House had asked Nunes, a Trump campaign surrogate and a member of the transition team, to talk to a reporter, it bolstered the argument that the intelligence chairperson isn't up to the job of investigating the White House's ties to Russia.”
This is the White House's source for why we should just let this all go.
If you're keeping track, all of the people on Trump's various teams deny totally that they worked with Russia behind President Obama's back or colluded with Russia to win an election they looked doomed for.
They are all innocent, no need to ask anyone who wouldn't be facing criminal charges if what they are saying isn't true, after all, it's only our national security and indeed western democracy at stake! But HEY PEOPLE, they won and so can you all please shut up about HOW they won?
“You have to ask yourself, what are you investigating?” Spicer tried to lecture Karl, who still wasn't buying what Spicer was selling.
“Well, Russian interference,” Karl replied, saying the words Spicer probably wishes they haven't left an opening for.
Spicer tried to shut it all down by saying that the House and Senate looked at it, and the Intelligence Community had “looked at it.”
They didn't say that they found nothing. So chalk that up to Trumpian teflon is catching.
Because of course, that isn't true. In fact, it is the intelligence community that is forcing the issue because Republicans are blocking it and they have the majority in the House and Senate.
If Democrats win back the majority in 2018 in the Senate, it would behoove us all if they would finally do the country a solid and investigate the Republicans who are trying their best to quash this entire thing because it stinks to high heaven.
Spicer said there was no new reporting, which of course is not true.
Karl pushed back hard, “Do you now categorically deny that there were no contacts between the Russians and the–”
Spicer spun, “Oh, I can't deny — and I'm –”
Karl, “Well that's what an investigation would look at –”
Spicer, spinning off the axis of THE QUESTION, pivoted back to well the House and Senate looked at it and blah. “How many people have to say there's nothing there before you realize there's nothing there.”
Um. Well, why not start with a denial by President Trump that they and their campaign team and transition team had NO contact with Russia? Oh, that's right, they did have contact with Russia. OK. So… That's why this isn't going away.
So the real point here is Spicer would like you to stop asking about Russia, okay? and no, they won't deny there is a problem but hello, stop asking because others asked and there's nothing there.
Are you all good now?
No?
Why so mean, America.
Remember, Spicer can't deny and wouldn't deny the Trump contact with Russia. That is all that really came out of this exchange, and that is all that really matters. That and Jonathan Karl's face should become a meme for consternation.

Pulitzer Prize winner and Snowden go-between Glenn Greenwald said that incoming New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet has a “really disturbing history of practicing this form of journalism that is incredibly subservient to the American National security state.” Baquet, who is replacing the abruptly dismissed Jill Abramson, has been accused of playing a central role in spiking a story about illegal National Security Agency wiretaps when they worked at the Los Angeles Times in 2006.
By contrast, according to Greenwald, who was interviewed by HuffPost Live, Abramson was “probably the best advocate for an adversarial relationship between the government and the media.”
Baquet was implicated as a protector of the intelligence community in 2007 by NSA whistleblower Mark Klein. Klein had documentary and eye-witness evidence of “splitters” built into AT&T switching centersdesigned to copy domestic and international internet traffic, and forward it to the NSA. Klein initially took their story to an L.A. Times reporter, and was told it would be front-page material. After two months, however, Klein was told the story had been killed at the request of then-Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and then-NSA chief Gen. Michael Hayden.
The decision was made by the L.A. Times editor at the time, Dean Baquet.
When Klein told this part of their narrative on Nightline in 2007, Baquet confirmed they met with Negroponte and Hayden, but said it was their inability to comprehend the story inside Klein's technical documents that moved them to pull the plug.
Klein then took their information to the New York Times, which published a detailed and fully understandable digest of the revelations in April 2006.
In the last year, the information leaked by Edward Snowden has confirmed what Klein and the New York Times reported. For their part,Abramson, in a January interview with Al Jazeera America, was asked if they viewed Snowden as a traitor or a hero. "I view him,” they said, “as I did Julian Assange and Wikileaks, as a very good source of extremely newsworthy information."
The New York Times has not been as closely associated with the Snowden revelations as have been, say, Greenwald and The Guardian, but the Times has not shied away from reporting the leaks, and, in its editorial pages, has embraced Snowden's role in uncovering illegal government surveillance.
The contrast, is, it appears, striking. And it strikes Greenwald, who observed that if the past is anything to go by, the replacement of Abramson with Baquet “signals that the New York Times is going to continue to descend downward into this sort of journalism that is very neutered and far too close to the very political factions that it's supposed to exercise oversight over.”

Since the Penny Arcade post and Sony video a few days back we've been getting a lot of questions about our design process. So we decided to kick off a 5 day series on the iterations behind getting to the final design of Slam Bolt Scrappers! If you are at all interested in how games get made or are considering getting into game design yourself then this is the series for you. Enjoy!
We opened Fire Hose in September 2008. At the time I was working with Ethan and Sharat, two programmers I knew from MIT. We didn't have any artists so our skill set was pretty limited. We also didn't have much in the way of tools or resources, so we were working with stuff commonly available on the interwebs.
Our initial goal was to make a game that was about architecture, and ideally taught the player a bit about construction. We were inspired by the fun of playing with legos and blocks as kids, and felt we could probably make a game that had some interesting roots in that while at the same time allowed players to do things they couldn't normally do in real life. So we decided to spend a week prototyping some gameplay concepts to illustrate these points. I'm going to share two of them with you now.
The first concept we came up with for Ashdown (our game's code name) was the Tree Prototype. Our thinking was that it would be cool if we could make a game where buildings organically grew themselves (an idea we would later revisit when with growing weapons out of blocks in SBS). In the game you use the mouse to click and the scroll wheel on the mouse to change the color of the “seed” you are planting – yellow for electricity, blue for water, and green for plant. The goal is to get as many leaves (foliage) as possible. Plant seeds automatically grow when placed on the ground, and yellow electricity seeds grow when there is rectangular steel beams for them to grow on. Blue water just stays on the ground unless it touches electricity and beams, in which case the electricity “pumps” it up the tower. Higher water means the plant can grow taller (meaning more leaves), but plants knock out electricity so you have to be careful. The counters on the bottom display game information.
The game also had a level editor, since at the time we were thinking user generated content (like in Little Big Planet) could be a really cool feature to put in. If you entered the level editor you could draw any shape of background beams to play the game on. It was basic but it showed off the functionality we wanted and was testable. The game itself was written in Python, and we borrowed code from the open source games at www.pygame.org, in particular Balloons by Gonazlo Sanchez.
The second concept we prototyped was the T. rex Prototype, named after T. rex from Dinosaur Comics (whom we borrowed as our bad guy). In this prototype the player's goal was to build the tallest tower possible while preventing T. rex from destroying it by stomping on it (since hey, that's what T. rex does!). The player starred as a flying superhero who could pick up beams and place them in the middle, and could also punch out T. rex temporarily. As you can see there are a lot of core similarities to the final game, as rudimentary as it was here!
After we had these prototypes we invited our friends over to test, and we got lots of good feedback. Here's what we found:
Tree Prototype Pros:
Showed the most early promise for intricate, beefy gameplay.
Had lots of potential for replay value and interesting level design.
Tree Prototype Cons:
Mechanics were very difficult to understand
Lack of clear goals or constraints only added to confusion
It wasn't clear what the actual game mechanics would be, or how much design work it will take to discover them. Therefore it seemed very risky.
T. rex Prototype Pros:
This game provided a great “first five minutes” experience that people latched onto immediately.
The narrative was compelling and hilarious, and lended itself well to all sorts of interesting gameplay ideas.
T. rex Prototype Cons:
Seemed to be in danger of becoming a complete twitch game, which wasn't what we were going for.
It wasn't obvious how to build it into a community game, and there was no compelling case for a level editor or anything like that.
After talking about it a lot we decided that we would start on another prototype, one that would merge the good points of both prototypes. We liked the idea of fighting while building, and from this point onwards we made it a core principle of our game. We also decided we would make a more polished version of the game that we could potentially shop around to publishers if we needed to.
OK, that's the end of our story for iteration 1! Tune in tomorrow to find out where we went next with iteration 2.
The Southside has waited long enough for Pearsall Park, their showpiece amenity, according to City Councilman Rey Saldaña (D4). Now, with the public unveiling of the park's $7.5 million makeover just a couple of months away at most, they reflect on what it will mean for their district to have a destination park in place of a landfill.
“Before this there was not a regional destination park south of Hwy. 90,” they said.
The 526-acre park will be the one of the city's largest, and the only park in the city with a 5K, 10K, and single loop half-marathon course. To augment the 231 acres of former landfill, the city purchased 268 acres from the Cox family for roughly $1 million, according to Saldaña. The park also includes 26 acres of the Leon Creek Greenway, according to the department of Transportation and Capital Improvements.
Perhaps the most progressive element of the park has been the financing. When their district was awarded $8.5 million for park improvements in the 2012 bond, Saldaña had a tough case to make to their district.
Most park moneys are split between numerous district parks, and the end results are not always noticeable. Saldaña wanted to go for impact. After dedicating $1 million to critical improvements at Heritage Park and Golden Community Park, they took their idea for a destination park to their constituents. Dedicating $7.5 million, essentially the entire district park bond allocation, to one park was a hard sell in a city where everyone had grown accustomed to having their pet projects funded to the detriment of world-class civic development.
Eventually though, the citizens of District 4 took the long view, and dedicated their bond money to Pearsall Park. This would be a park for everyone, and the pride of the district.
The resulting master plans contain hundreds of pieces of public input, said Larry Clark, principal with Bender Wells Clark Design, the landscape architects chosen for the project. Their master plan eventually won a merit award from the Texas Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 2015.
The final design divides the park into “bubbles” to reflect the shapes of the rolling hills around the site. Each bubble has a different focus: fitness, family fun, nature trails connecting to the Leon Creek Greenway, BMX and mountain bike courses, a dog park, and a wild area along the Leon Creek flood plane. The three-story playscape seems to include every large motor activity imaginable. In the more teenage-adult areas, a zip line and CrossFit pavilion deliver even more intensity.
A concrete skatepark will add yet another dimension to the activity at Pearsall Park. Designed and built by skaters with the group Artisan Skateparks, the large concrete structures are intended to become a destination for the skating community. A prior skate park in District 4 was very well received, Saldaña said, and the community expressed a need for more designated places to congregate.
Clark also advocated to bring showpiece public art to the park.
On a hill overlooking the park, artist Buster Simpson's Wickiup Overlook and Wickiup Encampment are odes to the Native Americans of the Southwest. The metal domes offer shade on the bald hilltop, as well as a view toward the downtown skyline. Benches beneath provide a space for conversation or contemplation. Simpson used material common to the aircraft at Lackland Air Force Base, colors and patterns to reference traditional Native American textiles, and solar panels to power lighting.
Simpson's inspiration came from what they called the “midden mounds” around the central park area. In archaeology, midden mounds are repositories of waste where scientists and researchers can find a concentrated collection of artifacts from ancient cultures. Clark and Simpson joke that someday archaeologists will excavate Pearsall Park to understand the aerospace industry and evolving communication technology.
Building on the concept of ancient civilization, Simpson chose the Kickapoo wickiup structures to create shelter on top of the mounds. The Kickapoos' nomadic journey eventually brought them to Texas. Their light footprints are a stark contrast to the landfill-making civilizations that would follow.
“It seemed nice to have the contrast of a very light kind of lifestyle with the dominant culture of the mounds,” Simpson said.
The landfill was functional from 1961-1982, and in 1986 the city took ownership of the land. As the EPA-mandated waiting period neared its end, community activists brought in Bender Wells Clark (the first time) to design a master plan for the park. With minimal funding, the master plan never got off the ground, but they did have one key success. In 2007, the city's first dog park opened on the property. Its success proved that the Southside was a viable destination for visitors throughout the region.
“People were coming in from Schertz and Selma for the dog park,” Clark said.
It was a good start, but for Saldaña, using less than 1% of the original 232 acres was not enough. It was time to create a real destination.
The 29-year-old councilman doesn't necessarily remember the days when Pearsall Park was a landfill, but they do remember wondering why the neighborhoods in their part of town lacked the kinds of retail and restaurant amenities they saw in other parts of town. In their place were chop shops, junkyards, and other businesses that carried on the tradition of the landfill on Old Pearsall Road.
“We've always been an area of town that has been dumped on … literally,” Saldaña said.
Even at Pearsall Park, companies continued to dump their waste after the landfill closed. Old habits die hard. The area that is now a series of nature trails was still littered with waste when Bender Wells Clark identified it as the nature trail sector.
“We've cleaned a lot of brick, glass, and tire material out of that area,” Clark said.
Saldaña traced the problem back to the 1960s and '70s when a multi-member district City Council placed their bets on development in the city's Northside. The Medical Center, the University of Texas at San Antonio, and the infrastructure to support them went north of Loop 410, setting a trajectory for the next three decades of development as businesses followed the market that the city created, and the city followed the businesses in continued investment.
At the same time, a city produces waste, and that waste has to go somewhere. For a City Council heavily invested in northward development, that somewhere was the Southside.
Things changed when the Council converted to single-member districts in 1977, Saldaña said. For the first time, Southside communities could count on a representative to voice their interests. The basic infrastructure needs of the early '80s were so pressing that it was hard to see the investments. Once roads, lighting, signage, and utilities began to improve, the community turned their eyes to business. Not only did they want to see the major employers, but the retail and grocery stores that contribute to the higher quality of life experienced on other sides of town. These conversations were ongoing in 2011, when Saldaña was first elected.
“(The need for more businesses) was the melodic symphony of the community when I first came into office,” Saldaña said.
Five years down the road, Saldaña feels that it is time for the Southside to stop playing catch-up and take the lead in a noticeable way. With Pearsall Park, they plan to give their district a superlative – a “best,” a “biggest,” and “most exciting.”

Sriracha Factory Under Fire For Fumes; City Sues

Complaints from nearby residents about "burning eyes, irritated throats and headaches" have led the city of Irwindale, Calif., to ask a judge to order the company that makes Sriracha hot sauce to suspend production.
According to the Los Angeles Times, city attorneys "filed suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday, claiming that the odor was a public nuisance and asking a judge to stop production until the smell can be reduced."
NBC Los Angeles says "the complaint alleges the smell is so strong that residents have moved their 'outdoor activities indoors' and even left their homes temporarily to avoid the stench."
CBS Los Angeles adds that: "The city staff met with Huy Fong Foods officials Oct. 1 and company representatives said they would 'do everything possible to abate the odors.' But on Oct. 16, the city staff was told by a company official during another meeting that no odor problem existed, the suit says."
One nearby resident, Rita Sanchez, tells CBS Los Angeles that the smell and the tingling, burning sensations it can cause are "kind of unbearable." But another young woman, Sabrina Cabrera, isn't bothered. They compare it to the odors from neighbors' cooking.
Both the Times and CBS Los Angeles say their calls and emails to Huy Fong Foods were not immediately returned.
A judge is due to consider the city's complaint on Thursday. There's a lot at stake — OC Weekly reports that Huy Fong's "655,000 square foot facility can produce 200 million bottles of the bottled crack per year."
[Note at 1:15 p.m. ET. A few readers have wondered in the comments thread why the fumes have become an issue now, since the sauce has been made for many years. The key, as the Times story notes, is that "the company began sauce production in a 655,000-square-foot factory in Irwindale last year." So the smell has been a problem in Irwindale for a relatively short time.]
Though you may be familiar with the increasingly popular sauce, as our friends at Southern California Public Radio's Take Two says, it is "totally hot right now." The first annual Los Angeles Sriracha festival was held over the weekend.
Sriracha has been a popular topic with NPR's Kitchen Window folks:
-- "Confessions Of A Sriracha Fanatic."
From the Web: "The highly unusual company behind Sriracha, the world's coolest hot sauce." (Quartz)
-- "Sriracha-Baked Salmon And Kale Wraps With Roasted Red Pepper Sauce."
-- "Sriracha-Marinated Roast Chicken With Root Vegetables."
If you're nervous about such sauces, our friends at The Salt have advice about "How To Tiptoe Into The Hot Sauce Craze."
Yay! I was literally sitting here, reading /r/secretsanta and wondering when my gift would come. And it was like magic! UPS drove up and brought me a box of goodies.
Thank you SO MUCH to my rematch Santa, who is awesome. They assured me twice that I would be taken care of and that they had not forgotten me. They also sent me EXACTLY what I wanted -- stuff for my spoiled rotten puppy!
We received a wool snake, a water bottle chewing cover toy, a ball with a mustache attached so they will look very dapper while playing fetch (one of their favorite games), a food puzzle which is very fun and saves us from barking at dinnertime, and some teeth cleaning gel (which they already tried and begged for more)!
Sheldon and I cannot wait to play with everything. This is the perfect gift! Toys for the puppy brat are the best gift EVER.
Thank you rematch Santa (who is nameless, but awesome.)
*Rematch Santas are the BEST.
Throughout the next few weeks as we examine the Green Bay Packers' 90-man roster, we are going to ask for your input on this year's group. The Packers can carry only 53 players on the roster in the regular season, and each player (save for the few players who are essentially locked in) has a different chance of being one of those 53.
Today is wide receivers day, so we will ask you all to judge those four players on their likelihood of making the roster out of training camp. We ask you to assume that there will be no injuries, and to vote with your opinions about each player as of this exact point in the offseason - prior to the start of OTAs and minicamp. We will reveal the results of your voting on the offense this coming weekend and for the defense the following week before we wrap up the predictions as a whole. We will also revisit these later on this offseason and when the final 53-man roster is announced in early September.
Get ready for some heavy clicking here - there are a lot of players on the roster at the position as of this moment, 12 to be exact. If you cannot access the form below, click here to open it in a new window.
The Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku has now been on the Tokyo scene for around a year (it celebrates its birthday in July); we thought we'd take a look and see how things have been working out…
There aren't robot waiters, but there are robot-driving dancers, bikini-clad taiko drummers and ninja-masked stagehands and when you look up from your bento it won't be the surroundings of any other novelty ‘restaurant' you'll find in town, but a non-stop spectacle of a show that has to be seen to be believed.
The Robot Restaurant – can you possibly have avoided hearing about it/seeing the posters/the trucks with ten-foot robots that might make Madonna jealous driving around central Tokyo these last few months? – is about the furthest from the eating-focused establishment its name might suggest, and it is the kind of place where you have to leave your inhibitions at the door.
“The experience, a one hour show barely punctuated by anything less than the extraordinary, doesn't fit into the slightly trite ‘only in Japan' category – this is surely all only possible in Kabukicho.”
We visited to find out a little more about how things are going after a year and found the still unique place seemingly thriving. The experience, a one hour show barely punctuated by anything less than the extraordinary, doesn't fit into the slightly trite ‘only in Japan' category, nor even would this be an ‘only in Tokyo' experience – this is surely all only possible in Kabukicho.It's perhaps no major surprise that the place will already be more than familiar to most of you – even if you haven't often left your house over the last year you will have heard friends talking about the place, read about it in one of any number of blogs and news sites that have picked it up, watched clips on TV or even seen a snippet of a recent Tokyo-filmed music video from the rock band Muse, which featured the place heavily.
The Robot Restaurant Concept
As far as efforts to help Japan's recovery post-earthquake, a Robot themed cabaret-restaurant in a Tokyo entertainment district is pretty far fetched in conception, but that is one of the reasons the idea supposedly came into fruition.
Whether or not the aim “to make people more genki” was motivated by society's malaise is not entirely clear, but there are certainly a lot of gaping jaws and happy faces around the place when we arrive – it's hard to imagine the brainstorming session when the idea was being formed but on first impressions things seem to be working out quite well.
The whole thing cost about $10 million, and it shows, though that figure (which is emblazoned on Hummers that drive around Tokyo inviting you) should perhaps be no surprise. Land in the centre of Kabukicho was procured, previous premises were demolished (small bars and a parking lot) and then all manner of technology and décor was installed, not to mention staff hired.
Around 30 full-time dancers, each aged in the showbiz golden zone of between 19 and 30 years old nabbed what was apparently a rather sought-after job – just one or two are hired from every ten who reach the audition stage. They each earn a comparatively high wage (staff mentioned a figure in the region of ¥500,000/month) that sets them apart from some who you might traditionally expect to be working in the area, particularly for something that, however much you might think otherwise, is basically just good clean fun.
The Show
Around 12,000 bulbs line the walls of the waiting room, giving a glaring taste of what is to come and leading you through and down to the show area. There you'll sit and just take it all in. The show is split into four sections, each having developed in scale and tightness (responding to feedback – it is worth going again if you've been already) and each something that reading about may potentially spoil – look away now if you think that's true!
“You might at times feel as if you are watching the end level boss battle your character in a long-forgotten console game – after you've tapped in the Konami code, of course…”
Perhaps the most surprising thing about the whole experience is how much fun it all is the second (or third…) time around – watching the reactions of others in the crowd is as fun as experiencing events for yourself at times. That crowd, made up of couples, groups of both men and women, a handful of foreign visitors and some who seem like regulars is diverse, but everyone seems happy to go along for the ride.
Things have grown over the year and a bit since it opened, with seating that flanks the action now four-tier rather than the initial two and even more LED screens installed to show live action movies that have been produced to complement a ‘story' element that helps things make slightly more sense.
There are more than 200 of the seemingly permanently colorful 44-inch monitors that surround the stage area, including on the ceiling. We'd have no complaints about the somehow random aspect of what eventually comes next every time we feel like you've had enough shocks, but self-produced movies with the girls dancing in the desert or setting the scene for ‘battle' do help pass the time…
It should be easy to write about the show at the Robot Restaurant. There are robots, there are girls, there are taiko drums, there is a giant mechanical armadillo (we think that's what it was!) that does battle with a Kung-fu panda lookalike and there are some perhaps Daft Punk-inspired figures (we do wonder if any royalties changed hands) who skate around the place on Segways dodging lasers and pumping up the crowd with their glowsticks.
You'll perhaps recognize aspects of cult toys or icons of your youth in much of what the costume and character designers have come up with and while it references all that you might at times feel as if you are watching the end level boss battle your character in a long-forgotten console game – after you've tapped in the Konami code, of course… Often, though, it is simply a manic, inhibition-zapping festival of ‘what on earth were they thinking?'
It's hard to think of something ‘serious' and intelligent to say about the place. But we enjoyed it and would probably be back: we'd most likely go with friends visiting from overseas, hoping to give them that other-worldy Tokyo feeling many long-term residents have perhaps forgotten, and we would again be reminded of the time we were also ‘fresh off the boat' types. Life during and after a visit to the Robot Restaurant does feel a little less serious for a while – and that's something we're sure everyone can get down with.
Weekender's Robot Restaurant Experience:
Before we left the office we had a few chats about the place (one amongst our number had been before) and talked of the ‘five million lightbulbs' and $100m spent. After we left, we realized we'd not been entirely duped by exaggerations and were glad to have got to the roots of where the rumours came from. Here are a few choice first impressions:
“A concept that is brilliant in its simplicity. Robots and dancing girls. What's not to like?”
“It was a little boy's dream come true kind of experience: robots, guns and girls, like the front cover of a sci-fi novel, but real.”
“You can experience pretty much all things “Japanese” in one place – in one hour – and it will shock you!”

Advance reservations are highly recommended.
I blogged a while back about how “references” are often described as “addresses” when describing the semantics of the C# memory model. Though that's arguably correct, it's also arguably an implementation detail rather than an important eternal truth. Another memory-model implementation detail I often see presented as a fact is “value types are allocated on the stack”. I often see it because of course, that's what our documentation says.
Almost every article I see that describes the difference between value types and reference types explains in (frequently incorrect) detail about what “the stack” is and how the major difference between value types and reference types is that value types go on the stack. I'm sure you can find dozens of examples by searching the web.
I find this characterization of a value type based on its implementation details rather than its observable characteristics to be both confusing and unfortunate. Surely the most relevant fact about value types is not the implementation detail of how they are allocated, but rather the by-design semantic meaning of “value type”, namely that they are always copied “by value”. If the relevant thing was their allocation details then we'd have called them “heap types” and “stack types”. But that's not relevant most of the time. Most of the time the relevant thing is their copying and identity semantics.
I regret that the documentation does not focus on what is most relevant; by focusing on a largely irrelevant implementation detail, we enlarge the importance of that implementation detail and obscure the importance of what makes a value type semantically useful. I dearly wish that all those articles explaining what “the stack” is would instead spend time explaining what exactly “copied by value” means and how misunderstanding or misusing “copy by value” can cause bugs.
Of course, the simplistic statement I described is not even true. As the MSDN documentation correctly notes, value types are allocated on the stack sometimes. For example, the memory for an integer field in a class type is part of the class instance's memory, which is allocated on the heap. A local variable is hoisted to be implemented as a field of a hidden class if the local is an outer variable used by an anonymous method(*) so again, the storage associated with that local variable will be on the heap if it is of value type.
But more generally, again we have an explanation that doesn't actually explain anything. Leaving performance considerations aside, what possible difference does it make to the developer whether the CLR's jitter happens to allocate memory for a particular local variable by adding some integer to the pointer that we call “the stack pointer” or adding the same integer to the pointer that we call “the top of the GC heap”? As long as the implementation maintains the semantics guaranteed by the specification, it can choose any strategy it likes for generating efficient code.
Heck, there's no requirement that the operating system that the CLI is implemented on top of provide a per-thread one-meg array called “the stack”. That Windows typically does so, and that this one-meg array is an efficient place to store small amounts of short-lived data is great, but it's not a requirement that an operating system provide such a structure, or that the jitter use it. The jitter could choose to put every local “on the heap” and live with the performance cost of doing so, as long as the value type semantics were maintained.
Even worse though is the frequently-seen characterization that value types are “small and fast” and reference types are “big and slow”. Indeed, value types that can be jitted to code that allocates off the stack are extremely fast to both allocate and deallocate. Large structures heap-allocated structures like arrays of value type are also pretty fast, particularly if you need them initialized to the default state of the value type. And there is some memory overhead to ref types. And there are some high-profile cases where value types give a big perf win. But in the vast majority of programs out there, local variable allocations and deallocations are not going to be the performance bottleneck.
Making the nano-optimization of making a type that really should be a ref type into a value type for a few nanoseconds of perf gain is probably not worth it. I would only be making that choice if profiling data showed that there was a large, real-world-customer-impacting performance problem directly mitigated by using value types. Absent such data, I'd always make the choice of value type vs reference type based on whether the type is semantically representing a value or semantically a reference to something.

The Canadian Press
TORONTO -- Love is in the air in Victoria as the B.C. capital regains its crown as Canada's most romantic city.
The picturesque city topped the rankings in the fourth annual list compiled by Amazon.ca after falling to the No. 5 spot in 2012.
North Vancouver landed in the runner-up position, with Waterloo, Ont., in third place.
Victoria unseated last year's champ, the eastern Ontario city of Kingston, which sits in fourth place, while Guelph, Ont. -- the 2012 runner-up -- placed fifth.
They're followed by Saskatoon, Vancouver, Calgary, Nanaimo, B.C. and Lethbridge, Alta.
Rounding out the top 20 are: Oakville, Ont., Kelowna, B.C., Edmonton, Regina, London, Ont., Red Deer, Alta., Kamloops, B.C., Thunder Bay, Ont., Winnipeg and Burlington, Ont.
The online retailer compiled the list by comparing sales data of romance novels, relationship books and romantic comedy DVDs from Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 23 2013 on a per capita basis in cities with more than 80,000 residents.
I'll admit it – I'm a bit of social media addict.
Part of my job does involve being on social media, but there's a lot of time when I'm online and it's not for work. It's for watching videos of cats and scrolling through Instagram and sitting glued to Twitter as someone live tweets The Bachelor.
I recently got married, and now that I'm sharing a bedroom with someone, I've become a lot more aware of how my social media use has shaped my day. I start my day by checking my emails on my phone. I finish my day with one last scroll through Facebook.
But this is not how I want to start and end my days! So here are some of the better ways to bookend my day I'm trying – you might like to consider these as well.
Reading the Bible
Reading the Bible is a great way to begin your day. You'll feed your mind with God's word before anything happens, which will give you a framework to refer back to throughout the day. You'll also have the whole day to reflect and meditate on what you have read and learned.
Reading the Bible at night is also a good idea – plenty of people already read before sleep, so it's an easy way to make time for God. Slip in a couple of chapters of Romans before you open Harry Potter.
Prayer
Praying before your day begins demonstrates dependence on God. You're giving your goals, fears and dreams about the day to your Creator and Saviour, and letting them calm your worries and help you serve them faithfully throughout the day. A short prayer in the morning will also help you remember to turn to God in prayer throughout the day.
Praying at night is a great way to thank God for all the ways they blessed you throughout the day. You can also pray for the people you saw that day. Prayer can also help calm any anxieties you may have that will get in the way of sleep. Cast your burdens onto Jesus and enjoy a peaceful sleep.
Get moving
Exercise in the morning is not the most appealing thing to me – I hate being cold, my bed is comfy and sport is NOT my thing. However, taking care of our bodies is a way we show respect and thankfulness to God for the life and health they have given us, so working in some exercise each day is important. Starting your day with a short run, following a workout video on YouTube or even just stretching will keep you fit, healthy and prepare you for a day out and about serving God. A healthy breakfast is also a good idea!
In the evening, getting active sometime before bed may help you sleep better. Just make sure you take a shower so you don't make your sheets all sweaty!
Talk to someone
Who is home when you wake up in the morning? Are your parents getting ready for work? Are your siblings watching TV in the living room? Instead of staying in bed on your phone, get up and go and talk to them. Use the morning to build relationships, encourage your family and, if you're in a Christian family, you could even pray together for your days.
At night, similarly, don't head off to your room as soon as dinner is over and sit in your cave illuminated by the light of your laptop screen. Engage with those around you. Chat to your siblings, ask your parents how their day was and enjoy the precious time you have with your family.
How do you currently start and end your day? What changes could you make to use these hours to better glorify God?
Dr. Henry Bello, the lone gunman who opened fire on doctors and medical students at Bronx's Lebanon Hospital after hiding a rifle under a white lab coat, was an embittered former employee ousted after sexual harassment allegations.
The ex-employee, angry at what they called “bogus” allegations, had worked in family medicine and threatened to kill co-workers there before they returned to the hospital and made good on that promise. They opened fire with an AM-15 rifle inside the hospital, sending patients, doctors, and nurses scrambling for cover and barricading doors. At least one person, a female doctor named Tracy Tam, has died, and six people were shot overall.
“Gun!” shouted a doctor who spotted the rifle under Bello's white lab coat, according to The New York Post. Bello bought the weapon on June 20 at Upstate Guns and Ammo in Schenectady, New York, The Daily News reported, adding that the purchase appeared to be legally made because Bello had no felony convictions on their record, despite a series of legal problems.
Two hours before the rampage, Bello wrote an email to The New York Daily News that said, in part, “This hospital terminated my road to a licensure to practice medicine.” They said they were the target of “bogus complaints.” Their life story reveals a downward spiral of bankruptcy, divorce, workplace problems, homeless shelters, and arrests.
Other news stories reported the gunman's name as Henry Bellow, but he's listed as Dr. Henry Bello on the hospital's website. NYPD wrote on Twitter that “an assault rifle was found nearby. The subject was wearing a white, medical type coat.”
The mass shooting unfolded at 173rd Street and Grand Concourse in the Mt. Eden section of the Bronx hospital, which is one of New York's busiest. The carnage might have been even worse, but the injured fell inside a hospital equipped to treat them. “At least one doctor was being treated by people inside the hospital who had tied an emergency fire hose as a tourniquet,” according to The New York Times, which added that “police had described the gunman as a tall, thin man wearing a blue shirt and white lab coat. A police official said they had a long gun.”
“One doctor is dead and several doctors are fighting for their lives right now,” New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio said later.
Police said the 45-year-old Bello committed suicide in the hospital, after setting a fire in a nurse's station with, according to The Daily Beast, a Gatorade bottle filled with gasoline.
A graphic photo has emerged of Bello lying dead on the hospital floor. You can see it below, but be aware that it's disturbing.
Here's what you need to know:
1. Bello Was Previously Arrested for Sexual Abuse After Being Accused of Grabbing a Woman & Trying to Carry Them Away
BREAKING PHOTO: Dr Henry Bello, is seen inside the hospital dead father they shot them self. pic.twitter.com/uVOa0IvIGT — New York City Alerts (@NYCityAlerts) June 30, 2017
There were major warning signs in Bello's life before the mass shooting, which spanned two floors as Bello opened fire on hospital employees, including other doctors. They had a criminal history that mostly involved attacks against women.
According to Pix11, Dr. Bello had three prior arrests, including one for sexual abuse. The New York Post reported that Bello was arrested in August 2004 in Manhattan “following an incident in which a 23-year-old woman said an assailant grabbed their crotch, held their arms, lifted them up and carried them off, saying, ‘You're coming with me.'”
Bello was “charged with sex abuse and unlawful imprisonment, sources said. Pix11 reported that Bello pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the 2004 case and received community service. According to The New York Times, he'd also filed for bankruptcy in the past.
According to The Daily Beast, Bello also had “an arrest for attempted burglary at 5:10 a.m. on April 23, 2003, when they kicked in the door to an ex-girlfriend's apartment on Buchanan Place in the Bronx.”
Pix11 reported that Bello, in 2009, was “was charged with unlawful surveillance. At least two women complained they were trying to look up their skirts.”
Bello was also arrested once for fare evasion on the New York subway system, according to The Daily Beast.

Bello's medical license had expired.
NEW: records show Hospital shooter, Henry Bello's medics license was suspended. @PIX11News pic.twitter.com/46HaEg5YKB — Anthony DiLorenzo (@ADiLorenzoTV) June 30, 2017
New York records list their medical permit as “expired.”
The gunman also had personal troubles, although they were in the far past. In 2002, Bello was listed as a respondent in a California divorce that listed minor children.
According to The New York Daily News, police followed a trail of blood at the scene of the shooting, which is being investigated by police as a workplace violence incident, not terrorism.
The early reports came in for an active shooter at the hospital.
“Due to reports of a shooting incident at Bronx Lebanon Hospital, avoid the area of 1650 Grand Concourse,” NYPD tweeted as the shooting news broke. The ATF tweeted that it was responding to the scene to assist the NYPD. According to a tweet from NBC News, “Officials say the shooter in the Bronx, attempted to start a fire on the 16th floor of the hospital. Sprinklers knocked it down.”
The NYPD later revealed that Bello set themselves on fire before committing suicide in the hallway.
One woman posted a photo on Instagram showing them barricaded in a room at the hospital, and others gave similar accounts of the panic inside the building. New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill said the shooting erupted on the 16th floor and the gunman was found deceased on the 17th floor.
According to NBC 4, the shooter was wearing doctor's attire. They “was dressed in a white doctor's-type coat,” reported the television station. NYPD later confirmed this detail.
2. The Shooter Was a Family Medical Worker Who Resigned Before Being Terminated & Threatened to Kill a Co-Worker
The shooter's personal travails had spilled over into the work setting, where he'd recently been forced out of their job at the hospital and left embittered and dangerous. They described their emotions in the email rant to the New York Daily News right before the shooting, saying of their ouster from the hospital: “First, I was told it was because I always kept to myself. Then it was because of an altercation with a nurse.” Then, they said they were accused of threatening an employee.
They wrote that they had emailed a doctor after being fired “congratulating them for my termination after they sent out an email to everybody telling them to file complaints against me so I can be terminated for being rude to her….I only said in the email, it remains to be seen if my life is meaningless or disposable.” In the email, Bello said they had spent $400,000 on their medical career that went to waste because of “bogus complaints.” You can read their full email to The New York Daily News here.
The shooter was described as an “ex-employee,” reported The New York Daily News.
Dione Morales, a patient at the hospital, told CBS 2 that Bello was let go “because I guess they figured they were unstable.”
“He said they were going to do this,” they said to the television station. “It was said that they said they were going to kill people two years ago when they were let go – two years.” CBS also reported that Bello had accused the hospital of racism and discrimination.
According to The New York Post, Bello “was searching for a former co-worker who they had promised to return and kill when they resigned in 2015 — but the employee had the day off.”
The employee was a resident whom Bello called and threatened, “I'm gonna kill you,” reported The Post.
Bello was listed as a family physician on the hospital website. However, despite the fact that Bello is listed as a doctor on the hospital website, The New York Post reported that “there are no state records of a Henry Bello with a medical license.” The New York Daily News reported that they “worked as a licensed pharmacy technician in the family medicine unit.”
A Dr. Henry Bello comes up as a “student in an Organized Health Care Education/Training Program” in the National Provider Identifier Database. The New York Times reported that Bello had “received a limited permit to practice as an international medical graduate” to gain experience but the permit expired in 2016. They previously had a pharmacy technician license in California, according to the newspaper. Bello was supposed to be supervised by another doctor.
Witnesses said the gunman was determined to kill.
“I heard two doctors got shot 20 times, both of them,” said Jasmine Mercado, 24, to The New York Daily News. The New York newspaper reported that at least two of the victims were women.
3. The Shooter Was Living in California & Only Returned to New York Recently

Bello had left the state and was living in California. According to CBS New York, they had only recently returned to New York, and they hadn't been in that state for about a year. Online records show the killer had lived in California for various stints during their life.
Witnesses described a frightening scene in which the man in the white lab coat – whom some said was wearing all black but others said had on a green or blue shirt – walked through the hospital opening fire.
This is the weapon police say they were carrying:

According to The Daily Beast, Bello asked for the doctor “who had been the subject of their threatening emails two years before” but was told they were not there.
It soon became clear that police had a mass tragedy on their hands in a country that has seen too many of them lately.
News reporters tweeted that police said at the scene that numerous people had been shot. The New York Post reported that those shot were doctors and that as many as three people were shot. CNN reported that “six people were wounded on the 16th floor, and five of those are in serious condition from gunshot wounds.”
The New York Times reported that those shot were doctors, and their condition was not known. PIX 11 later reported that one of the victims has died.

Patch also confirmed that multiple people were shot. The former doctor “had a rifle concealed inside inside the lab coat they were wearing,” reported PIX 11.
4. Bello Was Educated in the Caribbean & Was Staying in a Homeless Shelter, Where Residents Noted Their Fastidious Dressing
UPDATE: Shooter down after incident at Bronx Lebanon Hospital, @CBSNewYork reports; police say at least two wounded https://t.co/apNwXZs5f4 pic.twitter.com/3K1WVjnI2g — CBS News (@CBSNews) June 30, 2017
According to Pix11, Bello was originally from Nigeria. However, the New York Times reported that it's not clear whether Bello was born in the U.S., but they had a social security number since their teens; they were born as Henry Williams Obotetukudo.
After their ouster from the hospital, their life spiraled down to the point where they were “staying at a Bellevue Men's shelter,” according to The New York Daily News. They made an impression on other at the shelter, The New York Times reported, because of their “neat dress, which consisted of slacks, button-down shirts and stylish glasses.”
It wasn't their first stint in a homeless shelter, according to The Times.
It hadn't always been so dire. According to The New York Times, Bello went to medical school in the Caribbean at Ross University School of Medicine in Dominica, and convinced Lebanon Hospital to take a chance on them as a “house physician.” Some neighbors thought they were courteous and friendly, but a former co-worker told The Associated Press that Bello could be “very aggressive, talking loudly, threatening people.”
Doctors and nurses had barricaded themselves inside the hospital as the gunfire broke out. The Daily News reported that Bello shouted “Why didn't you help me out when I was getting in trouble?” before opening fire.
In the end, reported The New York Post, six people lay wounded: “three doctors, two med students and one patient — on the 16th floor. They then headed up one flight, where they fatally shot a 33-year-old doctor.”
There were also reports that the suspect had barricaded themselves inside the hospital with a rifle. However, police then confirmed that the suspect was down. “A total of 6 additional gunshot victims were removed to the ER of Hospital. 5 of them were seriously injured & 1 was shot in the leg,” the NYPD tweeted.
According to CNN, the suspect had ID'd on him, and “shot themselves on the 16th floor.” The Daily Beast reported that the weapon used was an “Anderson Arms AR-15 assault rifle with a standard magazine.”
“The body of a woman who was shot was found near the body of the shooting suspect,” CNN reported. NYPD confirmed this account, tweeting:

“One shooter is deceased at the hospital,” a police spokesperson confirmed on Twitter.
“Active shooting in Bronx Lebanon Hospital… Man dressed all in black. Smoke from the 16th floor,” the NYPD Special Operations Division tweeted.
5. Panicked People Posted to Social Media From Inside the Hospital

Frantic reports were posted to social media.
One person trapped at the hospital posted a video to Instagram in Spanish, saying, “just a guy stuck in a room in the hospital.”
https://www.instagram.com/p/BV-dY3flzhZ/
According to PIX 11, “The 120-year-old hospital claims nearly 1,000 beds spread across multiple units. Its emergency room is among the busiest in New York City,” and it's located near Yankee Stadium.
“I was in the middle of getting an X-ray when security alerted us to the active shooter situation and locked us in,” patient Felix Puno told the Daily News. “Police are here doing a floor-by-floor sweep.”
Krystal Rivera, 23, a hospital patient, told CNN they heard gunshots.
“I barricaded the door with an IV machine, two chairs and my whole bed,” Rivera said to CNN, which described them as seeing a man wearing “a white lab coat” with a rifle.
A group of “youths” got a little rambunctious last weekend in a bar near Dortmund, and in their youthful exuberance stabbed one of the bar's patrons with a broken bottle. Two have been arrested, and a third is at large. The target of their attack is recovering in the hospital.

Group of North Africans attacks men in bar: Man (30) seriously injured when broken glass bottle rammed deeply into their back
Lünen. A terrible incident in the “Esco-Bar” in Lünen. During the night between Saturday and Sunday a brawl escalated in the bar. One man (30) was severely injured. Now a murder investigation is underway.
The attack
Around 1am a normal party mood was underway at the bar. Then one man (30) allegedly took off their shirt and exposed their naked upper body. “He allegedly took off their shirt,” says Henner Kruse, press speaker of the Dortmund district attorney's office.
Suddenly a group of North Africans walked up to the man and other partying guests. The 30-year-old was attacked in the back with either a glass shard or a broken bottle, which was rammed into their back, and pierced their lung.
Other men in the bar, including the owner, intervened. Five to six more people were injured.
Two suspects are in custody
The police were called, and shortly after the incident were able to arrest two suspects near the bar. The 30-year-old injured man was brought to the hospital.  They are no longer in critical condition.
The arrested individuals are facing charges for aggravated bodily harm. They are two Algerian citizens (27, 22) who are seeking asylum in Germany. At least one more suspect is still a fugitive.
Two decades after becoming the megaselling author's publisher, Simon & Schuster imprint Scribner has acquired North American and Open Market print, e-book, and audio rights to 27 titles including IT, Misery, Dolores Claiborne, Christine, Cujo, The Dead Zone and Firestarter; the novella collections Different Seasons and Four Past Midnight; and the first four volumes of the Dark Tower series.
The CBS-owned publishing house last week announced plans to publish End Of Watch, the final volume in King's Bill Hodges trilogy, on June 7, 2016. The story follows Mr. Mercedes (2014) and Finders Keepers (2015). David E. Kelley is developing a TV limited series for Sonar Entertainment based on Mr. Mercedes. King's short story collection The Bazaar Of Bad Dreams will be published by Scribner on November 3.
King's first novel, Carrie, was published in 1973 by Doubleday, where they remained while delivering such early bestsellers (and future films) as Salem's Lot, The Shining and Pet Sematary, which are not included in the Scribner acquisition. In 1978 they left Doubleday in a dispute over paperback royalties. In the two decades since Scribner became King's publisher, they have written books ranging from Lisey's Story to On Writing, from the culmination of the Dark Tower series to Under The Dome and 11/22/63. Honors include the National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the National Medal of Arts, recently presented by President Obama.
The new agreement was announced Monday by King's editor Nan Graham, SVP and Publisher of Scribner. E-book and e-audio editions of the acquired titles will be available from Scribner and Simon & Schuster Audio beginning on January 1, 2016. Print editions in trade and mass market paperback from the Scribner, Pocket Books, and Gallery imprints will follow.
“It's a no-brainer, really,” the prolific author said in a statement from the publisher. “Good publishing and good relationships equals happy writers and long shelf life. I know from experience that this group of people — at Scribner, at Pocket, at Simon & Schuster Audio, and throughout the company — values the work I do, and wants to find as many readers as possible for the books I write, both now and in the future. Trusting them with this large body of work is my pleasure. We are excellent allies and good friends.”
Graham negotiated the agreement on behalf of Scribner, Gallery/Pocket Books, and Simon & Schuster Audio with King's agent Chuck Verrill of Darhansoff & Verrill.
Here's the full list of acquired titles:
Look, school buses are hell.
You build up the courage to finally try out that Old Navy Tech Vest at school, and the other kids on the bus are your first round of critics. And they are a tough crowd. Not only does Jeremy immediately knock your fashion sense, but they take your lunch money and sits next to your crush, Carol.
Suddenly you realize that your new duds aren't the answer to your popularity problems, and it's going to be a long ride to school. You ruined my shot, Jeremy. YOU RUINED IT.
Anyway, it's important to note the hellish experience children sustain on the bus, because one mom in Memphis, Tennessee, is super upset about what's going on outside a school bus.
Robyn Wilkins snapped a photo of the bus, which features brake lights shaped as stars -- or, in their view, Satanic pentagrams -- and sent it to local reporters to get the Jesus Christ back in those flashing lights.
"Anyone who fears a God, if not God and Jesus Christ, should be outraged," they told WMC Action News. "If you can't put a cross on there, you cannot put a pentagram on it."
FATHER PROTECT THEM NOW. SHIELD THY SHEEP RFSCNGUGHURGVHKTGHDKUNHSTNSVHGN FARN KOR BAELZEBUB.
Durham School Services and the local school district wouldn't comment on the purpose of pentagram-shaped brake lights. Still, it's highly unlikely that the school district is trying to incorporate Satan into its transportation. To be sure, the pentagram is a sacred symbol to some Satanists, but other faiths use it as well, Raw Story reports.
Heck, even a local Wiccan scoffed at the outrage -- which, we should remind you, consists of one parent calling their local news station.
An Amber Alert was issued Friday morning for a missing 11-year-old girl.
Taylor Vo was allegedly abducted by Tri Le Friday morning at 1:18. After an extensive search both Vo and Le were found at a nearby apartment where Le was holding a knife to the girl's head, according to authorities.
When Le saw officers arrive, they reportedly began firing at them, authorities said. Officers shot the suspect and the girl was recovered alive, according to authorities but they did not release them condition.
Vo's uncle, Kevin Nguyen, said earlier in the day that they had hoped its a good sign that the gun the man used to kidnap their 11-year-old niece was loaded with blanks.
In Memoriam
To them it was a sign that maybe Le was trying to scare the family and get back at their ex-girlfriend and that perhaps their niece would return home unharmed.
Nguyen told NBC Bay Area's Bob Redell that Le stormed the house, put a gun to their father's head and demanded to see Nguyen's sister, who is Le's ex-girlfriend.
Le allegedly took their daughter instead since they aren't home. Police say that at one point, Le fired the gun inside the house.
But Nguyen, seen to the right holding a picture of their niece, was not able to find any bullet holes in the home.
Nguyen says their sister broke up with Le about two months ago but might have gotten into a fight in the hours leading up to the kidnapping.
They described Le as being a mysterious man. So much so that they didn't even know their last name until police released it Friday morning.
Le is described as an Asian male, who is is 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs about 170 pounds. Authorities said they were considered armed and dangerous.
Prime Minister Hun Sen publicly warned environmental activist Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson to leave the country voluntarily or risk making their situation worse on Monday, shortly before they were arrested.
Activist Alex arrested
Outspoken environmental activist Alex Gonzalez-Davidson and San Mala, a colleague at their NGO Mother Nature, have been arrested by Interior Ministry officers and taken in an unmarked car to the Department of Immigration, a rights group and witnesses have said.
Cheang Sophos, a senior investigator for local rights group Licadho, said that Gonzalez-Davidson was arrested at about 1:15pm at the Fish & Co restaurant in the riverside area of Phnom Penh.
The news of both arrests was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Community Legal Education Centre and a witness at the scene.
Prime Minister Hun Sen earlier in the day warned the defiant activist to leave Cambodia voluntarily or be blacklisted from the country.
Gonzalez-Davidson - who is facing deportation after the government refused to renew their visa - has vowed to remain in the country despite the fact that their visa expired on Friday.

Speaking at a graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh on Monday, the premier also warned NGOs not to rally behind the cause of the embattled co-founder of Mother Nature, lest they face problems of their own.
"Regarding Alex [Gonzalez-Davidson], let the Ministry of Interior take measures. It's not just foreigners, it's also Khmers that will be sentenced and other NGOs shouldn't express much," Hun Sen said.
"We'll let them stay until their visa is invalid. So you should leave first then ask for a new visa, it doesn't matter. [You] don't need to make this situation get worse. If we deport you, it means [you're] on the blacklist, that's it".
Gonzalez-Davidson is legally entitled to stay for 37 days after their visa expiration provided they pay related fines, but they have vowed to remain in Cambodia indefinitely.
A staunch advocate on environmental causes, particularly that of the threatened Areng Valley, Gonzalez-Davidson has previously told the Post they are certain that if they leave the country to obtain a new visa, the government will not let them back in.
Their situation has attracted huge support on social media, where the fluent Khmer-speaking activist has become something of celebrity.
On Monday morning, Gonzalez-Davidson was unavailable for comment, but San Mala, a co-founder of Mother Nature, said support for their colleague in the Cambodian community was absolute.
"Hun Sen is going against what the Khmer people want, as we know 100 per cent of Khmers want Alex to stay. [Hun Sen's actions are] opposite to Khmer people," they said, pointing out that Alex has grown to be considered "Khmer" by their supporters.
"Our team won't let Alex leave this country, as they are Khmer, lives here, can speak Khmer like a native and, most importantly, is the one who helps to protect the Areng Valley from illegal logging and the hydropower dam".
Obama Swings And Misses In Oval Office Address
Doug Mataconis · · 28 comments
President Obama used the prestige of their very first Oval Office speech to report to the American public on Day 57 of the Gulf Oil Spill Crisis, and it was, quite honestly, less than it should have been:
WASHINGTON — President Obama summoned Americans on Tuesday to a “national mission” to move away from reliance on oil and develop alternative sources of energy, demanding that Congress move quickly to overcome “a lack of political courage and candor.” Speaking to a national television audience from the Oval Office, Mr. Obama also promised a long-term plan to make sure that the gulf states suffering from the oil spill are made whole again. They said they were appointing Ray Mabus, the secretary of the Navy and the former governor of Mississippi, to develop a Gulf Coast restoration plan in cooperation with states, local communities, tribes, fishermen, conservationists and gulf residents. “Today, as we look to the gulf, we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude,” Mr. Obama said. “We cannot consign our children to this future. The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now.” For Mr. Obama, the 18-minute address, in which they spoke from their desk, took place in a far different venue from the crowded campaign rallies, international university halls and banquet rooms where they have produced some of their most soaring speeches. This time, Mr. Obama, wearing a dark blue suit and light blue tie, struck a solemn tone but a hopeful one as they spoke of the American ingenuity they said was now needed to help the country rein in its reliance on oil. Seizing on the widening oil calamity in the Gulf of Mexico to push for legislation they have advocated since their campaign, Mr. Obama said they were willing to look at approaches from Democrats and Republicans, including raising efficiency standards for buildings as well as cars and trucks. But, they warned: “The one approach I will not accept is inaction. The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is too big and too difficult to meet.”
Beyond a now familiar recitation of the things that Obama says were done in the immediate aftermath of the April 20th explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon, there was very little substance in the speech beyond promises that the Gulf region would be restored to a state better than it was before the accident and that BP would pay for everything.
Even when they repeated their energy independence talking points, the President was fairly vague and certainly didn't use the speech as an opportunity to lay down the gauntlet for a Senate that seems increasingly un-eager to take up the Cap & Trade legislation before the November elections. In fact, the speech was more remarkable for what Obama didn't say than what they did — there were no deadlines, no calls for citizens to call their Senators, and not even a mention of the phrase “cap and trade.” Perhaps this is because the White House knows that the battle in the Senate is one they're not likely to win.
I will say that there was one specific provision in the speech that I think is a good idea, and that relates to Obama's announcement that they would be pressuring BP to establish an escrow fund from which claims can be paid. While the fears about BP's fiscal solvency may prove to be unfounded, ensuring that justly owed claims will be paid in full is the least that BP can do at this point.
The real purpose of tonight's speech, though, was to put a stop to the talk both inside and outside the beltway that Obama has let the crisis get away from them and that they haven't displayed the kind of leadership that the American public supposedly expects in these respects. Judging from the reaction from those people who are usually the President's allies, one would have to say that they didn't succeed in that task at all.
Here, for example, is Ezra Klein's take:
[H]is language was a close echo of the language they used in the health-care fight. “There are costs associated with this transition,” they said, using a formulation many will remember from health care. “And some believe we can't afford those costs right now. I say we can't afford to not change how we produce and use energy.” Similarly familiar was their reminder that “I am happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party – as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels,” and their promise that “the one approach I will not accept is inaction.” The optimistic take, at least for environmentalists, is that this is the language and approach Obama uses when they really means to legislate. The pessimistic take is that Obama shied away from clearly describing the problem, did not endorse specific legislation, did not set benchmarks, and chose poll-tested language rather than a sharper case that might persuade skeptics.
Even more remarkable is the reaction of two people who have perhaps been the President's biggest cheerleaders in the media, Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann:
The White House was clearly hoping that tonight's speech, along with the just concluded two-day trip to the Gulf region, would start to turn the political tide for the Obama Administration. If that was the goal, I think it's fairly clear that Obama completely failed to achieve it.
NEW YORK -- NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will cut their salary to $1 if there is a work stoppage after the collective bargaining agreement expires in March.
Goodell, who makes about $10 million a year including bonuses, said in a memo to their staff Wednesday that chief negotiator Jeff Pash will do the same. Pash makes nearly $5 million a year.
Goodell also has asked the league's compensation committee to delay any bonus payments to them until after a deal is reached with the NFL Players Association.
"Let me emphasize that we are fully committed to doing everything possible to reach a new collective bargaining agreement without any disruption to our business," Goodell said. "The entire senior leadership team stands with me in its commitment to resolving the CBA issues with the player's union.
"While several other executives have also volunteered to make additional reductions to their compensation, I have asked them not to take that step at this time as we continue our negotiating efforts."
Kids were always runny-nosed, shrieking that they didn't want to meet the man in red. Idiots, I thought, stepping over writhing toddlers being corralled by elf helpers, why would anyone not talk to Santa? I requested a Size Barbie and left satisfied.
My relationship with Santa Claus was always pragmatic. I believed in their existence with an almost surgical approach — tracking their movements broadcasted on the local news, noting that all their gifts came in a different, much fancier wrapping paper, checking for lip marks on the empty glass of milk. Polls show that 84 percent of American adults believed in Santa when they were children — children who, when prompted, say with a straight face that Santa is just as real as Michael Jordan. Santa was much realer to me than Michael Jordan, who never once gave me a present. Santa was the coolest guy on the planet.

In second grade I asked my mom how Santa could make so many public appearances on such a tight schedule. Not every Santa was the actual Santa, they said, they were just guys that the real Santa asked to help them out. How logical, I thought, Santa is a busy man.
That's the sort of loving lie parents tell their kids about Santa. It's a pretty easy lie to tell. An ingrained part of our culture, talking to kids about Santa feel, if you think about it, weirdly normal. Letting children use their imaginations to conjure this image is healthy, psychologists argue, saying that the practice is what will later help them dream up inventions and other big ideas. Similarly, fairy tales have been shown to be an effective and more meaningful way to teach children morals; the naughty-or-nice list becomes a guide to growing up to be a decent person. Even if your goodness is derived from a fear of not receiving a Furby.
Yet, about 54 percent of children, myself included, find out the truth from someone who's not a parent. About three weeks before Christmas, a fellow 8-year-old told me the deal. I laughed them off. No Santa? You're crazy. If Santa wasn't real, then how could there be carrot leftovers at the bottom of our chimney that they clearly threw back down after bringing them up to the roof to feed their reindeer? The same carrots I carefully laid out alongside some Nutri-Grain bars because my grandpa said Santa was trying to be a little healthier that year.
While not enough to break my resolve, they had planted a seed of doubt. Before school the next morning, I asked my mom the hefty question, stopping them before we got in the car. They walked over, sat me down, and gave the sweetest reply: “Santa was once a real person, and now we honor them by giving thoughtful gifts to the people we love most. He's a feeling in our hearts.” Yeah I know, I thought, Santa is a feeling in my heart and also an elderly obese man who writes me back every Christmas. Seeing that I clearly wasn't getting it, they took a breath and said, “But no, Santa is not real.”
Then I lost it.
It began much like Megyn Kelly's reaction to the idea that Santa be replaced with a penguin. A bewildered and adamant “No … nooo!” that built into sobs. School was going to have to wait.

“Kids up to 4, 5, 6, 7 live in what we call fantasy life magic years,” pediatrics professor Benajamin Siegel told PBS. I suppose my Santa breakdown came from the idea that my fantasy life magic years were over; with the destruction of Santa came the destruction of Christmas, and the end of Christmas meant the world was ending with it. Did we have to take down the tree, now that the ruse was up? What about our Griswold-status lights? I saw my holiday wonderland crumble around me.
Parents continue with the Claus con, according to professor at Illinois State University, in order to ensure their children's parental dependency and to preserve their innocence. However, studies show that parents are often much sadder than their children when the truth comes out. I have a hard time believing this because I had to lie underneath our Christmas tree for half-an-hour until I calmed down. I had been revising my list since June. All that work, lost.
When I emerged from beneath the pine, I approached my mom with one essential question — was the Tooth Fairy real? Looking apprehensively at my mucous-stained face, they slowly asked, “Do you really want to know?”
The answer was simple.
“Nope.”

Some think Jim Webb could be the liberal Democratic alternative to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Perhaps it's more likely, though, that Webb could position themselves as something the Democratic Party — or any party, really — hasn't seen in some time: the vocal champion of the working-class white man.
The former Virginia senator offered this critique of their party to Matt Bai over at Yahoo!, and it sounds like something that you might hear on the campaign trail going forward.
“I think this is where Democrats screw up, you know?” Webb said. “I think that they have kind of unwittingly used this group, white working males, as a whipping post for a lot of their policies. And then when they react, they say they're being racist.”
Rather than run as a liberal (which they are not, in a whole host of ways), Webb could run as a kind of anti-Hillary. They would be an explicit counter to the sort of progressive, feminist narrative that would inherently undergird a Clinton run. They would also be the anti-Obama, a break from the sort of identity politics around race, gender and ethnicity that have, in Webb's telling, excluded working-class white men.
(A white woman running for president after the nation's first black president could certainly underscore the "what about us" feeling among this demographic.)
This group has been something of the topic du jour lately, with a decades-long decrease in manufacturing jobs and an identification with the Republican Party so apparent in the midterms that it has left Democrats looking for answers (again).
President Obama weighed in on the plight of the working-class whites in an NPR interview, saying: "There's a legitimate sense of loss, particularly among men, who have seen manufacturing diminish; construction has been in the tank."
You know, part of my responsibility then is to communicate directly to those voters. And part of the Democratic Party's job is to communicate directly to those voters and say to them, "You know what? We're fighting for you."
Webb, who won a Virginia Senate seat by the slimmest of margins in 2006, suggests that they are the Democrat who can communicate directly to those voters. Webb's "whipping post" construct also appeared in a 2010 piece for the Wall Street Journal called "Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege." In the piece, they argued against race-based diversity programs like Affirmative Action and said that poor and working-class Southern whites have been ignored by policy-makers and lumped together into "a fungible monolith." They wrote about the lack of college degrees in this group, painting a more diverse picture of white America.
Contrary to assumptions in the law, white America is hardly a monolith. And the journey of white American cultures is so diverse (yes) that one strains to find the logic that could lump them together for the purpose of public policy.
They said to Bai that white working-class men are from "inclusive cultures, they are dignity-driven cultures, honor-driven cultures," and that they vote Republican because "at least they see that there they will have some respect and some response."
So how well did they do with the white male voters in 2006? Well, about as well as any of the Democrats who have run in Virginia in recent years, according to data pulled by Scott Clement, one of our polling guys. They lost those voters like other Democrats — and by similar margins.
In their very overt focus on working-class white men, Webb is doing something other politicians from both parties have only done in code. (Clinton's "Sister's Souljah" moment is an example. The title of Mike Huckabee's new book, "God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy" is another.) Rarely has any politician with national ambitions talked about white cultures and poor and working-class white people in this way. When Paul Ryan wanted to talk to poor people, they toured a black neighborhood in inner-city Indianapolis, not a white rural one in Mississippi.
With their blunt race-specific rhetoric about white people, Webb is staking out some interesting terrain. In a presidential campaign, it won't necessarily bear fruit in terms of votes or make much of a sturdy platform to win a race against another Democrat. But it's just the sort of identity politics that could push other candidates to rely less on dog whistles ("working class" as stand in for white, "inner city" as stand in for black and poor) when talking about race.
And just as easily trip them up, too.
Outlining an updated tax reform plan, Donald Trump addressed the Economic Club of New York Thursday, hawking policies that they promised would lead to economic growth of at least 3.5 percent and the creation of millions of jobs for American workers.
Trump opened their appearance by lamenting the current state of American auto manufacturing, noting their recent visit to Flint, Michigan on Wednesday.
“It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico,” Trump told the Manhattan crowd, referring to the recent move south of the border by auto giant Ford. “Now, cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.”
Trump slammed the outsourcing of auto manufacturers as “disgraceful” -- and, they added, “it's disgraceful that our politicians allow them to get away with it.”
Broadly, Trump, said their economic plan “rejects the cynicism that our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy will never grow as it did before.”
“And boy, oh boy did it used to grow,” they said. Their campaign claims that their plan would increase GDP growth to 3.5 percent, although during their speech Trump showed greater ambition. “My great economists don't want me to say this, but I think we can do better than that,” they said, suggesting 4 percent growth was possible.
“Under our plan,” Trump pledged, “the economy will average 25 million new jobs.”
They dismissed Clinton's economic plan as offering “only more taxes -- and their taxes are unbelievable -- more regulating, more spending, and more wealth redistribution.”
Trump offered some specifics of their tax plan during their speech, reiterating again that individual income tax brackets would be reduced to three: 12 percent, 25 percent, and 33 percent. Trump also proposed a lowered top corporate tax rate of 15 percent -- down from the current 35 percent rate.
To keep companies in the U.S., Trump also included a 10 percent tax on repatriation, and outlined an incentivizing proposal to allow U.S.-based manufacturer to fully expense the cost of their plants and equipment. (Electing to do this, under the Trump plan, would mean companies would give up the ability to deduct interest expense.)
Overall, Trump's team proposed a $4.4 trillion tax cut (scored as $2.6 trillion “under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored,” they said). That economic plan would also include Trump's recent child care proposals
Elements of this tax plan, which they first introduced in August, constitute a change from their earlier proposals. In June, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released a study that found national debt would inflate to $10 trillion or more over the coming decade​ if Trump's initial proposals were instituted. At that time, Trump had proposed a top individual income tax rate of 25 percent. In August, they changed their tax plan, increasing the rate for top earners to 33 percent. The current rate for top earners is about 40 percent. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) noted that Trump, under the current plan, would also allow “very-high-income households” to pay a low rate of 15 percent on what's known as “pass-through” income, that is, “business income claimed on individual tax returns,” as CBPP defines it. CBPP pointed out that “over two-thirds of all pass-through business income flows to the top 1 percent of tax filers.”
The new cost of the Trump tax plan is, according to Bloomberg Politics, “around $3 trillion over a decade” -- it cited Trump adviser Stephen Moore, and the conservative Tax Foundation, which used dynamic scoring to evaluate their plan, though the Tax Foundation also told Bloomberg that it wouldn't “vouch for any specific number” until there was a specific plan.
In comparison, Clinton's agenda, which includes tax increases to pay for federal programs, has been estimated to increase the debt by $250 billion over ten years, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Trump also pledged to cut back on environmental regulations, including a total elimination of the EPA's Clean Power Plan and loosened emissions standards.
On trade, Trump promised that there would be no Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), that they would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA, and that China would face consequences for currency manipulation.
Trump's economic team estimated that the savings from trade, energy, and regulation reforms would save about $1.8 trillion.
The GOP nominee also addressed what they called the “Penny Plan,” named for the idea that “if we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade.” Trump said the remaining cost of their economic plan -- $800 billion -- would be made up through “simple, common sense reforms,” though the GOP nominee also promised that the cuts would not touch defense or entitlement spending.
Contrary to a common belief, we don't really have a free market, and what little bit is left is being chipped away.
Today's comic was inspired by a comment from Brain Police. They do some great videos about the free market on YouTube. I recommend checking out their channel.
EDIT 8/7/2008: Comments that it makes no sense to name the comic “Prosecuting the Free Market” and then pointing out that we don't have a free market were well taken. I guess I thought of it as an attack on what choices are left to us in the marketplace, the limited portion or the extent to which the market remains free, but the fact remains that it was hypocritical to use that title while at the same time pointing at that we don't actually have a free market so I have hot-fixed it.
