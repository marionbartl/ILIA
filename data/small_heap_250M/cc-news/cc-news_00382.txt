"I saw Morton right across there, and I said, 'Oh, no,'" said the woman, who was walking her dog in town Monday. She said she did not want to be identified because she didn't want to be associated with the incident. "I just think he needed help and didn't get it. Just another one of those sad stories."
In past articles I have examined the nature of power and division in our society and have always come to the same conclusion, that there are only two types of people: the people who want control over others and the people who just want to be left alone. However, there are also subgroups that swim within the boundaries of each end of the spectrum. Often, psychologists and self-help gurus attempt to promote the idea that the defining quality of the average person's life is whether he is a follower or a leader. I have seen this spectrum applied to every political and social organization.
Ironically, I have heard so-called “leftists” argue that the nature of their ideology makes them more adept at leadership and that conservatives are more prone to become followers (ostensibly because conservatives tend to be more religious). I have heard the same argument from people on the so-called “right,” only in reverse. The problem is that very few people in our society understand anymore what it actually means to be a leader. Most Americans today are followers, whether they know it or not. And sadly, followers tend to also seek out control over other people, if only to make up for the lack of control they feel in their own lives. That is to say, most followers tend to pursue petty opportunities for leadership.
The concept of leadership has become ridiculously warped. Many people feel that to become a leader, one must clamor his way through the system — be it government or corporate — and achieve artificial status, which others are conditioned to recognize and respect. One cannot become a designated “doctor”, no matter how personally skilled the individual, without earning the correct accolades from the establishment, accolades that are essentially bought at the right price or given as a pat on the head to those who excel at parroting the mainstream consensus. The same goes for scientists, economists, political authorities, etc. This creates a professional class, a percentage of the population whose opinions are treated with immediate reverence simply because of their titles.
The reality often ignored in mainstream thought, however, is that many “professionals” are actually more clueless than laymen, if only because they have been subjected to far more complex indoctrination. How many Ivy League economists, for instance, completely overlooked the inevitable collapse of the derivatives market and the housing bubble simply because they were taught by the mainstream system that such things do not happen in American finance anymore? The truth is, a glossy diploma from the establishment does not necessarily make one intelligent, nor does it automatically make that person a leader to be blindly followed.
Others in our culture assume that leadership is measured by level of influence. Influence, however, can be stolen, rather than earned. The number of fans and worshipers a person retains is not a measure of the real man or woman. Some people lie about who they are to gain popularity, while other people devour such lies because they are desperate for an icon to show them the path to an imaginary promised land. Celebrity — whether by aid of media, finance or bureaucracy — is almost always superficial.
Still other men and women believe that leadership requires empty gestures of cultural rebellion. Do our style preferences, body art, sexual orientations, musical tastes, obscure philosophical hobbies and elitist attitudes really make us different or unique? No, they do not. These things are an expression of our orientation to others, not an expression of our inner selves. One can live a life immersed in what we believe to be the wildly eccentric and still be an empty follower, devoid of originality and independence. My generation in particular has become so obsessed with superficial expressions of artificial individualism I think future historians will one day avidly study this era in stupified wonder. How many times a day do we log on to our social media website of choice or walk outside our homes only to ask other people to love and adore our looks, our cynical but smarmy sense of nihilism, or our wit, carefully crafted to please as large a portion of the collective as possible?
This article from NaturalNews.com really says it all. Even when putting on elaborate displays of their brilliant uniqueness through “selfies” and tweets, Americans today at their darker core are desperate for the approval of others.
Carl Jung, one of the few psychologists in history I actually find useful, once said that all human beings are in search of a particular treasure, a psychological or spiritual treasure that is unique to them and makes them whole. Many people spend the entirety of their lives searching for this treasure in the world around them, rather than looking within, and they end their days feeling mostly miserable and thwarted. They look for it in politics. They look for it in religious representatives (without ever understanding their true relation to the religion). They look for it in wealth and stature. And they always come up short. This is the life of the follower, a life of endless transference in which complete happiness is always outside of oneself, somewhere over the horizon or in the hands of others.
One might ask what any of this has to do with independence and liberty? But, consider the implications…
How many socialists and collectivists in the world think THEIR happiness is dependent on the taxation of YOUR savings and labor, YOUR acceptance, YOUR submission to their ideal society. How many collectivists seek to complete themselves by forcing others to participate in their philosophical fantasies? How many of them will call you a “narcissist” or a “terrorist” because you only wish to make your own decisions free from the social pressures of their arbitrary group? They do not look within; they look without. And if you happen to be standing in their field of vision, you might become a prop in their self-serving theater.
Also consider that such collectivists will never be satisfied with the control they find in the outside world because the perfection they seek does not exist. Therefore, their efforts to force you to conform will only become more suffocating and demeaning to your humanity as time goes on. Followers are a cancer that never stops growing. They well eat up the Earth in order to diminish their fears. They'll say they are doing it for the greater good, but in the end, they are only self absorbed brats playing at being socially responsible adults.
On the other end of the spectrum, there are many within the Liberty Movement who also suffer from the follower's disease. They are the relentless crybabies on message boards screaming: “We keep talking about the problem but when are YOU going to give us a solution!?” Or they ask: “When is EVERYONE going to stand up and do something about this!?” Or, “When are all of you going to realize the magnificence of MY solution and follow ME?” Notice the inclusiveness of such statements. What they should be asking is: “What can I do myself to fix the problems I perceive?” These people are always waiting around for someone else to take action, while never taking action on their own. They are followers by default of their own apathy.
These are the folks looking for the next George Washington (or to become the next George Washington) on a white steed ready to charge into the center of D.C. like some ill fated Light Brigade. They are the bitter pills that rage over the fact that movement activists didn't support their favorite random silver bullet solution flavor of the week, be it Bitcoin to ‘Operation American Spring'. They are livid because no one will march lockstep behind them into whatever halfhearted battle they envision. They become indignant when activists move to support methods outside of their ideal. They want YOU to follow the plan and planners THEY follow, no matter how poorly conceived the plan is, and if you don't, then you must be some kind of traitor. They never consider that perhaps their ideal solution is actually destructive rather than practical, or that no one will rally behind them because no one has much faith in their abilities.
The point is, the fight for liberty is not a follower's game. It is a fight that begins with individuals taking individual measures first and foremost, and if anything, inspiring others through their actions, not demanding fealty for themselves, or their pet strategies.
What can be done to instill independence and legitimate leadership in Americans once again? The conundrum is that such values cannot be instilled; they can only be encouraged. Each individual must make the decision on his or her own to stop looking for the world to fix itself, or them. Each individual must take the first step toward the long journey of becoming a self-reliant and self-owned human being. When faced with this conundrum, I can do nothing but make suggestions:
Find a useful skill, something that you love, and master it completely. Try to become the foremost expert on just one thing — not to impress others, but to challenge yourself. When people assert the incredible effort required to master a skill, they grow their sense of self-worth instead of measuring their worth by the guidelines of hollow academia or the collective.
Never look for traditional leaders. Always look for teachers. A real teacher is someone who seeks to make each individual his own leader through knowledge and empowerment. A real teacher has no desire to rule others, only to help others so that they do not feel the need to be ruled.
Independence comes from self-leadership. As long as you are reliant on the system or its participating oligarchs to decide your future for you, you will never be anything more than a follower, even if the system has given you a “place at the table” and a title to make you feel special. As long as you are vying for approval from the system or the collective, you will never be free. When you can stand in front of a hostile crowd of people and give your viewpoint without fear of how they may respond, then you are on your way to self-leadership.
If you see a problem in the world, stop asking permission to fix it! Stop waiting for the establishment to police itself. Stop concerning yourself with the actions of others and take your own actions, however small they might be. Revolutions are sparked in the minds of individuals and implemented by the hands of the courageous few. There will be no mass awakening and there will be no grand march to glory, so stop holding your breath. If there is an unrelenting evil in the world, then you must fight it if you expect anything to change. If you are the only person who recognizes it, then you may have to fight it alone. The potential for success or failure is irrelevant. It is the fight that matters.
If you are going to lead others, lead by example. Hopefully you have realized by now that true leadership has NOTHING to do with people actually following you. Much more important is the ability to show people how to achieve something more by building something of your own. There are also far too many Americans who seek to falsely elevate themselves by attacking the achievements of others from the anonymous comfort of their computers, rather than doing anything constructive on their own merit. There was a time when Americans were respected as people of action, rather than talk. When you do talk, do so from a position of strength. Talk as someone who has actually done something worth talking about.
If you are going to join, do so with the intent to learn, and to teach. All organization must be voluntary if it is to succeed in the long term, and voluntary organization thrives when participants contribute their knowledge and skill sets without sacrificing their individual self determination. The group does not outweigh the individual, because without the contributions of the individual, the group is meaningless.
Make a list of your dependencies. Do you have the skills to survive without a job? Without money? Without on-grid utilities? Without consistent aid from others? Can you live without modern comforts if you had to? Do you have the fortitude to endure great hardship? Have you ever endured great hardship, or have you avoided it your whole life? The more self-sufficient you are, the less you will need to look to the system or other people to make your decisions for you. You will become fearless, and fearless people cannot be ruled.
I believe independence terrifies some people because it requires a human being to challenge the unknown and take responsibility for the consequences if he fails. Followers trade in their mental and spiritual freedom to governments, oligarchs and gatekeepers so that they never have to face these difficulties. Sometimes, they are simply lazy. Sometimes, they lack confidence in their own abilities. Sometimes, they are just cowards. In any case, the result is the same: a life of relative ease riding the tides in a vast school of self-serving minnows but always prey to the ever circling sharks. I say don't be a minnow; man-up, and build something of your own.

Communications firm Cambridge Analytica said Monday it "strongly denies" allegations it harvested data on 50 million Facebook users for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, as British regulators prepare to ask a court to allow access to its systems.
The British data analysis company, hired by the 2016 Trump campaign, said the source of the accusations -- which it called "a former contractor" -- was "misrepresenting himself and the company".
"This Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign; personality targeted advertising was not carried out for this client either," it said in a statement.
According to a joint investigation by The New York Times and Britain's Observer, the firm was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people but also scooped up data from friends.
Facebook has responded by suspending Cambridge Analytica's account and pledging to probe the allegations, but has pushed back against the claim of a major breach, suggesting misused data was limited to a far smaller group of users.
Its share price plunged on Monday, as officials on both sides of the Atlantic called for investigations.
Elizabeth Denham, Britain's Information Commissioner who regulates the sector in the country, announced her office would seek a court warrant on Tuesday to search Cambridge Analytica's computer servers.
She said the company had been "uncooperative" to requests for access to its records and missed a Monday deadline stipulated.
"The information commissioner is seeking a warrant to obtain information and access to systems and evidence related to her investigation," Denham's office said in a statement.
It added Facebook had agreed to "stand down" from its own search of the company's London premises "at the information commissioner's request".
"Such a search would potentially compromise a regulatory investigation," the statement said.
Meanwhile, fresh allegations against senior executives at Cambridge Analytica emerged on Monday evening.
The company's chief executive Alexander Nix was secretly filmed by Britain's Channel 4 News saying it could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and sex workers, using ex-spies to dig up dirt on opponents.
He also said the firm secretly campaigns in elections around the world, including by operating through a web of shadowy front companies, or by using sub-contractors.
A Cambridge Analytica spokesman told the news programme it does not use "untrue material for any purpose".
"We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever," the spokesman added. DM

Mark, Head of Residential Sales at the independent agency's 11 Yorkshire branches, will be experiencing a different kind of waterside activity by cycling the length of the canal from Liverpool to Leeds
Share Share +1 Shares 1
An estate agency director from Harrogate is back in the saddle to help a charity get over the finishing line in its quest to raise £30,000 to mark its 30th anniversary.
As colleagues from Linley & Simpson will be using paddle power in the Dragon Boat Races organised at Roundhay Park, Leeds, in aid of Martin House Children's Hospice, Mark Christopher will be resorting to pedal power in his own challenge for the same good cause.
Mark, Head of Residential Sales at the independent agency's 11 Yorkshire branches, will be experiencing a different kind of waterside activity by cycling the length of the canal from Liverpool to Leeds – that's 127.5 miles and 91 locks in just two days over the weekend of May 6 and 7.
He is joining more than 50 other cyclists, some as young as ten, for the Uncle Mick's Bike Ride challenge, which has set itself an ambitious target of raising £30,000 – £1,000 for every year Martin House has supported children and young people with life-limiting illness.
Mark recently cycled to Paris on a charity bike ride but the canalside challenge, which will end at Granary Wharfe in Leeds, marks a new departure for him.
Mark said: The whole company has thrown itself behind the fund-raising campaign to support Martin House – our chosen Charity of the Year – and this is my way of contributing to the amazing work its staff do, day-in day-out, for children and their families across Yorkshire. It's a great opportunity to keep fit, have fun, raise money for a deserving cause – and take in some of the UK's most breathtaking scenery along the way.
You can support Mark and his fund-raising ride in aid of Martin House Children's Hospice through this dedicated page on the Just Giving website.

A pedestrian has died after being struck by a vehicle in a community southwest of Edmonton on Friday afternoon. Police are investigating whether it was related to a possible gas-and-dash.
According to an official with Leduc County Fires Services, emergency crews were called to a collision involving a vehicle and a pedestrian on 52 Street in Thorsby at 3:41 p.m.
The RCMP said the collision occurred near the Thorsby Fas Gas and that a “medium-sized commercial vehicle was seen leaving the collision and has yet to be located.”
They described the crash as a hit and run.
“It seems to be stemming from an incident that occurred at the Fas Gas, a likely gas-and-dash-related incident and currently we're investigating all leads from that,” said Thorsby/Bretton RCMP detachment commander Corey Kyle.
“We have some really good surveillance footage from the gas sation and one of our members that happened to be travelling in town at the same time had footage from her police car rolling. So we have a very good idea on what vehicle we're looking for.”
Kyle said the pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene.
Firefighters were still at the scene redirecting traffic as of 6 p.m.
The RCMP said its investigation is ongoing.
Thorsby is located about 75 kilometres southwest of Edmonton.
A group of bicyclists is about to attempt a ride across Iowa in 24 hours.
The Sioux City Journal reports that about 30 bicyclists will start at 4 a.m. Saturday in Sioux City. They have one day to complete the 335-mile journey to Dubuque to officially complete the Ride Across Iowa in a Day event, known as RAID.
This year marks the seventh time riders will attempt the trans-Iowa trek.
Darren Johnson, the event's organizer, is riding himself for the sixth time and has finished the full ride once, last year. Eighteen bicyclists finished the ride in 2016.
Factoring in stops, riders will have to average 14 mph for all 24 hours to reach Dubuque in time. Johnson says he doesn't recommend stopping.
THE mother of a Hungerford schoolboy has told of the moment a knife was pulled on him when he was caught in a showdown between rival gangs.
The incident happened at the skate park in Bulpit Lane, where parents have warned recently of open drug dealing.
In an exclusive interview with this newspaper, the boy's mother told how her life and that of her family could have been destroyed forever in just a few seconds.
Meanwhile, in a written report to the town council, Thames Valley Police said they were investigating an “altercation between a group of youngsters from Newbury and a group from Hungerford”, which happened on Friday, September 22.
The team confirmed that its officers found a discarded blade in nearby bushes and enquiries are ongoing.
The mother of the 13-year-old who was reportedly threatened told the Newbury Weekly News of her horror at what happened.
She said her son had gone to the park with a friend, where they encountered a gang of around 15 youths from Newbury.
The mother of four from Park Way, whose full identity we have agreed to withhold, revealed: “It seems there had been trouble with another gang and they were looking for a boy whose mother lives in Hungerford and whose father lives in Newbury.
“My son noticed that the youths were passing round a yellow-handled blade. My boy said: ‘Let's go.'”
She added: “They had started to walk out of the skate park when one of the gang ran up to my son and grabbed him in a headlock.”
The woman said her son managed to wrest himself free and hit his attacker.
She said: “At that point another youth came over, handed his attacker the knife and said: ‘Here – use this.'”
The 13-year-old and the older boy faced each other, and the woman said that, at that moment, her son's life and that of all his loved ones hung in the balance.
She went on: “This youth was brandishing the knife at my son as they stared at each other. Then the youth turned and ran off.
“All of our lives could have changed forever in that moment.
“I was horrified.
“I mean, this is Hungerford – I've lived here forever.
“I know there have been problems with drugs in this area but you can't keep your children locked up.
“It's terrifying.”
In July last year, police said they feared that dealers from London were increasingly targeting the town, along with Newbury, after successful operations drove them from Reading and other major Berkshire towns.
Used hypodermic needles have also been found in the public toilets near Hungerford Library.
Then, earlier this year, there were fears of drug ‘grooming' gangs operating in the area, offering youngsters free, laced cigarettes.
Anyone who has any information about the latest incident should contact the neighbourhood police team via the 101 number.
Alternatively, the independent Crimestoppers charity can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
In Delta North in 2013, BC Liberals won by 203 votes (44.5 per cent to 43.6 per cent).
Scott Hamilton is the BC Liberal incumbent. This riding has been won by the NDP several times in the past. In 2013, the NDP vote declined by 900 while the BC Liberal vote climbed by 1,100. The Conservatives took almost 1,000 votes and most should go to the Liberals this time (if they vote). The Uber taxi issue may figure prominently here.
In 2009, NDP incumbent Guy Gentner successfully held this riding by defeating Liberal Jeannie Kanakos by nearly 2,000 votes (50 per cent to 41 per cent).
History & Geography: Delta North has had the same boundaries since being created in 1991, which is all of the municipality east of Highway 91. It also includes Annacis Island. The riding went to the NDP in 1991, 2005 and 2009, and went to the Liberals in 1996 and 2001. The southern suburbs around Briarwood Crescent and Sunshine Hills lean towards the Liberals, while the northern part of the riding often supports the NDP.
Candidates
BC Liberals – Scott Hamilton: Elected to the Legislature in 2013 after four terms as a Delta councillor. Served as Chair of the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services
before 2013 when he worked in the Ministry of Labour and Citizens' Services for 10 years.
NDP – Ravi Kahlon — Former national field hockey star and Olympian (Sydney 2008, Beijing 2008.) For the last six years, Kahlon has worked in the NDP Caucus as Director of Stakeholder Relations, liaising between the party and labour, environmental, First Nations and business groups.
Greens – Jacquie Miller: A policy analyst and researcher. Miller previously worked for the NWT government on resource and infrastructure projects. Miller is an active Green Party organizer.

Social media has a unique power in this day and age. For some, it is a destructive force, a bright red self-destruct button. For others, it's a means of slowly and assuredly winning back a hostile fan base. Last night, two entities that know what it's like to be pop culture punchlines—Nickelback and Arnold Schwarzenegger—displayed an understanding of the latter by eschewing pettiness for humor and humility.
It began when Schwarzenegger, who's been a particularly outspoken critic of President Donald Trump on social media, used the maligned Canadian rockers to help frame our commander in chief's low approval ratings. Nickelback, as they've made clear in the past, are through with jokes at their expense and won't let someone as imposing as the Governator stop them from saying so.
.@Schwarzenegger big fans. Approval rate this: Batman & Robin. Please leave us out of your future wisdom drops. Danke Shön Herr Governator. — Nickelback (@Nickelback) February 14, 2017
Schwarzenegger took the high road, acknowledging his ridiculous, pervasive ice-themed puns in the second-worst Batman film while still pushing forth his political points. And Nickelback? They were probably just happy to get a response.
@Nickelback That's… ice cold. I hope we can agree that we need a freeze on gerrymandering, guys. Thanks for the reply. — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 14, 2017
And everyone comes out looking better in the end. Isn't that a novel concept?
Maybe Father John Misty's right, after all.
President Trump and SC Senator Lindsey Graham talk Taxes and Golf
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) – The White House says President Donald Trump and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham are discussing tax legislation and upcoming budget talks during a golf game at one of Trump's Florida clubs.
Trump tweeted about the tax bill Sunday before heading to the club in West Palm Beach. House and Senate lawmakers are meeting this week to begin the difficult process of agreeing to a single version of the bill they can send to Trump for enactment.
Trump tweeted: “Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!”
Trump spent the weekend at his Palm Beach estate. He arrived after a Friday night campaign rally in Pensacola, Florida.

What: Blame the three Hawaiian princes who introduced surfing to California in the 1880s. Or blame the Beach Boys for deciding to sing about it in the early 1960s. Either way, the word got out about this sport, which can be fatal or, in the best of circumstances, not so hard.
I admired it from afar until the other day, when I signed on for a 90-minute, one-on-one lesson at beginner-friendly Mission Beach in San Diego. Instructor Adam Wiegand took me through the basics, launched me into a few waves, then went ashore and hollered instructions at me, the 56-year-old rookie. It wasn't pretty, but I got up a few times and spent some precious seconds gliding with the tide. This means it's not that hard.
It does help to start on a day of 1-2-foot waves, using a 10-foot-long foam board — that's about the size of an aircraft carrier. We did need to be careful of stingrays on the sandy bottom (no stings, thankfully) and we had the happy distraction of a dolphin swim-by.
Where: Classes like this are offered up and down the coast, and the citizen critics of yelp have evaluated more than a dozen in Santa Monica alone. I used Surfari Surf School, 3740 Mission Blvd, San Diego, 116 miles southeast of downtown L.A.
How much: Surfing instruction rates vary widely. At Surfari, I paid $85 for a 90-minute one-on-one session (and an added hour of board and wetsuit rental, if I'd had the energy). For a group lesson (three to five people), the rate is $55 per person.

Fentanyl has made its way onto Toronto streets and with a growing number of reported overdoses, Global News reporter Erica Vella took questions from viewers and posed them to Dr. Harry Vedelago, addiction physician at ACT clinics in Toronto and Hamilton, for some answers.
“What is fentanyl and what effects do it have on people?”
– Nico, Toronto
“Fentanyl is what we call a synthetic opiate. That means one that is manufactured. Its effect is far more powerful than the regular opiates,” Vedelago said. “Basically, it's used for pain relief … however, if it's used improperly it can cause overdose. It affects part of the brain that controls your respiration — your ability to breathe — and it depresses that to the point that you stop breathing and die.”

“Where are people getting fentanyl from?”
– Francesca, Toronto
“They are buying it off the street, of course, and that's how they are getting it,” Vedelago said. “There have been some situations where people who have come into the clinic … were totally surprised that there was fentanyl in [their drugs]. I've seen situations where the fentanyl has been pressed into pills that look like a Tylenol 3 or looks like an oxycodone and it's not truly that medication, it's actually fentanyl. You're not looking at anything that is passing any quality regulations.”

Why are people putting fentanyl in cocaine and other drugs?
– Drew Behm, Alberta
“[Fentanyl] is very cheap now because it's imported mainly from Asia — China in particular,” Vedelago said. “It's very potent. It does give quite a kick for its buck, and now it's found almost everywhere.”

If a drug is potentially laced with fentanyl, are there any early warning signs that you could be experiencing an overdose and are there any potential actions you can take to stop it before it gets worse?
– Josh, Toronto
“People who have taken [fentanyl] will feel a sense of euphoria but also a real sense of drowsiness [and] continuous decrease of consciousness,” said Vedelago. “You get this feeling that you're slowly drifting off into sleep, and when you get that feeling, the important thing is to seek medical attention.”
Vedelago added users can also use the antidote medication naloxone to help slow down a potential overdose.
“The naloxone kits are injectable blockers of opiates. They are very effective …but they are only a stop-gap measure — it buys you time to be able to call emergency and get medical attention.”
Remember the iced tea company that changed its name to Long Blockchain and immediately shot up by 500 percent on the stock market? Well, it turns out it may not be getting into the blockchain after all.
The company has decided to back off from its pledge to buy 1,000 bitcoin mining machines — just six weeks after it said it would be doing so.
Of course, six weeks ago bitcoin was worth a whole lot more than it is now — it's currently trading at $10,000 less than it was at the beginning of the year. That's not to say it won't go up again, but investors are rightfully skittish at this point.
That slump has affected Long Blockchain's shares, which have plunged 50 percent since it reached its dizzying height, causing the company's market cap to sink below the $35 million minimum value required to list on Nasdaq's exchange.
“While we continue to believe in the value of mining equipment to the blockchain ecosystem, the purchase of these machines — which was negotiated as a no-risk option to the Company — was just one of the multiple strategic avenues we have been considering,” Shamyl Malik, head of the Company's Blockchain Strategy Committee, said in a statement.
Instead, Long Blockchain says it will “continue to evaluate the purchase of mining equipment for Bitcoin and other digital currencies as part of our larger blockchain initiative” as it moves ahead on completing a merger with British firm Stater Blockchain, which works on “developing and deploying globally scalable blockchain technology solutions in the financial market,” according to its website.
Note, however, Long Blockchain was already in a pickle before adding blockchain to the name. Shares dipped by 24 percent over the last 12 months, and the company received a warning letter from Nasdaq in October, prompting the zany strategy to change its name to a zeitgeisty buzzword.
As it turns out, glomming on to the trend of the moment to boost your value can only hold you for so long. There's no word on when the merger will be complete, but one thing is clear — Long Blockchain is not likely to see the type of gains it once did simply by changing its name.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - An S&P Global Ratings analyst said on Friday that sustaining economic growth, including by boosting infrastructure spending, would be critical to India's ratings.
Kim Eng Tan, senior director at the rating agency, said India's 2018/19 fiscal budget unveiled on Thursday had assumptions for income tax collection that were “somewhat optimistic,” adding that any shortfalls might lead to cuts in “the much-needed infrastructure spending.”
Reduced infrastructure spending has the potential to hit economic growth, Tan told a conference call, a prospect that may lead S&P to consider reducing India's rating.
S&P rates India at “BBB-minus” with a “stable” outlook. “BBB-minus” is the lowest investment-grade rating.
“If growth were to slow and if the government deficit were to rise significantly this could cause us to lower the rating. Or if we perceive that the political will to maintain India's reforms were to sputter, that's another reason we could lower the rating,” Tan said.
Tributes have been paid to a respected stalwart of boxing who has died following a distinguished career.
Hartlepool man Fred Potter, who spent three decades as a referee before becoming one of the country's most influential officials, died on Wednesday, aged 86, following a short illness.

Champion trainer Neil Fannan his death marks the end of an era for boxing.
Fred only retiring as a director of the British Boxing Board of Control last year.
He suffered a heart attack in late June in Newcastle where he was working as the steward in charge at the Sky Sports-screened show.
Paramedics and doctors, who were in attendance at the Walker Sports Dome, revived him and Fred spent weeks at the RVI Hospital in Newcastle.
But he never fully recovered, undergoing further treatment at the University Hospital of North Tees, before dying this week.
As a referee, he officiated fights involving some of Hartlepool's top boxers, like the Feeney brothers, George and John, Dave Garside and Stewart Lithgo, as well as North-East greats, Billy Hardy and Glenn McCrory.
Fred picked up a lifetime achievement trophy at the 2014 Hartlepool Mail Sports Awards for more than 50 years of devotion to boxing.
Fannan, who trained Michael Hunter to the British, Commonwealth and European titles, added: “It's always very sad when one of the old figures goes.
“It's the end of an era for boxing here.
“Fred refereed me as a pro and he's gone on to be one of the British Board's top men.
“It was great for Hartlepool and the North-East to have had Fred there.
“He certainly was a big help to our camp and I knew when he went to the BBBC meetings in London and Cardiff that he'd put our case forward. He was probably at his most influential when Michael was about.
“Fred has been succeeded at the BBBC by a good man in this area, Reg Long, but he'll be a big miss.”

The special counsel appointed to investigate Russian influence in the 2016 presidential campaign is now examining whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice, the Washington Post reported Wednesday evening.
Accusations of obstruction arose last month when Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey. Comey testified in a Senate hearing last week that he believed he was fired “because of the Russia investigation.”
Comey also testified he had told Trump he was not under investigation.
The Post and the New York Times both reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was seeking interviews with three Trump administration officials who weren't involved in Trump's campaign: Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence; Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency; and Richard Ledgett, the former NSA deputy director.
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's personal lawyer, responded Wednesday evening to the Post report by saying: “The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal.”
The Post report cited anonymous sources who were briefed on requests made by investigators. It was not known whether the FBI was the source of the information.
Mueller, a former director of the FBI, met Wednesday with the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee in an effort to ensure their investigations don't conflict.
The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a statement issued Wednesday that they “look forward to future engagements” with Mueller.
Committee Chairman Sen. Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.) and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the panel's top Democrat, didn't provide any other details regarding the meeting. An aide familiar with the meeting said it was held to discuss the investigations, including ways that the parallel inquiries don't interfere with one another. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private.
The meeting comes a day after lawmakers questioned Justice Department officials about the inquiry and Mueller's independence, and after a friend of Trump said the White House was considering firing Mueller.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last month, testified Tuesday that he had seen no evidence of good cause to fire Mueller.
Also Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley said his panel would investigate the removal of Comey and “any alleged improper partisan interference in law enforcement investigations.”
Grassley announced the investigation in a letter to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panel's top Democrat. Grassley's office said the letter is in response to a recent letter from Feinstein requesting that the committee seek details from senior FBI leadership about Comey's interactions with Trump before he was fired.
The letter said the investigation would also look into Comey's testimony that Loretta Lynch, as President Obama's attorney general, had directed him to describe an FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton's email practices as merely a "matter" and to avoid calling it an investigation.

“You and I agree that the American people deserve a full accounting of attempts to meddle in both our democratic processes and the impartial administration of justice.... It is my view that fully investigating the facts, circumstances and rationale for Mr. Comey's removal will provide us the opportunity to do that on a cooperative, bipartisan basis,” the letter said.
Feinstein has said the Judiciary Committee should investigate but had asked Grassley to keep the investigations separate. Grassley said Comey's dismissal and Comey's testimony on Lynch should be looked at together, noting that Comey “took the opportunity in his testimony to clear his own name by denouncing as false the administration's claims that the FBI rank-and-file had lost confidence in Mr. Comey's leadership in the wake of the Clinton email investigation.”
The newly formed Relay for Life of Virginia's Blue Ridge kicked off the 2018 campaign at the Vinton War Memorial on January 29.
In past years, Vinton has held its own Relay for Life event. This year the American Cancer Society asked several relays in the area to combine, in an effort to be better stewards of the donor dollar.
Roanoke City, Botetourt County, and Vinton are among those relays who have elected to combine forces to raise funds for cancer research and programs.
The Relay for Life of Virginia's Blue Ridge is scheduled for May 18 at Rivers Edge North in Roanoke (the site of the old Victory Stadium). It will run from 6 p.m. until midnight.
The traditional Survivor's Reception, which in past years has been part of the Relay event itself, will instead be held at the Vinton War Memorial on May 4 at 6 p.m.
Carolyn Williams and Angie Chewning have served as co-chairs for the Vinton Relay for several years and will continue to work on the Event Leadership Team (ELT), along with past co-chairs from Roanoke City, Patrick McKee and John Cornett, and Botetourt chair Rob Poyner.
Other ELT members include B.J. Hutchison, Vicky Zimmerman, Tina Hostetter, Megan Motley, Dottie Booze, Suzy Lawrence, Tammy Lawhorn, Sandra Stubbs, Barbara and Mike Hutkin, Michelle Poyner, and Sherry Williams.
The kick-off on January 29 at the War Memorial included the traditional potluck celebration followed by a program hosted by Courtney Baker, Community Manager for ACS for Relay for Life.
Baker welcomed a crowd of about 100 at the War Memorial, thanking them for coming together to work as a team for the cause of finding a cure for cancer. She reminded them that although they will face challenges in combining three Relays into one, “it's not about locality”– it's about those diagnosed with cancer, fighting cancer; those who have lost the battle, and those who have survived.
She announced that this year's theme will be “Hoping for a Holiday” from cancer.
The intensity of the fight against cancer was highlighted with the presentation of a video featuring Jeff Ross, a passionately dedicated Relay worker, described as a superstar of the ACS and a member of the Relay for Life Hall of Fame.
Ross became a warrior in the fight against cancer when he lost his mother, Mildred Ross Allen, to a rare form of gastric cancer. She survived only 29 days after her diagnosis to a cancer for which there was no treatment and no cure. He made it his life's purpose to support the ACS through the Relay for Life program and has worked in the program for 16 years.
He said he thought he had paid his dues in the fight against cancer, but then about five years ago his wife Tammy was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer just after the birth of their son. She is now in full remission. He credits the work of the ACS in its research for a cure.
“The money I raise for the American Cancer Society funds important cancer research, supports cancer patient programs and services, and goes toward other important activities that help save lives from cancer,” said Ross.
According to the ACS, the society was founded in 1913 by 10 doctors and five laypeople in New York City and called the American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC). “At that time, a cancer diagnosis meant near certain death. Rarely mentioned in public, this disease was steeped in fear and denial. Doctors sometimes did not tell their patients they had cancer, and patients often did not tell their friends and families that they had been diagnosed with it.”
The Society founders knew they had to raise public awareness about cancer if progress was to be made against the disease.
In 1936, Marjorie G. Illig proposed creating “a legion of volunteers” whose sole purpose was to wage war on cancer. The Women's Field Army, as they became known, was an enormous success, going into the streets to raise money and educate the public.
In 1935, there were 15,000 people active in cancer control throughout the United States. At the close of 1938, there were 10 times that number. More than anything else, it was the Women's Field Army that moved the American Cancer Society to the forefront of voluntary health organizations.
In 1945, the ASCC was reorganized as the American Cancer Society. The next year, philanthropist Mary Lasker and her colleagues raised more than $4 million for the Society. One million was used to establish and fund the Society's groundbreaking research program. In 1947, they began their famous cancer signals campaign, a public education effort about the signs and symptoms of cancer.
Around the same time, Dr. Sidney Farber, one of the Society's first research grantees, achieved the first temporary cancer remission in a child with acute leukemia, opening the modern era of chemotherapy for cancer treatment. It was the beginning of how scientists the American Cancer Society supported early in their careers would go on to make great leaps in understanding and stopping cancer.
The ACS says that Society-funded researchers have contributed to nearly every major cancer research breakthrough in the almost 70 years since the Society's research program began– “They've helped establish the link between cancer and smoking; demonstrated the effectiveness of the Pap test; developed cancer-fighting drugs and biological response modifiers such as interferon; dramatically increased the cure rate for childhood leukemia; proven the safety and effectiveness of mammography; and much more.”
Since 1946, the American Cancer Society has invested more than $4 billion in research, recognizing and providing the funding 47 researchers needed to go on to win the Nobel Prize.
In the '60s, the Society was instrumental in the development of the Surgeon General's report on the link between smoking and cancer.
Their advocacy later contributed to the passage of the National Cancer Act in 1971, which granted special funds and authority to expand the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and revolutionized the war on cancer.
As National Institutes of Health funding has diminished, the Society has allocated more research grants for helping to promise young medical researchers enter the cancer field.
The ACS says it is proud to have contributed to the work that has resulted in a 25 percent drop in the overall cancer death rate in the United States between 1991 and 2014– that equates to 2.1 million fewer cancer deaths and a 50 percent drop in smoking rates.
There is now a global grassroots force made up of millions of volunteers “fighting for every birthday threatened by every cancer in every community.”
More information on the upcoming Relay for Life of Virginia's Blue Ridge is available on the website at www.relayforlife.org/vablueridge.
Their next Relay meeting is scheduled for February 20 at William Byrd High School, followed by meetings at St. Mark's UMC in Daleville on March 20, and Cambria Suites in Roanoke on April 17 and May 15. All meetings are scheduled to begin at 6 p.m.
“If you have been involved with Vinton Relay for Life for the past 10 years, please continue the fight,” urge Williams and Chewning.
PHOENIX (AP)  As some cities reaffirm support for sanctuary policies that protect immigrants, Phoenix finds itself in an unusual position to push back against any immigration actions by the new White House.
The Phoenix City Council on Wednesday will discuss a petition to adopt the sanctuary label, following the lead of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and others in a city with one of the nation's largest populations of immigrants in the country illegally. But the effort is complicated by the fact that Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law, known as SB1070, bars any Arizona city from becoming a sanctuary.
The Phoenix metro area is home to about 250,000 immigrants in the country illegally, according to a report last week from the Pew Research Center. The report is based on data from 2014. New York, Los Angeles and Houston have the highest number of immigrants who lack legal status.
Cities are doubling down on sanctuary policies in light of an order by President Donald Trump requiring immigration authorities to arrest and deport more people. The city policies vary but essentially bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

Phoenix has a Democratic, immigrant-friendly mayor who has denounced Trump, but his hands are tied because of SB1070.
The law requires local police to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally while enforcing other laws or in the course of an investigation. Most of the law was gutted by the courts, but city leaders say the surviving sections prevent local government agencies from restricting the enforcement of federal immigration law.
Still, pressure has mounted on Mayor Greg Stanton from immigrant advocacy groups who want the city to adopt sanctuary policies and from police and Republican leaders who oppose the measure.
City attorney Brad Holm says in a letter to the city manager that the petition for sanctuary status is "legally impermissible."
"It demands that the council break state law. If the petition were adopted, a court could fine the city for breaking the law, and the attorney general could seek forfeiture of state-shared revenue," Holm wrote.
Stanton last week blasted the Trump administration over the deportation of 35-year-old Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a Phoenix-area woman who until now had been granted leniency by Obama policies that aimed to protect immigrants without violent pasts and who have ties to the community. Garcia de Rayos was arrested in Phoenix during a routine check-in with U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement and was deported the next day to Nogales, Mexico.
"Rather than tracking down violent criminals and drug dealers, ICE is spending its energy deporting a woman with two American children who has lived here for more than two decades and poses a threat to nobody," Stanton wrote on Twitter.
Stanton denounced Garcia de Rayos' deportation, but immigration activists called on him to use his power and not just his voice.
"If there was ever a time when we need your courage and we need you to stand up and we need you to put actions behind saying that Phoenix PD is not gonna become a mass deportation machine, it's now," said Francisca Porchas, of Puente Arizona, an immigrant rights group. "This is when we need Mayor Stanton, the city council, the state, everybody who is of conscience to stand up and defy this racist law."
Police are on the hunt for a 22-year-old man wanted for attempted murder following a shooting in the Flemingdon Park neighbourhood of Toronto over the weekend.
Toronto police said they responded to a call of a shooting around 6:21 p.m. on Saturday in the area of Linkwood Lane and St. Dennis Drive.
When officers arrived, they located a male with a gunshot wound.
Police said they executed a search warrant at the suspect's home and seized a number of items including crack cocaine, a shotgun, a bulletproof vest and homemade ammunition.
Police have identified the suspect as Di'on Jahil Wong. He is known to drive a grey 2017 Dodge Charger with Ontario licence plates BRFK-061.
He is described as black, 5'8”, 146 lbs., with short curly black hair.
Police said the suspect is considered armed and dangerous and should not be approached.
Anyone with information is asked to contact police at 416-808-5400 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS (8477).
FAISALABAD: The University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) has emerged as first-ever Pakistani institution ranked among the world's top 100 universities in any category.
According to the National Taiwan University Global Ranking, it has attained 72nd position worldwide and 12th position in Asia Pacific in the agricultural sciences. The UAF has also been declared as 85th best university globally, according to the QS World Ranking. Not only that, the university, on the basis of research publications in agricultural sciences has attained 21st position worldwide. It has also grabbed 9th position worldwide as per UI Green Metric World University Ranking in the category of Specialized Higher Education Institutions.
To broad its role as a community builder, the university is going to organise Spring Festival/Kissan Convention from March 7, to 12. Objective of the convention is to provide an environment of interactive learning, knowledge and experience sharing to the agricultural community and all stakeholders under one umbrella. During the festival, various activities like Kissan convention, agricultural exhibition, cultural show, flowers exhibition, tent pegging, milk competition, grey hound race, food street, alumni meet and fancy bird show etc will be held to disseminate knowledge and awareness about modern technologies and entertainment to the participants.
Since the establishment of the Women's Caucus in the National Assembly, Pakistan has seen a significant increase in pro-women legislation, and this week, we saw another positive development.
The Punjab Women's Protection Authority in its maiden meeting on Thursday has decided to establish special courts for hearing cases of crime against women in all districts in the province.
These courts would be presided over by women judges and prosecutors, specifically trained in the subject, and they would be stationed in the centres across the province.
This development is certainly an interesting idea.
It is an encouraging sign that the Punjab government is taking the issue of violence against women seriously, and that the 2017 Act was not just a perfunctory gesture.
Domestic violence is a special kind of crime which requires swift justice for the law to be efficient and for women to avail it.
Special courts would solve the problem of lengthy and slow pace of procedures in the family and civil courts, which are already overburdened.
We saw this in the example of Intellectual property (IP) Tribunals, established in 2015, which have significantly increased the scope of copyright and patent law.
The idea of women judges and prosecutors in theory seems like a brilliant one.
Victims of domestic violence would be more comfortable approaching women judges and a female dominated legal sphere.
The rural taboo of a woman going to court and the “parda” problem would also be overcome to some extent in an all-female environment, and on whole, female judges should be considerably more empathic in such issues.
However, let us hope that these courts do not succumb to the same illnesses that other special courts usually fall victim to.
Tribunals and special courts have been known to become defunct due to vacancies.
Special Courts such as the Drug Courts and the Cyber Crime Courts have become non-functional due to vacancies and the government's delay in appointing a chairman.
Special Courts usually finish last on the list of the government's priorities and consistently suffer from lack of funds, lack of effective security against intimidation and other operational failures.
If the government takes these courts seriously and devote funds to it, like it has to the mostly successful IP tribunals, they could speed up the process of violence cases and enable victims to have trust in the law.
If not, issues of inefficiency and lack of security obscurity could occur, leading proposed relief for violence victims to be only words on paper.

The journey to compete in Beef 2018 began before Christmas for the many stud breeders who are exhibiting including Sharon and Greg Harms, Oakmore Droughtmasters, Greenmount.
Mrs Harms said they competed at their first Beef Australia showing in 2009 and are looking forward to returning this year.
She said their team had competed at both Clifton Show and the Droughtmaster Futurity at Gatton to give them extra travel and show ring experience, plus they had their final outing at the Toowoomba Royal Show three weeks ago.
“Beef Australia certainly gives us the opportunity to mingle with the breed's best and is the greatest promotion of the Australian beef industry, both nationally and internationally.
“Thankfully it is on only every three years, as it is expensive to participate, but it is well worth it.”
Beef Australia's stud committee chairman, Russell Hughes, said with the general widespread industry confidence, a 20-year high number of registered cattle across Australia and recent healthy stud sales, they were confident of strong entry numbers.
“However the 1676 entries has exceeded our expectations,” Mr Hughes said.
“We began speaking with stud breeders and breed societies back in June last year to allow us to better plan our preparations plus format for the competition.
“It's now Beef Australia's job to provide the best possible platform to allow Australia's stud producers to best showcase their cattle to our visitors.”
The story Beef's record stud show first appeared on Queensland Country Life.
At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, her laptop, video camera, footage and cellphone were taken and held for 41 days. In Newark, New Jersey, a security officer threatened to handcuff her for taking notes with a ballpoint pen that he said could be used as a weapon.
In Germany, she was told her name lights up “like a Christmas tree” when security officials scan flight rosters. In Austria, she was told her threat score was “400 out of 400.”
Time after time, airport authorities searched her baggage, rummaged through her electronics and quizzed her for hours about her trips.
She was stopped without explanation more than 50 times on foreign travel, and dozens more times on domestic trips, before the extra searches suddenly stopped in 2012. Only now is Poitras beginning to unravel the mystery, which goes back to a bloody day in Baghdad in 2004.
WASHINGTON—Laura Poitras' travel nightmare began more than a decade ago when the award-winning filmmaker started getting detained at airports every time she tried to set foot back in the United States.
Citizenfour depicted Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald's rendezvous with Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel where he handed over classified material documenting NSA's widespread surveillance program. Her new film, Risk, is about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Poitras, 53, knows U.S. government officials are not exactly fans of her politically sensitive work.
“I asked for crayons because I thought that would be less threatening to him as a weapon,” recounted Poitras, whose 2014 documentary film, Citizenfour about the National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, won an Academy Award. “He denied me any kind of writing device.”
Still, she never knew why the security delays started in 2006. She unsuccessfully sought answers from the Homeland Security Department. She finally took the government to court, filing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in 2015 with help from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties advocacy organization.
Late last year, as a result of the suit, the government released more than 1,000 pages of documents to Poitras, which she shared with The Associated Press. The documents show for the first time that the U.S. government investigated Poitras on suspicion she might have been involved in an ambush that led to a U.S. soldier's death in Iraq in 2004.
On Nov. 20, 2004, Poitras was in Baghdad filming My Country, My Country. The film depicts Iraqi elections from the perspective of an Iraqi doctor, who criticized the U.S. occupation yet hoped democracy would take root in his homeland.
Members of a U.S. army National Guard unit from Oregon reported seeing a “white female” holding a camera on a rooftop just before they were attacked. David Roustum, 22, an Army National Guardsman from West Seneca, N.Y., was killed. Several troops were wounded. Some guardsmen who saw Poitras suspected she had a heads-up about the attack and didn't share that information with American forces because she wanted to film it. If true, Poitras would have broken U.S. criminal law.
Poitras called the allegation false and said she didn't film the attack.
“There is no ambush footage,” Poitras told the AP. “That's the narrative that they created, but it doesn't correspond with any facts.”
After the attack, a lieutenant colonel, whose name was redacted from documents, reported the woman with a camera to his superiors. No action was taken.
But after returning home, the lieutenant colonel was contacted by author John Bruning of Dallas, Ore., who was interviewing guardsmen for a book about their experiences in Iraq. According to the government's documents, the author learned about the woman filming on the rooftop before the ambush.
In an email exchange on Jan. 15, 2006, Poitras confirmed to Bruning that she was filming in the area the day of the attack, but didn't think she could help the author with his research.
“I was staying in the house of an Iraqi family I was following so my record of the fighting is from the perspective of the family,” Poitras wrote to Bruning. “I did not venture out onto the street that day — didn't seem like it would have been a good idea. So I really don't have a document of what took place on the streets.”
Bruning told the lieutenant colonel that Poitras was the woman on the rooftop. The lieutenant colonel then informed the U.S. military that she could have been involved.
In February 2006, a military police agent from Fort Lewis, Wash., interviewed the lieutenant colonel and the author.
Bruning declined to speak to the AP about Poitras.
But in his sworn statement to military investigators, he said he believed Poitras had prior knowledge of the attack. He said Poitras was staying in a pro-Saddam Hussein neighbourhood “and she was not in fear of her life or being kidnapped at a time when Western journalists were being abducted and executed.”
Nevertheless, the Army Criminal Investigation Command at Fort Belvoir, Va., wrote a two-page letter shortly after to the FBI, saying the Army lacked sufficient evidence to charge Poitras.
It said: “A review by our legal staff of the information developed thus far revealed credible information does not presently exist to believe Ms. Poitras committed a criminal offence; however, this could quickly change if Ms. Poitras were to be interviewed and admitted she had knowledge of the ambush and refused to notify U.S. forces in order to further her documentary and media interest.”
Poitras said she was never interviewed.
In May 2006, Army officials sent a summary of their investigation of Poitras to FBI headquarters in Washington.
The airport detentions and delays began shortly thereafter.
David Lapan, a Homeland Security Department spokesman, said other agencies control who is flagged as a high-risk traveller. When people are flagged, he said, authorities must “put them through enhanced screening procedures. This is the reason for Ms. Poitras' repeated referrals to secondary screening.” The FBI, which had investigated Poitras, declined to comment.
The detentions stopped abruptly six years later after a 2012 news article highlighted her travel problems.
Lapan said Poitras was deemed no longer of “significant interest.” That allowed Customs in June 2012 to “discontinue its enhanced screening procedures,” he said.
Poitras worries her ordeal will resume.
She is seeking more information from the government. A federal judge in Washington ruled late last month the FBI hadn't provided adequate justification for withholding some information.
“I don't know if the investigation is ongoing,” she said. “I don't know if it was ended or why it was ended.”

Jason Gardiner is back. And he hasn't arrived quietly. The judge on the recently returned Dancing On Ice, who can make the likes of Craig Revel Horwood and Simon Cowell seem polite and reserved with his razor-sharp, caustic remarks, is once again the major reason for tuning in.
And if we didn't already know about his impressive credentials – he's a trained ballet dancer, wrote his first musical aged 12, has choreographed shows for everyone from Shirley Bassey to Cher to Kylie – they're right in our face during our amazing photo shoot. We all stand there, jaws dropping, feeling like the least agile people who ever lived, as he slips into the splits with less effort than it takes the rest of us to plonk our behinds on the sofa.
‘Still got it,' he says, looking genuinely pleased with himself, although we just know he even watches the telly in some complicated yoga pose with his leg over his head.
The 46-year-old Aussie has led quite a life. His early days were beset by the most awful bullying and, just when he came to terms with his true self and left the past behind, he was told he'd never make it in ballet or theatre for being gay.
No wonder he's developed a ‘rhinoceros thick' skin and turned into the force of nature we see before us today. Actually really quite nice to talk to (we absolutely wouldn't want to cross him, though) and refreshingly open, Jason is at pains to ditch the ‘Mr Nasty' tag that he reckons is, well, a bit lazy.
And we most definitely don't want to argue with him about that. Or anything else for that matter…
Were you surprised Dancing On Ice came back?
Very. Usually when things are gone, they're gone. I had reservations, but I was overwhelmed with people on Twitter saying, ‘You have to come back!' They tried it once before without me and… it didn't do well. I keep it spicy.
How's it working out with Torvill and Dean on the judging desk?
I've got a lot more respect for this panel. We really know our stuff. I can disagree with them – they are top of the tree in the skating world, but I'm from the dance world, so I have credentials that match. We weren't allowed to criticise choreography before, because Jayne and Chris did it, so now, boy, the gloves are off, I really am laying into the pro skaters. I like ruffling feathers.

Do you ever feel guilty about what you say to people?
I'm honest, I give tough love. Everyone else is lovely, lovely, lovely, but you will never improve if you're being praised for being mediocre. Nobody wants mediocre.
Even your most famous harsh comments in previous series, like when you compared Sharron Davies to, um, a poo?
I still maintain I used a medical term [fecal matter], I didn't use words inappropriate for the time slot. It's exactly what it looked like – I thought, ‘God that was one of the most boring things, what did it remind me of?' and she was dressed all in brown, which was unfortunate… I never expected the uproar. I think it's going to stay with her for life. I hope she doesn't wear brown any more.
Do you get a lot of grief from viewers?
The unpleasantries this time are that I'm an ageist, apparently. Which is ironic considering I'm knocking on 50's door, so what on earth are they talking about? It's because of my remark about Cheryl Baker – her position in the air made her look like she was going up a Stannah stair lift. But I didn't say, ‘You're too old to do this competition'.
(Image: ITV)
What about saying Kelly Holmes looked like a man in drag…
I think, today, the climate has changed so much and I wouldn't say that – there would be a huge outrage. Sexual identity is huge right now, and fantastic. It is at the core of human existence and if you can't have your own identity, what have you got? And I was raised by drag queens.
Literally?
I left home at 16 and had an awful experience in the first bedsit I moved into with a man who abused me. I had to get out of there and I moved into a glorious draghouse. They were all ostracised from their families and we became a family.
Are you a different person in real life to the one on that judging panel?
I don't know what happens, but when I sit on that panel, something else takes over. Any sort of relationships or feelings I have, whether I really like someone as a person, or I'm a fan of them – it's bizarre, I don't know how I do it, it amazes me – I'm paid to have an opinion and I'm going to critique you as I see it. When I watch the clips back I think, ‘God, is that me? How did I just say that to them? I love that person!'
(Image: WireImage)
What's the worst thing anyone has ever said to you?
I was told by a well-known choreographer that I would never become a theatre star because I was gay. That hit me hard. There was a moment of darkness where I thought, ‘There's no point. If I'm coming up against that in musical theatre?' It even happened when I was studying ballet – they said if I wanted to be a principal dancer, I had to go back in the closet and stay there.
We were also dealing with the HIV/AIDs epidemic. It was terrifying and the rhetoric going round in Australia about gay men was ‘kill them'. I remember hearing even my family saying, ‘Good, wipe them out', while I was fantasising about men. The self-loathing was horrific.
You were horribly bullied as a child. What was the lowest point?
When I was stabbed in the back. Literally. With a compass. I was expelled for disrupting the class as a result. It wasn't just the students, it was the teachers. I couldn't go home and tell my mum and dad, ‘They're saying I'm a f*gg*t and a poofter,' because of the shame. Every day I'd throw up going to school and spend every lunch break in the library. Which is why I'm so good with words. So, up their a*ses. It's made me the person I am today. I wouldn't change any of it, actually.
So your razor-sharp way with words is a defence mechanism you developed?
I learnt that from the drag queens. They were so sharp and knew through the power of words how to stop a volatile situation escalating. I didn't have any of that with the bullies, there were too many. I was just being me, damn it. I'm Vegemite. Some people love me, some can't stand me. But stay true to yourself.
How is your love life these days?
I'm single. And I don't have anybody that wants to mingle. Apps and dating sites are great if you just want a hook up. And sometimes that's fine, but I'm at that point in my life where I want something more. When people get to know me they go, ‘You're so lovely,' but then they go, ‘I don't know if I could deal with all of that.' My life intimidates people.
You seem a very disciplined person…
An understatement. But I've relaxed a lot. Going on Bear Grylls: Mission Survive helped. You can't have OCD when you're traipsing around Africa sleeping rough. I let a few things go. Food issues have been with me since I was a teenager – we had weigh-ins at ballet school and I was surrounded by anorexics. I had it myself – I didn't see anyone else eat, so neither did I. Getting older has been a gift.

How is it to be famous again?
I get invited to nice things. But when Dancing On Ice stopped before, that all disappeared. The phone didn't ring. When you're back in the circus, all of these little parasites crawl out of the woodwork trying to get back into your good graces and you think, ‘Where were you for the past four years?' ‘We've really missed you darling, it's so great to have you back on our screens, can we do dinner?' I'm like, ‘F*** you!'
Is Jason really nasty, or nice?
When was the last time you lost your temper?
I don't shout, I go very quiet. It's almost a bit psychopathic. I'll be like, ‘Right, this is what's going to happen…' I give them a look and people on the other end of that look know they need to shut up or I will annihilate them.
What annoys you?
People standing on the wrong side of escalators, that p*sses me right off. And why is it that people with young children forget that everyone else exists? Tame your kids for Christ's sake. Have some decorum in social settings, people. There's a whole world out there that's not just your family.
Your worst trait?
I'm working on being more affectionate. If there's a crisis, I won't wrap my hands around you and let you cry on my shoulder, but I get all the messy stuff no one wants to sort. Hopefully by the time I'm 80 I'll meet somebody nice who I'll be able to hug. I'm a work in progress.
Does it bother you if people are scared of you?
I don't think I'd like people to be scared of me, because you don't get the best out of them. But I like to keep people on their toes, if it keeps them on the straight and narrow with me. There are enough f***ers who will scr*w you. And I've dated pretty much all of them.

Eyes Down for These Bingo Loving Stars
Famous or unknown, at the end of the day, we're all just people. And nothing shows how down to earth some celebrities are than finding out that while they can live the high life and go out wherever they want, they still get excited about activities accessible to us mere mortals, such as the humble game of bingo.
And if you think about it, what's not to love about bingo? Its universal popularity is down to the fact that it's an easy and fun game to play, you don't need to concentrate and you also have a chance of winning cash when you play. While lots of celebs have more money than they know what to do with, apparently some of them still get a big buzz out of playing bingo.
In fact, bingo has been reinventing itself in the last few years, both in real life and online. The tech advances made in bingo mean that it's now an ultra-convenient pastime for anyone, famous or not. Not only can you play on your phone, but it's also possible to make a bingo deposit by phone bill at sites like mFortune, which ensures that you can start playing whenever you want to. Wherever and whoever you are, topping up your bingo account is easier than ever.
With an estimated 100 million people now playing bingo online, there's no way of knowing whether you're chatting to a big name when you log on to online bingo chat rooms, as celebs' anonymity can be assured when they play under a bingo username. You can imagine that a few quick games of bingo on a smartphone would be a great way for a star to unwind in between shooting movie scenes or while they're being chauffeured to their next engagement. Perhaps they enjoy a bit of bingo banter in the chat rooms too.
So which celebrity bingo fans might you bump into while playing bingo on your mobile?
• Courtney Cox is one of a number of celebs who actually don't just enjoy playing the game, they get involved in running games occasionally too. Cox, Paris Hilton, Ricki Lake and Eric McCormack have all taken turns as the caller for celebrity bingo charity nights held at Legendary Bingo in Los Angeles. Perhaps the increased uptake of bingo playing on phones and online has led to the evolution of traditional bingo nights like those at Legendary Bingo and the Rebel Bingo club nights which are held in different venues in the UK, US and Europe.

• Perhaps one of the stars who's most often associated with bingo is actor Russell Crowe. Back in the days when he had yet to become a member of the Hollywood A-listers, Crowe worked at a bingo hall in his home country of Australia. Russell's pretty familiar with the rules of “Housie,” as he was a caller for the game. Perhaps luckily for Crowe, he got sacked for making up his own risqué bingo calls, and this cleared the way for his acting career to take off.
• Another actor who has a strong connection to bingo is Catherine Zeta-Jones. She came from a working-class home in Wales where money was tight – until her parents won £100,000 playing a game of bingo in the 1980s. With the windfall, they were able to support Catherine to reach her dreams of becoming an actress and it was while she was in acting school in London that she was discovered. Apparently, Zeta-Jones gets out the bingo cards at home on special occasions and has introduced her in-laws to the game, though it's said that husband Michael isn't a fan!
It's not just actors who love the game of bingo, though. The game has some pretty big fans from the world of music too.
• Rolling Stones' legend Mick Jagger has always been known for his wild partying, but he has a quieter side to him. He's said to enjoy hosting bingo nights for his friends at home, so perhaps he's introduced to the game to a few more celebs who might not otherwise have tried it.
• U2 frontman Bono is another fan of the game – he even is co-owner of a club in Dublin that includes bingo nights in its range of entertainment. Bono's been known to observe proceedings from a VIP balcony in the club.
• Robbie Williams may not immediately strike you as the kind of person who'd love bingo, but apparently, he does. In 2011, he attended a bingo charity night and won a handbag. In the same year, while filming a video for his single Advertising Space, Robbie discussed playing bingo with his parents when they came to visit him in LA and the song's video also featured a bingo hall in one scene.
Of course, there may be many other famous faces who like to get their eyes down with a game of bingo – we're not privy to every leisure activity that every celebrity enjoys. But what we know is that when playing bingo online, we could easily be in the company of one of these celebs without realizing it.

Kylie Minogue is reported to have found love once again after her last fiancé was accused of cheating on her.
This time the famously unlucky in love star has shunned her usual toyboy model type and hooked up with GQ's hunky creative director.
Kylie is said to have been quietly dating Paul Solomons since they were introduced in February this year.
It's been a year since Kylie, 49, was left 'traumatised' after calling off her engagement with actor Joshua Sasse, 30.

"Kylie's in no rush to get into a serious relationship, but she's enjoying the attention," said the insider.
They then added: "Both Kylie and Paul are keen to keep their close friendship under wraps."
Mirror Online has contacted representatives of Kylie for comment.

As well as bagging herself a new man, the pop princess is currently riding high after landing herself another number one album with Golden.
After the release date came off the back of her painful break-up with actor Joshua, Kylie was forced to deny some of the more emotional songs were about him.
"Literally, that's been and gone," she said on ITV's Lorraine, before adding, "That does seem like another life."
She continued: "I was very happily single when I wrote them [the tracks]. Like, very happily single. The grass is always greener isn't it?"

Speaking to the Sunday Times magazine back in February, the Aussie star revealed she fled to Thailand after the shock of the split sparked a breakdown.
"I just wanted to stop. I knew I needed to heal my... my physical system was compromised," she said.
"I think it's called a nervous breakdown. I just thought 'no, no, no, no'.
"Thailand was an opportunity to reclaim myself, get strong and get going.
"I think I reacted pretty quickly. I can take a nose dive pretty fast, but I won't stay there long," she added. "I'm too practical."

LAHORE - Most of the injured were still in a state of shock. Some were still unable to break the silence while others found it hard to make sense of what had actually happened. A few, however, narrated the incident in trembling voice.
“I went to Bedon Road for taking ice cream. On seeing rush of people, I came to Faisal Chowk out of curiosity which brought me close to the blast site,” said Muhammad Rizwan, a teenager who sustained injuries on legs and abdomen and was brought to the Ganga Ram Hospital.
“I fell unconscious and don't know as to how I reached the hospital,” he said.
For the on duty doctors receiving dead bodies and injured soaked in blood amid hue and cry was really a horrifying experience. But, they said, performing duty for serving and treating injured gave huge self satisfaction.
Mohsin Abbas, a traffic warden performing duties at Faisal Chowk, sustained injury on left arm and was brought to Services Hospital.
“Martyrdom of such a loving and competent boss (Syed Ahmed Mobeen) is a heart-rending episode for me. I have been performing duties at Faisal Chowk. I am not a coward and want to continue duty at the same spot in future. Hopefully I will be able to resume duty at that place,” said determined Mohsin Abbas.
“Doctors including seniors and allied staff are providing good healthcare facilities. All of us are getting free medicines,” said Rana Naseer, 35, security guard of CCPO Lahore under treatment at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Resident of Jaranwala sustained injuries on leg. He narrated the incident of suicide attack targeting senior police officers negotiating with participants of sit-in at Faisal Chowk in trembling voice.
“The chief traffic officer was talking to leaders of protesters at the time of blast. I only remember my uniform was soaked in blood. I fell unconscious and came to know about fracture in my leg when I opened eyes in the hospital. I have been operated and feeling well now,” Rana Naseer said.
Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Nouman Matloob said that majority of the injured and all dead received injuries on legs and abdomen.
“Patients are getting free treatment. Necessary medicines are available. Eight dead bodies were brought to the hospital and all were handed over to heirs after completing legal formalities. Presently, 39 injured are under treatment. 21 patients received minor injuries and they are recovering fast. Sharpeners and ball bearings have been removed after surgery of abdomen and legs of 18 patients. Out of these, eight are still in critical condition,” he said, adding, senior doctors were supervising treatment of all the injured.
Hospital sources said that as many as 67 injured including 10 in critical condition are still under treatment at different tertiary care hospitals in Lahore. At least two dozen patients with minor injuries were allowed to leave the hospitals after dressing of wounds on the same day while 16 were discharged yesterday.
As many as 19 patients were under treatment at Mayo Hospital and nine at Services Hospital.
The injured and their attendants expressed satisfaction on the overall healthcare facilities. Some attendants complained about inconvenience to patients due to frequent VVIP visits and the resultant extra ordinary security arrangements.
Duty doctors also complained about inconvenience of VVIP visits, saying it was actually interrupting provision of healthcare facilities to patients.
Minister Specialized Healthcare and Medical Education Kh Salman Rafiq said that the injured were getting quality healthcare services free of cost.
“There is no issue of shortage of any medicine. All the necessary drugs are available in stock. Senior consultants and officers of Health Department are supervising and monitoring provision of healthcare facilities to injured at all three hospitals,” he said.
Medics' bodies have expressed concerns over increasing trend of VVIP visits for photo session.
“Such visits of politicians and high ranking officers are against interests of patients. They interrupt provision of healthcare facilities. There are reports of not even allowing duty doctors to enter wards during visits of high profile politicians,” said Dr Khurram Shahzad, spokesman for Young Doctors Association Punjab.
Clifton James, best known for his indelible portrayal of a Southern sheriff in two James Bond films but who was most proud of his work on the stage, has died at the age of 96.
James died Saturday in Gladstone, Ore., due to complications from diabetes, his daughter Lynn James said.
"He was the most outgoing person, beloved by everybody," the daughter said. "I don't think the man had an enemy. We were incredibly blessed to have had him in our lives."
James often played a convincing Southerner but loved working on the stage in New York during the prime of his career.
One of his first significant roles playing a Southerner was as a cigar-chomping, prison floor-walker in the 1967 classic "Cool Hand Luke."
His long list of roles also includes swaggering, tobacco-spitting Louisiana Sheriff J.W. Pepper in the Bond films.
His portrayal of the redneck sheriff in "Live and Let Die" in 1973 more than held its own with sophisticated English actor Roger Moore's portrayal of Bond.
James was such a hit that writers carved a role for him in the next Bond film, "The Man With the Golden Gun," in 1974. James, this time playing the same sheriff on vacation in Thailand and the epitome of the ugly American abroad, gets pushed into the water by a baby elephant.
"He wasn't supposed to actually go in," said his daughter. "They gave him sugar in his pocket to feed the elephant. But he wasn't giving it to the elephant fast enough."

She said her father met with real Southern sheriffs to prepare for his role as Pepper. Of his hundreds of roles, it was the Louisiana sheriff that people most often recognized and approached him about.
His daughter noted that her father sometimes said actors get remembered for one particular role out of hundreds.
"His is the sheriff's, but he said he would have never picked that one," she said.
George Clifton James was born May 29, 1920, in Spokane, Wash., the oldest of five siblings and the only boy. The family lost all its money at the start of the Great Depression and moved to Gladstone, just outside Portland, Ore., where James' maternal grandparents lived.
In the 1930s, James got work with the Civilian Conservation Corps and then entered World War II in 1942 as a soldier with the U.S. Army in the South Pacific, receiving two Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and a Silver Star.
Lynn James said one of the Purple Hearts came when a bullet pierced his helmet and zipped around the inside to come out and split his nose. The second Purple Heart, she said, came from shrapnel that knocked out many of his teeth.
After the war, James took classes at the University of Oregon and acted in plays. Inspired, he moved to New York and launched his acting career.
Later in life, he spent the fall and spring of each year in New York. In the winter, he lived in Delray Beach, Fla. During the summer he lived in Oregon.
James' wife, Laurie, died in 2015. He is survived by two sisters, five children, 14 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
KASUR: The police claimed to have recovered 40kg of hashish worth millions of rupees from a car here the other day.
According to the Khuddian Khas Police, the hashish was recovered during snap-checking at Syedpur. The police registered a case against the accused Syed Rehman of Landi Kotal who managed to escape the scene.
Trinidad and Tobago were eliminated from the CONCACAF Under-15 Championship with a game to spare after their second successive Group B loss today at the IMG Campus in Bradenton, Florida.
The young Soca Warriors were routed 6-0 by hosts, the United States, on the heels of a 4-0 loss to Costa Rica yesterday.
Ten goals conceded with none scored and zero points, the Warriors have no choice of advancing to the knock out stages. However, they can expect another tough test on Wednesday when they face a Canada team that will be aiming to ensure their own progress.
Canada lost 1-0 to the United States on Sunday but rebounded to beat Costa Rica today. So Canada and Costa Rica both enter their final group matches with three points and will be competing for one available spot alongside the US.
It was always going to be tough for Trinidad and Tobago to match them but head coach Russell Latapy has had the team in training for much of the year and there was an invitational tournament in the Cayman Islands along with a pre-CONCACAF friendly by way of warm-up.
Trinidad and Tobago drew with Manchester City, DC United and Tampa Bay United with a solitary loss to Houston Dynamo before they faced international competition. But they still came up well short when the confederation's championship kicked off.
Latapy's own record as national youth coach, since he returned to Trinidad last September, has been humbling with defeats to Haiti and Jamaica and a solitary win over Bermuda at the Caribbean Under-17 level last year before he picked up the National Under-15 Team.
In his defence, Trinidad and Tobago have played second fiddle to Jamaica and Haiti long before Latapy took up the reins while Costa Rica and the United States enjoy tremendous records against the twin island republic.
After Sunday's loss, Latapy told the TTFA Media that his under-15 players have good technical quality but lacked in the areas of tactical awareness and game management.
“We are a much better team than we were earlier in the year,” said Latapy, “but we still need the experience of playing international games in which this here is part of the process.”
Trinidad and Tobago U-15 Starting Team (x USA): Trinidad and Tobago: 1.Jahiem Wickham (GK), 16.Marc Wharfe, 4.Antonio Chee Ting, 3.Darian Bradshaw, 13.Zachary Welch, 6.Jabari Lee (2.Randy Antoine 62), 9.Ezekiel Kesar (15.Adriel George 52nd minute), 8.Josiah Allen (5.Cephas St Rose 46), 11.Jaiye Sheppard, 10.Josiah Edwards (7.Jean-Heim Mc Fee 12), 17.Justin Araujo-Wilson.

Iowa's new state climatologist, Justin Glisan, says he won't be spending all of his working hours in his office in Des Moines. “Getting out into the state is a big thing I'm excited about,” Glisan says.
The Missouri native was hired as Iowa's state climatologist in May. He plans to travel the state as much as possible. “And talk to farmers, the ag sector, talk to any group that'll have me,” Glisan says. “This is an important job and getting more people in the observation role, with a thermometer and a rain gauge in their backyard, so they can report those.”
One task of the state climatologist is coordinating a group of volunteers who report daily weather observations. The multi-state group is known as CoCoRaHS, the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow network.
The 35-year-old old Glisan is only the third person to hold the job of state climatologist in Iowa. He replaced Harry Hillaker, who recently retired after three decades in the position.
Glisan is also hoping to keep the job until he retires. “I really think that being in a position like this for a long time gives you an idea of how the climate of Iowa has changed or how the weather patterns have changed. Harry liked to call himself ‘the weather librarian' and I'd really want to emulate his career,” Glisan says. “So, I hope I can be here for a long time.”
The state climatologist's office is part of the Iowa Department of Agriculture. Glisan is in charge of compiling weekly, monthly, and annual reports about precipitation totals, shifts in temperatures, and other climate-related data.

Mike Reilly was born to run, but in his fifth season with the Edmonton Eskimos, the quarterback with the Methuselah beard has pretty much run out of things to experience.
Reilly has had three coaches and two general managers with the green and gold. He has been booed off the field, along with the rest of the team, in a miserable 2013 campaign, only to don a knee brace two years later and march the Eskimos to a Grey Cup.
He has blown out his knee, blown up his bursa sac, broken his foot, and has been knocked wobbly with a concussive helmet-to-helmet hit.
He has gone from a gun-slinging, free-running risk taker dropping the deep bomb and forcing the ball into tight coverage to a field general in head coach Jason Maas' up-tempo, no huddle offence, predicated on hot reads and adjustments on the fly.
“I've seen pretty much all,” Reilly said after practice at Commonwealth Stadium
“That's why you appreciate what you have now, because you know what a championship calibre team looks like and you know what one doesn't look like.
“Right now I know we have a championship calibre team. I say calibre because a lot of stuff has to happen between now and (the Grey Cup).”
The Eskimos offence lit it up last season under Reilly and the tag team receiving duo of Adarius Bowman and Derel Walker
They led the CFL in net offence (418.7 yards per game) first downs (448), completion percentage (71) and second down conversions (54.1 per cent).
Reilly topped all quarterbacks, throwing for 5,554 yards to go with 28 TD passes against 12 interceptions. Bowman led the CFL in receiving yards (1,761) followed at number two by Walker, who has since left to try out for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFL.
Reilly said better things are coming with a year of the Maas offence under their belts.

“With all the great quarterbacks and offences that they've had here with Ricky Ray and Warren Moon, we had the highest completion percentage in the history of the Edmonton Eskimos last season,” he said.
“And we watched the tape and we felt like we were way lower (in percentage) than we should have been — which is crazy but it's true.”
Bowman said Reilly has always been a leader but in the last two years, particularly under Mass, has become more of a tactician determined to keep the defence off balance and the other offence on the bench.
“It's all about staying on the field,” said Bowman.
“I remember in Mike's earlier years it was the big play, you needed something just chucked down the field, but somehow we made it work.”
Off the field, Reilly arrived in Edmonton as a 28-year-old bachelor after three years as a back-up with the B.C. Lions. Now he's a 32-year-old husband to Emily and, as of last year, first-time father to daughter Brooklyn.
“It's been life changing,” said Reilly, from Kennewick, Wash.
“There's a lot of stress in (quarterbacking), but then you get home and get to see your little baby girl smiling, and she couldn't care less if you threw five touchdowns or five picks. That definitely changes things for you, puts it into perspective.”
Brooklyn has been home in Seattle with Emily during training camp.
“The best part of my day is five-minute FaceTime before she goes to bed,” he said.
And the Rip Van Winkle beard? It may be history later this week when Emily arrives in Edmonton and Reilly makes his case to save the face fuzz.
“I'll try to barter with her but I don't know if it's going to work,” he said.
“I would not be shocked if the next time I step on the field at Commonwealth it's gone.”

Bags of rubbish and human faeces have been left behind on a site that was occupied by travellers.
A group of travellers moved onto the former Listy's Sport and Social Club site on West Common Lane.
It was the fifth time that travellers have occupied the site since June and came as a Broughton-based company is investing a significant sum on converting the site into a care centre for adults with autism and learning difficulties.
The development will create 20 new full-time and part-time jobs.
A spokesperson for North Lincolnshire Council previously said they were aware of the travellers on the site.
North Lincolnshire Council has been contacted for comment.
The Trump White House defended its record on transparency Monday despite two glaring cases in which its practices fell short of those of the Obama administration.
In his first briefing since the administration said it would no longer release logs of visitors to the White House, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House was simply returning to a policy that had been in place until President Obama took office. He dismissed the disclosures made by the last administration as a "faux attempt" at transparency.
The Obama administration, starting in September 2009, voluntarily began releasing records each month of who had visited the West Wing or other offices in the executive complex. There were exceptions, though, for visits deemed to be purely personal or for highly sensitive purposes, including some national security discussions or interviews of candidates for positions like Supreme Court seats.
"We recognize that there's a privacy aspect to allowing citizens to come express their views. And that's why we maintain the same policy that every other administration did come up here prior to the last one," Spicer said.
"And the last one, frankly, was a faux level of doing that, because when you go through, and you scrub everyone's name out that you don't want everyone to know, that really is not an honest attempt at doing it."
Separately, Spicer also said President Trump would not release his 2016 tax returns, citing the same justification the campaign had offered for not releasing filings from previous years: They are under audit.
"I think the president's view on this has been very clear from the campaign, and the American people understood it when they elected him in November," Spicer said two days after a series of demonstrations across the country called for the president to release his tax records.
Although Trump has long claimed his 2015 returns were under audit -- something the IRS as a policy does not confirm -- it is guaranteed that his 2016 filings will be. As USA Today noted last week, all presidents are subject to audit under Internal Revenue Service practice dating back decades. That fact hasn't stopped past presidents from releasing their tax returns.
On the issue of visitor logs, Obama administration officials believed they never got the credit from the public or the press corps that they believed they deserved for what was a new policy at the time. In 2016, then-Press Secretary Josh Earnest wrote a letter to the New York Times claiming that the policy was just one of several ways in which they were fulfilling Obama's promise "to lead the most transparent White House in history."
At the very least, though, Obama's administration set a standard to which their Republican successor now is being held.
Reporters asked Spicer on Monday about the verdict of some ethics experts that the Trump administration was already the least transparent in decades. He disagreed, citing what he said was increased access reporters have to official events.
"I think we've done a fairly good job of making sure that people know who he's meeting with, who he's speaking to, and when appropriate, the contents of those calls," Spicer said in his 30-minute briefing, one far shorter than the ones typically held in the Obama administration.
The panel is part of the first Climate Action forum by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment to be held every year at World Government Summit. Dr Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said the world wastes $2.6 trillion worth of food every year at a time when farmers are leaving rural areas for the cities.
The issue is of concern in the UAE as well, he said, when combined with global fears of growing food security and waste. “It is a $4 billion [a year] problem in the UAE,” Al Zeyoudi said. “We need food efficiency.” Greater use of new agri-technology, he said, can increase “food efficiency for production that will produce food with 99 per cent less water.” Greater care is needed from the farmer's field to kitchen table if the world is to sustain growing food demand that will spike by 50 per cent by 2050, Al Zeyoudi said. Jose Graziano da Silva, director-general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), said the food security issue is compounded heavily by the astronomical amount of food wasted daily around the world. “We need to waste less food, one-third of the food we produce is wasted,” da Silva told delegates. Da Silva said entirely new approaches are needed for the global food system to help fight climate change. ”We need to transport less food over distances,” he said, “to reduce greenhouse gases from food transport.” Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said the recent Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 now has been ratified by 129 countries as a blueprint for decades to come to hold global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Fighting climate change may help limit the massive impacts upon agriculture that disruptive weather patterns and storms could bring down the road, she said. “There is a need for us to accelerate action in order for us to build agriculture,' Espinosa said. “Food waste is something that starts with the individual and his activities.” Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister of Bhutan, said food security is critical in his country where 64 per cent of citizens depends on agriculture for a living. Fighting climate change in years ahead is critical to stop changes already happening in his country, he said. Tobgay said that “because of climate change, glacial lakes are breaking dams and wreaking havoc downstream.” More from Government Mohammad launches 10x pro-innovation initiative

The two dynamic and sometimes controversial wide receivers and the always-reliable and often spectacular Bruce are among 15 modern-era candidates. From that group, no more than five will be selected.
On Saturday, the 48 voters for the Pro Football Hall of Fame face a similar complexity. Is Moss, in his first year of eligibility for the Canton, Ohio, shrine, worthy of induction? And what about T.O., in his third year on the ballot? Or Bruce, in his fourth year.
BLOOMINGTON, MINN.—Randy Moss on one side, Terrell Owens on the other. Isaac Bruce in the slot.
Malcolm Jenkins' season about more than football
Also being considered are first-year eligibles linebackers Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher, and guard Steve Hutchinson. Other finalists are running back Edgerrin James; centre Kevin Mawae; safeties John Lynch and Brian Dawkins; guard Alan Faneca; tackles Joe Jacoby and Tony Boselli; and cornerbacks Ty Law and Everson Walls.
The senior nominees are linebacker Robert Brazile and guard Jerry Kramer. In the contributor's committee it is Bobby Beathard.
Much of the attention will be paid to the guys who caught the ball extremely well. Moss and Owens made the Team of the Decade for the 2000s. Bruce's TD reception won the 2000 Super Bowl for the Rams against the Titans.
Owens has been a lightning rod because despite impressive career numbers, he's failed twice to get the necessary 80 per cent for induction.
“I think it diminishes the reputation and the credibility the Hall of Fame is really revered for,” Owens says of not being elected for what he believes are “character” reasons.
“I have kind of just moved on from it. Me not getting in first time — and everybody else said at the same time, I should have been in — and even the second time, I have been in (contention) — I am very fortunate and blessed to have played the game as long as I did considering I thought I would never play beyond the college level.”
Owens played for five teams in 15 pro seasons, having the most success with San Francisco and Dallas, losing a Super Bowl with Philadelphia. Each of his stints in those cities — he also was with Buffalo and Cincinnati — didn't end well.
“Early in my career when I was an adolescent and teenager, I had self-esteem issues,” he explains. “I had to get out of that. You have to believe in yourself in order to progress in order to do anything in your life. No matter what, I am not going to look at the Hall of Fame as a platform to kind of validate what I did in my career.”
Nor does Moss, who spent 14 NFL seasons with five clubs, having his best years with Minnesota. He was the 1998 Offensive Rookie of the Year with the Vikings and in 2007 helped the New England Patriots go undefeated until they fell to the Giants in the Super Bowl.
Like Owens, Moss also had some run-ins with teammates, opponents, coaches and executives. Whether that affects him as Owens believes it has impacted him for Hall of Fame consideration remains to be seen.
“Going through college and my first couple years in the league, I never looked at the Hall of Fame or at the (gold) jackets,” Moss says. “I loved and enjoyed the game. As I retired, now on my fifth year and up as a finalist, now is the time I really looked at, ‘Am I Hall of Fame worthy? Will I get the nod?'
“Through my playing career, the Hall of Fame was not in my equation. I just enjoyed coming to the stadium and being around my teammates and just competing.”
Moss admits there might be some nerves Saturday.
“It's kind of like you going into court and being in front of a jury, the fate is in their hands,” he says. “I don't have a vote.
“What I will do is being around close family and friends and just wait it out . . . I guess your overall final accomplishment for playing in the NFL is the gold jacket. Some nervousness will come in.
“I think I am worthy of getting in on the first ballot, but if not, you win some, you lose some. If the Hall of Fame is my final stop, I am definitely honoured to be part of it.”

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Nikita Kucherov helped the Tampa Bay Lightning quickly bounce back from a rare shutout loss.
Kucherov scored twice to lead the Lightning to a 3-1 victory against the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday. Tampa Bay extended its lead to four points over Boston for the top overall spot in the Eastern Conference less than 24 hours after a shutout loss at home to the Bruins.
"We weren't sitting in here pouting," said Lightning captain Steven Stamkos, who finished with two assists. "We thought we had a decent effort (against Boston) and we knew we wanted to improve on it."
Kucherov's fourth multi-goal game of the season extended his lead to four points in the race for the Art Ross Trophy over Edmonton's Connor McDavid, who was held off the scoresheet. McDavid scored four goals against Tampa Bay earlier this season.
"We tried to stay on top of him, have a guy back on him, not give him too much room," said Tampa Bay center Brayden Point, who drew the defensive assignment against McDavid. "In the first period he had a pretty good chance kind of out of nothing just by skating around us. After that we did a pretty good job of just staying on top of him."
Victor Hedman also scored for the Lightning and Stamkos added two assists.
Tampa Bay's penalty kill was a big area of improvement as Edmonton came up empty on five power-play chances, including 28 seconds of a two-man advantage with 6:35 left in the third period. Despite 14 shots in total on the power play, nine during three successive chances in the third, the Oilers failed to convert with the man advantage.
"We talk a lot about the chances, the shots, the looks we had but it's still got to get a goal," Edmonton head coach Todd McLellan said. "That's been the tale of the tape on the power play. We had (14) shots on goal and a number of missed attempts or opportunities."
Ty Rattie scored for Edmonton and Al Montoya finished with 37 saves.
Louis Domingue, making his eighth start with Tampa Bay since being acquired from Arizona, finished with 29 saves and recovered from allowing a fluke goal 14 seconds in to the game after he fumbled the puck behind the net that Rattie collected and banked off the Lighting goaltender.
"There are days when you give up a goal like that and it's going to be harder," Domingue said. "But I washed it away right away. It was one of those things, the guys are coming in tapping your pads. It was just a bad break. You can't do anything about it."
Hedman pulled Tampa Bay even at 15:12 of the first period. Kucherov put the Lightning in front on the power play 2:24 in to the game and provided the insurance goals 11:34 in to the third.
NOTES: Lightning RW Ryan Callahan appeared in his 700th career game, 250th with Tampa Bay. Callahan played his first 450 games with the New York Rangers. . Edmonton D Kris Russell missed his second consecutive game after blocking a shot against San Jose on Wednesday. . Tampa Bay allowed five power play goals in the previous three games. . Lightning head coach Jon Cooper moved two victories behind John Tortorella for the most in franchise history. . McDavid had points in eight of his previous nine games, six of those multi-point games.

ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC) has trained about 100,000 farmers of rice, wheat, maize and sugarcane across the country during last four year. The farmers were trained under USAID funded Agriculture Innovation Programme (AIP), which would be concluded by the end of current year, said an official of PARC. Under the programme, the farmers of wheat, rice, maize and vegetables were provided different training of soil testing, seed selection, water management and adoption of innovative technologies to enhance per-acre crop yield, he added.
VERMILION, Alta. -
Lakeland College students and faculty shared the potential plans of their new Dairy Learning Centre at an open house on Monday, Feb. 6, at the Centre for Sustainable Innovation.
“The event is an open house before the final bylaws are passed. Once everything is officially approved, the college will be having an official announcement with more details,” said Marigje Bikker, leader of the Dairy Student Managed Farm (SMF) team and second-year Animal Science Technology student, during the open house.
The following day, the Town of Vermilion council gave second and third reading to Bylaw 1-2017 and 2-2017 and proceeded with the amendments to accommodate the development of a Confined Feeding Operation within Lakeland College land.
The proposed 47,000 square feet facility will feature 120 cows, a meeting space fit for 25 people, and public viewing mezzanine, or “partial floor” located between the ground floor and first floor. It will also include a heifer barn with outside pens, commodity shed, two silage bunkers, and a lagoon for liquid manure and storage. It also has the potential to service an additional 400 students in the college's agriculture programs.
The lagoon, specifically, caused much conversation, questions, and concerns, in the community in terms of location and if Lakeland College would be hosting two lagoons or one.
Project Manager Craig Marple cleared the air saying the lagoon will be replacing the one already on campus, and will have close to the same functions as the current one.
“The new one will separate the solids from the liquids, so there are a slightly fewer volumes of manure that is actually going to the lagoon. It'll be emptied at the same frequency, which is twice a year approximately, and there are some numbers that say they might have an extra four to six hours' worth of unloading,” Marple said.
Marple went on to say the difference to what the town and any member of the public will experience is minimal, and they are in discussion with the town on taking any solids or compost from the and adding it to the compost pile at Lakeland.
They are also looking into odor mitigation through a straw cannon, which will reduce the odor by as much as 95 per cent.
The design of the proposed dairy barn is also guided by five principles, including Safe student and industry training; Maximize automation and minimize environment impact; Transition cow management; Cow comfort and animal care; and Bio security.
Since the beginning stages of the dairy centre's plans, Lakeland College students have been integral pieces in the process.
With two groups of six now gone and graduate, 2016-17's Dairy SMF team, Sydney Fox, Quinn Rogstad, Jan Werner Slomp, Jeremy Kramer, Bikker, and Alekzander Moes, are finalizing the two-year production in order to meet the August 1 deadline.
“It has been a great opportunity to learn about it and all the steps it takes to go through designing a barn for future education,” Kramer said. “So, when we want to go and do it ourselves - I am glad I was here for the opportunity to help out.
The Dairy SMF team manages a mixed herd of Jerseys and Holsteins with assistance from faculty and farm staff, and contribute to everyday operations on the college's SMF, and is involved with breeding, moving, monthly health visits by a vet, milking, regular nutritional consultant visits, and hoof trimming.
Bikker added that the whole project has been a long-time coming with the goal of it being a long-term facility that will offer leading industry technology for future students.
Some of the technology anticipated to be a part of the build includes a robotic and conventional milking parlour, automated feed system with robotic delivery, herb navigator technology, manure scrapers programmed to run several times a day, and a manure separation system.
“(The) automatic robot feeder (has) not really seen in western Canada and it will definitely draw the public I think,” Bikker said. “There is also a lot more high technology stuff like a herd navigator and an item that takes out the need for a vet. There is also a manure separator and in a few years, there is room for expansion for compost bedding if that is the way we decide to go. There is lots of opportunity in this project.”
Werner Slomp added the robotics in the parlour was another great opportunity for the team, as they will be aware of the state-of-art technology being created in the dairy industry, which will prepare them upon graduation this year.
The group also focused on the Bio security aspect of the project, by projecting all of the numbers that fall under feed needs, manure and the capacity needed.
The project has also seen tremendous support by Alberta Milk, according to Lakeland's Dean of Agriculture Josie Van Lent
“The Alberta dairy industry is supporting us strongly by providing quota, and they have also provided input,” she said. “They have been an intrical part in this and we really see opportunities for training in the dairy industry, and that is certainly what this barn is going to be about; training future dairy producers and also training people to work in the barns.”
“We took the students to their board meeting, which consists of all dairy producers. There, the students were able to sit down and review the plans; we all did.
Van Lent added the project will cost approximately $9 million, which is supported by both provincial and federal government, and will encompass the land development across from the college's CSI, the purchasing of additional cows and heifers, and the upgrade of the old dairy barn to a sheep facility.
Joel Barlow High will host a girls Lacrosse alumnae game on Saturday, May 20, at 1 p.m. at the Barlow stadium field. All former players are invited to come and challenge the current varsity team. Food and refreshments will be available after the game.
The suspension by President Cyril Ramaphosa of SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane on Monday night brings to an end a 42-months' long reign of terror which not only saw the haemorrhaging of skilled staff and the relentless persecution of senior executives, including former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, but also the reduction of the once-formidable revenue service to a hollow shell. Under Moyane, one of Jacob Zuma's most loyal pawns, SARS became a key and vital player of the State Capture project. By MARIANNE THAMM.
On Monday night, behind the scenes, an unholy battle of wits played out as SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane clung to his job for dear life.
You have to give it to the man. Nothing so far has shamed this Zuma loyalist.
From massive revenue collection shortfalls to the exposure by the FIC of his right-hand man Jonas Makwakwa's own suspicious list of payments to his private account as well as links to a money laundering debt collection firm, to an expedited, and unlawful, VAT payment to the Guptas, Moyane has behaved like a man who believes he is untouchable.
On Monday night, after being asked to step aside earlier, Moyane even attempted to threaten President Cyril Ramaphosa with an interdict. His “deadline” to the President was 21.30 on Monday night.
At 10:00 the Presidency issued a statement that Moyane had been suspended “with immediate effect pending the institution of disciplinary proceedings”.
It was in the public interest to restore the credibility of SARS without delay, the statement said, adding that in a letter to Moyane, Ramaphosa had said that developments at the SARS under his leadership “have resulted in a deterioration in public confidence in the institution and in public finances being compromised. For the sake of the country and the economy, this situation cannot be allowed to continue, or to worsen”.
The President raised concerns about the manner in which Moyane had handled the Makwakwa matter, his treatment of the report given to him by the Financial Intelligence Centre, and his failure to immediately report this to the Minister of Finance.
Another concern was the management of VAT refunds (including a R70-million repayment to the Gupta family) which Ramaphosa said had “brought the SARS into serious disrepute and potentially jeopardised the integrity of the SARS as collector of revenue and adversely affected tax morality among taxpayers”.
Mark Kingon, who replaces Moyane in the interim, is currently Acting Chief Officer: Business and Individual Taxes with SARS – in other words, he is the man who also replaced Joseph Makwakwa late last week... There must be a message in there somewhere.
The decision to suspend Moyane followed a meeting in which Ramaphosa had informed Moyane that he had lost confidence in his ability to lead SARS and had offered him an opportunity to resign with immediate effect, which Moyane had declined.
Ramaphosa said that as SARS Commissioner, Moyane held a “high position of trust” in the management of the country's public finances, and it was necessary, therefore, “to act urgently and immediately to protect the institution and place it on a path to stability and recovery”.
The appointment of Tom Moyane as SARS Commissioner by Jacob Zuma in September 2014 took everyone by surprise at the time. His appointment was announced to senior staff only a few hours before the decision was made public.
Almost immediately, Moyane instituted a series of suspensions of senior staff and by April 2015, 10 people had left, including CEO Barry Hore, enforcement head Johann van Loggerenberg, anti-corruption head Clifford Collings and group executive for strategy and planning Peter Richer. They were followed later by the resignation of Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay, his adviser Yolisa Pike and chief officer for SARS enforcement and customs investigations, Gene Ravele. SARS spokesperson Adrian Lackay also resigned.
The purge by Moyane had been orchestrated after a series of stories had appeared in the Sunday Times alleging that a “rogue unit” had existed in SARS. But even before the series of articles, which the Press Ombudsman later ordered the newspaper to retract, SARS had been under threat from underworld figures and politically connected individuals who were being investigated and brought to book.
What followed was an attack on SARS through abusing state resources in Crime Intelligence, the State Security Agency, the Hawks and SAPS.
In his book The President's Keepers – Those Keeping Zuma in Power and Out of Prison, investigative journalist Jacques Pauw exposed how Moyane has protected Zuma in his bid to quash the R63-million tax bill as well as the former president's failure to submit tax returns for the first five years of his presidency.
Moyane and Zuma's friendship dates back to their days in exile in Mozambique. Moyane said Zuma had been the first to receive him in Mozambique in 1976 and that he had worked “under his leadership” when Zuma was the Deputy Chief Representative for the ANC.
While Moyane clung to his powerful position as scandal after scandal broke around him, it was Daily Maverick's Pauli van Wyk's in-depth investigative dossiers on the SARS commissioner's lies, cover-ups and fake investigations into Makwakwa that proved to be his final undoing.
And in a week when rumours circulated that former acting commissioner Ivan Pillay and former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas were headed to SARS, the NPA's Priority Crimes Litigation Unit was suddenly and coincidentally roused to action, recycling an old case number to come after Pillay and Co. The same case number was used by Hawks boss, Berning Ntlemeza, to pursue Pravin Gordhan.
Moyane, like many in the machinery of the state, threw his lot fully and completely in with former president Jacob Zuma. While Cyril Ramaphosa has had to act swiftly with regard to the massive clean-up, there are many ghosts still left in this machine. Moyane is not likely to go down quietly. But for now he is out of the picture and away from causing further damage to the engine that drives the Treasury and the country's economy – SARS.
There will be, on many levels, a collective sigh of relief from many at the SARS headquarters in Pretoria (and beyond its walls) on Tuesday as a man whose actions have severely compromised the service will be barred from wreaking any more damage.
From the moment he was appointed SARS, Tom Moyane featured in newspaper headlines almost daily and always for the wrong reasons. Hopefully much of the chaos he caused will be quietened down and the most extreme of the damage reversed.
For South Africa to exist, SARS must work. As a country, we toyed with the suicide button for way too long. It is now time for the grown-ups to come and help SARS serve the people of South Africa once again. DM

A five-goal lead held up for the Joel Barlow High girls lacrosse team in a 13-5 win over Mask at home on Monday, April 17.
The Falcons went up 7-2 after one half of play and did not leave up for the remainder of the night.
Tess Siburn led the Falcons with six goals. Cat Goncalves and Sarah Witherbee each netted two.
Julia Shapiro, Hannah Tunick and Maggie Porter all scored one apiece. Elena Patron had an assist.
Gabby Becket led MAsuk with three goals.
Eve Grassie made eight saves in goal for Barlow, now 3-3.
A San Mateo County homeowner woke up early Monday to find that what's believed to have been a mountain lion had entered her bedroom, snatched her pet dog and walked out, authorities said.
The woman and her child were sleeping in her bedroom at about 3 a.m., when her 15-pound Portuguese Podengo, which was just feet away from them, suddenly started barking aggressively, according to Det. Salvador Zuno, spokesman for the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.
She woke up and saw a shadow of an animal walk through her partially open French doors and enter her bedroom.
The animal then took the small dog from the foot of her bed and walked out, he said.
With a flashlight, the woman looked for her dog, but only found large wet paw prints at the entrance of her bedroom, Zuno said.
Deputies searched the area and also found similar paw prints. They immediately notified the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, he said.
“They are very shaken up about what happened,” Zuno said.
The woman and her child live in the rural, coastal town of Pescadero, where residents often come across wildlife, he said.
But even in Pescadero, Zuno said, this sighting of an apparent mountain lion is rare. In the San Mateo County mountains, cougars usually eat deer and other wildlife, not pets, Zuno said.
“What's so rare and shocking about this is that the animal comes up to the property and enters the home,” the detective said.
Andrew Hughan, a Fish and Wildlife spokesman, said the department is still trying to determine if the animal was a mountain lion.
“It's too early to tell,” he said.
Meanwhile, Zuno said residents should take precautions and safeguard their homes. He advised residents to keep an air horn nearby and lock their windows and doors at night.

Thailand will need to delay a planned general election until 2018 to allow time to pass the necessary laws, a member of the military government's national assembly said on Monday.
But a spokesman for the government said it remained on track for an election this year as set out in its roadmap to restore civilian rule.
The junta toppled an elected government in 2014 in a bid to enforce calm in a country divided by more than a decade of conflict between a military-backed royalist establishment and populist political forces.
Somjet Boonthanom, a member of the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly (NLA), told Reuters that elections would likely be delayed until March or April 2018.
"This is not a postponement but because of the intricacies involved in drafting election laws, elections will not happen this year," he said.
Until now, the junta has said it is sticking to plans for an election in late 2017.
"As far as the government is concerned, we are on track with the roadmap. The NLA's opinions are their own," said Major General Sansern Kaewkamnerd, spokesman for the prime minister's office.
Thailand's army has carried out 12 successful coups since 1932.
The next step in the transition back to civilian rule is for new King Maha Vajiralongkorn to endorse a constitution which was approved in a referendum last year.
Critics argue that provisions in the constitution will entrench the hold of the military even after elections.

The 2017 Carbon Fiber conference, Nov. 28-30 in Charleston, SC, US, includes a tour of the Boeing South Carolina plant, a panel on carbon fiber recycling and a pre-conference seminar on carbon fiber in transportation and energy applications.
The agenda for CompositesWorld's 2017 Carbon Fiber conference, Nov. 28-30 in Charleston, SC, US, at the Belmond Charleston Place, is nearing completion. Registration is now open and attendees are encouraged to secure lodging as soon as possible.
The Carbon Fiber conference, the pre-eminent source of information about carbon fiber supply chain trends, technologies and applications, this year features a tour of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner final assembly line in North Charleston, followed by a half-day pre-conference tutorial by Chris Red, principle of Composites Forecasts and Consulting LLC, titled, “2017 Carbon Fibers Global Outlook: Growth through Transportation and Energy Applications.”
For the cost of a good hotel room (on a per-person, per-night basis), you get a mostly all-inclusive break from our whirling hyper-culture. It unspools you to the sea. You are still attached to the world, yes, but barely so. It's a kind of magical-thinking aquamarine summer suburbia, a dreamy distillation of middle-class Americana, minus the drudgery of lawn mowing and dish washing. It is the pleasure of the familiar with just enough variety to feel, in the vaguest possible sense, adventurous.
The arms-length ironic detachment with which so many of us (OK, me) lead our day-to-day land lives simply doesn't work when surrounded by a thousand fleshy strangers in swimsuits. Accommodation to imperfections, those of others and ourselves, must be made. Out there in the balmy breezes, where the average age is far north of Madison Avenue's desirable demographics, coolness falls away, as unnecessary and cumbersome as a poolside leather jacket.
Nothing is cool on the Summit. How could it be? Cool feels phony while self-assembling tacos under the "Mexican Corner" sign at the Oceanview Cafe. Cool requires a certain snootiness, which may be appropriate when weighing whether to watch "The Big Bang Theory" or "Atlanta," but doesn't do much good when deciding between playing bingo or Baggo (a beanbag-tossing game). Both are equally uncool. In fact, every activity in the ship's daily circular reads like the itinerary of a well-meaning but dorky youth minister: "11:00 a.m. Scrapbooking Session With the Cruise Director Staff"? The 2:15 "Port vs. Starboard Pool Volleyball" match? "Foyer Jams With Chris Hawks" running until 8:45? All decidedly uncool-sounding. But I went to two of these events, foyer jams and volleyball (as a spectator, not a participant), and they were fun. Not supposedly so. Just fun.
In his essay, Wallace complained about (among other things), feeling infantilized aboard the Nadir, about being "pampered," which he compared to "a certain other consumer product" (actual Pampers, that is). He's right in his description, but wrong in his conclusion. Yes, the cruise is set up as a deeply maternal experience, a place of nurturing, even coddling. It dispenses care with the gentleness of a mom tending to a kid with a sore throat. Ice cream, for example, is available, in multiple locations. But where Wallace felt infantilized, I feel gratitude. A lot of us need care. Not just the many wobbly older passengers, but the younger ones, too. The harried parents, the cop from North Carolina, the New Jersey couple explaining to some first-timers why they cruise: "You're forced to do nothin'."
My cruise was filled with couples of every age, race and gender configuration, some with kids, most without. A lot of couples seemed to be cruising with friends. A bunch of triple-generation families were traveling together, and there was one large Filipino family reunion of about 15 or 16: I know because they wore matching (decidedly uncool) teal T-shirts. Also on board was a group of veterans of Vietnam and other foreign wars, and it was touching to watch these older guys sitting beside comrades in arms, baseball caps naming their service branches and their wars.
Until I met another solo traveler while waiting to clear customs after the cruise, I thought I was the only person on the whole ship traveling alone. Turns out the other solo passenger is an accomplished Washington-based legislative aide and occasional guided history tour operator who gives "talks to drunk guys about John Adams." I asked if she was able to avoid work while onboard. No, she said, with a sigh. Calls still needed returning, emails needed responses. But she preferred to do it from a deck chair, alone.
Wallace was alone, too, which probably enhanced his despair. Cruising is an activity of togetherness. One goes to be with people. You can certainly spend plenty of time alone on a cruise liner, as I did, napping (daily) in my stateroom, or sitting by myself staring out the Rendezvous' windows toward the horizon in what I hoped was a sexy, forlorn way. But aloneness on a cruise ship is something one has to make efforts to achieve; it is not the natural state.
All week long, people leaned in to each other, touched each other and talked. Most of the conversations I overheard (that is, blatantly eavesdropped on) involved the food: a conversation about the exact viscosity of an egg yolk; an older woman with swollen legs and Velcro-strapped black sneakers emitting actual, full-throated moans of joy to her husband upon sampling her dinner, sound gurgling out of her like bubbles in a mud spring. "Uuaaggghhh! My God, it's delicious," she said. "This pork loin is delicious. Uuaaggghhh."
But sometimes the talk turned a bit more introspective. As I ate my morning cereal midway through the cruise, I listened to two women in their 60s seated together, huddled over their breakfast plates, reminiscing about past marriages:
"You didn't want kids?"
"I did. He didn't."
"But that was unfair to you."
She shrugged. "I wouldn't have gotten involved, but I was 35 ..."
Oatmeal with a side of O. Henry. There were a lot of conversations like that, the kinds of intimate talks that only happen when people are relaxed enough to let the words fall where they may. Whether the subject was pork loin or marriage, the topic at hand seemed less important than the state of togetherness.
Close quarters among guests and crew demand constant interaction, which results in one of the best qualities of a leisure cruise: civility. For a week, I never heard a single argument. I never even heard a raised voice. People treated each other well, and I can't count the number of times I heard guests asking crew members questions about their lives: their time at sea, their families, their adventures ashore. Everybody seemed to care.
The crew, for their part, was polite and attentive without ever crossing into obsequiousness. One server, a Jamaican guy named Donovan, roamed the Oceanview Cafe every morning during breakfast hours singing made-up songs about coffee. Sample lyrics: "Coffee is bubbling/ I'm coming/ I'm coming with your coffee-o/ So please hold up your cup-o." Uncool? Yes. Off-key and maybe inching a little too close to cultural stereotype? You bet. But also wonderful.
Those who object to cruises often do so for reasons that extend beyond their lack of street cred. The cruise industry gets knocked around for the long hours and often hectic conditions of the people in its employ. I can't speak to that other than to say I spent some time patrolling message boards for Celebrity employees. Reviews seem about as mixed as you would find at any high-stress place of employment. Honestly, I was expecting worse.
As for the cruise industry's woeful environmental record, I ignored that for the duration of my cruise because I am a monster, but for the record, Celebrity received an overall grade of D+ from the Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy organization, in 2016. Not good. The green-nosers at Disney got the highest grade, an A-.
All this onboard civility is probably not an accident. Perhaps it is even a low-key necessity. No matter how much you dress up a boat, it is still, in the end, a boat, and as we all know, boats are vulnerable vessels. At our mandatory pre-cruise evacuation drill, a chipper fire marshal reminds us that even a megaship is only one misplaced cigarette butt from disaster. As such, each of the five cruises I've been on over the years shared a pervasive spirit of cooperation. People are perhaps a little kinder to one another when they know their vacation could end in a cramped lifeboat fighting over pelican scraps.
That's not to say there aren't moments of conflict. On my cruise, I heard an unconfirmed tale of a woman caught in another guest's room in what I understood to be a case of unappreciated seduction. The woman was promptly remanded to the ship's onboard brig. Much speculation was given to how she managed to sneak into a room without a key card, known on Celebrity as a SeaPass. The theory was that she somehow entered from the outside balcony slider, which would have necessitated some kind of Spider-Woman-level scaling of the ship's exterior. Which, I'm sorry, is kind of awesome.
If I had one objection to life aboard the Summitit's the endless upselling. The weeklong cruise cost $1,915.50 (plus airfare to San Juan, Puerto Rico); at every turn, somebody was offering the opportunity to spend more. During each meal, for example, servers would swing by to ask if I wanted to purchase the "beverage package." When I declined, they would tip over my table's large, prominent drink menu, as if they were knocking over my king after a game of chess.
Also available for purchase: spa treatments, acupuncture, Raymond Weil watches with faces "celebrating the iconic Beatles," lots and lots of tanzanite jewelry, on-demand movies, dockside photos, studio photographic portraits, all manner of sundries, terrible "art gallery" art, specialty dining options and, oddly, Apple computers.
The worst deal on the ship, though, is the Wi-Fi package, which runs $259 for the week. What kind of sucker spends that kind of money to browse Twitter? Me, apparently. In my defense, in addition to tweeting, I also wanted to be able to FaceTime with my wife and kids, and, once purchased, the internet was surprisingly reliable and fast. The upside of this absurd cost is that most people refrained, keeping noses away from iPhones and, instead, buried in books. I will be a snob about this one thing: I like seeing people read.
Did I mention ports of call? I did not. The destinations along the way are not the point. At least, not for me. But if you must know, we stopped in St. Thomas, St. Maarten and Bermuda. I barely got off the boat. I don't like the beach and had no desire to Jet Ski or wander tourist stalls, but I did spend a mesmeric half-hour on my balcony in St. Maarten watching cranes stack and unstack shipping containers on the pier. Guilt compelled me to do some shopping in Bermuda for the aforementioned wife and kids, who were unable to cruise with me due to school or whatever it is they do when I am relaxing at sea.
Our vacation lives are often a frenetic extension of our work lives. So many of us have come to view our scant downtime as a call to action, an opportunity for challenge and growth instead of a moment of rest. A recent article in Travel + Leisure offered the 50 best options for people looking for "heart-stopping adventure, a close-up look at history, or the perfect meal." All three of those options stress me out. Between my son's SAT prep and my daughter's hectic field hockey schedule, I have enough adventure.
And I don't want the "perfect" meal. I want a cheeseburger. Simple, banal, uncool. Cheeseburgers are delicious. I think a lot of people just want a cheeseburger.
TOKYO-Japan on Wednesday kicked off a whaling campaign in the northwestern Pacific, in a move sure to anger animal rights activists and others calling for an end to the hunts.
Three ships are leaving port on a three-month mission to catch 43 minke whales and 134 sei whales, according to the government.
The new mission comes after Japan on Sunday started an annual coastal whaling hunt along its northern Pacific shores, aiming to catch 47 minke whales until mid-July.
Japan is a signatory to the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on whale hunting, but uses a loophole in the temporary ban allowing for lethal scientific research.
Tokyo claims it is trying to prove the whale population is large enough to sustain a return to commercial hunting for a traditional source of food.
Foreign pressure on Japan to stop whaling has hardened conservatives and politicians, making it a rare thorny issue for Japan's otherwise amiable diplomacy. Japanese consumer demand for whale meat has declined significantly over the years, however, throwing a question domestically over whether whaling missions still make economic sense.
In 2014, the United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Tokyo to end its hunt in the Antarctic waters, saying the project did not meet conventional scientific standards.
Japan cancelled its 2014-15 hunt, only to resume it the following year under a new programme, saying the fresh plan is genuinely scientific.
The Antarctic hunt has seen high seas clashes between Japanese whalers and animal activists.
PARIS (Reuters) - Swiss academic Tariq Ramadan, a professor of Islamic studies, was ordered to remain in custody in France on Friday and notified that he was the target of a full investigation into rape accusations, a source with the prosecutor's office said.
Ramadan, who denies the allegations, took temporary leave in November from his post at Britain's University of Oxford.
He vowed to sue for slander two women whose rape accusations prompted a preliminary judicial inquiry.
Friday's announcement turned that preliminary inquiry into a full, open-ended investigation where French magistrates stated goal is to establish whether Ramadan should stand trial.
In France, the launch of a full investigation implies that initial findings justify further pursuit in the view of the investigating magistrates but does not mean the matter is sure to go to trial.
Ramadan is a grandson of Hasan al-Banna, an Islamist thinker and activist who founded the Muslim Brotherhood. He enjoys a substantial following among young Muslims and has challenged French restrictions on wearing veils.
Police arrested him and took him into custody earlier this week in France.
LONDON-Hollywood actress and women's rights campaigner Emma Watson won the Woman of the Year at the ELLE Style Awards in London. Emma Watson was named Woman of the Year at the ELLE Style Awards in London.
The 26-year-old actress received the accolade in recognition of her on-screen talents as well as her campaigning for gender equality, which has included helping to launch the HeForShe solidarity initiative.
The ‘Harry Potter' star is among the most outspoken women in Hollywood on the issue of gender equality and in 2014, Emma was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador.
As part of her role, Emma has spoken at the United Nations headquarters in New York and the World Economic Forum about the issue of equality for women. The French-born British star has also visited various countries around the world to stress the need for women's political participation.
Meanwhile, other winners at the star-studded bash included Blondie singer Debbie Harry, who claimed the Style Icon award, and Riz Ahmed, who won the Actor of the Year gong after his starring role in the widely-acclaimed ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'.
Elsewhere, Sasha Lane - who made her film debut in ‘American Honey' last year - was named the Breakthrough Actress and French singer-songwriter Christine and the Queens walked away with the Album of the Year gong.
Other big-name guests in attendance at the fashion magazine's annual ceremony included Beth Ditto, Thandie Newton and Vivienne Westwood.
The Met Office has issued a warning of snow and ice covering the entire North East coast today and overnight.
The yellow warning covers the period from 3pm today until 11am tomorrow.
It says: "Ice is expected to form on some surfaces from mid-afternoon Monday, and overnight into Tuesday morning.
"Wintry showers may also bring some fresh snowfalls, mostly to higher ground.
"Accumulations of 2-5 cm area possible, again mostly above 100-150 m in places in eastern Scotland and eastern England. Some roads and railways are likely to be affected with some journey times taking longer.
"There will probably be icy stretches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths with some injuries from slips trips and falls."
Motorists nationwide are being warned of havoc on the roads today as snow turns into ice following a weekend wintry blast.
Hundreds of schools are due to be closed at the start of the working week following a cold night which saw temperatures drop as low as -11.6C (11F) in Chillingham Barns, Northumberland.
A chilly day is forecast - and yellow warning for ice is in place for most of Wales and central parts of England - while on Monday night temperatures could drop as low as -15C (5F).
Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill told the Press Association: "It was chilly in Chillingham Barnes, but it wasn't the coldest night of 2017 - that was Saturday night when temperatures went down to -12.4C.
"We could well beat that tonight and could go as low as -12C and even -15C."
The cold weather has brought disruption to flights, with dozens cancelled at Heathrow, and train services are also likely to be impacted into Monday.
Western Power Distribution said engineers worked through the night as they aimed to restore power to 10,000 home in the Midlands, South Wales and South West.
SSE said they restored power to 48,000 customers on Sunday and that 2,900 remained without power as of 11pm last night.
As a result of the snow and freezing conditions, Birmingham City Council has been forced to cancel all council-run school and related transport services on Monday, the authority said.
More than 200 schools will be closed in Gloucestershire, and more than 100 in Shropshire.
In Wales, 71 schools are closed in Flintshire, 11 in Wrexham and 49 in Denbighshire.
Pete Williams, the RAC's road safety spokesman, said they were expecting 11,000 breakdowns today , 20% above the seasonal norm.
"I think the big thing is people are not going to leave enough time," he said.
"Journeys will take two to three times longer.
"It's going to be treacherous driving conditions."
He said low overnight temperatures could cause black ice and urged people to drive slowly, leaving plenty of space between them and the car in front.
More than a foot of snow fell in Sennybridge in Wales which saw 32cm (12.5 inches) on Sunday.
OSHAWA, Ont. – Police say a suspect who was allegedly driving a stolen vehicle was arrested after fleeing on foot and jumping out of a second storey window in an attempt to avoid capture.
Durham regional police say officers spotted the stolen vehicle late morning and followed it to a parking lot in Oshawa, Ont., where they attempted to arrest the driver.
It's alleged the suspect resisted arrest by punching and kicking the officers, and even a bit one of them.
They say after officers unsuccessfully tried to Taser the suspect, he fled into an apartment building and police pursued him into one of the units.
Investigators say the suspect then jumped out of a second storey window and was taken into custody, uninjured, by officers waiting on the ground.
A 30-year-old Oshawa man is charged with possession of stolen property over $5,000, assault with intent to resist arrest and possession of cocaine and fentanyl.
Just months before shops can begin selling marijuana for recreational use, Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday vetoed a measure that aims to prevent marketing pot edibles to minors, saying it conflicts with a similar law previously approved by the state.
The bill by Assemblyman Rudy Salas (D-Bakersfield) would have banned the sale of marijuana edibles shaped like animals, fruit, people and other shapes that appeal to children.
The Legislature last month approved a law more generally prohibiting the marketing of marijuana to minors. That law said marijuana sold cannot be “designed to be appealing to children or easily confused with commercially sold candy or foods that do not contain cannabis.”
Brown's veto message was short.
“As currently drafted, this bill would chapter out specific provisions in the recently enacted trailer bill,” Brown wrote in his veto message. “Therefore I cannot sign it at this time.”
BUENOS AIRES, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Toronto-based Yamana Gold said on Friday that an accident at its Gualcamayo mine in Argentina resulted in two fatalities.
The accident involved two employees of a local contractor traveling in a light truck on an access road at the Las Vacas exploration site, the company said, adding that no additional details were available. (Reporting by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
LONDON - Global stock markets clawed back losses Monday as spiralling tensions over North Korea showed tentative signs of easing, in turn reducing appetite for haven assets.
Fears of a catastrophic confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang were calmed when CIA director Mike Pompeo said Sunday there was "nothing imminent" in the escalating stand-off.
London's benchmark FTSE 100 index climbed 0.6 percent, while in the eurozone Paris and Frankfurt rose one percent or more.
"European equity markets appear to have left the fears of late last week behind, with investors coming out of their defensive positions to move back into riskier assets," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at traders IG.
In New York, the Dow index was up 0.6 shortly after the opening bell.
Earlier in Asia, Hong Kong was back in positive territory Monday after slumping two percent Friday, while Shanghai ended the day higher despite data showing Chinese industrial production slowed sharply in July as government efforts to rein in debt weighed on demand.
However, Tokyo closed one percent down as traders returned from a three-day holiday weekend to play catch-up after Asian and European shares had dropped Friday, with the Nikkei finishing at its lowest level in more than three months.
Investors largely shrugged off official data showing Japan's economy grew by a faster-than-expected one percent in the three months to June, as the accelerating world number three economy marked its longest economic expansion in more than a decade.
- 'Not out of the woods' -
"What we are seeing today is relief at the (geopolitical) situation not deteriorating over the weekend, something traders were clearly wary of towards the end of last week," said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.
As stock markets started recovering, the dollar rose against the Japanese currency and the euro, while gold halted its advance after jumping 2.4 percent last week.
"We're seeing a small unwinding of ... risk aversion trades, with gold trading slightly lower and the yen and Swiss franc off against the dollar, pound and euro," Erlam added.
Last week's losses worldwide were triggered by President Donald Trump threatening to unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea, and Pyongyang countered by announcing plans to test-launch missiles toward Guam.
"There is a still a 'buy the dips' mentality running through financial markets," said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG Markets.
However, analysts cautioned that with joint South Korean-US military exercises scheduled and North Korea celebrating "Liberation Day" Tuesday, volatility could return to markets.
"We are not out of the woods yet and the situation in North Korea will remain front and centre," said Weston.
CLEVELAND (AP) — The suspect in the random killing of a retiree posted on Facebook made his living mentoring teens in Cleveland, but his life appeared to be unraveling under the weight of gambling debts and trouble with his girlfriend.
Rambling videos he shared showed his despair, saying he was out of options and wanted to kill as many innocent people as he could.
While authorities have not found any evidence that he killed anyone else, the manhunt for Steve Stephens stretched into a third day on Tuesday and far beyond the neighborhood where police said he shot a 74-year-old man who was picking up aluminum cans on Sunday after spending Easter with some of his children.
Stephens, 37, could be anywhere, authorities said, calling it a nationwide search. A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his capture and prosecution.

Stephens posted a video of himself killing Robert Godwin Sr., a former foundry worker who had 10 children, police said. In it, he said, “I snapped, I just snapped.” But police would not speculate on what was behind it.
“Only Steve knows that,” Williams said.
In the video, Stephens told Godwin a woman's name and said, “She's the reason that this is about to happen to you.” Godwin did not seem to recognize the name.
The woman Stephens spoke of, Joy Lane, said in a text message to CBS that “we had been in a relationship for several years. I am sorry that all of this has happened.”
She also said Stephens was “a nice guy” who was good to her and her children.
Stephens filed for bankruptcy two years ago despite holding down a job as a counselor helping young people develop job skills and find employment. The behavioral health agency where he worked said an extensive background check before he was hired turned up nothing worrisome.
In one video posted on Facebook, Stephens said that he gambled away everything and that he and his girlfriend had planned to marry but did not, without saying why. He blamed her for what was about to happen.
Some friends said they knew about his gambling. But the videos showed a man they did not recognize.
Alexis Lee, who saw Stephens last week, said his childhood friend always seemed respectful and got along with everybody.
“He never ever told me he had problems or issues. It was always good things,” Lee said. “He was always just so happy and cool, calm, collected, like, that's why it's so shocking.”
Other neighbors said he was quiet as a kid and intelligent, recalling how he went to college and got a master's degree.
“He was just a no problem person at all, compared to a lot of people,” said Cynthia Coley, a former neighbor.
In one video in which he blamed his girlfriend, Stephens said he woke up last week and “couldn't take it anymore.”
Investigators said that Godwin was the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite his claim on Facebook that he killed over a dozen people.
On Monday evening, Facebook announced that it was launching a review for reporting harmful content following the killing. The company said that Stephens posted a video of himself announcing his intent to commit murder, then two minutes later posted another video of himself shooting and killing Godwin. A few minutes after that, he went live and confessed.
The company said it disabled Stephen's account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the video of the fatal shooting and two hours after receiving any report.
“In this case we did not receive a report about the first video, and we only received a report about the second video — containing the shooting — more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted,” said Justin Osofsky, Facebook's vice president of global operations. “We received reports about the third video, containing the man's live confession, only after it had ended.”
Officers searched dozens of places around Cleveland without finding Stephens or any other victims before expanding the manhunt. Detectives spoke with the suspect on Sunday by cellphone and tried to persuade him to surrender, police said.
Law enforcement officials said his cellphone was last tracked Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Cleveland. Police in Philadelphia said eight elementary schools and a high school were locked down Monday while they investigated reported sightings but found nothing.

The latest “Star Wars” movie from Disney and Lucasfilm hit theaters this past weekend, with “Solo” giving a glimpse of the adventures of a young Han Solo.
After Disney acquired Lucasfilm in a mammoth $4 billion deal, it has made every effort to cash in on that investment, starting with the beginning of a new trilogy in 2015's “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” The movie, directed by J.J. Abrams, was a box office behemoth, grossing $2 billion worldwide and introducing Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the new stars of the franchise.
The studio followed that up with “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” the first of its planned standalone films. The movie was also a commercial and critical success, and starred Felicity Jones in a Rebel plot to steal the Death Star plans. The next movie in the main new trilogy, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” came a year later, with director Rian Johnson bringing back Mark Hamill to show what's become of Luke Skywalker and progressing the story of Ridley's Rey.
“Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the first of the movies to disappoint financially in its opening weekend, grossing a lackluster $103 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend. It stars Alden Ehrenreich as a young Solo, as well as Donald Glover, Emilia Clarke, and Woody Harrelson.
Which one of the “new” “Star Wars” movies is your favorite? Weigh in below!
Every nation state is founded on certain myths.
These myths serve the purpose of foundations of a national narrative that it provides to its people.
At the same time, these national myths serve the purpose of creating enemies where there are none, distracting the national effort from the real problem at hand.
In postcolonial states, a phenomenon emerged to cover up the failures of the ruling elites by labelling these failures a “conspiracy” by another country or a group of countries.
On Sunday, Mushahidullah Khan, the current Minister for Climate Change, stated that foreign forces see the former Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif as a source of prosperity in the country and that is why they never want him in power.
He further said that the reason foreign powers did not like Pakistan was that it was an Islamic country with nuclear weapons and because of its partnership with China.
Where can one start to even try to unravel everything that is wrong with this viewpoint? Does he, or his party, really believe that the Panama Papers were a foreign conspiracy to disable the former PM when many many other international politicians were named? Is he really implying that our judiciary is not independent, and of sound reasoning, that they would give the wrong verdict? Is any Pakistani who does not support this party, and is with the opposition like the PTI and PPP a foreign conspirator? And what is the proof of such claims of megalomaniacal puppet masters?
The blame is very much grounded at home, from weak monitoring of corrupt practices, to weaker laws and judicial oversight.
The ruling elite of the country lacks the moral courage and strength to accept their own failures.
One cannot disagree with Mr Mushahidullah when he argues that the whole system of Pakistan stems from the Parliament.
But this does not mean that opposition parties or public will not ask those occupying the treasury benches about their performance.
If the ruling parties achieve half of what they promise, it can be easily assured to them that no “foreign power” will ever dare oust them.

Police officials in Bermuda confirmed that they have found the body of missing United States student Mark Dombroski.
Acting Assistant Commissioner James Howard of the Bermuda Police Services declined to provide certain details, include how authorities believe Dombroski may have died during a visit to the British Island territory.
The discovery of his body was announced at a news conference after a day of searching that involved members of the 19-year-old's family, volunteers and local authorities.
Dombroski, a member of the rugby team at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, disappeared early Sunday after a night of socializing.
Police had appealed for the public's help Monday, and fellow rugby players joined the search.
A marine unit scoured the harbor, police reviewed surveillance footage and Dombroski's family and other searchers tried retracing his steps but found no immediate sign of the slender 6-footer, a Saint Joseph's freshman from the Philadelphia suburb of Media.
Dombroski had been relaxing at The Dog House, a bar and restaurant in the capital of Hamilton, when he left by himself after midnight early Sunday, police officials said. He was last seen at 1:15 a.m., when government surveillance cameras recorded him walking east, a little more than a half-mile from the bar. He was reported missing more than eight hours later.
Detective Sgt. Jason Smith said there's no evidence Dombroski was drunk, or that alcohol played a role in his disappearance.
Earlier Monday, Lisa Dombroski speculated that her son, who had hurt his shoulder in a game that day and wasn't feeling well, had simply wanted to call it a night. She said the surveillance footage showed him favoring his arm.
"He wasn't in a celebratory kind of mood," Lisa Dombroski said. "He wanted to get back."
Dombroski was last seen walking in the opposite direction of the Royal Bermuda Regiment camp, which provided lodging for the Ariel Re Bermuda rugby tournament on the British Island territory. The team from Saint Joseph's was among more than 20 taking part.
Following the lingering Boko Haram Menace, Nigeria is expected to spend a total of close to $9.5 billion on its defense over 2018-2022, and the country's military expenditure is expected to increase at a CAGR of close to 9 percent to reach over $2 billion by 2022, the report added.
According to the ‘Future of the Nigeria Defense Industry-Market Attractiveness, Competitive Landscape and Forecasts to 2022' report, the Nigerian defense budget, valued at around $1.5 billion in 2017, registered a negative CAGR of over 10 percent during the historic period
Nigeria has a long history of internal conflicts negatively affecting its economic growth and stability. The recent emergence of radical Islamic group Boko Haram intensified the rebellion in northeast Nigeria and led to a state of emergency announcement by the President regarding the affected states.
The report said the country's capital expenditure's share of the total defense budget increased from over 16 in 2013 to about 30 percent in 2017, and is expected to increase to an average of about 26 percent over the forecast period.
Allocations towards the army are expected to marginally decrease from an average of about 36 percent over the historic period to over 35 percent over the forecast period.
Similarly, allocations towards the navy are expected to decrease from just over 20 percent during the historic period to about 20 percent over the forecast period.
Allocations towards the Nigerian Air Force are expected to decrease from over 21 percent during the historic period to about 21 percent over the forecast period.
The report further stated that Nigerian homeland security expenditure increased from almost $1 billion in 2013 to about $1.5 billion in 2017, registering a CAGR of over 11 percent during the historic period.
Threats from Boko Haram and increased drug trafficking are expected to drive the country's focus on defense spending, the report noted.
In order to counter these threats, the country is expected to invest in surveillance and intelligence technologies such as electronic identification documents, e-passports, automated border crossing systems, bio-metric identification, and CCTV (closed circuit television) systems, which are expected to be covered under defense spending.
As a result, the Nigerian homeland security budget is expected to increase at a CAGR of almost 14 percent over the forecast period, from around $1.7 billion in 2018 to close to $3 Billion by 2022.
Traditionally, the country has been an importer of weapon systems as domestic military production is small-scale and technologically inferior, Business Post reports.
Bruce MacCallum, a camera operator on films including “Silence of the Lambs” and a longtime union activist, died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 70.
MacCallum started out in entertainment as an assistant to Dustin Hoffman, then moved into the camera department and worked on films including “Raging Bull,” “Married to the Mob,””All that Jazz,” “Witness,” and “Heartburn” as assistant cameraman.
He went on to become camera operator on “School of Rock,” “The Departed,” “I Am Legend” and “The Adjustment Bureau.”
More recently he worked on TV shows including “The Night Of” and “The Blacklist” as well as the recent feature “The Book of Henry.”
MacCullum helped train and mentor many fellow members of the International Cinematographers Guild (ICG, IATSE Local 600), where he served as National Assistant Secretary-Treasurer between 2007 and 2016.
He is survived by Linda, his wife of 32 years.

A freak accident in Terrace, B.C. has claimed the life of a 13-year-old girl.
Grace Peerless was alone at her backyard fire pit when her hair and clothes caught fire.
Father Dennis Peerless said his youngest daughter couldn't have fallen into the fire pit since it was raised two feet off the ground.
“It's not a typical fire pit that you could even fall into,” he said.
No one really knows what happened at this point, but Dennis believes it could have been an ember landing on her head with hairspray acting as an accelerant.
After arriving at Mill Memorial Hospital, Grace was transferred to BC Children's Hospital where doctors said she had suffered second- and third-degree burns to 25 to 30 per cent of her body.

Her father says her injuries were serious but everyone, including her doctors, expected her to recover.
She passed away early Saturday.
“For some reason, she went into cardiac arrest,” Dennis said.
A funeral service for Grace Peerless will be held on June 5 in Terrace. A GoFundMe page has been set up in her name.
“She was a sweet, beautiful kid,” Dennis said.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette's sore foot will keep him out of Thursday's preseason game against Tampa Bay.
Wide receiver Marqise Lee, who suffered an ankle injury on Sunday, also will not play against the Bucs, coach Doug Marrone said.
Fournette missed practice on Sunday and Monday and Marrone said the fourth overall pick will be evaluated later in the week to see if he can return to practice on the weekend.

"We're just being smart on it," Marrone said. "Obviously we're going to be smart with him and Marqise, so we'll probably hold those guys out for at least until after the game."
Fournette, who attended Monday's joint practice with Tampa Bay in a sweatshirt, rushed for 31 yards and a touchdown on nine carries in the Jaguars' preseason opener against New England last week.
Marrone said Sunday the team had been monitoring Fournette's foot injury but it had not been an issue that would keep him out of practice. But when Fournette complained of soreness after Saturday's practice, the team decided to hold him out of Sunday's practice.

At the quarter mark of the 2017 NFL season, Gregg Rosenthal identifies the shakiest offseason additions.
Jay Cutler, QB, Miami Dolphins
I believed that Cutler could make the young offense around him more entertaining, but the conservative attack and Cutler's seemingly diminished physical skills have resulted in nearly being shut out in back-to-back weeks by the Jets and Saints. It's still too early to give up on this experiment, but coach Adam Gase will need to see progress soon or consider rolling with Matt Moore.
Stephon Gilmore (CB) and Dwayne Allen (TE), New England Patriots
Pinning all of New England's secondary woes on Gilmore is overly simplistic, but Pro Football Focus' No. 95-ranked cornerback (out of 106) through Thursday has clearly struggled to pick up Bill Belichick's scheme. Gilmore's been involved with numerous communication breakdowns that have led to big plays, and he has been called for four penalties, two of which kept Panthers scoring drives alive in last week's home loss to Carolina. The play of the secondary improved in the win at Tampa on Thursday night, but Gilmore's contract indicates the Patriots expect him to be a star.
Allen, acquired in an offseason deal with the Colts, barely cost any trade compensation. But he's the eighth-highest-paid player on the team and has contributed little beyond a few key drops and a lack of timing with Tom Brady. Allen's snap count was down to single digits in Week 4 and he didn't have a catch in Week 5 despite Rob Gronkowski missing the game.
Kenny Britt, WR, Cleveland Browns
Anyone who has followed Britt's roller-coaster career closely can't be too shocked that he's followed up his best NFL season with one making headlines for the wrong reasons. Britt's effort and focus have been questioned with plenty of drops and little efficiency. Other free-agent pickups at wideout are off to slow starts, but Britt's eight catches on 23 targets is in a different class, with two of his drops leading to interceptions and early-season boo birds. Coach Hue Jackson indicated he might be forced to give Britt a "breather," although the Browns don't have healthy or logical replacements to step in.
Eddie Lacy, RB, Seattle Seahawks
Lacy was worth a flier in free agency, just not for $3 million guaranteed at a depressed position. Having received just 16 carries thus far after getting passed on the depth chart by (now-injured) rookie Chris Carson, Lacy could wind up getting passed again by the return of Thomas Rawls.
Adrian Peterson, RB, New Orleans Saints
There were some great debates this offseason over whether Peterson or Mark Ingram would lead the way in the Saints' backfield. The question has been answered by coach Sean Payton. Ingram has played 137 snaps and rookie Alvin Kamara has earned 93, while Peterson has only been on the field 44 times. The future Hall of Famer has just 85 yards from scrimmage on 29 touches, a number that is perhaps so low because his usage is so predictable. Payton can't quite figure out what to do with Peterson, so the team might use him even less moving forward.
Mike Glennon, QB, Chicago Bears
Free agency comes before the draft, which is how someone like Mike Glennon could get $18.5 million in guarantees on a contract just weeks before the Bears drafted Mitchell Trubisky second overall. (The rival Vikings found a fine backup, Case Keenum, for just $2 million.) That sequence of events in Chicago created an impossible situation from the outset, exacerbated by the team's lack of receivers and Glennon's lack of mobility. The last thing this roster can use is a dropback quarterback ready to launch it down the field. The Bears need a mobile quarterback who can accentuate the team's strong running game -- and that player is Trubisky.
Menelik Watson (Denver Broncos), Greg Robinson (Detroit Lions) and Matt Kalil (Carolina Panthers), OT
All three tackles, for varying degrees of investment and varying degrees of desperation.
Kalil cost the most, but he's struggled in Carolina just like he did last season in Minnesota. Robinson, the former No. 2 overall pick, was acquired by Detroit for a sixth-round pick as a short-term solution to the team's left tackle problem. He's currently ranked No. 67 out of 68 qualifiers on Pro Football Focus, one spot ahead of Watson. Overall, Broncos executive John Elway directed a strong offseason overhaul, but bringing Watson over from Oakland seemed like a curious move at the time -- and it looks far worse now. The turnstile tackle has given up six sacks and three more quarterback hits in just four games.

When it came to convincing people to loan him money, Sgt. Robert Mugridge would shed tears, cite problems with addicted relatives, and sometimes asked while in uniform having arrived in his police cruiser.
These were among the details of an agreed statement of facts that were read out during a Police Services Act hearing in Chatham on Tuesday at the John D. Bradley Convention Centre concerning the officer's actions.
Mugridge, who pleaded guilty to 50 counts of discreditable conduct dating back to 2010. He will be losing his job for his actions.
The officer sat quietly as details of the numerous excuses he used to get people to loan him money were revealed. These people included neighbours, businessowners, relatives, co-workers, people from his church and people he met through activities his children participated in.
There was often a veil of secrecy around the loans with a common request that the person giving him the money not tell his wife.
An overview of some details will be provided without naming the victims.
Mugridge borrowed anywhere from $10,000 to $500, but often it was at least over $1,000 he would get out of people. A small number of people received some repayment, but many people were not paid back a cent, despite him agreeing, on many occasions, to pay the money back with interest.
According to the statement of facts, there were times Mugridge would be shedding tears – sometimes while in uniform having arrived in his cruiser – and be quite emotional as he asked people for money.
An excuse given a number of times why he needed funds was that he had siblings with drug and alcohol addictions, which he was paying for, so he was short of money.
On one occasion, Mugridge told someone he needed $2,000 to send a sibling to rehab. He told another person his addicted siblings took money from his mother.
Another popular excuse why he needed money was to pay for a child's post-secondary tuition, because he had to previously use the money for another purpose.
On one occasion he asked someone for $2,535 to pay for university tuition. The person made the cheque out to the university, but Mugridge called later claiming the university wouldn't accept it and he needed the cheque made out to him. It was stated, the person refused this request, but the cheque was later cashed by the university.
However, it was noted that numerous times the loans requested for tuition were never used for that purpose.
Mugridge also often stated he needed money because he had to pay back another loan that someone was demanding repayment for.
On at least one occasion, someone who loaned him money found out shortly after he took his family on vacation.
Some people questioned why a police officer needed a loan, but Mugridge would have excuses such as a customer stiffed him on a job that he did through a fence and decking business he ran on the side.
However, the officer gave some people assurances they would be repaid their money when he got either retroactive pay or a raise on an upcoming police contract.
It was noted the officer has declared bankruptcy, but no details were given about why he asked so many people for money.
After the statement of facts were read, the hearing officer, retired OPP Supt. Morris Elbers, gave Mugridge the opportunity to make a statement.
“No thank you, sir,” Mugridge replied.

PANAJI: Around 77 liquor licences remain suspended for election-related offences, according to the state's excise department.
The suspension order was issued during pre-assembly election period and continues to remain in force until the inquiry is over, said assistant commissioner of excise Satyavan Bhivshet on Tuesday.
Bhivshet said that flying squad teams of the excise department had booked over 125 cases of violation of model code of conduct between January 4 and February 4, 2017, of which 77 cases are pending inquiry. The offending parties were issued show-cause notices and until the hearing of the notices is over, the suspension order will not be lifted, said Bhivshet.
Licences were suspended due to various offences related to violation of the model code of conduct, including serving of alcohol beyond 11 pm, keeping premises open etc. The department officials had also seized liquor for which there were no invoices and liquor coming in from outside the state. The seized liquor continues to remain with the excise department, said Bhivshet.
Freebies and liquor to tempt voters is a regular feature during election time. However, monitoring during this assembly election was strict, with the excise department constituting 11 flying squads that worked 24×7 in all the talukas. Further, there was also tightened checking at the check-posts. About 12 control rooms were also set up to take in complaints from citizens.
A daily register was maintained to track production by distillers, sale at dealers or shops and stock of unsold liquor at the end of the day. Although no political parties have been detected distributing liquor, the department is yet to ascertain the reason for flouting of the model code of conduct.
Show-cause notices seek adequate reasons from the offenders for committing the wrongdoing and if the explanation is not satisfactory, it could result in cancellation of licence.
The search continues for a pickup truck involved in a hit-and-run in Edmonton on Thursday night. Some area residents say the area it happened in is known to be dangerous for pedestrians. Vinesh Pratap reports.
PITTSBURGH >> The weather keeps wreaking havoc on the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Detroit Tigers.
Steady rain at PNC Park on Tuesday forced the clubs to postpone a game for the third time in the first month of the season.
The game was the 28th postponement in the majors this season, the most related to weather through April since the commissioners office started keeping those records in 1986. Baltimore and Tampa Bay were also rained out on Tuesday.
Detroit and Pittsburgh will make up the game with a straight doubleheader on Wednesday starting at 4:05 p.m.

This is the second time the teams will play a doubleheader this season and the third time theyve had to reschedule due to weather. Wintry conditions pushed back opening day at Comerica Park on March 29 and their game on March 31 was also postponed. Pittsburgh swept a doubleheader from the Tigers on April 1. Detroit also had two games against the New York Yankees wiped out earlier this month.
Pittsburgh will send out Jameson Taillon (2-1, 2.86) in Game 1 against Detroits Jordan Zimmermann (1-0, 7.71). Chad Kuhl (2-1, 4.57), who had been scheduled to start on Tuesday and was originally slated to take the hill for the opener of the doubleheader, will face Matthew Boyd (0-1, 1.40) in the nightcap.
The Pirates have dropped six of seven following a hot start, while the Tigers have won five of seven.
Pittsburghs offense has cooled off during its current slide and manager Clint Hurdle believes his teams struggles are part of a somewhat larger trend, one the weather is impacting. There could be more strikeouts than hits across the majors in a month for the first time, and Hurdle pointed to frigid temperatures as an issue.
This has been the most challenging weather Ive ever been a part of, and Im not playing, said Hurdle, who spent a decade in the majors as a player from 1977-87 before going into coaching. Its hard to hit when its cold.
Pittsburgh had more strikeouts than hits in each game while dropping a four-game set with Philadelphia last week. Hurdle pointed to his own experiences as a player as proof that when conditions arent ideal, hitting can become painful.
Sometimes, you can only have one bad at-bat, the first at-bat of a game, in this kind of weather, (and) that can re-arrange your mental furniture, he said. I know if I hit a ball right off the end of the bat, that first at-bat, I knew I didnt want to do it again. Some of my aggressiveness might have leaked out of me.
The Dodgers beat the Oakland Athletics 3-1 on Monday giving them a 12-13 record in Cactus League play.
AT THE PLATE: First baseman Cody Bellinger hit his third home run of the spring, and outfielders Joc Pederson and Trayce Thompson hit their first. Logan Forsythe had two hits, boosting his Cactus League batting average to .357.
Dodgers' Justin Turner suffers broken wrist after getting hit by pitch
ON THE MOUND: Alex Wood pitched five scoreless innings, lowering his Cactus League earned-run average to 2.92. Wood has struck out 16 in 121/3 innings this spring. … Closer Kenley Jansen pitched another perfect inning. His spring: nine up, nine down. … Right-hander JT Chargois pitched a perfect inning, striking out the side. Chargois, claimed on waivers from Minnesota last month, has charged into contention for a bullpen spot by giving up two hits in his seven innings.
EXTRA BASES: Although Austin Barnes supplanted Yasmani Grandal as the Dodgers' starting catcher last October, Grandal will reclaim his role this season. “Yasmani is going to get most of the at-bats,” manager Dave Roberts said. Grandal is batting .314 this spring, Barnes . 111. … Ross Stripling pitched four innings in a minor league exhibition game. Stripling is expected to break camp as a long reliever, but he appears to be the first option to replace an injured or ineffective starter. … The Dodgers sent pitchers Adam Liberatore and Dylan Baker and infielders Jake Peter and Donovan Solano to minor league camp.

Craig Harrison must today bang in an appeal against Nicky Deverdics' sending off at Dover Athletic.
Hartlepool United cannot afford to lose their left-back for three matches while Deverdics requires justice after an unjust stain on a flawless disciplinary record.
Referee Richard Hulme dismissed the 30-year-old for what he ruled as an elbow on defender Connor Essam just over a minute from time of the 4-0 thumping at the Crabble Athletic Ground.
The two former Dover team-mates collided around 30 yards from the Athletic goal in a challenge for the ball.
Deverdics has inadvertently ‘clothes-lined' his old friend when putting out his arm, but footage shows it is not an elbow.
The Geordie, who has never been sent off in his career, debated the decision with Mr Hulme who he will now hope will review the incident.
Boss Harrison said: “In real time in no way was it a sending off.
“I think it has been misinterpreted, mis-read by the referee I really do.
“I understand it happens that quickly and referees and their assistants have a tough job to do.
“I thought it was going to be a free-kick to us.
“It looked like Devs had got his body between the man and the ball and their lad has come through him.
“That was my assessment of it.
“At no point did I think a): it was going to be anything but a free-kick to us and b). there was going to be a red card coming out of it.”
It was untidy on the part of the player, but it looked a free-kick and yellow card, at worst.
Pools can ill afford to lose Deverdics for three matches given he is one of the players who are actually performing at his potential at the moment.
As things stand, he would miss Saturday's FA Trophy trip to Workington and the National League matches against Maidenhead (H) and Gateshead (A).
“Devs been one of our better players, without a shadow of a doubt,” said Harrison.
“We need as many senior players and consistent players as we can in our squad.
“He'll be a huge miss if he's out for three games.”

Washington — The federal government will have to find ways to regulate self-driving cars that don't stifle innovation among auto manufacturers and technology companies, lawmakers and industry groups agreed during a hearing that took place hours after a shooting rocked Capitol Hill on Wednesday.
Proceeding with business as usual after a brief acknowledgment of the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., during practice for an annual Congressional baseball game, members of the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee described the delicate tightrope walk that regulators face with self-driving autos.
“Current federal motor vehicle safety standards do not address automated technologies, and in some cases directly conflict with them,” said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who is chairman of the panel. “We are looking for ways to address these conflicts in dated rules without weakening the important vehicle safety protections they provide.”
Thune quickly added: “We also must be careful to avoid picking winners and losers in this space... It is important for Congress not to favor one path before the market figures out what really works best.”
Thune, along with Michigan U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., all members of the Senate Commerce Committee, released on Tuesday “bipartisan principles” to guide legislation on self-driving cars.
Thune, who said he rode in an Audi A7 that had self-driving features last week, said the advent of autonomous cars will require drastic changes for both automakers and regulators.
“Government needs to challenge itself to overcome the traditional 20th-century conception – and regulation – of a car and a human driver,” he said. “AVs (autonomous vehicles) will – over time – bring changes to jobs, insurance, law enforcement, infrastructure and many other things we cannot yet foresee. Similar to when the car was first invented, these challenges are not insurmountable.”
Democrats on the panel agreed, talking up the potential safety and economic benefits of self-driving cars.
“This technology is without question one of the most transformative technologies to come out of the auto industry probably since the first car came off of the assembly line,” Peters said. “Certainly we know what happened when that first automobile came off of the assembly line, it literally transformed America. It created the American middle class.”
Peters touted Michigan's role in the development of self-driving cars, arguing that the state is “leading the way” in innovation in the arena of autonomous vehicles.
Auto industry groups pushed lawmakers to act fast in creating regulations for self-driving cars, arguing that they are closer to appearing on U.S. roads than many people think.
“The key question this committee must ask is how to use public policy to optimize the safe deployment of these vehicles and their promise of social good, while continuing to let innovation spur economic growth,” said Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which lobbies for automakers in Washington.
Bainwol said driver-assist systems that have become popular in recent years like adaptive cruise control and active lane keep have “accelerated significantly” the move toward autonomy in the automotive sector.
“The more consumers experience driver-assist systems, the more they are favorable toward full automation,” Bainwol said.
Colleen Sheehey-Church, national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said self-driving cars hold the promise to reduce the number of car crashes that involve inebriated drivers, noting that her 18-year-old son was killed in a 2004 crash that involved a driver who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs.
“Technology will ultimately be the way we eliminate drunk driving,” she said. “Autonomous vehicles are vital in helping us achieve our goal.”
Other safety groups complained that they did not have a seat at the table in Wednesday's hearing, however, noting that MADD's agenda is narrowly focused on eliminating drunk driving.
“A spokesman for MADD has the laudable, but narrow, agenda of combating drunk driving,” Santa Monica, Calif.-based Consumer Watchdog wrote in a letter to leaders of the Senate panel. “This is an industry-dominated panel with no representatives of auto safety or consumer protection organizations.”

Roughly three months after the Supreme Court ban on highway liquor came into force, Goa's revenue from liquor remains intact.
In fact, it increased 10 per cent in the first two months of this year, sources in the excise department said.
A senior official on Wednesday said that excise revenue has not come down in the least, as there has been aggregate collection of Rs 48.3 crore in April and May 2017.
The comparative excise revenue collected during April-May 2016 was Rs 43.9 crore. The official said that revenue collection of the department is almost back to normal.
“The consumption of liquor has been unaffected as buyers are purchasing from interior shops,” he said.
The senior official added that most of the department's revenue in May came from excise duty which shows that sales of liquor are on track.
For 2017-18, the excise department has set a target of Rs 386 crore, and expects to achieve it.
According to the government, the SC liquor order was not expected to adversely affect state revenue from excise in anyway. However, it is affecting livelihood of the people dependant on the liquor trade. Chief Secretary Dharmendra Sharma said that unlike the states like Punjab and Haryana, which earn exceptionally through liquor by auctioning licences, “Goa's earnings through liquor has been normal”. The Chief Secretary added that the government would follow up with the decision to appeal to the SC against the ban.
About 2,000 liquor outlets, including shops, bars and restaurants are closed in the state after the highway liquor order was implemented from April 1 2017.
Earlier, the excise department had estimated that 3,127 outlets would be adversely affected by the SC order. But a relaxation in the distance from 500 metre to 200 metre for towns with population less than 20,000 saved about 1000 outlets from closure.
In December 2016, the SC ordered shutdown of all liquor shops within 500-metre distance of national and state highways to prevent road accidents caused by drunken driving.
Excise officials said the ban has not pushed down liquor sales, as such the order would not affect revenues in the coming months. However, Goa Bar and Restaurant Owners Association president Michael Carrascao said that traditional bars along highways have taken a big hit due to shutdown of business. He said that bar and restaurant owners would shortly appeal to Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar to take up their case.

Britain's topsy-turvy weather could lead to a broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower shortage, experts have warned.
While it's great news for greens-hating children, farmers say supermarket shelves could be stripped bare for weeks following a poor harvest.
Home grown courgettes are also affected with planting set back by a month following heavy rain and snow.
Greville Richards boss of Southern England Farms which has 7,500 acres devoted to vegetables in Leedstown, Cornwall said: “We have had months of heavy rain with very few dry days. The ground has not had a chance to recover.

“Cauliflowers went in late and the spring greens were disastrous.”
The business responsible for almost half the country's supply of green vegetables warned of a three week shortage of broccoli this summer.
Mr Richards said: “Spanish growers can't fill the gaps because when it gets to June and July it is too hot there.”
The problems were being felt in the other broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower growing areas with Lincolnshire suffering and Scotland particularly badly hit.

Months of wet and cold weather are also having an impact on the dairy sector with farmers facing extra costs for straw bedding to keep animals inside for longer than usual.
Increased demand and a shortage of straw has led to the price more than doubling from £70 a tonne to £150.
Dairy farmer Richard Pennington of Treore Farm, near Port Isaac, North Cornwall said: “We had to get cattle in earlier than usual and they have stayed in longer.”
He added home produced winter feed had also run out so farmers were having to fork out for expensive imported cereal with costs rising because of a weak pound.
Earlier this month Jersey Royal potato farmers reported being up to a month behind with their planting after the Beast from the East set the harvest back by three weeks.
Edinburg, Texas — Police in Texas acting on a tip found 17 immigrants locked inside a tractor-trailer parked at a gas station about 20 miles from the border with Mexico, less than a month after 10 people died in the back of a hot truck with little ventilation in San Antonio.
Edinburg Assistant Police Chief Oscar Trevino tells KGBT-TV that the immigrants from Mexico, Honduras and other countries may have been locked inside the 18-wheeler in Edinburg for at least eight hours before being freed by officers late Sunday morning.
None of the people inside the tractor-trailer required medical attention. A man and woman who Trevino said are Cuban nationals were in charge of the rig and have been detained.
The discovery comes three weeks after 10 people died in a sweltering rig parked at a Walmart in San Antonio. Immigration officials say survivors estimated 100 people had been packed into the back of the 18-wheeler at one point in its journey. Officials said 39 people were inside when rescuers arrived, and the rest either escaped or hitched rides to their next destination. Nearly 20 of those rescued from the rig were hospitalized in dire condition, many suffering from extreme dehydration and heatstroke. The driver of that rig remains in federal custody, charged with illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain, resulting in death.
On Sunday, Edinburg police went to the gas station, a popular stopover for commercial truck drivers traveling through the region, after receiving an anonymous call from someone saying a relative was trapped inside the tractor-trailer with several others. Officers began knocking on the sides of trailers parked at the station and eventually received return knocks from the one holding the immigrants, police said.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the agency is investigating the matter.
The San Antonio incident demonstrated how smugglers regularly use big rigs as part of an elaborate network of foot guides, safe house operators and drivers. The immigrants discovered in San Antonio had been divided into groups and marked with color-coded tape. Six black SUVs were waiting at one transit point to take some on to their destinations.
Authorities have not said if similar arrangements had been made for the immigrants found in Edinburg, about 230 miles south of San Antonio.
Tractor-trailers emerged as a popular smuggling method in the early 1990s amid a surge in U.S. border enforcement in San Diego and El Paso, Texas, which were then the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. Before that, people paid small fees to mom-and-pop operators to get them across a largely unguarded border. As crossing became exponentially more difficult after the 2001 terror strikes in the U.S., migrants were led through more dangerous terrain and paid thousands of dollars more.

Islamabad
The Minister of Interior Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, taking action on Sunday of the news of a Pakistani woman trapped in India, issued orders to NADRA chairman and passport directorate to verify the woman's Pakistan nationality within 48 hours.
The report said that a Pakistani woman named Rubina had gone from Hyderabad (Sindh) to India along with her husband and her little daughter for treatment in 2012. But her husband left her in Delhi and disappeared with her travel documents.
Later she was arrested by Indian Police and detained in a jail in the Occupied Kashmir where she is living for the last four years.
However, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court ordered to send back the woman to Pakistan immediately but the Indian officials submitted a report saying that Rubina could not be deported as the Pakistan High commission did not confirm her citizenship. It was also reported that the woman named Rubina Bibi and her juvenile daughter have been kept in Amphalla jail of occupied Kashmir by Indian forces. She was arrested in Jammu and Kashmir under section 14 of Foreigners Act in 2012. The Pakistan Embassy in India is yet to confirm the nationality of Rubina and her daughter.
Rubina's deportation procedure remains incomplete.
Now, Chaudhry Nisar ordered Director Passports and Chairman NADRA to verify the particulars of Rubina and if she is proved a Pakistani citizen then make arrangements along with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take her back to the country.
JAKARTA (Reuters) - A BBC journalist on a reporting trip to cover a health and malnutrition crisis in Indonesia's easternmost area of Papua was forced to leave the province after the country's military said tweets she sent on her trip had “hurt soldiers' feelings”.
Papua is one of Indonesia's poorest areas and President Joko Widodo after coming to power in 2014 pledged to speed up its development and ease media restrictions in the area, where there has been a simmering secessionist movement.
But while investment has risen and efforts made to address some human rights concerns, activists say foreign journalists continue to be blocked or face obstacles when trying to report.
Indonesia's military said in a statement that a tweet sent by Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia's editor, had “hurt the feelings of TNI (Indonesian military) personnel” involved in relief efforts in the Asmat area.
Henschke had tweeted a photo of supplies on her personal Twitter account, adding: “This is the aid coming in for severely malnourished children in Papua - instant noodles, super sweet soft drinks and biscuits.”
Papua military spokesman Colonel Muhammad Aidi said: “(The food and drink) that she took the picture of at the speedboat pier are not donations or aid. It was merchandise from merchants that was incidentally there.” Aidi also described two other tweets as misleading.
Henschke, a Jakarta-based Australian citizen, later took down the photograph and tweeted: “Adding important NOTE: Other sources say this is NOT aid but normal supplies. Huge relief effort underway here.”

Indonesia has deployed additional military personnel to help in Asmat, where at least 61 infants are reported to have died from malnutrition and diseases such as measles.
Henschke had asked to be allowed to continue covering the story during questioning by security forces over her tweets on Friday, but was escorted to the city of Timika and held by immigration, the military statement said.
Henschke declined to comment, but a BBC spokesperson said via email: “A BBC team on a deployment to Papua province has now returned to Jakarta. They had the necessary documentation and the authorities were aware of their visit. The BBC respects local laws wherever it operates.”

Many Papuans, who are predominantly Christian and a minority in Muslim-majority Indonesia, criticize Jakarta for neglecting Papua and instead being too focused on the densely-populated island of Java.
Catholic priest and rights activist John Jonga blamed the crisis on a lack of vaccinations and a switch from more nutritious tubers to rice as a staple food. Some of the forest-dwelling Asmat are also reported to be increasingly relying on instant food or energy drinks.
Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch said Henschke's treatment showed pledges to open up Papua had not materialised.
“She had her travel permit - the only Indonesian area where foreign journalists need to get a permit to visit - and still got intimidation for a single tweet,” said Harsono.
A presidential spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shonda Rhimes, the creator of popular television series such as “Scandal” and “Grey's Anatomy,” has signed a deal to make new shows for Netflix.
The streaming service announced late Sunday that Rhimes' Shondaland production company is moving to Netflix. Rhimes' shows “Grey's Anatomy,” ″Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder” will continue to air on ABC, Netflix said in a new release about the deal.
Rhimes said she was grateful to ABC for giving her career a start, but was looking forward to expanding her audience and “creative identity” with Netflix. “Starting today, we are thrilled to begin creating new Shondaland stories with Netflix,” she said in a statement.
According to Rhimes' statement, she and Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos developed a plan for the next phase of her career. She said Netflix offered her and her team “limitless possibilities.”
“I've gotten the chance to know Shonda and she's a true Netflixer at heart — she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience,” Sarandos wrote.
No financial terms of the deal were disclosed. The news release also didn't state how long Rhimes and her company would produce series for Netflix.
Rhimes, 47, has been nominated for three Emmy Awards, all for her work on her “Grey's Anatomy.” The long-running series begins its 14th season next month.

A two-day gun and Western Americana show is scheduled for the OC Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa beginning Saturday, despite concern from some people about the event's timing in the wake of Sunday's mass shooting in Las Vegas.
The Crossroads of the West Gun Show — billed as the largest gun show in California — has been held annually at the fairgrounds for 35 years.
But Bob Templeton, the show's chief executive, said Thursday that he's received about a half-dozen calls and emails from groups who say it's insensitive to have a gun show in light of the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people — including the gunman — dead and hundreds wounded.
Templeton expressed sympathy for the victims and their families and referred to the shooter, Stephen Paddock, as a “madman.”
“Our entire gun show staff extends our thoughts and our prayers to those who lost loved ones and to those who are being treated for their injuries by Las Vegas' medical professionals,” Templeton said.
An OC Fair & Event Center spokeswoman said Thursday that the center has received two complaints about the show, one via phone and the other through social media.
Templeton said the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Orange County Sheriff's Department will be at the show — as is typical — as a safety precaution and to make sure all sales are aboveboard. He added that the event complies with all California gun laws, which are some of the strictest in the nation.
Templeton said he has no plans to cancel the show, which is set to run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.
“There's no direct connection to what we're doing and what happened in Las Vegas, although many people would like to make that linkage,” he said.
About 12,000 visitors are expected. Guests can peruse collections of antique and military-style firearms as well as purchase guns, ammunition and accessories, Templeton said.
“Bump fire” stocks, which Paddock had equipped on semi-automatic rifles in the Las Vegas attack, and automatic weapons are illegal in California and will not be sold at the event, Templeton said.
Bump fire stocks, also known as bump stocks, can be fitted on semi-automatic firearms to make them fire more like fully automatic weapons. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Wednesday proposed legislation that would ban the devices nationwide.
Republican Party leaders and the National Rifle Assn. said Thursday they will consider limiting bump stocks.
“The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,” the group said.
Templeton added: “There are two sides to the story on gun control, and perhaps there should be further debate.”
He said, however, that “now is not the time to accommodate those enemies of the 2nd Amendment who attempt to capitalize on this and every national tragedy which involves guns.”
“Those who advocate regulating, restricting and eventually eliminating the private ownership of firearms in America have wasted no time in voicing their loud and shrill demands for more gun control,” he said.

Fry writes for Times Community News.
The targeted shooting of Republican lawmakers at play yielded a kaleidoscope of emotions Wednesday — anger, revulsion, horror — but little in the way of surprise.
The attack almost seemed a natural, if sick, extension of the virulence that surrounds the country's increasingly tribal politics.
As if to prove it, events quickly settled into a familiar pattern: finger-pointing, blame-laying, partisan positioning. People today don't just disagree. They've grown to hate the other side, from President Trump on down.
Not necessarily over issues or ideology, which can be debated or leavened by compromise. But rather as an outgrowth of a deeper pathology, a contempt toward people for merely existing.
“It's hard to suggest it's an ideological conflict,” as if, say, the abortion issue has suddenly grown more heated, said Marc Hetherington, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. “What it's all about is bad feelings.”
He cited studies showing Republicans say they hate Democrats more than they hate atheists, and Democrats hate Republicans more than they despise religious fundamentalists.
Both sides, he said, hate the other more than they hate “illegal immigrants,” the inflammatory phrase used to gauge respective animosities.
The overwhelming majority of people, of course, don't take up weapons to vent their anger as did gunman James T. Hodgkinson, a supporter of independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and a fierce Trump critic.
In the aftermath of Wednesday's brutality there were many instances of grace, not least from those most directly affected.
“We don't shed our humanity when we enter this chamber,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said in a moving oration on the House floor. “For all the noise and fury, we are one family.”
San Francisco's Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, responded, “On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our hopes and prayers for the wounded.”
We don't shed our humanity when we enter this chamber. For all the noise and fury, we are one family. — House Speaker Paul D. Ryan
The coming-together recalled a similarly transcendent moment after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when members of Congress, Democrat and Republican, ventured to the steps of the Capitol and side by side delivered a spontaneous rendering of “God Bless America.”
But that brief harmony proved a mere pause as the country descended into an even deeper slough of animosity and political loathing.
Similarly, the high-flown words of party leaders were quickly and loudly drowned out Wednesday by partisans grasping for tactical advantage.
Among them was the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who used Twitter to link the shootings to a controversial New York production of “Julius Caesar,” in which a presidential doppelganger is murdered onstage.
“Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President,” commentator Harlan Hill wrote in a Tweet the younger Trump amplified by sharing with 1.7 million Twitter followers.
“The Left in this country is ushering in a new #CultureofViolence where violent hate is the new normal,” tweeted Bill Mitchell, a pro-Trump radio host. “#DomesticTerrorists,” he added.
On the Democratic side, some more virulent partisans openly celebrated the critical wounding of Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, or summoned eye-for-an-eye memories of the hatred directed at President Obama and his supporters. (A number of Democratic lawmakers reported receiving death threats immediately after the attack.)
The junior Trump's tweet drew a string of angry rejoinders:
“Did you have a problem when [candidate Trump] said ‘I could shoot someone on Fifth Ave. and my approval would go up'?”
“Or when Trump advocated violence at rallies to show people a lesson? Lol”
“Trump is a major contributor [to] the type of violence that led to this in the first place.”
The president, for his part, responded with a call for national unity, a show of equanimity in notable contrast to his stance during the campaign, when he sometimes encouraged violence and, at one point, seemed to invite opponents to take up arms against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
While many were quick to blame Trump for Wednesday's violence — just as they implicated him after a Republican congressional candidate body-slammed a reporter for asking about healthcare — it's not as though he overnight transformed a nation bathed in love and light.
“It's been building and building,” said Hetherington, who has written extensively on the country's polarization.
He cited the pugnacious Newt Gingrich, who in 1994 broke a 40-year Democratic stranglehold on the House by shattering the ordered rules of engagement and urging acolytes to tar their opponents with words like “corrupt,” “pathetic” and “traitor.” (On Thursday, the former House speaker tweeted a link to Ryan's speech and the quote “an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.”)
The contagion spread well behind the Capitol in the aftermath of the fiercely disputed 2000 presidential campaign, which ended in an effective tie broken by a partisan 5-4 Supreme Court decision. It deepened with the antagonism directed at President George W. Bush and, as though to outdo the hostility, the contempt aimed at his successor, President Obama.
David Axelrod, who helped steer Obama to the White House, said Trump must shoulder some blame for the country's growing chasm. Ultimately, though, he said it was the voters who must take responsibility.
Tiger Woods will not be part of a news conference on Wednesday at Riviera Country Club because he has been "advised by doctors to limit all activities'' due to his ongoing back spasms, according to a statement released by the Genesis Open on Tuesday.
Woods' foundation runs the tournament at the course in Pacific Palisades, California, and as tournament host, he was scheduled to conduct a news conference, which was pushed from Tuesday to Wednesday and now has been canceled. It was announced Tuesday night that back spasms will keep Tiger Woods from holding his scheduled press conference for the Genesis Open, a tournament run by his foundation. Gregory Bull/AP Photo
It is unclear if Woods ever made the trip from his home in Florida to Southern California. His agent, Mark Steinberg, could not be reached. Tournament officials were unaware if Woods was at or near the tournament, which is not far from where the Tiger Woods Foundation is based. Editor's Picks Tiger drops next two events due to back spasms On his website, Tiger Woods said he will miss next week's Genesis Open and The Honda Classic, which is set to start Feb. 23. He will determine his next event after his back is reassessed.
On Friday, Woods, 41, withdrew from the Genesis Open and next week's Honda Classic due to the back spasms that forced him out of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic on Feb. 3. Woods had shot an opening-round 77 in the European Tour event, his second of 2017. He missed the cut a week earlier at the Farmers Insurance Open.
Woods returned to competition in December at the Hero World Challenge, which his foundation also runs. It was the first time he competed since the second of two back surgeries in 2015, a period of 16 months.
The plan for Woods originally was an ambitious start to 2017, with four tournaments in five weeks, including this week's event at Riviera, where he played in his first professional event as an amateur in 1992 as a 16-year-old high school student.
"My doctors have advised me not to play the next two weeks, to continue my treatment and to let my back calm down," Woods said in a statement on Friday. "This is not what I was hoping for or expecting. I am extremely disappointed to miss the Genesis Open, a tournament that benefits my foundation, and The Honda Classic, my hometown event."
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  California's attorney general sued the Trump administration Friday over new rules allowing more employers to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming moral or religious objections, joining a flurry of lawsuits by other states and birth control advocacy groups.
Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued in federal court in San Francisco the same day the Republican administration announced it is giving employers more discretion as part of a broader rollback of the Affordable Care Act.
The new rules violate the U.S. Constitution by allowing employers to use their religious beliefs to justify discrimination and to deny women equal protection under the law, the lawsuit contends. It says the administration also violated federal law by acting without allowing for public comment and without providing a proper legal or factual basis for the change.
He said the rollback could affect 13 million California women and their families, but later said those women would still be protected by state law. California Department of Managed Health Care Director Shelley Rouillard said in a statement that California-regulated health plans must cover contraceptives for women without cost, with very narrow exceptions for religious employers.

"We're not interested in going backwards," Becerra said during a conference call with other contraception advocates, many of whom promised their own legal challenges. "We're prepared in California to take all action, including legal action, to defend a woman's rights against these unacceptable attacks."
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a fellow Democrat, also sued Friday, citing similar legal grounds.
Becerra said other attorneys general, whom he would not name, are preparing to file their own lawsuits or join existing suits.
He was one of 18 state attorneys general who signed a letter warning the Trump administration that it should expect legal action. The others are in Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
The American Civil Liberties Union also sued Friday in federal court in San Francisco on behalf of its members and members of Service Employee International Union-United Health Care Workers West whom it said were at risk of losing their contraception coverage.

Riyad Mahrez will be missing again when Leicester host Swansea in the Premier League.
The 2016 PFA Player of the Year went AWOL on Tuesday, after the Foxes ­refused to sell him to Manchester City.
The club insist they would have let the 26-year-old go if the league leaders had coughed up £80million cash.
But the King Power Stadium owners dug their heels in as Man City refused to meet their terms, which has left Mahrez claiming to be “depressed”.

Manager Claude Puel admits it is a “difficult situation” and could not confirm when Mahrez would be ­returning to the club — with Leicester ironically away to Man City next ­Saturday.
Puel was even unable to say if he had spoken with Mahrez after four days absent as medics, HR and lawyers are now set to get involved over the star's state of mind.
Before Saturday's visit from the Swans, he confirmed: “Riyad will not be available for this game.
“We will assess him when he has cleared his head.

“It is a tough situation for us to manage. I ­understand the ­disappointment when it was a good ­opportunity for him.
“I think Riyad after some time will come back with us. It is a situation ­between the club, myself and the player to manage calmly. The first priority is for him to find the good feeling again and enjoy his football.”
Mahrez first failed to report for ­training on Tuesday with no ­explanation which stunned team-mates and officials.
It plunged Leicester's preparations for their 2-1 loss at Everton on ­Wednesday into chaos as Mahrez was in Puel's line-up and the training ground was said to be “madness”.
But Puel insists he and City's stars are willing to welcome Mahrez back into the fold in due course.
The Frenchman added: “Riyad is a good player, but he is good man as well and I respect him. We will meet with his side and the club, and keep it between ­ourselves.
“His team-mates wait for Riyad to come back in the squad because he is a valuable player for us, a decisive, clinical player and is ­always their friend.
“I hope he can come back happy and find a smile with his team-mates.”
Mahrez, who has eight Premier League goals and seven assists this season, could face a club fine of two weeks' wages worth £200,000 if found guilty of going AWOL.
Leicester insist their £80m valuation of the player, who has two-and-a-half years left on his contract, was fair in a window that saw Liverpool pay £75m for Virgil van Dijk and Barcelona splash £145m on Philippe Coutinho.

Dear Bella,
I currently live in the US and I have been married to my first love (who lives in Dominica ) for almost three years. My first love and I have been in love since we were kids. When I moved to the US we lost touch with each other and a few years back we reunited.
We got married and ever since we got married our marriage have been very rocky. We have been out of touch with each other and then get back in touch but this time it's been the longest. I love my husband very much. He completes me. I have been trying to reach out to him through phone calls and text messages and he is refusing my calls.
I was told by several people that he is seeing someone. I don't know how true it is, but I guess action speaks louder than words. My heart hurts deeply that he would do this to me. Our love is not an ordinary love. I want to come home because I believe that he will have to face me and talk to me but I am very afraid of what I might be coming home to.
I spoke to him about a week ago and he told me he loves me. But what I don't understand is, why he is keeping away from me?
I am a woman with a broken heart.
What should I do?
Distance
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
Dear Distance,
Perfect love casts out all fear and so you shouldn't be afraid to come home to face your husband irrespective of the situation.
He is your HUSBAND. He made a vow to you and so you should have no fear to find out why he is faltering on these vows. Before you listen to Dominicans (some people know other's business and not theirs) you need to get the facts for yourself.
In a world where communication is free, I find it worrying that you have been “trying to reach out to him through phone calls and text messages” and he is refusing your calls.
Honey, if you are able to come home then do that. Knowledge is power. And once you know, you will have the power to make the right decision going forward whether it is to continue the marriage or move on without him. Whichever way, it is always better to know.
Best,
Bella

The advantages of watching a ballet once, twice or even more, year after year? Not only do you get to know its intricacies, but in the case of “The Nutcracker,” you also get to watch its child performers grow up into lead parts.
Of course, not every “Nutcracker” is worth repeated viewing. The 1892 Russian ballet is bah-humbug for some viewers, even with Tchaikovsky's luscious and romantic music.
Choreographer Alexei Ratmansky's 7-year-old production for American Ballet Theatre, however, is already an unreserved classic. It's back for its annual performances at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts with the Pacific Symphony in the pit and rotating casts of children and adults, including San Pedro native Misty Copeland as the Princess in some performances.
Among the scads of children at Friday night's performance (all local and many from the ABT William J. Gillespie School at Segerstrom), Julianna Dove portrayed Clara with warmth and fearlessness; two years ago, she was a skittering Little Angel. Chase Rogers, as Nutcracker Boy, has moved up the solo ranks each December, first as Little Mouse and last year as Fritz; he is a gifted actor and a budding dancer. Salvatore Lodi made his debut as Little Mouse, while Kellan Hayag was a floppy-haired, scampering scalawag Fritz.
The little ones happen to be a personal favorite, but most of the audience is there for the grownups. Veteran principal dancer Herman Cornejo was a glorious Prince, who managed to naturally balance regal and humble. He moved with fullness, drawing distinct shapes with his body that oozed with rhythm, embodying the music in all its qualities. See him while you can; he's approaching his 20th anniversary with ABT.

Sarah Lane, the Princess, wavered on this evening. She was mostly in command when Cornejo was nearby but insecure during her solos. Lane tended to rely on her steely legwork, as though her upper body port de bras were tacked on as an afterthought. She appeared to lose confidence during the grand pas solo. Conductor David LaMarche saved the day at the end, holding the orchestra's final chords as the couple maneuvered into their last position.
Dancers throughout the ranks distinguished themselves Friday: Marshall Whiteley played up the Mouse King's make-believe fearsomeness, making his debut in the role; Courtney Lavine turned the Nanny/Sugar Plum Fairy part into a whimsical Mary Poppins; and Gabe Stone Shayer and Betsy McBride sharply defined the mechanical dolls, Harlequin and Columbine. Craig Salstein was the night's energetic Drosselmeyer, perhaps a bit too high-voltage, and for my taste a tad too young yet to be the magical uncle and toymaker.
Shayer, joining Patrick Frenette and Nathan Vendt, amped up the antics for the Russian dance, which Ratmansky has transformed into a balletic Three Stooges. Likewise, the Arabian dance is no longer the skin-showing seduction scene of past productions but a comedic vignette of a husband under pressure from his four-woman harem. Considering the current headlines, that one needs a very light touch, and Roman Zhurbin, Kathryn Boren, Claire Davison, Scout Forsythe and Catherine Hurlin achieved the right tone.

There seems a never-ending supply of subtle complexities to uncover in Ratmansky's work. In the Waltz of the Flowers, I noticed for the first time the women's shivering arm gesture, suggesting they're quaking with joy. And in the Snow scene, the 24 female snowflakes continuously reform new angles and shapes, as though there were a real storm blowing them about. Richard Hudson's colorful costumes set the mood as much as his painterly scenic designs.
Finally, the Pacific Symphony, though occasionally thin-sounding in the strings, kept a sprightly and joyful pace.

President Peter Mutharika has told the general public that he is not a failure because he has completed various developmental Projects under his government.
President Mutharika made the remarks at Comesa hall in Blantyre on Tuesday during acceptance speech for his endorsement as the DPP torch bearer for the 2019 tripartite elections.
Mutharika said he is delighted to learn that all the promises made in DPP's 2014 manifesto are translated into tangible development citing Mzuzu-Nkhatabay road, construction of schools, Cancer Centre in Lilongwe, roads, decent affordable houses as examples of the many projects completed under his government.
“I want to show people that we have completed Mzuzu-Nkhatabay road. I don't just do groundbreaking but I complete projects. That's success, I have not failed. This assures me that people will vote DPP into power next year.
Mutharika also emphasized on the responsibility of the newly elected National Governing Council members as he urged party members to love one another, unite and work hard to win 2019 elections.
He commended the members for his endorsement as DPP president and torch bearer for May 2019 elections as he described the convention as the best ever among the 3 conventions the party have had so far.
” I will stand so that DPP continue to run not for myself but for the people. I am not standing for the presidency for the money as I take 40 percent of my salary, the rest goes to the government but I will contest because I know I can take the party and country to greater heights, ” Mutharika said.
In his remarks, Nicholas Dausi, who was the organising chair for the convention and also the minister of information, communication and technology described the elections as free and fair.
” We have had a peaceful convention winners have won with integrity and those who have lost with dignity and that's the spirit,” Dausi said.
Dausi advised his fellow party members to stop defecting from one party to another and that NGC should not take party members for granted.
The convention saw President Mutharika endorsed as the party's president, Goodall Gondwe and Bright Msaka went unopposed for the Vice president position for the northern and Eastern region respectively.
Kondwani Nankhumwa and Uladi Mussa got the Vice presidency position for the Southern and Central region respectively.
Secretary General position went to Grezider Jeffrey, Nicholas Dausi won the Publicity Secretary position, National Director for Women position went to Cecelia Chazama.
About 8 positions have been deferred to a later date. Such positions include that of the National Director of Youth, Director of International affairs and Director of religious affairs among others.
Depression is characterized by a severe and typically prolonged feeling of sadness and dejection. It is basically a state of feeling sad about everything.
It makes us irritable, saps our energy and motivation, and negatively affects our ability to experience joy, pleasure and excitement.
Jumia Travel shares 5 treatments that can help you cure depression.
Change Your Mindset
If you want to cure depression, you have to start by changing your mindset. Refuse to be a weak person who lets himself or herself be beaten down by emotions you should have mastered.
You should remember that you have control over your mind and body; and know that you have the willpower to say no to the feeling of depression, and rise up to do something to restore your feelings of joy, pleasure and excitement.
If you don't remember these things and do something to overcome depression, the feeling of depression might never leave you and you'll end up doing permanent damage to your life.
Don't forget that you might not have been able to control falling into depression, but you can control whether or not you stay in depression.
Participate In Engaging Activities
The worst thing you can do when depressed is to be alone. Participating in engaging activities with friends, family or people in a group you are a part of can do wonders in helping to lift you out of the pit of depression.
It stops you from ruminating and letting your mind wonder on despondent thoughts. When you're interacting with other people and participating in engaging activities, it's difficult to dwell on repetitive negative thoughts.
Go Outside To Get Some Exposure To Light
Have you ever wondered why when you're depressed you're more sensitive to light exposure? It's because there is a deeper link between light exposure and depression.
Usually, when you're depressed you want to remain in a dark gloomy place to wallow, but what you don't realize is that your brain measures the amount of light you get every day and uses the information to reset your body's internal clock.
When there's no light exposure, it throws your body off balance and disrupts important circadian rhythms that regulate energy, sleep, appetite and hormone levels.
This disruption only makes the feeling of depression worse. It is therefore important to get light exposure (even if it's only the natural light of a gray cloudy day) to keep those rhythms well regulated and enliven your body.
You'd also notice that you will feel better than when you allowed yourself wallow in the darkness with the feeling of depression.
Physical Exercise
When you're depressed, the desire to do anything, go anywhere, say anything wanes drastically. To address this, doing physical exercises as simple as 20 to 30 minutes of brisk walking, two or three times a week, can help you overcome this crippling emotion.
You should encourage yourself to move and not let the emotion of depression defeat you.
Exercise is essential in the treatment of depression because it increases the activity level of important brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, alongside the brain's production of a key growth hormone called BDNF.
Depression affects the production of these chemicals and causes them to plummet, leading to learning and memory impairments (this is why when you are depressed you feel weak, sluggish and find it difficult to remember details of things that might have happened in your direct line of vision).

Social Support
Relationships play a big part in helping to cure depression. Many hormones involved in bonding and helping behavior help reduce the anxiety and stress related to depression.
Having someone to talk to you about your feelings and having someone to talk to you out of your drowning feelings of depression can be of monumental help in dealing with depression and preventing a re-occurrence.

Art-music deity Brian Eno was one of the producers who worked on 2008's Viva La Vida, the second-best Coldplay album. And now he's once again teamed up with the band. But this time, he isn't helping the band make music. He's helping you make music, but he's only helping you make music when one particular Coldplay song is playing. It's a bit confusing!
In 2008, Eno and his collaborator Peter Chilvers put together Bloom, an app that you could use to make your own ambient music — or, more accurately, an app that would generate its own ambient music, which you could tinker with a bit. And now, based on that Bloom app, Eno and Chilvers have made an app for “Hypnotised,” the single from Coldplay's forthcoming Kaleidoscope EP.
Pitchfork reports that the new “Hypnotised” app “is able to detect when “Hypnotised” is playing, and then plays its own generative melody, based on the song's piano motif.” You can also use it to make your own melodies. On Twitter, Coldplay ask that their fans use the app when they play “Hypnotised” live, promising that “it will sound magical.” I don't know how loud the members of Coldplay think iPhone speakers are, but there is no way in hell you're going to be able to hear anything from your phone if you're at a Coldplay show.
In any case, you can download the app for free here.
Faster data speeds are on the way, but you'll need to pay more for them.
Wireless carriers in the United States are currently in a race to offer truly 5G networks and Sprint just announced that it plans on being the first one to roll out nationwide 5G coverage during the first half of 2019.
To achieve this, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure says the carrier will add new antennas to its towers that are capable of sending and receiving large MIMO transmissions. 5G support will be added to the towers/antennas with a software update, and unlike other carriers, Sprint will be deploying its 5G network through its 2.5GHz spectrum.
Over half of Sprint's towers already support the 2.5GHz standard, and the goal is to expand this to all operating towers by the end of 2018. Furthermore, to help ensure the 5G network's expansion, Sprint will utilize the power of 40,000 "outdoor small cell solutions" 15,000 strand-mounted cells, and as many as 1 million of the network's Sprint Magic Boxes (small signal boosters that customers can purchase and use in their homes).
According to Marcelo –
Sprint is the only carrier that doesn't have to compromise what 5G can deliver because we can deliver super wide channels of more than 100 MHz while still delivering mid-band coverage characteristics.
Another thing worth noting is the fact that Sprint's 5G network is expected to cost more than what it currently charges for unlimited 4G LTE speeds. This is something the market saw during the transition from 3G to 4G networks, and while Sprint says it'll continue to be a "price leader" before its 5G rollout, customers are going to "potentially see some modest price increases in the next year, but nothing substantial."
Speaking more on the 5G price hike, Marcelo states that –
It's going to be very difficult for our competitors to increase the price of unlimited, but we're going to have a lot of room to increase our price of unlimited to get to similar prices as Verizon and AT&T in the future. You get that by having that amazing network. You get that by being the first one to launch 5G. So we're looking at 5G as an amazing opportunity for the company not only for the position of the company, but also to charge for the blazing fast speeds.
In early January, AT&T announced that it would introduce a genuine 5G network to 12 markets across the U.S. by the end of 2018. T-Mobile is expected to start deploying its 5G network at some point in 2019, and Verizon will launch its 5G service in a handful of cities this year.
With 5G just on the horizon of finally becoming a reality, what are looking forward to the most with these increased speeds?
A 5G network owned by the United States government? It's not going to happen
The Hamilton Police Service's female recruitment night will have a different theme next year.
Inspector Treena MacSween stresses that organizers welcome the feedback, and will be making changes after the YWCA Hamilton objected to its hot pink “Girls Night Out” poster.
Our @hamiltonpolice recruiting event started a healthy discussion with @YWCA_Hamilton about labels. That's ok because we welcome feedback. Let's not let it overshadow a great event. As a guest speaker, I encourage females interested in policing to sign up. #HamOnt pic.twitter.com/3Ywgr8sqIF — Treena MacSween (@TMacSween370) April 22, 2018
The YWCA has voiced dissatisfaction with the poster's stereotypical colour choice, adding in a Twitter post that “we have to stop calling women ‘girls.”
The recruitment event is scheduled for Monday, April 30 at Ancaster Old Town Hall.
We have to stop calling women "girls." We are dissatisfied with the use of patronizing language (and stereotypical pink) by @HamiltonPolice in their recruitment efforts. #UseTheRightWords https://t.co/MqiIWXbBFE — YWCA Hamilton (@YWCA_Hamilton) April 20, 2018
MacSween adds this type of initiative has been successful, as Hamilton's contingent of female officers has jumped from 21 to 24 per cent since 2014.
She also stresses that organizers “didn't mean to offend anyone,” adding that “Girls Night Out” is designed to be a “comfortable” atmosphere where females can ask questions about things like maternity leave, child care and elder care that tend to fall on their shoulders.

Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen (Yossi Zeliger/Flash90)
Israel and Canada signed a new free trade agreement on Wednesday.
Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen and Canadian Minister of International Trade François-Philippe Champagne concluded the deal between their two countries.
Israel said that the amount of Israeli-Canadian trade has doubled in value since 1997, when the existing free trade agreement was signed. In 2013, trade between the two countries exceeded $1 billion.
Israel has free access to the Canadian market when selling baked goods, fresh and processed fruits, vegetables and wines. In exchange, Canada gets free access to the Israeli market for baked goods, berries and spices.
Israeli hummus, among other items to be sold in Canada, will enjoy tax-free status when less than 400 tons are sold.
This is the third free trade agreement signed this year by the Israeli government, after agreements with Panama and Ukraine.

Creator Abi Morgan's The Split has been renewed for a second season on BBC One. Produced by Sister Pictures, the first six-episode season completed its UK run on Tuesday and began airing in the U.S. on SundanceTV last week. The female-led legal drama is set in the fast-paced world of London's divorce law circuit and focuses on the Defoe family of lawyers while exploring modern marriage and the legacy of divorce through their eyes.
Nicola Walker, Meera Syal, Stephen Mangan, Fiona Button, Deborah Findlay, Annabel Scholey, Anthony Head, Barry Atsma and Stephen Tompkinson starred in the first season whose first episode launched with 6M consolidated viewers and 2.2M iPlayer requests in the 30 days following.
Suffragette and The Hour writer Morgan says, “It's a delight and a privilege to bring The Split back for series two and to submerge myself once more into the world of Noble, Hale and Defoe and the lives of Hannah and her sisters. Thank you to the BBC and the enthusiasm of viewers and we look forward to seeing you in 2019.”
The show was the first commission for Sister Pictures, the drama indie led by former Kudos chief Jane Featherstone. She says, “I've been very proud to see Nicola Walker leading our incredible cast through six episodes of Abi Morgan's beautifully crafted exploration of families and modern marriage, and I am thrilled that we're going to be able to continue to explore their lives in even more detail in a second series. Expect things to get even messier for the Defoe sisters and those closest to them.”
BBC Drama chief Piers Wenger calls the series “bold, modern and original and quite unlike anything else on our screens.”
The Split is produced by Sister Pictures for BBC One, co-produced with SundanceTV, and was renewed by Wenger and Charlotte Moore, Director of BBC Content. Season One was executive produced by Featherstone, Morgan, director Jessica Hobbs and Lucy Richer for the BBC, with Lucy Dyke producing.

A "lady" called Mary is about to start a year-long crossing of the River Humber from Goxhill at a cost of £100 million.
Mary is the name given to a National Grid tunnel-boring machine weighing 510 tonnes and measuring 160 metres in length which will create a tunnel under the river for a new gas pipeline.
It has been named after Mary Fergusson, the first female fellow of the Institute of Civil Engineers.
In accordance with tradition, Mary the machine was today officially blessed by Grimsby Catholic priest Father Andrew Cole.
At the same time a statue of St Barbara - the patron saint of miners and tunnellers - was placed at the head of the proposed tunnel.
Following assembly at Goxhill, Mary is due to start her five-kilometre journey across the Humber to Paull, near Hull.
A National Grid spokeswoman said: "The tunnelling machine has now been assembled on site and, in the next few weeks, will begin a five kilometre, year-long journey under the river to emerge on the north bank at Paull. It will create a 3.65 metre diameter tunnel as it travels, around 35 metres below the river bed.

"Once the tunnel is finished, a new 42 inch diameter gas pipeline will be laid inside it to replace an existing one.
"The gas pipeline which currently crosses the river is laid in a trench just below the river bed but is at risk of being exposed by shifting tides.
"Work has been carried out to keep it buried but the Humber Pipeline Replacement project offers a long-term solution."
National Grid has awarded the £100 million contract to build the tunnel to a joint venture made up of Skanska, PORR Bau GmbH and A. Hak.
The work by National Grid is proving a major boost for the North Lincolnshire economy, with 250 contractors already on site.

National Grid representatives visited primary schools in Goxhill and Paull last summer to introduce the project to pupils and ask for help in naming the machine.
The winning name was chosen by eight-year-old Paull Primary School pupil Kasey Doney.
The giant machine was built in Badem-Wurttemberg in Germany and was shipped via Holland to Immingham Docks.
It was then transported by road along the A160, A180 and A15 in December, ready for assembly at the site in Goxhill.

KARACHI - Karachi wore quite a deserted look on Tuesday afternoon, amidst heat warning issued by the Meteorological department coupled with an advisory urging people to avoid unnecessary exposure to sun.
With day time temperature reaching 42 degree celsius, humidity registered at 33% and wind blowing 27 Km per hour the weather was comparatively bearable for those who had to leave cool environs of home owing to their unavoidable obligations. “It is hot but not as sizzling as experienced last week,” said Ammara Jalil, a banker.
Thanking her luck that the day did not turn out to be extremely warm as feared, Ammara said the weather forecast must, however, not be taken lightly as there are little chances of much respite during next few days.
Mohammad Sikander, running his general provision shop at one of the most frequented Empress Market talking to APP pointed out that although most of the shops in the market as well as centres located in the vicinity were open but there were not many buyers.
“You cannot even see the window shoppers,” he mentioned commenting that people are taking the warnings quite seriously.
“People are scared and are also getting increasingly conscious of global warming,” said senior environmentalist, Dr Tahir Qureishi.
He said this was an opportunity for the state as well as all stakeholders to take needed measures and meet the challenges related to climate change.
Emphasizing that interventions must be adopted without any delay, he said short terms as well long term interventions are needed, he said.
As per weather alert issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department the maximum temperature was expected to remain between 40 and 44 degrees Celsius due to a change in the direction of the cooler and humid sea breeze.
The metropolis has been warned to experience hot to very hot weather from Tuesday to Thursday after a brief relief during past two days.
Provincial and city governments cognizant of the possible implications of heat wave forecasted for the current week have ensured availability of all required assistance for the people reporting with heat stroke or heat injury at the emergency and out-patient departments of the hospitals and medical centres falling under their respective jurisdictions.
Floyd Mayweather said in an Instagram post on Tuesday that he's made no deal to fight UFC star Conor McGregor, or any other fighter, reiterating that he is happily retired.
There seems to be several rumors floating around media recently however, let the record show, there hasn't been any deals made in regards to a fight between myself and any other fighters. I am happily retired and enjoying life at this time. If any changes are to come, be sure that I will be the first to let the world know. A post shared by Floyd Mayweather (@floydmayweather) on Feb 14, 2017 at 3:17pm PST
The post came shortly after UFC President Dana White texted ESPN's Brett Okamoto: "No deal is even close to being done."
Earlier Tuesday, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith said he'd spoken with Mayweather on Saturday while both were attending the Warriors-Thunder game in Oklahoma City. Smith said Mayweather told him that "we're getting very, very close" to the superfight. Floyd Mayweather dismissed talk that he's close to a deal to fight Conor McGregor in an Instagram post on Tuesday. Christian Petersen/Getty Images
Sources confirmed to Okamoto that McGregor had arrived in Las Vegas on Monday evening. Mayweather lives and trains in Las Vegas.
Prior to Mayweather's post on Tuesday, Nevada State Athletic Commission chairman Anthony Marnell had confirmed to ESPN that the commission had been made aware of active negotiations between the two camps, but said the fight still faces several challenges.
It's unclear if those negotiations have ended in light of Mayweather's post.
"There is a lot of real stuff going on," Marnell said. "It still seems like a long shot, but when there is a lot of money involved, people tend to figure it out. There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen, but I'm not sure if we're going to eat.
"The Nevada Athletic Commission, in my experience, has always been well-briefed by all parties on an event or potential event that may take place in Las Vegas. We are aware of conversations and information that has been disclosed and not disclosed in the media. Whether these conversations will get to a point that a fight happens, I can't tell you."
The two sides have gone back and forth in the headlines for nearly a year, regarding a potential fight.
McGregor, 28, is the UFC's lightweight champion and remains under contract. Marnell mentioned that as a wrinkle in any boxing match McGregor wishes to pursue, saying, "people are under certain contractual obligations that need to get figured out."
McGregor successfully applied for a boxing license in California in December. He has never boxed professionally. Mayweather, 39, is regarded as one of the best boxers of his era.
Last month, White publicly offered McGregor and Mayweather $25 million each for the potential boxing match. When told of White's offer by TMZ, Mayweather said, "He's a f---ing comedian!"
McGregor has demanded $100 million for the fight and said he'd be willing to do it with or without the UFC's involvement. White has promised that won't go well for the star fighter.
"It is what it is now," White told ESPN last week. "He came out and said, 'I can do this without them.' I guarantee you, he can't do it without us. What I then said was, 'I've always been respectful of Conor, the things he wants to do and everything else. If he wants to go down that road it will be an epic fall.' Everybody knows exactly what that means."
According to Marnell, as expected, the distribution of money from this potential megafight might be the biggest hurdle of all.
"I'm confirming that real people are having real discussions," Marnell said. "I'm also telling you my opinion as the Nevada Athletic Commission chairman that a lot of things need to get done in order to see something like this come together because there are so many parties that want to get their hands on the pot.
"Maybe it will get figured out, but it's going to be hard when everyone is declaring they want $100 million. That's not what I said -- that's what they've said. That's their quotes, not mine. If everyone wants $100 million, that's a lot of $100 millions to go around."

When you grow up consuming the products of the pop machine, you quickly come to realize there's a formula to it all. Be malleable and effervescent, churn out safe hits, or be ready to be spat out and forgotten. But those were the rules from another time, a time before Charli XCX showed up and took a hammer to the system, breaking it down to build it back up into something beautiful.
The perennially left-of-mainstream artist from the London suburbs has made a business of being unapologetically herself. Her fuck-shit-up attitude has been the core of her songwriting from her early days of penning “I Love It” to her recent Pop 2 — a brilliant, A.G. Cook-produced mixtape with frenetic production and earworm hooks that's redefining everything pop music can be. To write about the genre without a mention of Charli XCX is to completely miss the point. With the middle-fingers-up attitude of rockstars past, she's letting those who still doubt know that her version of pop — adventurous, experimental, and dizzyingly good — is the future. Get on board or get out of her way.
When Charli announced in late February that she was doing two special nights dedicated to Pop 2, the question on everyone's mind (beside whether or not they would be able to snag a ticket) was who would be joining her onstage. And with the spectacle of featured artists from the Pop 2 Los Angeles show still fresh — Carly Rae Jepsen, Caroline Polachek, ABRA, and more guested — the question was even more pressing on NYC's take of the event at Elsewhere in Brooklyn.
“If SOPHIE shows up, I'll cut my dick off and throw it onstage,” said one guy in the audience to his mildly horrified boyfriend, referencing the producer who collaborated with Charli on her dark pop 2016 EP Vroom Vroom. Close by, another group discussed how they woke up that morning knowing CupcakKe, the diabolically sexual rapper who also worked with Charli on her previous mixtape Number 1 Angel, would be one of the surprise guests. The anticipation was tangible. Violet lights bathed the crowd — a sea of holographic designs, slick fabrics, PVC-heavy accessories — giving everyone an extraterrestrial glow that felt fitting for a night of music that feels like it was beamed in from a future era.
No one has more fun than Charli XCX. Her energy is rare, white-hot from the moment she steps on stage, the kind that lingers with you on the journey back home. She effortlessly hits the sweet spot between the curated and spontaneous — her brief exchanges with the audience could easily be what she says at every performance, but Charli's realness could make you care less; she makes you feel like she's saying it all for the first time. Plus, in an “XCX” world, time doesn't mean shit.
“If you hook up with someone tonight — which I hope you do — this one's for you,” she said before the sugary opening notes of her single “Boys” flitted through the speakers. Charli made the most of the guest-heavy evening, making each song as visceral and distinct as the next. For ”Boys” she called an army of bubblegum pink-hued backup dancers to the stage while the quaking and brash “I Got It” tore the house down with both CupcakKe and Brooke Candy in attendance. CupcakKe and Charli continued to wow with the Number 1 Angel standout, the cheekily X-rated “Lipgloss,” while Caroline Polachek took the inherent ache on “Tears” and exploded it open.
Pop 2 is music best listened to loudly and with friends, its choruses so anthemic it's difficult to keep your composure during a solo listen on the subway. Watching Charli while her collaborators took the stage was a special highlight of seeing the bulk of Pop 2 performed live. While CupcakKe dominated the stage with a salvo of raunchy bars on “Duck Duck Goose,” Charli scurried behind A.G. Cook's amorphous lime green alien of a DJ deck, arms up and dancing wildly, fully generous and supportive. It felt special to see her watch her collaborators — her friends — shine on stage, all while partying harder than anyone else. It felt obvious that no one loves Pop 2 and everyone involved in it more than Charli. She's said she would pick “Track 10″ as one of her five songs to listen to if she was doomed to die in a desert, and it was a singular experience watching that love lived out in person.
On the day of her Pop 2 show in Los Angeles, Charli posted a photo next to a sign for the office supply store Staples with “Pop 2 at staples tonight. Ultimate success. (Obviously kidding – don't go to the wrong venue)” written as its caption. It's very sassy and thus very Charli, but also brings up a valid point. Why isn't a boundary-shattering artist like her headlining the Staples Center? How is it possible that she's still playing at small, taste-making venues like Elsewhere? It's OK though, because as with most visionaries, it takes time before the masses catch on. At one point whilst on stage, fluttering around in a fantastic, layered, lavender chiffon two-piece set, Charli set the record straight: “Pop 2 is the fucking future. And every fucking person on this stage is the fucking future. And you guys are the future, too.”

KARACHI - The Democrats clean-swept the Karachi Press Club elections for 2017 on Saturday.
According to results, The Democrats panel's candidate for president's office Siraj Ahmed secured 464 votes and won the election. His rival candidate from The Journalist panel Abid Hussain received 225 votes.
The Democrats panel's candidate for the office of general secretary Maqsood Ahmed Yousufi got 497 votes. The candidate for vice president's office from the same panel, Syed Minhaj-ul-Rab, received 425 votes.
Similarly, Moosa Kaleem won the election for the seat of the treasurer and Naimat Khan for the office of joint secretary.
All seven members of the governing body who won the election were from The Democrats panel.
In a related development, Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari extended his felicitations to the newly-elected office-bearers of the Karachi Press Club and hailed the members of Pakistan's oldest press club for upholding democratic transitions and commitment to the freedom of press.
In his congratulatory message to newly-elected President Siraj Ahmed and Secretary Maqsood Ahmed Yousufi, the PPP chairman said that Karachi Press Club had always been a harbinger of democratic norms and a hub of professional and working journalists since its inception. “I hope and I am confident that office-bearers and members of the Karachi Press Club will continue to follow the principles of their predecessors and play their role in strengthening democracy at the national level,” he said.
Separately, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari condemned the bomb blast in Istanbul late on Saturday night in which dozens of people celebrating New Year were killed.
“The terrorist attack on innocent people in the beginning of the year is a warning that the scourge of terrorism needs more concentrated and coordinated international cooperation,” he said. Terrorism is in fact a common threat to the world peace, he said.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari expressed sympathy with the people of Turkey, especially those who lost their loved ones in the barbaric bomb attack, and assured them that people of Pakistan stood in complete solidarity with them.
Chrissy Teigen isn't one to hold back when it comes to indulging in her favorite foods, so the model and her pal, stylist-turned-designer Andrea Lieberman, chose trendy Los Angeles eatery Jon & Vinny's as the venue for a dinner to launch A.L.C.'s new collection for Intermix, titled “On Duty.”
Stefanie Keenan / Getty Images for INTERMIX x A.L.C. Andrea Lieberman (Stefanie Keenan / Getty Images for INTERMIX x A.L.C.)
The 16-piece contemporary line, for which Teigen was the muse, includes Lieberman's takes on the classic white shirt, black trousers, tracksuit and other wardrobe staples, and ranges in price from $128 to $895 retail.
Lieberman started the collection with the track pant. “Since my days as a stylist, traveling around the world, I've wanted to find a pant that could take you from city to city, day to night. Pair it with a sneaker, pair it with a heel, it is equally cool and totally effortless,” she said. “My good friend Jen Atkin puts it best, ‘Life is hard, looking good should be easy.'”
The collection is available exclusively at the retailer's web site and brick-and-mortar boutiques. Guests, including Teigen's stylist Monica Rose, singer Kacy Hill and Justin Bieber's stylist Karla Welch, all got the dress code memo, arriving in white shirts and black pants.
Teigen wore a tie-front version of the white shirt with a pair of zip-front olive cargo pants, while her husband Jon Legend coordinated in a leaf-print bomber jacket. “I love how ‘On Duty' reflects the fact that, as women today, we're never truly ‘off duty,'” she wrote in an Instagram post hours before the event, which showed her being dressed by Lieberman. She called the collection “my absolute dream bicoastal closet.”

Said Lieberman, “At A.L.C. we've been long-time admirers of Chrissy — her confidence, style, incredible sense of humor and warmth represent everything we stand for. As a mother, wife, and entrepreneur, she embodies the On Duty woman. Simply, she's as real as it gets.”
Teigen told the crowd that she and Legend “eat here all the time,” a testament to their patience, as the shoebox-sized restaurant doesn't take reservations and usually has the crowd spilling out onto the sidewalk as they wait for tables. Other pasta and pizza lovers in the bunch included Atkin, Marianna Hewitt, Hillary Kerr and Jessica de Ruiter.
Teigen has been busy of late; in May she launched a face palette for Becca that works for women of all skin tones. The color cosmetics company said that it cold-called the model with the business pitch, telling her that she could have input in the shades and design of the product.

Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms is organizing the Pakistan's Development Summit and Expo on August 17 to celebrate Pakistan's development journey it has embarked upon over the last 70 years and the future plans in the light of Pakistan Vision 2025.
The conference will deliberate upon the policies responsible for growth in agricultural, industrial and services sector. The conference also aims to look at the reforms of the current government of Pakistan to overcome the shortcomings of the previous policy frameworks, particularly, the socio-economic initiatives undertaken the Pakistan Vision 2025 to whom the recent economic resurgence can be attributed, sources in the ministry said.
The objectives of the conference would be achieved by engaging different stakeholder from academia, media, government and leading industry players.
The stakeholder engagement is proposed to initiate a development discourse which stems from a positive outlook on the achievements of the past and nourishes from the efficient and effective policy framework of the present.
The resulting “Development Discourse” can rope in the development journey of Pakistan making it inclusive and sustainable.
Such a discourse is also much needed to dispel the negativity and atmosphere of despair which are a threat to the much-needed stability required for continuation of policies.
The proposed conference is structured in a way that it also serves as a platform to initiate a dialogue where ideas, thoughts and questions are expressed and tackled in an open environment to ensure a sustainable and inclusive development process in the country.
Moreover, the 70 years of Pakistan Development Expo will present a visual journey of decade-wise development timeline of key projects. Starting from 1947, the major development projects of each decade will be presented.

Abul Hasan replaces injured Mustafizur Rahman in Bangladesh squad for T20s against Afghanistan
Not a prolific international bowler himself, Abul's BPL 2017 stats have been the most impressive among those of the local bowlers.

Abul Hasan
What's the story?
Bangladesh have called up Abul Hasan as the replacement for Mustafizur Rahman in their squad for the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan in Dehradun. He is scheduled to arrive in India on June 1, the day Bangladesh play their only warm-up game of the tour.
The details
Mustafizur's availability was confirmed by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials confirmed on Monday, and back then they were yet to announce the replacement. According to BCB physician Debashish Chowdhury, Mustafizur suffered the injury during the recent Indian Premier League and would require at least two to three weeks to return to full fitness. "Mustafizur damaged the thumb on his left leg during IPL and would not be traveling with the team," Chowdhury stated.
The left-arm pacer's sudden withdrawal with time running out has left BCB extremely displeased, with the board believing that Mustafizur hadn't effectively communicated the severity of the injury sustained during his stint with Mumbai Indians at the Indian Premier League.
An X-Ray was conducted on Mustafizur's toe on Monday itself, with further tests conducted on Tuesday.
In case you didn't know...
Abul Hasan is not really popular in the international circuits. He last played for Bangladesh in an ODI in January during the tri-series that also involved Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. He has struggled for wickets since his international debut in 2012, taking only five in 14 matches across all formats, at an overall average of 144.60. He played the last of his four T20Is in 2012, a format in which he has just two wickets and an economy rate of 9.81.
In the 2017 Bangladesh Premier League(BPL) however, Abul was one of the better performers among the local fast bowlers, particularly impressing with his yorkers and slower balls in the death overs. He took 10 wickets at an average of 24.40 and ended the tournament with an economy rate of 8.13, which is understood to have been a factor in his recall.
What's next?
The Bangladesh team will travel to India on Tuesday to play the series against Afghanistan, scheduled at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium at Dehradun on June 3, 5 and 7.
Later this June, Bangladesh is bound to a tour to West Indies to play two Tests, three ODIs, and three T20Is. Mustafizur might be available by then, but as of now, nothing can be established with certainty.
Will Mustafizur Rahman join a long list of bowlers whose careers were hampered by injuries? Or will we see the "Fizz" of old soon? Let us know in the comments below.
Beyoncé has not posted a picture in the past couple weeks leading many to think she might of had the twins.
According to The Shade Room, a tip from an unknown source said
“My homegirl works at UCLA Hospital and she spilled some tea about my girl Queen Bey!
She told me that Beyoncé and her team showed up to the hospital and that they're in the process of shutting down the whole 5th floor. She also said that they're moving patients to another building”.
In addition, there was a post from hair guru Chuck Amos saying “Hang in there, mama! to Beyonce
EAGAN, Minn. -- There was an audible reaction inside the Minnesota Vikings' new indoor practice facility as Kirk Cousins' pass evaded All-Pro safety Harrison Smith's reach and connected with Adam Thielen, who has been seeing throws like these from his new quarterback for a couple of months now.
"The ball comes out of [Cousins'] hand differently," Thielen told me with a smile after Wednesday's OTA practice, the second open to reporters this spring. "Every quarterback has their strengths and weaknesses, and I'm not here to evaluate that, but all I can say is, the ball comes out of his hand differently.
"(Stefon) Diggs said it the other day -- the spiral he puts on it just makes it easy for us to catch. It just kind of pops out of his hand differently than you're used to, and you don't see that kind of stuff on film. You can only see that when you're out here practicing. It's been fun, and we have a lot of work to do."
Far greater tests await than a non-padded spring practice as Cousins tries to live up to the three-year, $84 million, fully guaranteed contract he signed with the Vikings in March, ramping up expectations for a team that reached the NFC Championship Game last season and the QB it's paying to lead it even further. Still, Thielen's words about Cousins are notable when you remember all the comparisons at his disposal. Just since Thielen cracked the active roster in 2014, the Vikings have started six quarterbacks: Matt Cassel, Teddy Bridgewater, Christian Ponder, Shaun Hill, Sam Bradford and Case Keenum.
The Vikings won a lot of games with Bridgewater and Keenum, and Bradford (when healthy) is regarded as one of the best pure passers around. Yet, from the moment Cousins got on the field here, everyone in the building seemed to take note of the way he throws. Smith told me he kept glancing over during Phase 2 of the offseason program, before the offense is allowed to go against the defense, to see Cousins dropping dimes on the other end of the field.
New offensive coordinator John DeFilippo said last week: "I knew he had a strong arm coming in. I didn't know he was able to drive it as well as he does. He has a very compact release. The ball just jumps off his hand because he has a short stroke back."
One of Cousins' former coaches once told me he also processes as well as any QB in the league, reacting to what he's seeing and getting the ball out without thinking. That trait probably contributed to high interception totals early in Cousins' career, but he'd learn from those mistakes and improve.
"That's the cool thing about him that you notice out here. You notice when his eyes get to you -- boom! -- it's out," Thielen said. "When you're running a route and all of a sudden he finds you and he puts his eyes on you, it's coming out. And that's a great feeling for a receiver. That's what you want, because you don't want to get too close to a safety, or you don't want the ball to be late, because that's when you get popped."
Again, this is all happening in OTAs. Nobody's getting popped -- not even Cousins when he's diving for the goal line, as he did during a red-zone period Wednesday. There's no pass rush. Frankly, an $84 million QB had better look good in this environment. It'll be a while before Cousins, 29, gets a chance to live up to that monster contract after six seasons (three as the starter) with a Redskins team that always seemed to be in some state of flux and never made him feel he was their guy.
For all the premature debate over whether he's "worth" the money, Cousins does have strong numbers -- 81 touchdown passes vs. 36 interceptions total from 2015 to 2017, and over 4,000 yards each season. Now he's on a Vikings team with one of the NFL's best defenses, a competent O-line and an established group of skill players, including Thielen, Diggs, tight end Kyle Rudolph and running backs Dalvin Cook and Latavius Murray.
"Each play helps build a confidence, helps build a rapport with the receivers, with the tight ends, continue to try to get on the same page with the centers, making the right protection calls," Cousins said Wednesday, speaking at the Vikings' "Team Up to Give Back" event at a local middle school. "It is a lot of new, a lot of chemistry that still has to be built, but every day we're out here, we take another step, and that's exciting to be a part of."
Coach Mike Zimmer echoed Wednesday that everything is still new to Cousins, from his teammates to his coaches to the installation of an offensive system that's getting a shakeup under DeFilippo. But when I spoke to Zimmer at his foundation's youth football camp a couple of weekends ago, even he used an answer to a question about Cousins establishing himself as a leader to mention his new QB's accuracy and ability to anticipate throws.
"Like a lot of times, leadership -- if you do your job really good, then you become a leader," Zimmer said, "and he's done it very well this spring."
Before the offseason program began, Cousins invited Thielen and Diggs to Atlanta, where Cousins' wife's family lives, for a few days of work, in addition to golf, watching basketball and just getting to know one another. I asked Cousins on Wednesday how much something like that can help, and before he could answer, Diggs -- quietly stationed behind a semi-circle of cameras -- yelled out: "I hope a lot!"
The balls that count won't be thrown for a few months yet. But for a team that has seemingly had someone different throwing it every few weeks for years, what the Vikings have seen so far from Cousins -- and the knowledge that, barring injury, he's the guy for at least the next three seasons -- is certainly encouraging.
"It just kind of gives you a little confidence when you're out there, just to go out there and play football," Thielen said. "You know you have a guy that has a great track record and has done some really great things in this league. So now we're just out here to help him take it to the next level, and hopefully, he can help us take our game to the next level as well.
"It takes a lot of time, though. There are a lot of repetitions that we need still in a short amount of time. But I think that's what's so great about OTAs. You get to come out here, you get to try some different things, and you get to go against the No. 1 defense every day."

MBTA and state transportation officials on Wednesday christened a new catamaran, a 150-passenger addition to the public transit agency's fleet of ferries.
The Glory, as they're calling the boat, was built by Gladding-Hearn Shipbuilding in Somerset, Mass. It's the second of two new ferries to go into service in the last year.
Gov. Charlie Baker's transportation chief Stephanie Pollack, and the MBTA's general manager, Luis Manuel Ramirez, boarded the boat, which was docked at Hewitt Cove in Hingham, a community south of Boston.
The Glory then zipped across Boston Harbor in less than 40 minutes, letting off its small band of passengers at Long Wharf, close to the city's Financial District.
The new ferry will serve Hingham, Hull and Logan International Airport in East Boston.
A similar vessel, dubbed Champion, was added to the fleet in October 2017.
Other high-speed ferries include the Lightning and the Flying Cloud.
"The Glory is named to honor the legacy of Master Shipbuilder Donald McKay's Glory of the Seas clipper, which set a record for the fastest day's run in twenty-four hours in 1854," the MBTA said in a release. "With the original Glory of the Seas designed in east Boston, the MBTA's new Glory honors this idea as the new ferry will service the same community."
Four days after suing former Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, accusing him of fraud, early Uber investor Benchmark told Uber employees why it resorted to legal action: Kalanick, it said, was getting in the way.
In an open letter sent to Uber employees and publicly shared on Twitter, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm — which also has a seat on Uber's board of directors — alleged that Kalanick had forced Benchmark's hand by undermining the Uber board's search for a new chief executive.
Citing Kalanick's ongoing day-to-day involvement with the company (despite his resignation as CEO a month ago) and what the venture capital firm called his failure to make good on a promise to modify Uber's voting agreement to ensure that “independent, diverse and well-qualified” directors could be appointed to the board, Benchmark said Kalanick had created uncertainty for everyone.
“It has appeared at times as if the search [for a CEO] was being manipulated to deter candidates and create a power vacuum in which Travis could return,” the letter said.
“A number of people have asked why we took legal action before giving Travis the chance to sign these amendments. The fact is that we did give him a chance. … We were asked to postpone any filing and assured that efforts would be made to get these changes made without a lawsuit,” the letter said. "We waited and waited, watching as things deteriorated even further. Eventually, we felt that we could no longer wait and took action."
Benchmark said the lawsuit also was intended to hasten the search for a chief financial officer and to bring about cultural change at the company.
Last week, a spokesperson for Kalanick described the lawsuit as “baseless” and “riddled with lies."
Benchmark filed its lawsuit against Kalanick last week, alleging that the Uber co-founder had defrauded investors by keeping unethical business practices secret. The lawsuit attempts to void the three board seats that the board of directors approved last year on Kalanick's insistence, a move that would effectively kick Kalanick off the board because he occupies one of those three seats. It also attempts to bar Kalanick from being involved in the day-to-day operations and decision-making of Uber and its board of directors.
In its open letter Monday, Benchmark reiterated that it believed Kalanick's ongoing presence at Uber was creating a governance and management crisis for the company.
“It's easy to reduce this situation to a battle of personalities,” it said. “But this isn't about Benchmark versus Travis. It's about ensuring that Uber can reach its full potential as a company. And that can only happen if we get rid of the roadblocks and distractions that have plagued Uber, and its board, for far too long."
Spokespeople for Uber and Kalanick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Benchmark declined to comment.

Her voting rights, however, remain locked in a dark crypt," Walker wrote in the ruling released Thursday. "Only the state has the key — but the state has swallowed it. Only when the state has digested and passed that key in the unforeseeable future, maybe in five years, maybe in 50 … does the state, in an 'act of mercy' unlock the former felon's voting rights from its hiding place."

LONDON
A huge blaze on Wednesday engulfed a 24-storey residential tower block in west London housing over 100 families, killing at least 12 people and injuring 74 others, with the police saying the death toll in the tragedy could rise further.
The fire at Grenfell Tower on the Lancaster West Estate in Latimer Road was reported at 01:16 (local time). About 600 people were believed to have been inside the tower's 120 flats, many of them asleep, when the blaze ripped through the building.
Firefighters rescued many people but there may still be people in the building who are unaccounted for.
Many people from neighbouring housing blocks have also been evacuated as a precaution and gathered at community centres, mosques, gurdwaras and churches in the area until the structural credibility of the burning tower is verified.
Forty people have been discharged from the six London hospitals treating them, said state-run National Health Service. Separately, the London Ambulance service said 18 of the injured still in hospitals were in critical care.
Vinod Diwakar, the Indian-origin medical director of NHS England's London region, whose team has been coordinating the medical response, urged Londoners to try and ease the pressure on the NHS as medical staff deal with the tragedy.
“The hospitals receiving patients continue to be busier than normal and we encourage Londoners to use NHS services wisely and turn first of all to sources of advice such as NHS 111 and local pharmacies,” he said.
The fire is thought to have started because of a faulty refrigerator on the 3rd or 4th floor of the building shortly after midnight and destroyed flat after flat. By noon, the building looked to be just smoking ruins but the fire again took hold, and cladding began to fall to the ground.
Some reports have suggested that the building's rain-screen cladding, installed as part of a 10-million-pound refurbishment work last year may have contributed to the speed with which the fire spread through the entire building.
Metropolitan police commander Stuart Cundy said the force do not expect to find any more survivors. “This is going to be a long and complex recovery operation and I do anticipate that the number of fatalities will sadly increase beyond those 12,” he said.
He said it was likely to be some time before the police could identify the victims and figure out the cause of the fire.
Steve Apter, director of safety and assurance at London fire brigade, said the inferno was “unprecedented in its scale and speed” and firefighters have now “searched almost all the building” and managed to get to the top-most floor.
“There are still pockets of fire yet to be extinguished in particularly difficult areas to reach,” he said, adding his officers will carry on their work on the site overnight.
London fire brigade chief Dany Cotton said: “This is an unprecedented incident. In my 29 years of being a firefighter, I have never ever seen anything of this scale.”
“Extensive cordons remain in place and a number of nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution,” Cundy said.
Eyewitnesses described people trapped in the burning tower, screaming for help and yelling for their children to be saved. They said they saw lights – thought to be mobile phones or torches – flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows – some holding children.
Some residents were seen using bedsheets to make their escape from the tower block.
“I'm lucky to be alive – and lots of people have not got out of the building I've lost everything I own. I'm standing here in everything I've got,” one survivor said.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said questions will need to be answered over the safety of such tower blocks.
“We can't have a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,” he said.
Fire commissioner Dany Cotton said firefighters expected to be on the scene for at least another 24 hours and she would not speculate about the cause of the blaze.
Prime Minister Theresa May is “deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life”, said Downing Street.
The area around Grenfell Tower is home to a large number of Muslims. Many were awake at the time the fire broke out having their early morning meal before beginning the daily fast for the holy month of Ramzan.

When it comes to our eyebrows, there are no limits to what we can do with them. We can make them better, we can make them worse, we can rub soap on them, or microblade them and now we can even turn them into very true to likfe feathers. Yes, the new brow trend has arrived, and it involves feathering...
When it comes to brows, we've seen everything. Straight, curved, too curved, thick as hell, so thin we can barely see them, McDonald's brow, scouse brow, TOWIE brow. All a big mistake, all shudder-inducing. But, it seems, there is still one brow we hadn't come across until now.
Brow beaters may well be confused right about now - yes, you have heard of feathered brows before; Kim Kardashian's makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic taught us that a feathered brow is much better than the "Instagram brow", the former taking away the boxy, heavily filled look of the latter and replacing it with a more natural, soft brow a la KKW.
But the #featherbrow is an entirely different beast. For starters, it looks like an actual feather. The look was created by Finnish makeup artist Stella Sironen and debuted on her Insta page last week. To create the look, she splits the hair of the arch down the middle with a glue stick and Anastasia Beverley Hills Dipbrow Pomade to create the illusion of a feather.
The new eyebrow trend.....feather brows 🤔 what are your thoughts? #featherbrows #newtrend #notsure A post shared by Holly (@baybrows) on Apr 18, 2017 at 2:11am PDT
Sironen credits her "muse" @leevittu who came up with the look whilst brushing her eyebrows. In a second Insta post, Sironen says that the look was only supposed to be a bit of fun and seems genuinely surprised at the attention her post has received: "note to self: when u make a joke about starting a funny brow trend people will take it seriously and.... well. start the trend." But despite the trend starting life as a bit of a laugh, it's already got plenty of beauty bloggers trying out the trend. The internet doesn't mess around!

LONDON-Argentina and Peru kick-started their final preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ with morale-boosting home wins on Tuesday, while Panama had to settle for a scoreless draw against the visiting Northern Ireland.
Lionel Messi warmed up for next month's FIFA World Cup with a hat-trick as he inspired Argentina to a morale-boosting 4-0 win over Haiti in a pre-tournament friendly in Buenos Aires.
Messi scored a quickfire second-half double (58th and 68th minutes) to add to a first-half (17th minute) penalty, before setting up substitute Sergio Aguero (69th) as Jorge Sampaoli's side hammered the Caribbean minnows in their final phase of preparations for the showpiece event.
With this hat-trick, the FC Barcelona talisman took his international tally to 64 goals in 124 appearances. The Albicelestes, who are two-time world champions, had struggled throughout the qualifying campaign but the thoroughly dominating display here should boost their confidence even though the win came against a side that has not qualified for the World Cup.
Haiti could not even register a shot at the goal in the whole match. It was a night of celebration for another Barcelona star as Javier Mascherano joined Javier Zanetti as Argentina's most capped player with 143 international appearances. “I have no doubt that we are going to grow, we have time, this team is going to take shape.We have been working hard on the physical, I think we have a nice opportunity to try again, we are going to be very excited, as always,” Messi said after the match.
Argentina play Iceland in Moscow in their first match of the World Cup on June 16.
Sampaoli was upbeat about his superstar No. 10, saying, “Messi is training very well, he finished the Spanish tournament and two days later he was here, he looks very enthusiastic”.
“Against Iceland we will have to take advantage of the domain, we need a high level of force in the World Cup.” Peru secured a confident 2-0 win over an inexperienced Scotland with goals either side of half-time in Lima.
Christian Cueva converted a spot-kick eight minutes before the break, while Jefferson Farfan added the second just after the resumption. There was a celebratory atmosphere in Panama City, but no goals for local fans to cheer.
Panama came closest to breaking the deadlock against Northern Ireland, but Edgar Joel Barcenas saw his first-half header come back off the crossbar.

Be aware there are spoilers for The End of the F***cking World series and comic.
In its final episode, The End of the F***ng World reaches a tipping point. The cumulative momentum of James (Alex Lawther) and Alyssa's (Jessica Barden) increasingly high-stakes crime spree and increasingly honest emotional intimacy careens off the rails; all their small decisions have added up and now everything has changed. In just under a half-hour, we watch their bravura Bonnie and Clyde adventure come to a fittingly ferocious end, the jazzy percussive score swinging with momentum, as all of the series narrative threads crash together in a violent, impassioned, and possibly tragic finale.
With the cops hot on their trail and Leslie (Barry Ward) utterly revealed a “fucking useless dad,” James and Alyssa burry the dead dog on the beach and share one last quiet moment of intimacy. They decide to run away. Take dad's boat and cross the channel. Start fresh. They're kids and they're in love, and they're out of options. When they go to take Leslie's keys, Alyssa finally confronts him, but he's not only unrepentant and manipulative, he secretly calls “999” for the reward. Alyssa opens up and confesses, while sympathetic officer Eunice (Gemma Whelan) sneaks toward the door outside, hearing every word. So do the cops on the line, and on instinct, James susses out Leslie's betrayal, confesses to all the crimes as his alone, insistening on Alyssa's innocence, and pulls a gun. That's when things get out of hand.
Alyssa stabs Leslie in the leg just as Eunice bursts in, telling the kids they have to turn themselves in so she can help them — especially James, who just turned 18. It's his birthday. “I would have bought you a present,” Alyssa says with equal love and indignation. Your heart breaks into a thousand pieces. Eunice tries to reason with them, convince them that they still have a home to go back to, but once Alyssa realizes they would be separated in juvenile detention, it's all over. She knocks Eunice out with the butt of the gun, demands the keys to the boat, grabs James' hand, and they run to the water. But the water isn't there — the tide is out and they're stranded.
Eunice's not-so-sympathetic partner Teri (Wunmi Mosaku) rolls in with a SWAT team and James realizes they're out of options. He tells Alyssa to say she was kidnapped, hits her in the head with the rifle, and runs down the beach. Gunshots send up sprays of sand at his feet as he sprints away, gun in hand, and Alyssa screams for him while Teri restrains her. “I've just turned 18,” James says in voice-over. “And I think I understand what people mean to each other.” A montage of his moments with Alyssa flashes by, a piercing shot rings out, and we get a brutal cut to black. It's the end of the fucking world.
The Netflix and Channel 4 series caught on like wildfire when it debuted last month, and fans have been debating James and Alyssa's fates ever since. With that in mind, I hopped on the phone with series creator Jonathan Entwistle to talk about what to make of the ending and the value he found in ambiguity. For those looking for a bit more resolved version of the ending, Entwistle pointed to the source material, Charles Forseman‘s comic of the same name, which ends pretty similarly, except for a coda that removes most of the doubt about what happens after that gunshot on the beach — Alyssa sits alone in her room, runs a nail through flame, and uses it to carve “James” into her arm.
Entwistle explained,
“For those have read the comic, the comic ends very definitively. And in fact, there's a prologue to the comic that we never shot, we never wrote, which makes it unambiguous if that makes sense. And I think for us, we wanted the opportunity to be able to continue the story, because when we were writing — We started writing the show four years ago and Netflix didn't really exist in the way that it exists back then, so when we were putting together the arc of the story and sticking very closely to the spine of the comic book, this made sense as a way to end it.”
He continued, explaining that because they wanted the opportunity to continue, the version of the finale we ultimately saw was a bit different than what they originally had on the page.
“Now, the ambiguity that we've got in the show is done in the edit, if that makes sense. It's a little bit different to what was in the script, and we gave ourselves some options with the ending of the show. And in the end, we just felt that this was a nice way to leave it open for everyone, and it lets people think to themselves, “What happened?”And what's really interesting for me is that I think I've read some amazing comments from people saying, “What happens to Alyssa?” And I think that that is actually a really key point for me, is that she's so front and center in the show. Even though in some ways the show kicks off with James, it is very much about Alyssa and how she unpacks everything. This show is about Alyssa trying to find her dad, essentially. And I think that she is the one that is kind of left at the end of the show more open; more ambiguous is what happens to Alyssa.
Entwistle also pointed out a detail you may have missed,
It was a good week for the stock markets as domestic investors remained cheerful on hopes that Gujarat's ruling BJP party will win the state election despite a tough fight from the Congress.

The RBI kept rates steady on expected lines, and there is a feeling that the central bank may also hold rates in February because of upside risks to inflation.
The rupee traded stronger despite a rise in the dollar index, closing the week below 64.50 against the greenback.
Going forward, the Indian currency's strength is unlikely to sustain and a rate hike by the U.S. Fed in its upcoming meeting could trigger selling pressure in Indian bond markets.
Global investors remained optimistic after the U.S. senate approved a tax overhaul, including corporate tax cuts which could lead to more profitability for companies, improve risk appetite and increase the inflow of overseas funds into U.S. stocks.
Meanwhile, the UK government finally struck a deal with the EU to move Brexit talks forward, ending months of negotiations. There won't be a "hard border" in Ireland while the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK will be protected.

A surge in the value of crypto-currencies had an impact on gold and silver.
Bitcoin touched levels above $19,000 this week as speculators rush to buy the crypto-currency due to fears of being left out of the rally.
They mostly funded these positions by liquidating their underperforming assets like gold and silver.
Bitcoin is well on its way to emulating the Tulip bubble of the 1630s. The times, the people and the subject matter may have changed but the underlying greed, euphoria, fear and eventual collapse will continue to be the hallmark of such speculation.

India's service sector contracted in November after two months of expansion due to deterioration in business performance due to the effects of GST.
In contrast, the manufacturing sector expanded in the same month at its fastest pace since October 2016.
The government also announced fresh incentives worth 84.5 billion rupees to boost exports and support the MSME and labour-intensive industries. The incentive came as a part of the mid-term review of India's Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020.
On the global macro data front, China's exports and imports unexpectedly accelerated last month, an encouraging sign for the world's second-biggest economy.
Exports in November rose 12.3 percent on a yearly basis, the fastest pace in eight months, led by strong sales of electronics and high-tech goods, while commodity purchases helped lift imports. Imports grew 17.7 percent in November.
In the U.S., a report by the commerce department showed trade deficit widening more than expected in October to $48.7 billion from a revised $44.9 billion in September.
The keenly watched U.S. jobs report for November was released on Friday, where headline non-farm payrolls number came in significantly better than expected, with 228,000 jobs added in November against a prior consensus forecast of around 200,000 jobs.
But wage growth turned out lower than expected. The FOMC starts its two-day meeting on interest rates on Tuesday. The Fed's policy outlook will be of critical importance for policy expectations into next year.
The coming week will be an extremely busy one for markets. The main focus is on the Gujarat election that is expected to give cues for the general election in 2019. The government will announce IIP data for October and retail inflation data on Tuesday. Wholesale inflation for November will be announced on Thursday.
The Nifty, which took support at the psychological support level of 10,000, will be volatile in the coming week.
At current levels, we seem close to an intermediate top which will be surpassed only if the BJP wins in Gujarat with a large majority. Election results can throw up surprises, so it is prudent to wait for the outcome, which will be announced on December 18, before investing further.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Vince Vaughn has joined the cast of the dramedy “Fighting With My Family” starring Florence Pugh, Nick Frost and Lena Headey, Variety reports.
Johnson, who announced the casting on his social media accounts, will also have a role in the film as well as produce along with his partner Dany Garcia through Seven Bucks Productions banner. Misher Films, WWE Studios and Film4 will also produce.
MGM recently acquired the worldwide rights to the film at the Berlin market.
The movie will be written and directed by Stephen Merchant (“The Office”) and is based on the true story of WWE star Paige and her family of professional wrestlers. The film, revolves around a reformed gangster and former wrestler, his wife and their children, who make a living performing in tiny venues across the country. The parents want a better life for their children, and when the siblings get the chance to audition for the WWE, it seems the family dream is coming true and all their troubles will be solved. However, the brother and sister are about to learn that becoming a WWE superstar demands more than they ever imagined possible.
Vaughn and Johnson had previously worked in the “Get Shorty” sequel, “Be Cool.”
Following his performance in the the Oscar-nominated “Hacksaw Ridge,” Vaughn has begun stepping outside his comfort zone of comedic roles that made him famous like “Wedding Crashers” and “Old School.” He just finished filming on the prison action film “Brawl in Cell Block 99” and the police brutality movie “Dragged Across Concrete” opposite his “Hacksaw Ridge” director Mel Gibson.
The Presidency confirmed in a statement on Monday night that President Cyril Ramaphosa has informed South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner Tom Moyane of his suspension with immediate effect pending the institution of disciplinary proceedings. By DAILY MAVERICK STAFF REPORTER.
President Ramaphosa said it was in the public interest to restore the credibility of SARS without delay, the Presidency statement said.
Late on Monday night the National Treasury issued a media statement to the effect that Mark Kingon had been appointed Acting Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.
In the earlier letter to Mr Moyane, President Ramaphosa said:
“Developments at the SARS under your leadership have resulted in a deterioration in public confidence in the institution and in public finances being compromised. For the sake of the country and the economy, this situation cannot be allowed to continue, or to worsen.”
Concern was raised in particular about the manner in which Moyane handled the matter of Jonas Makwakwa, his treatment of the report given to him by the Financial Intelligence Centre, and his failure to immediately report this to the Minister of Finance.
Another concern that was raised was the management of VAT refunds, which had brought SARS “into serious disrepute and potentially jeopardised the integrity of the SARS as collector of revenue and adversely affected tax morality among tax payers”, the Presidency said.
The decision to suspend Moyane follows a meeting in which President Ramaphosa informed Moyane that the president had lost confidence in his ability to lead SARS and offered him an opportunity to resign with immediate effect, which Mr Moyane had declined.
President Ramaphosa indicated that as SARS Commissioner, Moyane holds a high position of trust in the management of the country's public finances. It was therefore necessary to act urgently and immediately to protect the institution and place it on a path to stability and recovery.
Mark Kingon, who replaces Moyane in the interim, is currently Acting Chief Officer: Business and Individual Taxes with SARS. He has been at the revenue service since its establishment, Treasury said, and had worked his way through the ranks to become Group Executive: Relationship Management within Business and Individual Taxes.
Previously, Bloomberg reported that Moyane “will seek a legal interdict against Cyril Ramaphosa if the president does not stop trying to remove him from the tax agency”, quoting unnamed people “familiar with the matter”.
“Ramaphosa had been given until 9.30pm on Monday to respond to a letter from Moyane calling for him to back down,” Bloomberg quoted its sources as saying.
SARS spokesman Sandile Memela on Monday night confirmed that Moyane “has been suspended with immediate effect. Unfortunately, no further details can be provided at this stage."
"SARS has less than seven days to the end of the financial year 2018. The eyes of the 14 000 men women youth and people with disabilities will remain focused on reaching and even surpassing the the revenue target of R1.217-trillion. SARS is a solid, efficient and effective organisation that appreciates its mandate to collect the much-needed resources for the developmental agenda of the State." DM

Texans head coach Bill O'Brien says that due to lack of video on the sideline he was unaware of the seriousness of QB Tom Savage's injury. (0:56)
O'Brien 'would have never' let Savage back into game if he saw video (0:56)
HOUSTON -- Texans coach Bill O'Brien reiterated Monday that he did not really see the hit quarterback Tom Savage took when it happened but said if he had seen the video -- he cannot see it on the sideline -- he "would have never let [him] back in the game."
Savage took a hard hit from defensive end Elvis Dumervil in the Texans' loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. While he was lying on the ground, his hands appeared to be shaking involuntarily, but he was allowed back in the game for one series after being evaluated for a concussion. O'Brien said after the first "quick check," he told team trainer Geoff Kaplan he thought Savage needed to be evaluated again.
Editor's Picks Tom Savage concussion makes clear that NFL's protocol has major issues If the Texans QB could show potential symptoms one moment then be back behind center the next, the policy isn't good enough. Here's how to improve it.
With playoff hopes dashed, Texans' focus has to turn to 2018 Sunday's defeat guarantees the Texans a losing season for the first time under head coach Bill O'Brien.
Sources: Fiedorowicz's career may be cut short Texans tight end C.J. Fiedorowicz, who suffered at least his third concussion of the 2017 season last weekend against the Titans, could be forced to retire at age 26, sources told ESPN. 2 Related
"It wasn't anything that I particularly saw on the field, I just said, look, that was a quick check," O'Brien said Monday morning. "It was a three-and-out on that series. Let's continue to check him to make sure that the player, Tom Savage, is OK. They went, they checked him, they came to me, they were not satisfied with his answers to the questions that they were asking him, and they pulled him from the game."
On Monday, George Atallah, the assistant executive director of external affairs at the NFLPA, tweeted, "we are initiating a full review of the Tom Savage concussion from yesterday's game."
O'Brien was criticized after his postgame news conference for deflecting blame for the fact Savage stayed in the game. On Monday, he defended his comments, saying he's "not passing the buck" for what occurred.
"At no point in time in my coaching career [has] there anything more important to me than the safety of our players," O'Brien said. "I love our players, and I care about them. And I cannot stand when players get injured.
"Anybody that's been on the sideline of a football game knows that from a coaching standpoint, you really can't see things like that, especially when the ball is in certain areas of the field."
Savage is still in the concussion protocol, and O'Brien said he expects T.J. Yates to start at quarterback on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Yates was 14-of-26 for 175 yards and two touchdowns in relief of Savage on Sunday.
With the loss to the 49ers, the Texans fell to 4-9, ensuring their first losing season under O'Brien. He has one year remaining on the five-year contract he signed when he took over in Houston, and said despite the losses, he expects to be back next season. He also said his agent has not had a discussion with Texans owner Bob McNair about a contract extension and he has "no idea" whether that will happen after the season.
"I signed a five-year contract. I expect to be back here, but those decisions are not made by me," O'Brien said. "My job is to make sure that I coach these players. I really care about these players. I really care about how hard they're working and the effort that they're putting in. And we're not seeing the results on the field, so I really want to try to improve that over the next three weeks."
"I enjoy being the head coach of the Houston Texans. I have great relationships with these players here, and I'm going to continue to coach hard until they tell me I'm not coaching here anymore."

RIYADH:- Saudi Police announced to investigate an arson attack targeting on a woman's car in Mecca, Sabq online news reported on Tuesday. The car was burned at dawn on Sunday in one of Mecca's villages. A video on the social media showed that the car was burning with the sound of a woman's crying. The woman cried that a group of her male neighbours intentionally burned her car as the village was against the recent decision to allow women to drive. Saudi Arabia lifted a ban on women driving vehicles on June 24 after decades of restriction. On June 4, the country handed the first driving license to a woman.–Xinhua
Despite the ban, many women are expected to face some difficulties by the conservative members of the male-dominated society.
Good luck trying to cover starting wide receivers for the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2018.
Randy Moss and Terrell Owens are among the eight men who will be enshrined into football immortality this summer in Canton, Ohio. Ray Lewis, Brian Dawkins, Brian Urlacher, Bobby Beathard, Robert Brazile and Jerry Kramer were also named as the newest Pro Football Hall of Famers, as announced Saturday night at NFL Honors.
All eight men have such fantastic stories and roads to enshrinement, with particularly long waits for induction ending for Brazile and Kramer. Lewis, Dawkins and Urlacher are fitting teammates as some of the hardest-edged defenders of their era. But it's hard not to start telling the story of this class without noting that the two most electric, productive and headline-grabbing receivers of their era will head to Canton together.
Randy Moss never quite passed Jerry Rice as the greatest receiver of all time, but for many he was the most dominant ever at his very best. A league-changing talent from his first game with the Vikings, Moss was a vertical threat problem that virtually no defense could solve. He led the league in touchdowns with 17 as a rookie and wound up averaging 1,395 yards and 13 scores in his first six seasons. As a member of the Patriots, he and Tom Brady reset what was possible for a passing offense to achieve, with Moss scoring 23 times in 2007. Moss was on the first-team All-2000s squad as named by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, doing it with a magnetic style on and off that field that was impossible to ignore. Few players in NFL history were more fun to watch, which helps to explain Moss' enduring popularity with younger generations to this day. I can't wait until his speech.
Terrell Owens shouldn't have had to wait three tries to get his hall call, but that's unfortunately what happens when only five modern era candidates can make it every year. It was always only a matter of time before the voters recognized Owens' sustained brilliance in his stops with the San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys.
While he had his share of controversies over the years, no one ever questioned Owens' work ethic or excellence on the field. He was a first-team All-Pro five times, once more than Moss. Owens had memorable clutch moments in the playoffs with a game-winning touchdown for the 49ers and an epic 122-yard performance in the Super Bowl with Philadelphia, just seven weeks after breaking his leg and tearing ligaments in his ankle. Few receivers more consistently beat the man across from him snap after snap than Owens. It was time for Hall of Fame voters to love them some T.O.
Moss and Owens will be joined by three defenders who helped define the era they played in. Ray Lewis owned the mantle as the league's preeminent middle linebacker, bringing a ferocity in his tackling that was only matched by his versatility and intelligence. He was part of a new school of do-everything middle linebackers, like Urlacher, who excelled against the run and the pass. A rare player to win Defensive Player of the Year twice, Lewis also won Super Bowl MVP in 2000. Known as one of the great leaders of all time, Lewis maintained the Ravens' level of defensive excellence throughout the aughts. He was a first-team All Pro seven times, the type of number that made him a shoo-in first ballot Hall of Famer.
Like Owens and Moss entering the Hall together, it's great to see Urlacher and Lewis make it the same year. Another first-time nominee, Urlacher was Lewis' NFC counterpart as the best middle linebacker of the last decade. Showing rare speed and deep coverage ability for a linebacker, Urlacher's skills helped to popularize the Tampa-2 defense that spread across the league. But no other team could find a player quite like Urlacher, whose instincts and speed could erase big plays before they happened. He was both the Defensive Rookie of the Year (2000) and Defensive Player of the Year (2005) in a career that included five first-team All-Pro nods.
Perhaps the induction of Eagles great Brian Dawkins is a positive omen for Philadelphia's chances in Super Bowl LII. The hard-hitting safety was nominated in his second year of eligibility after after a 16-year career that included four first-team All-Pro nods. Dawkins had a knack for making big plays, recording 37 interceptions with 26 sacks and 36 career forced fumbles. He played an enforcer-style at the position, without sacrificing any range, that almost doesn't exist anymore.
Both senior finalists, Packers guard Jerry Kramer and Oilers linebacker Robert Brazile, have finally earned induction after careers that ended decades ago. Kramer was a finalist for induction eleven times and got into the Hall after helping to anchor the Lombardi-era Packers offensive line. One of the most colorful players of his era, Kramer was all-NFL five times and a member of the NFL's All-Decade team of the 1960s. You can't write the story of the NFL without Kramer. He opened up the hole that helped Bart Starr score the winning touchdown in the "Ice Bowl" and helped change the way NFL players were seen after writing a book "Instant Replay" with the late Dick Schaap. Kramer is finally headed to Canton, 45 years after he was first eligible.
Brazile is lesser known, but no less deserving. The Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1975 as the sixth overall pick, Brazile made first-team All Pro in five straight seasons (1976-1980.) He was a member of the 1970s All-Decade team and is the latest in a crop of recent worthy Hall of Famers that had brilliant peaks to their career without crazy longevity. As described by Chris Wesseling, Brazile was the league's first dominant 3-4 outside linebacker.
Former personnel boss Bobby Beathard was this year's Contributor Finalist and is now a Hall of Famer because of his excellent work across four decades with the Chiefs, Falcons, Dolphins, Redskins and Chargers. He is best known for his work with the Redskins, where he became Redskins general manager in 1978. Often using a method of trading away his first round picks, the Redskins Super Bowl XVII title included 27 free agents. Beathard led the Redskins to two Super Bowl titles. Throughout his career, his teams advanced to seven Super Bowls and won four of them.
Every Hall of Fame class is strong, but this is a particularly high-wattage group from top to bottom. The modern-era candidates were all major stars elected early in their eligibility. It sets up what should be a memorable weekend in Canton this summer, where eight more gold jackets will be given out to complete some of the greatest football careers of all time.
i am such a smashing pumpkins fan that i once bought tickets to his chicago area wrestling league event because he was scheduled to make an appearance. i waited in line with my siamese dream and zwan booklets in my backpack with a green sharpie. i rushed over to him when the doors opened and he was wearing a purple cape that went all the way to the ground. he happily signed the two albums and took a photo with me. i was happy and expected the rest of the night to be formulaic as i had already achieved the purpose for buying the tickets. a few minutes later i walked by the merch table where a family was in a conversation with billy. the dad had two brand-new copies of the deluxe reissue siamese dream and gish vinyls in their shrink wrap. he opened them and asked billy to sign them because his son was a fan. the kid couldn't have been more than 8 years old and for sure wasn't a fan. i stayed close to see if i could hear what billy would say. he took the records to sign them and said something about how this man was obviously a flipper and the albums would be on ebay before midnight tonight. the man assured him by saying “no, no these are for my son, right here, he is a big fan.” billy then looked at the dad and said “don't tell me this kid is my fan.” he bent over at the waste and said with a smile to the kid – “don't make me ask you to sing one of my songs.” after he finished signing both he walked away. aside from being memorable, i actually found the exchange i overheard to be endearing. somewhere in there is the grunge spirit, unwilling to let it pass by – he HAD to call the guy out on being a record flipper – but still signed them anyway so as not to be a dick. anyways i would happily welcome a new pumpkins record – pretty much everyone slept on the much better than average solo record from last year.

PANAJI
The Congress party on Wednesday gheraoed officials of the Captain of Ports (CoP) and later barged into the reception area of the Big Daddy (Maharaja) Casino, currently being operated by the Golden Globe Hotels Pvt Ltd over alleged encroachment and illegal occupation of the pavement adjacent to Dayanand Bandodkar road near the Old Secretariat.
The party leaders have given the casino operator and the government 48 hours to remove the barricade and clear the pavement failing which they have threatened to remove the encroachments by themselves.
The 50-odd Congress workers led by Panaji block committee president Prasad Amonkar called the marine engineer Octavio Rodrigues and technical superintendent Stephen Braganza of the Captain of Ports to the jetty wherein they exposed alleged illegal permanent structures which are being erected by the Big Daddy (Maharaja) Casino operator adjacent to the pavement.
The Congress workers exposed how the casino management was building toilets with provision for releasing sewage in river Mandovi. The proposed bathroom pipes were also laid in a way that the water from the bathroom would be discharged in the river directly. A structure was also seen being built for an ATM.
It was noticed that many private vehicles were parked on the pavement from the inside barricaded area. Shockingly, a meter for power connection with four-phase connection for Maharaja Casino reception center was installed on the barricade. Interestingly, there was a separate counter inside the reception center for taxis. There were around 50 boxes of tiles stored on the pavement by the casino operator to be used for flooring.
The Congressmen confronted the officials of the Captain of Ports at the jetty and asked how the casino operator has managed to encroach on the jetty and the pavement.
“If the pavement and the toilet block are not cleared in two days time then we will bring the machinery to get it removed,” warned Congress spokesperson Amarnath Panjikar.
They also demanded that the barricade erected on the pavement at the reception up to the building of the captain of ports be removed immediately clearing the pavement for use of general public. Earlier, the Congress workers gheraoed Octavio Rodrigues in his office and demanded an explanation over the illegalities. As they did not get satisfactory reply from him, they forced him to accompany them to the jetty for inspection.
“The barricades were erected some six years ago by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) for construction of the jetty. The second phase of the construction is likely to begin in next 30 days; hence, they have retained it. As far as the pavement is concerned, it falls in the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the City of Panaji,” an official of the Captain of Ports said.
The official admitted that the canopy erected by the casino was beyond the area demarcated for them as per the High Court order.

Alpena — Getting away with crime in Northeast Michigan just got a little more difficult thanks to two new additions to the Michigan State Police Alpena Post.
Trooper Jordan Romel, an Alpena native, and his police dog Zed are now on patrol and it is the first time in years the Alpena post has had an operating canine unit.
Romel said he has wanted to be a police officer who worked with canines since he was a child. After graduating from the academy he took a job in Sault Ste. Marie as a trooper and on his third attempt was accepted to the canine unit and went through 14 weeks of training with Zed.
“When I was in preschool a canine trooper came to my class and did a presentation. I never forgot that and it was what I always wanted to do since,” Romel said. “To be able to do this in my hometown makes it even more special.”
Romel said Zed will work in the five county area MSP covers in northeast Michigan. He said Zed is part of some type of investigation or search on almost a daily basis and thus far has performed well, despite his inexperience and brief time out training.
“For where we're at in our training he is doing really good,” he said. “I think he's doing excellent.”
Besides sniffing for narcotics and helping to apprehend suspects who may be trying to flee, Romel said Zed can be used to help track and locate people who may be lost in the woods. He said there is a long list of functions the dog can perform and many commands he responds to in order to successfully complete them.
“Of course he knows how to heal, sit, stay and he also knows what stop ‘em means,” Romel said. “He likes that one.”
Romel said because of Zed's training and job he is different than other dogs and people should not try to pet him when they are in public. He said the dog was exposed to only a small number of people during training and is still becoming acclimated to new people and crowds of people.
“He just turned two and is still going through a little fear stage,” Romel said. “Everything he is experiencing is new and a little scary to him. He is still being exposed to many things, so we are still working with him on that too.”
While off duty Zed stays at home with Romel and his other dog. He said there is already a bond between the two and he expects it to continue to strengthen as time passes.
“We've only been together five months, so our relationship and bond is still growing,” Romel said. “To see where we are now from when we were introduced until now it has been phenomenal. It is coming along really good.”

Police found almost 400 marijuana plants in an electrical fire at a Garden Grove commercial building Sunday night, authorities said. No one was injured.
Firefighters saw the plants when they put out the blaze at 13062 Century Blvd. around 11 p.m., said police Lt. Carl Whitney. Police then obtained a search warrant and found close to 400 mature marijuana plants that were being grown illegally.
“They're not the little small plants you would see, they had buds on them and they could be harvested to sell marijuana,” Whitney said.
The fire was mostly limited to one wall, and occurred because the building's tenants had jury-rigged the electrical circuit in the building to increase power to air conditioning and lights, said Garden Grove Fire Capt. Brad Spell.
“They had overloaded the electrical circuit by a lot and that's what caused the fire,” Spell said. “I'm surprised it lasted this long. … They took a very outdated electrical service and modified it significantly.”
The tenants have been leasing the space since 2013, Spell said.
Garden Grove police are trying to find out who was growing the plants, Whitney said.
There is about $100,000 worth of damage to the building, Spell said — it took time to get in because “the building was heavily fortified with security bars that the firefighters had to get through.”
It's common for growers to modify electrical panels to fuel the high intensity UV lights needed to grow the plants, Whitney said. The modifications cause fire hazards like this one.
“This marijuana grows are all over the county,” he said.
If people believe there's an illegal marijuana grow they should contact local police, Whitney said.

Trump labeling House health care bill 'mean' frustrates GOP

(AP) — President Donald Trump's labeling of a House-passed health care bill as "mean" is aggravating some of the conservatives he pressed to back it, even as Senate attempts to reshape the measure increasingly threaten to spill into July.
"In terms of strategery, I hope he's just trying to motivate the Senate," Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said Wednesday, employing a mangled word used by former President George W. Bush. "Because he put all sorts of pressure on us to move the bill we passed."
Congressional sources said Trump described the House bill as mean at a closed-door White House lunch Tuesday with 15 Republican senators. It was an extraordinary slap at a bill Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., guided through the House and that Trump himself had championed and praised. At a Rose Garden ceremony minutes after the bill's 217-213 House passage on May 4, Trump called it "a great plan."
"To call a bill that he pushed 'mean' leaves us scratching our heads," Brat said.
The president's criticism also came as Senate Republican leaders' attempts to write their own health care package have been slowed by disagreements between their party's conservatives and moderates. Trump said he wants the Senate version to be "more generous," the sources said.
GOP senators said Wednesday they remained divided over pivotal questions about dismantling and replacing chunks of former President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. These included disagreements over phasing out Medicaid expansion to additional low-income people, easing some of the law's coverage requirements and reshaping subsidies the statute provides to millions of individuals buying policies.
No. 2 Senate GOP leader, John Cornyn of Texas, called his chamber's passage of legislation by Congress' July 4 recess "a good goal" but urged patience.
"I'd say give us a little more time," Cornyn said. "The end of July by the latest."
That delay would be a setback to the GOP. Party leaders would rather avoid sending lawmakers home for an August recess with hostile town hall meetings that might erode support for an unfinished health care bill, and they want to leave more time for work on tax legislation.
Facing expected unanimous Democratic opposition, Republicans will be unable to pass a Senate bill if just three of the 52 GOP senators vote "no." Alienating any of them could make approving the measure trickier for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who's been hoping for a vote before Congress' July 4 recess.
Trump's comments were described by two GOP congressional sources who received accounts of Tuesday's White House lunch. They spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal a closed-door conversation.
One source said Trump called the House bill "mean, mean, mean" and said, "We need to be more generous, more kind." Another said Trump used a vulgar phrase to describe the House bill and told the senators, "We need to be more generous."
Two other congressional GOP officials confirmed that the general descriptions of Trump's words were accurate.
The sources say the president did not specify what aspects of the bill he was characterizing.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday evening, "We don't comment on rumors or private conversations."
In an embarrassing retreat, Ryan had to abruptly cancel a March vote on the House measure after a revolt by Republican conservatives and moderates that would have ensured its defeat.
The measure's final version reflected a compromise by conservative leader Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and centrist Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. They agreed to language letting states drop requirements for higher premiums under Obama's health care law to protect those with pre-existing medical conditions, and requiring insurers to cover specific services like maternity care.
Asked to comment on Trump's remarks about the House measure, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, "Congressional Republicans, with President Trump's support, are working to repeal and replace this terrible Obamacare law that is harming Americans."

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Sunday that a deal signed with Tehran to swap up to 60,000 barrels per day of crude produced from the northern Iraqi Kirkuk oilfield for Iranian oil is for one year and subject to renewal.

The agreement signed on Friday by the two OPEC countries provides for Iran to deliver to Iraq's southern ports, on the Gulf, “oil of the same characteristics and in the same quantities” as those it would receive from Kirkuk.
“This is an agreement for one year and then we will see after that whether to renew it,” Luaibi told reporters in Kuwait City on the sidelines of an Arab oil ministerial meeting.
The deal in effect allows Iraq to resume sales of Kirkuk crude, which have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the fields from the Kurds in October.
Between 30,000 and 60,000 bpd of Kirkuk crude will be delivered by tanker trucks to the border area of Kermanshah, where Iran has a refinery.
Luaibi also said that the construction of an oil pipeline from Kirkuk to the Turkish port of Ceyhan will take one year to build.
It will replace an old, badly damaged section of the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline. It will start from the nearby city of Baiji and run to the Fish-Khabur border area with Turkey.
The territory that the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline ran through was taken by Islamic State militants in 2014 and then recaptured by U.S.-backed Iraqi forces over the past two years.
The minister said he plans to visit Kirkuk oilfield on Thursday with a senior executive from BP to “activate” an agreement signed with the British oil company to help Baghdad halt a huge decline in output from Kirkuk and increase production to higher levels.
“We have a memorandum of understanding with BP to evaluate Kirkuk oilfield to raise output and enhance it reservoirs,” Luaibi said.
Iraq has asked BP to help increase output from Kirkuk oilfield to more than 700,000 barrels per day.
Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, still estimated to contain around 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP.
BP has provided technical assistance in the past to the Iraqi state-owned North Oil Company to aid the redevelopment of the Kirkuk field.
It's not every day that one gets to experience a solar eclipse. On the morning of August 21st, there will be rare one. While partial solar eclipses happen roughly every 12 to 18 months, this will be the first time a total eclipse will be visible in the U.S. since 1979. What is a solar eclipse? It is when the moon positions itself between our own Earth and the sun. Due to Los Angeles being further south, Angelenos will only get to experience around 70% of the sun being blocked compared to those in the northern states. Experience this rare occurrence on August 21st at these locations.

The City of Saskatoon wants to hear from people living in condos and apartments on how to divert waste from the landfill.
The goal of diverting 70 per cent of Saskatoon's garage waste by 2023 was set by the city.
City officials said six per cent of Saskatoon's trash comes from multi-unit residential buildings, which is estimated at 8,600 tonnes annually.
They added 61 per cent of this waste, primarily food and recyclable materials, could be diverted through programs, policies and participation.
“Approximately 34 per cent of housing in Saskatoon is multi-unit residential,” Brenda Wallace, the city's director of environmental and corporate initiatives, said in a press release.
“To extend the life of our landfill, it is critical to add multi-unit organics collection, review current waste services, look for innovative diversion ideas from our residents, and develop a sustainable funding model for waste.”
Wallace said the cost of closing the existing landfill and establishing a new one is estimated at $126 million.
Property managers and people living in multi-unit buildings are invited to participate in a series of engagement activities this month as part of the city's ongoing “Saskatoon Talks Trash” campaign.
The project aims to identify barriers and ideas for organics collection programs, improving recycling services, and other ways to divert garage.
Public engagement events start Sunday and conclude on June 15. Online surveys will be open between June 3 and June 22.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" will not be James Gunn's Marvel Cinematic University swan song. The filmmaker has announced he will be returning to write and direct "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3."
"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula – and some of the other forthcoming heroes – goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine," Gunn wrote in a Facebook post. "I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit."
The filmmaker also explained the role this third "Guardians" film will play in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it will take place after the events of "Avengers: Infinity War."
In addition to concluding the story of the current Guardians team, the third installment will help set up the adventures of "both old and new Marvel characters" for the next 10 years of the MCU and beyond. Gunn will be working closely with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige to craft the story.
The announcement comes in advance of the release of "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2." Gunn, who is preparing to set off on the film's U.S. press tour, explained he wanted to share the news directly with fans.
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" hits theaters May 5.
Read Gunn's full announcement below.
Even though digital is on the upswing, physical is still performing relatively well on a global basis — if not in the U.S. market, where CD sales were down 18.5 percent last year. But things are about to get worse here, if some of the noise coming out of the big boxes comes to fruition.
Sources say that Target has demanded to music suppliers that it wants to be sold on what amounts to a consignment basis. Currently, Target takes the inventory risk by agreeing to pay for any goods it is shipped within 60 days. With consignment, the inventory risk shifts back to the labels.
According to those sources, Target gave the ultimatum to both music and video suppliers in the fourth quarter of last year that it wants to switch to scanned-based trading, with a target date of 2/1. But while it is proceeding to push DVD vendors to switch to scan-based trading terms (i.e. the chain would pay for DVDs after they are sold or scanned while being rung up at the register), it has moved the deadline back to music suppliers to either 4/1 or 5/1. So far, music manufacturers are not sure what they are going to do, but sources within the various camps say that at least one major is leaning no, while the other two majors are undecided.
If the majors don't play ball and give in to the new sale terms, it could considerably hasten the phase down of the CD format.
Target has greatly reduced its music presence over the years. Once upon a time carried as many as 800 music titles, and nowadays seems to carry less than 100 titles in most stores. Yet, it can still be a powerful force on big titles. For example, the chain moved over 500,000 CDs of Taylor Swift's Reputation album.
Music manufacturers suggest they are waiting to see what happens with DVDs. If the studios don't give into Target's demands, will Target pull DVDs from the store? Depending on how that plays out will likely influence what happens in music, sources suggest.
But in even bigger news than whether Target switches to buying on consignment terms, Best Buy has just told music suppliers that it will pull CDs from its stores come 7/1. At one point, Best Buy was the most power music merchandiser in the U.S., but nowadays its a shadow of its former self, with a reduced and shoddy offering of CDs. Sources suggest that the company's CD business is nowadays only generating about $40 million annually. While it says it's planning to pull out CDs, Best Buy will continue to carry vinyl for the next two years, keeping a commitment it made to vendors. The vinyl will now be merchandised with the turntables, sources suggest.

John Lewis was a speaker at the 17th annual Leadership Conference Friday night at Troy University. (Source: WSFA 12 News)
Georgia Congressman John "Robert" Lewis received a standing ovation inside Sartain Hall during the 17th annual leadership conference Friday night.
"I am delighted and honored to be here," said Lewis.
As the Pike County native and Civil Rights legend took to the podium, he wasted no time giving honor to those who inspired him.
"Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks inspired me to get in trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble," Lewis said.
Recalling his more than 40 arrests, physical attacks, and serious injuries in the 60's during the Civil Rights Movement-- he saw it as a call that couldn't go unanswered.
"When you see something that is not right and not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation to stand up," he said.
But in order to be an agent of change, you must approach leadership differently.
"Leaders must be a headlight not a tail light," he said.
Saturday at 2 p.m. at the Troy Public Library, The city will be honoring Lewis with the unveiling of a historic maker and portrait.

PESHAWAR - Local administration on Sunday launched a weeklong cleanliness drive aimed at keeping the city clean as well as educating its dwellers to cooperate with the sanitation workers.
The drive, titled “Guluna Pekhawar”, or Floral Peshawar, is aimed to bring back old glory of Peshawar, which once was called a city of flowers.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Finance Minister Muzaffar Said along with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Water and Sanitation Services, Peshawar Engineer Khan Zeb, member of the provincial assembly Shaukat Yousufzai and other citizens formally kicked off the campaign. The dignitaries as well as sanitation workers took part in cleaning the Ashraf Road to mark launching of the campaign. During the campaign, waste and garbage dumped along the roadside would be removed in collaboration with city district government, municipal administration of four town councils and Peshawar Development Authority (PDA). Non-government organisations, including Al-Khidmat Foundation, Sabawoon, Tameer-e-Millat Foundation, Sarhad Rural Support Program (SRSP) and Muslim Hands would also take part in the drive through educating residents of the city about importance of cleanliness.
The basic aim of the campaign is to make Peshawar the real city of flowers, Muzaffar Said explained while talking to media persons. Quoting a saying of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), “Cleanliness is half the faith”, the finance minister elaborated as to how much our religion emphasised the importance of cleanliness.
On the occasion, the minister said that additional sanitation staff would be deputed in the city while such drives would also be launched in other cities of the province, adding that the PTI-led coalition government in province was committed to restore old glory of Peshawar, once known for its beauty and cleanliness.
Shaukat Yousufzai said it was the responsibility of the government to provide clean and neat environment to citizens. Peshawar, provincial capital of the KP, he said, had constantly been ignoring for the last 70 years. However, the PTI government was now focusing on its beatification and cleanliness.
He said changing attitudes and dumping waste properly was the most important measure to keep the city clean. “We should bring a positive change in our attitudes and should stop dumping waste in streets and throwing them into nullahs, he said.
The PTI government has already banned use of plastic bags, he said, adding that legislation would be made in this connection after taking all stakeholders on broad. “We have already taken into confidence traders involved in plastic bags business and factories manufacturing the same,” he informed, adding that after the passage of the law, the KP Environment Protection Agency would be able to take action against those found involved in sale and production of plastic bags.
Engineer Khan Zeb Khan said on the occasion, “We are committed to provide clean environment to residents of the city by utilising all the available resources”. The WSSP is evolving a plan how to educate people, Implement the law and get the desired results. For this purpose, he said, they would need support of religious figures, students, welfare organisations, civic bodies, government and international bodies, he concluded.
Coffee Meets Bagel scored a $12 million Series B this week. The round, led by U.K. VC firm Atami Capital, brings the popular dating app's total up to just under $20 million since launching back in 2012.
The San Francisco-based dating app has worked to distinguish itself from competitors like Bumble and Tinder by limiting the number of matches it offers during a 24-hour window. Late last year, it expanded its offering with a video feature, to add an extra dimension to profiles. This month, it introduced additional CMB Experiences to bring users together in the real world.
Of course, Coffee Meets Bagel is battling a juggernaut in the form of the billion-dollar Match Group, which currently owns OkCupid, Tinder, PlentyofFish and Match, among others. According to the company, this latest round will drive investments into more CMB Experiences along with international expansion for the service, along with other “product innovation.”
Co-CEO Arum Kang also notes that the Series B brings a number of VC firms with “prominent female investors,” including Gingerbread Capital. “We're excited about the next phase of Coffee Meets Bagel, and are pleased to have some wonderful international and female investors on board,” Kang says in a release tied to the news. “Given our focus on female experience, it was very important that we have a female perspective at the investor level.”
There was a ceremony at the Iowa State Fair this morning to unveil a newly-formed 255-pound bell created to honor Iowa veterans and those currently serving in the military.
The “Spirit of Iowa Tribute Bell” was made this weekend by a mobile foundry on the fairgrounds. Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs director Jodi Tymeson stood near the bell, which is mounted on a trailer and pulled by a Jeep.
“One of the most asked questions is: ‘Where is the bell going to be?'” Tymeson said. “…The bell will travel on this trailer across this state to communities that will ask to have it to honor their veterans.”
Tymeson's been getting requests, before the bell was even made. The process started this past weekend, as the nation's only “foundry on wheels” set out from the Iowa Speedway in Newton with a motorcycle escort by the “Patriot Guard Riders.”
“Saturday, Gold Star and military survivor families along with other Iowans placed bronze ingots into the foundry for melting to form the bell,” Tymeson said. “The bell was cast and hundreds of Iowans watched the pouring ceremony.”
On Sunday, the mold around the bell was broken by fairgoers, then the bell was hidden from the public as it was polished for today's unveiling.
Governor Kim Reynolds was at the head of a long “rope line” of people who got to ring the bell for the first time. Reynolds said the bell will keep the spirit of Iowa veterans alive as it travels the state in the decades to come.
“Not only is this bell stunning to behold, the meaning behind it is even more significant,” Reynolds said.
After a few teams of bell-ringers had their turn, Iowa National Guard Adjutant General Timothy Orr got a turn by himself. As the clapper struck the bronze, the peal Orr produced was the loudest of the day. Orr told Radio Iowa it was an honor to represent all veterans from all services.
“When you ring that thing, you ring it with a sense of purpose and heart knowing that there are soldiers, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard — all service members behind that,” Orr said.
Orr said “a part of my soul” is in the bell. He threw a bronze coin into the melting pot that was used to produce the liquid metal poured into the bell's mold. The now-finished two-foot-tall bell was the lead-off entry in today's Veterans parade on the Iowa State Fair's Grand Concourse.

One is surprised that so far Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has failed to forge a consensus on the KBD while the PM of India, Narendra Modi, has stated that he would deprive Pakistan of its last drop of water.
Our PM stoically ignores the writing on the wall that says Pakistan would meet a sad end without ensuring a stable water supply for its people.
He has managed to get 2/3rds of the majority to become the Prime Minster for the third time with the help of ANP and JUI, he promised to build KBD but has gone back on his promise as Mr Shahi Sayed, the President of the ANP, went on record to say that his party had agreement with PML(N) to make KPK and not to make KBD.
Nawaz Sharif has thus betrayed Pakistan by his reluctance to take steps to have a consensus regarding the KBD which remains to be a source of disagreement to this day.

Afghanistan: Slamming the terrorism in Pakistan, Ashraf Ghani who is the President of Afghanistan went on to say that the center of Taliban terrorism is in Pakistan. Blaming it for a wave of massive deadly attacks that have ravaged his nation recently and accusing Islamabad of harboring the Taliban.
While addressing the people in a television speech, Ashraf Ghani insisted the “center of Taliban terrorism is in Pakistan” and demanded that authorities in the neighboring country “show some concrete action to rid their territory of insurgents.”
Ghani, flanked by Afghanistan's top Islamic clerics, also urged those among the Taliban who wanted to talk peace with the government to separate themselves from those who want only to fight.
On Wednesday, Afghan officials visited Pakistan with what they describe as evidence of Taliban attacks emanating from militant training centers in Pakistan. Afghanistan's Intelligence Chief Masoom Stanikzai and Interior Minister Wais Ahmed Barmak presented documentation and confessions from arrested insurgents claiming to have been trained in Islamic seminaries in Pakistan.
“The Afghan nation is waiting for clear action” from Pakistan, said Ghani, adding that so far Afghanistan got only promises of cooperation from Islamabad. Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua along with senior military and security officials will travel to Kabul on Saturday with Islamabad's response, after reviewing the Afghan documents.
Kabul and Islamabad have repeatedly traded accusations that the other is harboring enemy insurgents.
The United States has also criticized Pakistan for providing sanctuaries for the Taliban, who are fighting U.S. troops in Afghanistan. President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of “lies and deceit” and demanded Pakistan evicts Taliban insurgents, particularly the Haqqani network from Pakistani safe havens. The U.S. has suspended military assistance to Pakistan to back its demands.
Pakistan has denied providing sanctuaries to militants. On Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it stands with Afghanistan “in fighting the menace of terrorism.”
The ministry's statement noted that Pakistan has erected 975 security posts along the porous border with Afghanistan, while Kabul set up only 218. It called for more border security from Kabul, saying insurgents in Afghanistan have carried out 417 attacks in Pakistan in 2017.
Meanwhile, Ghani said he has ordered a wide-reaching review of Kabul's security following massive deadly attacks in recent weeks that have left killed nearly 200 and wounded hundreds more.
“The Kabul people are demanding that we make a serious review of our security arrangements,” he said.
Since the Parkland, Fla., shooting on Feb. 14, thousands of students across America have begun to find their voices. I've found mine, too. I had struggled with depression and felt like I didn't know who I was or who I wanted to be. This year I helped organize the walkout at my high school and the middle schools in my town in Massachusetts. About 2,000 Lexington students walked out (on March 15 — March 14 was a snow day), and then 20 of us walked a mile through the snow to rally on the historic Battle Green where the American Revolutionary War began in 1775.
I am left to wonder if irony is being used as a randomized trial for facilitating the evaluation of the impact of some Caribbean development agencies and governments with a mandate for poverty reduction and supporting entrepreneurship.
The incredible comedy of errors: existing businesses— usually small and medium sized consultants or service providers delivers services to development agencies; government departments or international development projects being implemented by one or more of the two aforementioned players. Contracts are issued with penalties for delivering services late. Services are delivered on time and within budget however, the service providers go for months at a time without compensation. At times there is no sign-on payment, yet SMEs are expected to thrive and grow while allocating operations time and cost without compensation for four or more months at a time.
In 2017 alone, several consultants and service providers across the region suffered the woes of not getting that cheque for valuable services they provided. One lost office space rented because the rent could not be paid. Others earned bad credit reports and or could not access loans. Relationships suffered as a result of consultants working 60-hour work weeks in order to deliver outputs —accepted and used without pay leaving them unable to finance their portion of household bills. Others have lost friends as a result of defaulting on loans they intended to pay with monies earned but not received while development agencies and government departments sit on their monies. Your SMEs should not be called upon to fund development at that level. One consultant even had her car seized while hundreds of dollars US was owing to her.
It is mind blowing to think the leaders of such organizations are not aware of the relationship between cash, the survival and growth of businesses. How can so many of these entities continue to receive awards and recognition when it is clear that they have lost pieces of their missions and forgotten the scripts of their purpose? I hope those failures are not born of a disregard for their own and a culture void of service. IBM, left this message with me many years ago as a student member of the UWI-IBM Leadership Quality Circle, “You can't spell Quality without “I”.
How do we allow hypocrisy and disregard of our own to retard economic growth and development?
How do we pay lip service when the Region faces a threat to its development and there is a marked absence of high performing businesses in the region as well as in its diaspora markets? The high performing businesses to which I refer employ 100 or more (individuals) and make close to or more than US $500,000.00 per annum. I use those benchmarks because we are talking earnings, employment creation, growth and competitiveness globally. But I need not go that far you can use your own Caribbean benchmarks. The Region is old enough to have delivered dozens of Golden Krusts (a Caribbean food chain based in New York). Of course, the agencies have made significant contributions, it is just a pity they create with one hand and destroy with the other.
It is ironic that the staff of the very development agencies receive pension, health insurance and all kinds of benefits while the service providers must foot their own cost. Staff in those agencies look forward to their monthly cheque in order to pay their bills. How can entrepreneurs grow businesses when they are incurring debt, paying additional cost on credit cards and utility bills, are unable to take advantage of sales or bulk purchases or to pay for their health care? In some agencies leadership were content to go home with their Christmas bonuses while service providers where not paid. But more than that they did not feel any obligation to say when service providers would be paid.
It is high time that Caribbean consultants and service providers make it clear that they operate businesses and manage operations against cash flow. Do not cower in the hope of getting another contract. Write those letters to those agencies and government departments; then engage the services of a lawyer if necessary.
It cannot be business as usual when the very entities charged with poverty reduction and facilitating the growth of businesses are creating poverty, strangling existing businesses and wiping out any chance for some entrepreneurs to attain financial wellbeing and economic security. Consultants should not have to name and shame entities in order to collect!
How many employees of those agencies can go for two months without their salaries? How then do they expect consultants and service providers who operate on a feast and famine cycle to survive? Overdue— is the need for additional indicators and penalties for agencies who feel it is within their power and ethical practices to so wilfully create poverty and kill businesses already in the growth phase or exiting the start-up phase, while claiming to support start-ups and other poverty alleviation initiatives.
Black history month is the perfect time to rewrite that plot or change the actors; respect and support your Caribbean and Black SMEs or get out of business. Acting should be left for the theatres.
New York Mets starting pitcher Matt Harvey will be examined by doctors Thursday for what manager Terry Collins called a "tired arm."
Harvey came out of Wednesday night's game against the Chicago Cubs after pitching a season-low four innings. He allowed four runs on four hits, including back-to-back home runs to start the game, and averaged a career-low in fastball velocity.
"We're going to have Matt looked at just as a precaution," Collins said. "He'll go see the doctor. Again, like anything else, when someone is just abnormal. It would be one thing if Matt was 91-92 [miles per hour], but it's another thing when he's 89."
"The last time I threw 87 on a fastball was freshman year of high school," Matt Harvey said after four innings Wednesday, a season-low. Esa/Getty Images
Harvey underwent surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome in July of 2016.
Wednesday night, he said he was "fatigued" and "tired" and the most concerned he'd been since the surgery.
"It's pretty frustrating," Harvey said. "My arm was not working at all."
"I looked up a few times and saw 86, 87 on the fastball. ... The last time I threw 87 on a fastball was freshman year of high school."
After five years, 62 episodes and 3 zillion overwrought thinkpieces, HBO's “Girls” came to an end Sunday night. (Spoilers ahead.)
The finale of Lena Dunham's brainchild left us in upstate New York, where a pregnant Hannah Horvath had moved to take a teaching job at a local college. Five months after the birth of her son, however, she has yet to start the new gig and is struggling to adapt to motherhood -- and breastfeeding — even with the aid of Marnie (Allison Williams), who has uprooted her life to be by Hannah's side.
A few days before the finale aired, we spoke to Dunham and showrunner Jenni Konner, who co-wrote and directed the finale. Dunham, who spends most of her time in New York, was planning to watch the episode with her parents, Williams, and pizza. Konner, who lives in L.A., was unsure of her plans, but was considering asking executive producer and fellow Angeleno Judd Apatow to watch with her.
Many viewers thought the penultimate episode felt like a finale. Was that intentional?
Jenni Konner: Judd came up with the idea that we would do the finale and then a finale. We had too much to say. We had to wrap up the finale of the girls and find out where they wind up and that in fact they're not all going to be friends, and it's going to be OK. But we also spent the whole season with Hannah being pregnant, so we're not going to deprive you of seeing the baby and seeing what she's like as a mom.
In a way, it felt like Andrew Rannells' character Elijah was Hannah's best friend this season. Did you consider him moving with Hannah instead of Marnie?
Konner: Elijah has been one of her closest friends, but we wanted him to succeed on his own. I think we leave Elijah in a really positive place as evidenced by the fact that everyone wants the Elijah spinoff.
Is that happening?
Konner: I mean, talk to HBO. We'll do it in a heartbeat. But the thing about Marnie is that it has always been important to her to be the most important [person] in Hannah's life. It's a competition. When I was directing her, I was saying to her, “This is like you just won the Olympics. It's all you've been waiting for, for everyone else to drop out and you're the last man standing.” But then you see the episode and you think, thank God Marnie was there. She took care of the baby when Hannah was flipping out. I don't think she's going to stay there forever. But she needed to be there for a while.

Jenni, you directed this episode. Lena, did she offer you practical advice about breastfeeding and other aspects of new motherhood?
Lena Dunham: Both her and Judd were huge for me, because I haven't had a baby. The only experience I've had is all of the crazy stuff I've been through with my reproductive organs. I tried to draw a little bit on my experience of losing control of my body and reproductive system, but obviously, that's a really different experience because it also doesn't involve the joy and intensity of a newborn. It just involves your vagina hurting a lot.
Lena, did the acting experience make you contemplate your own feelings about motherhood?
Dunham: It's interesting -- I've always known I wanted to be a mother. Like, literally there are pictures of me breastfeeding stuffed animals as a child. It's always just been about the timing. I definitely felt pretty at home in that pregnant belly. I'm not going to lie.
I was totally anticipating a dramatic labor scene.
Dunham: We purposefully didn't do it. You have the opportunity to see a lot of women screaming their heads off on television about to give birth. We wanted it to be about the actual aftermath of what it feels like once you've given birth and who are you then. No one needs to see more of me screaming and sweating than they've already seen.
Hannah was also fully naked for the last time.
Konner: We can't end the show with Lena with pants. You've got to start the way you finish, in some ways.
Dunham: You are not getting away from this without full nudity. We choreographed that pretty carefully. Jenni was like, “This is Hannah now.” And we painted little stretch marks on my sides.
We really wanted the body to tell the story of what she's been through. I'm wearing prosthetic lactation nipples, which I forgot to take off one night when I got home, which was alarming for everybody involved.
Did your boyfriend [musician Jack Antonoff] freak out?
Dunham: He was not with me that week, but I was sending him pictures. He was a little disoriented by the pregnant belly. It's weird to see your partner, whose body you know, like that. Not to be a gender essentialist, but for me, putting on the stomach and holding the baby got me into a mindset. And I feel like for dudes, it's like the child needs to be in their lap for them to process what's going on. I was like, “Don't you feel warm looking at me in this belly?” He was like, “You look like you're wearing a belly.” It sort of tickled and amused him. There's something very primal about being a woman with a pregnant stomach.

Was the final breastfeeding scene meant to represent the idea that finally, after all these years, Hannah is able to take care of someone other than herself?
Dunham: Completely. It's definitely not a pro-breastfeeding screed, it's more about what that represents. That's a huge, huge, huge emotional moment for her. I think that was part of how she needed to evolve. Everybody was so quick with the show to demand a political statement. People know what our politics are around reproduction. That's not what we were doing here. One of the extras was like, “I feel worried that this is too prescriptive about breastfeeding.” And we were like, “We don't have an opinion about whether you should breastfeed or not. This is just about Hannah and her weird journey.”
What about Hannah's teaching job? There's been a lot of chatter about how unrealistic it seemed for her to get such a good job offer.
Konner: It is so funny to me that people are so upset about that. I'm like, first of all, anyone can get a job teaching an Internet class for 10 minutes at Bard.
Um, can they?
Konner: I think so. Teaching how to write for the Internet? I do. She's not on the tenure track. But that's also a great example of: Who cares? It's a show.

Even though the show finished filming months ago, there are still plenty of tabloid stories chronicling your weight, Lena. Why do you think people love to talk about your body so much?
Dunham: My body, to me, just feels like this incredibly changeable thing I use as a tool in my work. I don't have a super ego-driven association with the shape of my body. So when other people seem delighted by my weight loss, often I consider it to be a projection. I look at it and go, “Oh, that's your projection because what you're thinking about every day is a desire to change your body.”
Konner: She's literally the sexiest person she knows. She feels like Rihanna all the time. She also has a slight disconnection to her body in that she'll shoot a sex scene and then come out to the monitor to watch it almost naked. We've all been putting robes on her in between takes because she just wasn't thinking about it, but it's distracting to everybody when you're wearing a tiny bikini and everyone else is in work boots and jeans.
Dunham: It's funny to say as a person who gets naked on TV a lot “I'm sick of attention about my body,” but it was impossible for people to imagine that my nudity was a creative choice. And of course I was trying to change the way that women were looked at and what we thought was an acceptable body on television. But also, it was supposed to be naturalism, the way that ‘70s film dealt with sex and bodies. It was often about serving the scene with as much honesty and passion I could, it wasn't always about Lena jamming a “normal” body down people's throats. I guess my mantra for myself this year has been, in some way, of course my work will always be inherently political. But depoliticizing some of it and reminding some people that it's art.

Diageo Reseve brand Talisker Whisky has teamed up with The Birmingham Whisky Club and artist Luke Jerram to create a lunar-themed brand experience.
The event will be held on 5 August at the ThinkTank Birmingham Science Museum, and will showcase six different whiskies from the Talisker range during a tasting led by Diageo Reserve whisky ambassador, Colin Dunn.
Guests will be invited to gather around the museum's moon installation, which is a fusion of lunar imagery, moonlight and surround sound musical compositions created by award-winning composer Dan Jones. The installation has been created by artist Luke Jerram, and uses detailed imagery from NASA of the lunar surface to form a realistic representation of the moon.
The luxury tasting experience forms part of Jerram's ‘Museum Of The Moon' tour.
Colin Dunn, whisky ambassador at Diageo Reserve, said: "We are really excited to be working with The Birmingham Whisky Club to present this fantastic line up of whiskies in such an exceptional setting. Talisker is the only Single Malt Whisky on the shores of the Isle of Skye, one of the most remote, yet beautiful landscapes in Scotland. I hope that presenting these whiskies alongside the moon will evoke the tidal and rugged landscape of where they're produced and take the audience on a journey to Scotland as they taste through the selection."
More: Diageo Reserve announced a newly formed global cocktailian role this week, which has been filled by mixologist Lauren Mote. Earlier this month, Ardberg staged a sea-themed event featuring storytelling and whisky tastings.

Randall Margraves, father of Lauren and Madison Margraves is detained after trying to attack Larry Nassar Friday, Feb. 2, 2018, in Eaton County Circuit Court during the second day of victim impact statements in Judge Janet Cunninghams courtroom in Charlotte, Mich. The incident came during the third and final sentencing hearing for Nassar on sexual abuse charges. The charges in this case focus on his work with Twistars, an elite Michigan gymnastics club. (Matthew Dae Smith /Lansing State Journal via AP)
CHARLOTTE, Mich. (AP)  A distraught father seething over sexual abuse suffered by three daughters tried to attack former sports doctor Larry Nassar in a Michigan courtroom Friday after a judge rejected his request to confront the demon in a locked room, a stunning rush that reflected the anguish felt by parents who trusted him with their children.
Randall Margraves was blocked by an attorney, tackled by sheriffs deputies and hauled out of court. He later apologized, saying he had lost control. Eaton County Judge Janice Cunningham said there was no way she would fine him or send him to jail under her contempt-of-court powers.
I dont know what it would be like to stand there as a father and know that three of your girls were injured physically and emotionally by somebody sitting in a courtroom. I cant imagine that, the judge said.
Nonetheless, she added, it is not acceptable that we combat assault with assault.

 Endangered missing report issued for Michigan teenager.
I cannot tolerate or condone vigilantism or any other type of action that basically comes down to an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, Cunningham said.
The incident occurred during the third and final sentencing hearing for Nassar, who has admitted to sexually assaulting girls under the guise of medical treatment. This case focuses on his work at Twistars, an elite gymnastics club southwest of Lansing. It follows a hearing last week where Nassar, 54, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for assaults at Michigan State University and his home.
Nassar pleaded guilty to molesting nine victims in Eaton and Ingham counties, but the courts have been open to anyone who says she was assaulted during Nassars decades of work at Michigan State, Twistars and USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians. More than 200 accusers so far have spoken or submitted statements in the two counties, and at least 80 percent have agreed to be publicly identified.
Margraves dramatic move occurred after he listened to two of his daughters speak in court for 10 minutes. Lauren Margraves, a college student, said her parents were filled with regret because they took three daughters to see Nassar for sports injuries.
I see the look in their faces and I know they want to be able to do something but they cant, she told Nassar. The guilt they have will never go away. All this is because of you.
Her father then stepped up and asked the judge if she would grant him five minutes in a locked room with this demon. Cunningham declined and also turned down his request for one minute. That is when Randall Margraves rushed toward Nassar.
There were gasps and tears in the courtroom. Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis turned to the gallery and told families to use your words, not violence.
This is letting him have this power over us, she said. We cannot behave like this.
During a return to court, Margraves told the judge that he just snapped. He said he had not known what exactly his daughters were going to say about their abuse.
I look over here and Larry Nassars shaking his head, no, like it didnt happen. ... Im embarrassed, Margraves said of his conduct. Im not here to upstage my daughters. Im here to help them heal.
About 30 more people spoke in person, by video or had statements read after the incident. The case will end Monday with final remarks from the prosecutor, defense and Nassar, followed by the judges sentence. Nassar faces a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison in this case.
Outside court, Melissa Alexander Vigogne, who traveled from France to speak, said she was surprised that an attack had not been attempted earlier.
Its not that thats how we should respond. But its truly understandable  the amount of pain that weve all gone through, Vigogne said of Margraves actions.
Sheriff Tom Reich said his officers will investigate what happened in court and send a report to the local prosecutor.
The judge started the day by addressing comments made by a Nassar lawyer who said she had doubts about the large number of women and girls who say they were assaulted by Nassar. Cunningham called Shannon Smiths remarks unfortunate and said Nassar did not authorize them.
Smith told Detroit radio station WWJ that it is really unfortunate if some people stepped forward only because of all the recent attention. Nassar released a statement saying Smiths comments were a distraction and that his accusers remarks have pierced my soul.
Many of Nassars accusers have blamed Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for not doing earlier to stop him. The USOC announced Friday that it hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation. And the coordinator of the womens national team for USA Gymnastics, Valeri Liukin, said he was stepping down.
Nassar soon will be under three prison sentences. His first, 60 years in a federal prison, was ordered in December for child pornography crimes.

PanARMENIAN.Net - FX has released its first extended trailer for Ryan Murphy's anthology series "Feud", AceShowbiz said. The trailer gives a deeper understanding of the rivalry between Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) during the filming of their 1962 movie "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?".
The footage opens with legendary actress Olivia de Havilland, who is portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones, telling the press, "For over half a century, they hated each other and we loved them for it." Havilland adds, "They only ever made one film together, 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' "
The video also features a deeper look at Director Robert Aldrich, who is played by Alfred Molina, as well as Warner Bros. Television's president Jack Warner, who is portrayed by Stanley Tucci. The trailer then offers a glimpse of Judy Davis, who portrays Hedda Hopper on the series.
"You want me to work with them again? Never! Never Again!" says Warner to Aldrich of pairing the two divas in a movie together. Later in the video, Warner tells Davis, "You're naked rancor. I love it! I want more!"
The extended trailer concludes with Havilland calmly saying, "Feuds are never about hate." The legendary actress adds, "Feuds are about pain."
"Feud" premieres on Sunday, March 5 on FX.
LAHORE - It is often said that one incident should be enough for authorities to take action. In July a lady who went to Hunza valley for site seeing was harassed by some boys. At that time she had no medium to launch a complaint against them so she took their pictures and started a social media campaign against them. Within no time the post went viral.
When the campaign came to the notice of Assistant Commissioner Hunza, Mr Anas Goraya he initiated immediate action and set up a helpline to deal with such cases.
While it is the State's responsibility to provide security to the people of Pakistan, as a representative of the government, AC Anas Goraya took it upon himself to deal with such situations.
Speaking to The Nation he said, “I took this initiative after the July incident. If an incident takes place people should have a medium to report and get help from. The aim of this helpline is to provide a safe and secure environment for people especially women coming to these areas.”
He said that the landline helpline number of AC Hunza 05813 921704 is available from 9AM to 4PM. However the cell phone number 0355 5550203 and email assistantcommissioner.hunza@gmail.com are available round the clock.
The system has been set up for both for locals and visitors to report any case of mistreatment, harassment, or quality of food/overcharging in hotels.
He said that all efforts will be made to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of any crime.
Hunza Valley in Gilit-Baltistan has a population of about 50,000 people with rich traditions and culture.
He added, “Hunza valley is a very safe place. People here are very particular in following their traditions and they give women a lot of respect. Women here can be seen running their own businesses and working in shops also. So when this incident with the lady visitor happened and the locals came to know about it, they were disturbed and asked me to do something about it; and this is the result of it.”
AC Anas also messaged Meenah Tariq to inform her of the Helpline in Hunza and she expressed her happiness on Facebook by stating, “I cried when I saw this message. I feel so immensely happy that this step in the right direction was taken, and that this gentleman was thoughtful enough to share with me that my story in some way contributed to positive change. I am extremely grateful.”
Meenah also spoke about the reaction she faced from people when she spoke about the harassment, “I felt doubly violated because of the horrible comments and hate mail that I started getting. It got so bad that I un-subscribed from my own post so I wouldn't read any more. As the post got more attention, it filtered into my offline life - my parents and parents in law were questioned about the ‘nature' of my experience. Everywhere I went, people brought this up. Some in sly, strange ways, but many with love and support.
My husband kept stating ‘you've got nothing to worry about, this is the right thing to do'. He had to repeat it many, many times before I started to believe it.”
As tourism in Pakistan has been very adversely affected by terrorism, the efforts at local and GB level, have shown an increase especially in the past three years.
Locals and foreigners have started to visit the Northern Areas to explore the beauty of Pakistan and the KKH. There are comfortable hotels and rooms available for tourists which being maintained under the supervision of AC Goraya.
“We also make sure the hotel rooms and guest houses are neat and clean with toilets and other facilities; the kitchen is properly equipped and the food is of good quality, fire safety is also taken care of. The room rents have to be of reasonable rates and if anyone has any complaints they can contact us.”
About the incident earlier, he said that it will be resolved as soon as possible.
Separate Hotels and tourist spots have been earmarked for foreigners so they do not face any issues, he said.
Especially with the construction of China Pakistan Economic Corridor a lot of foreigners have to visit the area and their safety and security are important, he added.
“The people of Hunza are very careful about their reputation as such they want to provide a safe environment to foreigners. As per law all foreigners are required to report to the AC office daily.”
According to AC about 4,500 foreigners and a hundred and fifty thousand local tourists visited Hunza last year.
Garbage is another major concern for the people of Hunza. They have been complaints of locals littering the place, according to Anas Goraya, “The local people hardly have much garbage, as they don't use non-biodegradable stuff. But tourists generate a lot of garbage so we have hired a team of 12 people to clean and dispose the litter; we plan to start using replace manual garbage collecting with proper machinery soon.”

Built in 2007, the contemporary-style house has more than 6,400 square feet of finished space that includes a movie theater with a bar, an office, six bedrooms and five bathrooms. There are three fireplaces including ones in the family room and master suite.
Four thousand horsepower is quite a lot to manage even for the most serious drivers on the planet. And every time a drag racer climbs into the cockpit, he or she knows there's a risk at hand. The circumstances were no different with this Chevrolet C7 Corvette dragster, which encountered a nasty accident on the dragstrip.
During runs at Tulsa Raceway Park, driver Daniel Pharris caught air while rocketing down the track. Not the good kind of air, either.
CHECK OUT: Anatomy of a record-setting Top Fuel run
As you watch the video you'll see that the twin-turbocharged Corvette lifts off the ground nose end first and looks to be on the verge of a backflip before the weight of the car brings it crashing back down to Earth in the opposite lane. It makes the overzealous wheelie performed by the car in the other lane look like child's play. Thankfully, despite the horrific looking scene, the other driver is able to stop (due to a poor run caused by that wheelie) before a real problem occurs, and Pharris climbs out of the Corvette unharmed.

The Corvette, on the other hand? Not so much. The impact slams the front clip into the ground and spreads pieces of shrapnel that were once performance parts all across the track.
The video not only captures the accident from the starting line, but goes on to show the mishap from farther on down the track, and from inside the cockpit, too.
As you can imagine, race day was over for the 4,000-hp Corvette. But, knowing how gearheads operate, the Corvette will likely be back on the track before we know it for a proper pass down the dragstrip, this time with perhaps better aerodynamics to prevent it from catching any unwanted air.

In “Marlon,” comedian Marlon Wayans plays Marlon Wayne, a social-media savvy celebrity just famous enough to get recognized occasionally. Each episode of the multi-camera sitcom starts with Marlon directly addressing his followers in a jokey video that introduces them to his family and friends. That flourish of digital media has a way of making the sitcom feel even more dated, but although in most ways “Marlon” is a run-of-the-mill family sitcom, what makes it interesting is that Marlon is trying to co-parent his children while navigating an amicable divorce with his ex-wife Ashley (Essence Atkins). That reinterpretation of the foundation of the family sitcom — a long-suffering marriage — makes “Marlon” a refreshing take on family dynamics.
Everything else about it feels pretty standard: Wayans is a scene-stealing presence, apt to get loud and gesture wildly in his eagerness to poke fun at himself. His performance is kind of a parody of the righteously disgruntled patriarch, because his family mostly ignores him; Ashley is self-sufficient (and in the first episode, going on a date with the very handsome Boris Kedjoe), his bookish daughter Marley (Notlim Taylor) is already a teenager, and little Zachery (Amir O'Neil) has his father's resilient attitude in spades. But as the first few episodes indicate, Marlon needs them for his own sense of home, and even though his marriage with Ashley is over, he still wants to feel like he is a part of their lives. Most of the show is spent watching Wayans have a feeling, while the family members around him patiently wait for him to get through it. Then they find their way to an ending where everyone's briefly on the same page, with sitcom-ready hugs in front of the couch.
It's notable that NBC is launching another black family comedy just a couple months after “The Carmichael Show” was canceled. Both are multi-cams about black families centered on the male comedian at the center; NBC launched “The Carmichael Show” in a similar three-week August run in 2015. Otherwise, “Marlon” is a very different show, without any of the hot-button conversations of the previous show. Indeed “Marlon” swings in the other direction: It might be too inoffensive. Wayans' performance is so outsized that it's impossible to take him seriously; it's like his character absorbs conflict, taking discord out of commission the way a bodyguard takes a stray bullet. “Marlon” is a steadfastly more comforting show — but it is less interesting, too.

After one week with a new chief executive, Mattel Inc. is already stepping into new territory — partnering with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to design products for China and announcing its first male American Girl doll.
The El Segundo toy maker said Tuesday it will sell items through Tmall.com, Alibaba's sprawling online marketplace. Mattel will also work with the Chinese tech giant's artificial intelligence lab to develop “innovative products” to nurture childhood development.
It's the first public move by Margo Georgiadis, a former Google executive who took over as CEO last Wednesday. In another splash, Mattel announced it will add a boy character for the first time to its American Girl line of dolls and accessories.
In a Tuesday statement, she said China presents a big opportunity for Mattel.
"The multibillion-dollar toy category in China is highly fragmented, with tremendous potential for growth,” she said. “Working with Alibaba, we see a terrific opportunity to develop and lead the category."
Partnering with Alibaba offers insights into the Chinese market that Mattel would otherwise not have, analysts said. The company will also be making this aggressive push into China just a year after the country ended its one-child policy.
“Obviously the potential in China is huge,” said Gerrick Johnson, equity research analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “Just the sheer number of children in China you can address.”
Georgiadis is coming in at a crucial time of turnaround. The company has been overhauling its culture, which has been mired in recent years in red tape, and reviving sales at core brands including Barbie and Fisher-Price. The hiring of a leader with Silicon Valley experience is a sign the toy maker is making a big play for technology as the future of the toy industry.
Many analysts said that Mattel is heading in the right direction, but has suffered some bumps along the way. After a lackluster holiday season, the company reported in January that its fourth-quarter sales and profit missed estimates. That is in contrast to rival Hasbro, which beat expectations.
“From a strategic standpoint, everything they are doing is the right thing,” Johnson said. “The product is so much better. The culture is so much better.”
However, Mattel was probably hampered during the holiday season, dealing with retailers that were less eager to heavily stock its products after years of unimaginative offerings. The company probably had to pony up extra money to get better placement at stores.
“Mattel was coming from a position of weakness versus Hasbro, which has been performing well for the last three years," Johnson added. “They have to do more to convince retailers to take their product.”
The loss of the doll licenses to Disney's blockbuster film “Frozen" and its princess properties to rival Hasbro last year has also dealt the company a big blow. Analysts said those brought in more than $300 million a year for Mattel, and their absence left a major void.
“The toy-making business, particularly now more than ever, is about hitching your wagon to the biggest name out there,” said Jason Moser, a toy analyst at the Motley Fool. “Disney is the brightest star out there.”
Mattel has focused on rolling out new products that speak to a more diverse audience. Last year, Barbie got a whole lineup of new dolls with new body shapes, skin tones and eye colors.
On Tuesday, the company said it is launching its first-ever boy character, a drummer named Logan Everett, under its American Girl brand.
Industry watchers were skeptical that one new doll would make any difference to the bottom line. But it does add to Mattel's reputation as a company actively trying to embrace a wider swath of kids and parents.
“It's not going to be a needle mover,” Moser said. “Perhaps they felt that introducing a boy to the mix could open up that market,” which is almost exclusively female.
As a toy novice, Georgiadis is expected to bring changes to Mattel (the new toy, however, was likely in development well before the new CEO was chosen).
But her initial appointment, followed by the report of Mattel's poor holiday season, added to the uncertainty about the company's immediate future, analysts said.
Some experts think that she could bring a badly needed fresh perspective to an industry already grappling with huge changes in the way children play.
“At this point in the game, Mattel was in need of a total outsider," Moser said. “Number one, she is female, but also a female in tech. I think you are hitting a really tremendous one-two punch there.”

The Opp Ministerial Association will continue to sponsor baccalaureate services at Opp High School, according to Opp City Schools Superintendent Michael Smithart.
Smithart said Opp City Schools will "follow the Constitution of the United States to the letter of the law."
This announcement comes after The Freedom From Religion Foundation asked Opp City Schools to stop allowing prayer at graduation ceremonies.
The group wrote a letter in which they stated that "Opp City Schools has a legal duty to remain neutral toward religion."
In response, The Foundation for Moral Law spoke out in support of Opp City Schools.
The school district's attorney is currently researching the issues, according to Smithart.

Complaints were filed on behalf of state Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) with the secretary of state, attorney general and local district attorneys, all seeking an investigation of the recall campaign being waged by Newman's opponents.
The complaint alleges that voter signatures are being gathered for a recall election by promoting a repeal of the upcoming increase in California's gas tax. Newman voted for the transportation plan, which is why a political campaign partly funded by the California Republican Party seeks to remove him from office before his four-year term ends in 2020.
But the political fate of Newman, a freshman lawmaker narrowly elected last November, will have no bearing on a hike in fuel taxes or the creation of a new vehicle registration fee — both features of a $52-billion transportation plan signed into law in April.
"The campaign literature, materials and other messaging clearly demonstrate an effort to persuade voters to sign a petition based on false and misleading information regarding the content of the petition," wrote Richard Rios, Newman's attorney, in the complaint.
Supporters of the recall effort have regularly posted photos on social media showing signatures gathered alongside large "Stop the car tax" signs. Some of the photos also include Carl DeMaio, a former San Diego councilman and current radio talk show host who is one of the chief supporters of the recall.
Chris Lattner, one of the key creators behind the Apple programming language Swift, is on the move again. After a short six-month stay at Tesla, which he joined last year from Apple to act as VP of Autopilot Software, Lattner announced on Twitter today that his next stop is Google Brain.
Lattner, who worked for more than a decade on low-level software and systems at Apple, revealed in June that he wasn't going to be staying on at Tesla after finding that it wasn't “a good fit.” Lattner then joked that his resume was “easy to find online,” and noted his top qualification: Seven years of Swift experience, which is the longest anyone not on his immediate team at Apple can reasonably claim without outright lying.
I'm super excited to join Google Brain next week: AI can't democratize itself (yet?) so I'll help make it more accessible to everyone! — Chris Lattner (@clattner_llvm) August 14, 2017
Swift isn't Lattner's only major contribution to the world of programming: Prior to his helping hand with Apple's latest coding language, he created the Land compiler and LLVM. In other words, you'd be hard-pressed to find a modern developer whose work hasn't been touched at a fundamental level by something Lattner has created in the past.
Google Brain is the search giant's team focused on deep learning and artificial intelligence. It focused on helping to use AI across a range of products, tackling both research and product integration, working together with teams across Alphabet, including at DeepMind. Its ultimate stated motivation is to advance the field with open source projects, academic collaboration and publication.
WASHINGTON-Scientists have taken the first photographs of a worrying new crack in one of Greenland's largest glaciers.
The rift was spotted while researchers were examining satellite data from the Petermann glacier.
The crack is raising concerns that part of the floating ice shelf could break off into the ocean.
The images were captures by scientists with the Nasa field campaign Operation IceBridge.
The glacier moves toward the sea along the northwestern coast of Greenland, terminating in a huge floating ice tongue. Researchers are keeping a close eye on it they believe it holds back a foot of potential sea level rise from the Greenland ice sheet. Like other glaciers that end in the ocean, it periodically calves icebergs.
A massive iceberg, or ice island, broke off of the Petermann Glacier in 2010. Nearly two years later, another chunk of ice broke free. Another crack has been found stretching towards the center of Petermann's ice shelf, according to the Washington Post.
Last week, Stef Lhermitte, a researcher at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said a second new crack is appearing in the middle of the ice shelf.
‘As far as I understand, the island might not break off until later this summer or even next summer,' he told MailOnline. ‘As this part of the ice shelf is already floating the break-off of the island will not affect sea level rise (i.e.floating ice and water have exactly the same volume). ‘But understanding the glacier response on the longer term is important as it holds back a large amount of ice from the Greenland ice sheet.'
If it continues to grow, it could join up with the initial crack and cross the entire ice shelf. There may be still be hope for the shelf, according to Nasa.
A ‘medial flowline' in the ice could have a ‘stagnating effect' on the newer rift, helping to slow its advance, scientists with Operation IceBridge said on Facebook.
Lhermitte said a possible cause for the crack might be ‘ocean forcing,' a phenomenon that happens when warm ocean waters melt the ice from underneath.
In its in-depth report, the Washington Post asked several researchers if the crack could cause a larger break in the ice shelf.
Andreas Muenchow, a University of Delaware oceanographer who studies Petermann, told the Post: ‘This could be a big deal that may lead to a third break-up, but it probably will not happen until later this summer.'
Jason Box, a professor with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland said it could lead to an ice island around 50 to 70 miles in size.
Earlier this month, it was revealed that Greenland's glaciers and ice caps have passed a ‘tipping point' and are no longer able to regrow lost ice.
The proverbial ‘tipping point' was passed in 1997, when coastal meltwater was filled to its capacity.
Researchers predict that the subsequent melting of Greenland's coastal ice will raise global sea levels by about 1.5 inches by 2100.
The problem lies in a layer of snow called the firn, which lies between fresh surface snow and the ice.
Normally, meltwater drains through gaps in the firn down to the ice surface.
But when the firn became saturated in 1997, it froze through.
Since then, there haven't been any gaps to capture meltwater, and the ice hasn't been able to grow.
They found that, for the last 20 years, mass loss has been exactly equal to the amount of meltwater runoff lost to sea, with a frozen firn the most likely cause.
The study was conducted by researchers at Ohio State University, who looked at the glaciers and ice caps that dot the edges of the Greenland coast.
Twenty years ago, the island passed a tipping point, meaning the smallest glaciers and ice caps on the coast are no longer able to regrow lost ice.
The findings reveal exactly why the most vulnerable parts of Greenland ice are melting so quickly – the deep snow layer that normally captures coastal melt-water was filled to capacity in 1997.
That layer of snow and melt-water has since frozen solid, meaning all new melt-water flows over it and out to sea.
Fortunately, the findings only apply to a fairly small amount of ice along the coast, and not the Greenland Ice Sheet – the second biggest ice cache in the world.
Dr Ian Howat, who lead the study, said: ‘These peripheral glaciers and ice caps can be thought of as colonies of ice that are in rapid decline, many of which will likely disappear in the near future.
‘In that sense, you could say that they're ‘doomed.'
‘However, the ice sheet itself is still not ‘doomed' in the same way. The vast interior ice sheet is more climatologically isolated than the surrounding glaciers and ice caps.
‘Also, since this ‘tipping point' was reached in the late 90's before warming really took off, it indicates that these peripheral glaciers are very sensitive and, potentially, ephemeral relative to the timescales of response of the ice sheet.'
If Greenland's coastal ice melted at once, global sea levels would rise a few inches.
In comparison, if the whole Greenland Ice Sheet melted at once, sea levels would rise by seven metres.
The problem lies in a layer of snow called the firn, which lies between fresh surface snow and the ice.
Normally, meltwater drains through gaps in the firn down to the ice surface.
But when the firn became saturated in 1997, it froze through.
Since then, there haven't been any gaps to capture meltwater, and the ice hasn't been able to grow.
They found that, for the last 20 years, mass loss has been exactly equal to the amount of meltwater runoff lost to sea, with a frozen firn the most likely cause.
The researchers have warned that the Greenland Ice Sheet is subject to the same danger, though to a lesser degree that the edge ice.

Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Chad Kuhl explains what he'd be doing if he wasn't a baseball player
A US study suggests that children in daycare may not always learn about sun protection or UV protection as teachers are more concerned with their lessons on healthy food habits, brushing teeth and regular exercise.
Usually, in the month of July, kids are more vulnerable to harmful UV rays. Researchers, therefore, surveyed 202 administrators in this period in collaboration with managers and teachers of daycare centres in Illinois.
After the survey, the researchers found that most of the participants teach the toddlers about health regime, exercise and food choices and not about the harmful effects of the sun rays, the need to wear bike helmets or the necessity of vaccination.
Lead author June Robinson from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Robinson of Medicine in Chicago states that sun's seasonal shift in Illinois is the reason why sun safety receives little attention.
According to the reports in JAMA Dermatology, the daycare programs did provide sunscreen for all kids, but nearly 77% of these programs refused to allow kids use sunscreen themselves.
It may be possible that nursery schools are strictly following the state regulation which does not allow kids to apply sunscreen on themselves without doctor's prescription and that only school nurses can apply sunscreen on kids with a prescription when required.
"Daycare centres aren't bound by these regulations, but it might still influence their decisions," said Robinson.
Half of the people use spray sunscreens to protect the kids from the harmful rays of the sun.
However, there lies a possibility that head start programs may prefer to spray sunscreen compared to daycare centres. Spraying sunscreen on kids might go wrong if not sprayed properly on their faces. It might affect their eyes or they might end up inhaling it. These programs did not inform the kids about sunburns and UV rays or of the guidelines to keep children safe from the harmful sun rays.

Stocks fell sharply in morning trading Friday, putting the market on track for its worst week in two years, as several large companies sank after reporting weak earnings. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Google's parent company, Alphabet, all dropped. Bond yields shot higher after the government reported another month of strong job gains, further stoking fears of inflation and worries that higher interest rates could weigh on companies and stock prices. Crude-oil prices headed lower.
KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 23 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,798 as of 11:08 a.m. Eastern Time. The benchmark index is down 2.7 percent since hitting a record high a week ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281 points, or 1.1 percent, to 25,905. The Nasdaq slid 54 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,331. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 16 points, or 1 percent, to 1,563.
THE QUOTE: “We've enjoyed low interest rates for so long, we're having to deal with a little bit higher rates now, so the market is trying to figure out what that could mean for inflation,” said Darrell Cronk, head of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “The concern for the stock market is as interest rates go up so does the cost of debt service, the discount rate that you would use in factoring earnings growth for companies.”
JOBS DATA: U.S. employers added a robust 200,000 jobs in January, slightly above market expectations for a 185,000 increase. Meanwhile wages rose at the fastest pace in more than eight years, suggesting employers are competing more fiercely for workers. The figures point to an economy on strong footing even in its ninth year of expansion, fueled by global economic growth and healthy consumer spending at home.
FED IMPLICATIONS: The pickup in hourly wages, along with a recent uptick in inflation, may make it more likely the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates more quickly in the coming months.
BOND YIELDS: Bond prices declined again Friday, sending yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.84 percent from 2.79 percent late Thursday. European bond yields also rose after the U.S. jobs report came out.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the benchmark for many kinds of loans including mortgages, has risen swiftly in recent months, having traded as low as 2.17 percent in September. The yield is now the highest it's been since January 2014. The increase has been driven by the prospect of stronger economic growth, and higher inflation, in the U.S. and abroad.
Investors are worried that higher interest rates could weigh on company earnings and stock prices, by making bonds more appealing than stocks and by making it more expensive for companies to borrow money.
SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS: Google's parent company Alphabet slumped 5 percent after the search giant reported results that missed analysts' forecasts. The stock slid $58.92 to $1,112.67.
FALLING SHORT: Exxon Mobil dropped 5.7 percent and Chevron lost 3.9 percent, after the oil companies' latest quarterly results fell short of forecasts. Shares in Exxon shed $5.05 to $84.02. Chevron gave up $4.85 to $120.72.
X FACTOR: Apple declined 2.5 percent after the technology company said it sold 77.3 million iPhones in the last quarter, below the 80 million analysts had expected. The stock was down $4.17 to $163.61.
AMAZIN' BOOST: Amazon climbed 5.5 percent after its fourth-quarter profit increased by more than $1 billion. The online retail giant said it sold more voice-activated gadgets, enlisted new Prime members and benefited from its recent purchase of Whole Foods. Amazon shares gained $77 to $1,467.
ENERGY: Oil futures declined. Benchmark U.S. crude slid $1.12, or 1.7 percent, to $64.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell $1.62, or 2.3 percent, to $68.03 per barrel in London.
CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 110.40 yen from 109.42 yen on Thursday. The euro weakened to $1.2440 from $1.2502.
BITCOIN: The price of bitcoin was down 0.5 percent to $9,006, according to the tracking site CoinDesk. Bitcoin futures on the Cboe Futures Exchange slid 0.6 percent to $9,030.
MARKETS OVERSEAS: Major stock indexes in Europe declined. Germany's DAX slid 1.4 percent, while France's CAC 40 lost 1.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 0.4 percent. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent and South Korea's Kospi slid 1.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dipped 0.1 percent.

Two West Baton Rouge Parish natives who began their coaching careers on their home turf head to the grand stage of high school football in different areas.
Brusly High School graduate Mike Fouquier will coach alongside head mentor David Brewerton when the Zachary Broncos vie for the Class 5A non-select championship against Hahnville in the Allstate/Louisiana High School Athletic Association Prep Football Classic on Dec. 9 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.
Port Allen High School alumnus Josh Laborde will ply his trade alongside head coach Rob Odom when West Feliciana faces Richwood for the 3A non-select title at the Dome.
It's the second time at the Superdome in three years that Fouquier, who coached at both Brusly and Port Allen. As for Laborde, who worked with Fouquier on the PAHS coaching staff prior to his move to WFHS, it's the first time he or any coaches on the West Feliciana squad have led a team to the Dome.
“It feels surreal,” said Laborde, defensive coordinator for the Saints. “I never thought I'd be a defensive coordinator for a game in the Superdome.
“I've attended the Prep Classic every year I've been in coaching, but I never thought I'd be coaching in the Dome,” he said.
Odom led West Feliciana to the 3A semifinals four times in the last five years, only to come up short in the end. The Saints lost by one point to Patterson in 2010, by eight to Livonia
The Saints fell short 22-21 in 2010, 23-15 to Livonia in 2014, 46-38 in overtime to Lutcher in 2015 and 16-14 last year to Lutcher – a total of only 19 points over four games.
Ironically, WFHS advanced to the finals off a 19-point margin (45-26) in the semifinal victory Friday that punched the ticket to the Dome for the Saints.
“All the losses in the semifinals make us all appreciate this opportunity that much more,” he said.
Richwood is no stranger to Laborde, who was on the staff when the Pelicans lost 42-7 Nov. 14 in first-round action in Monroe.
The Saints will go into the title game 13-1 – their only loss to powerhouse University High. Laborde sees the loss as an advantage going into the championship game.
“Last year, we were 13-0 going into the semifinals and had some tough tests along the way, but we didn't have to deal with adversity down the hump,” said Laborde, a 15-year veteran. “We were exposed in the semifinals.”
Laborde isn't alone in terms of never coaching in the Dome. Odom and all members of the football coaching staff have never coached in a championship game.
“We're all in the same boat,” he said. “We've told the players they don't know just how much this mean to us coaches, all veterans – it makes the whole experience that much better.”
The aura of the Superdome alone makes the experience an opportunity of a lifetime, Laborde said.
“It's the biggest thing in the world Super Bowls are played here and the largest concerts in the world,” he said. “It's one of the biggest stages in the world … it's everything. Every team has talked about the Dome from the start of the season.”
Laborde realizes the situation will become strictly business when they line up against Richwood, but he's savoring the opportunity leading to the game.
“Even my six-year-old is excited,” he said. “It's like Christmas come early.”
It's a different story for Fouquier, who was part of the Bronco squad that won the 5A title in 2015 during Brewerton's second year at ZHS.
A different type of jubilation prevails on the second trip to the title game, he said.
“The first time you're a bit more giddy. The second time is just as sweet, but you know a little more about what to expect,” Fouquier said. “I'm telling them about it like I'm some kind of old veteran, but I've only been through it once.”
“The first time, you don't know what's coming, but the second time you know what it's all about,” he said.
The Broncos head to the Dome after a 29-26 win in a classic battle on the road against perennial state contender West Monroe.
The win over West Monroe proves how far the Broncos have come after a 3-2 season.
“You don't just go to West Monroe and get lucky,” he said. “The kids got better at everything they do during the season.”
The second trip to the Dome brings with it another advantage.
“You know a little more about what to expect,” Fouquier said. “I tell the players about that like I'm some kind of old veteran, but I've been through it only once.”
He also knows the perfect conclusion to the championship weekend.
“If all goes as we hope, you'll see two longtime friends and colleagues from West Baton Rouge Parish celebrating victories in the biggest game in high school football,” Fouquier said. “I've been there and I'm hoping for the same for Josh and his team. They deserve it.”
We started today from our parking garage near Ala Moana and Piikoi streets, that's when the timer began.
Our end point?
The traffic light where the H-1 Freeway intersects Ainakoa Street. This route would take us to the Ward on-ramp.
One of our producers decided to try out the University on-ramp instead.
So away we went. We left the station around 5:30 p.m., for all intents and purposes the peak of rush hour traffic.
The first slow down we experienced was around the Blaisdell at Ward Avenue, but before too long we made it on the freeway.
After that, we ran into what tens of thousands of Oahu drivers are no doubt used to, the slow down leading to the Punahou off-ramp.
Of course after just a few minutes and a couple of lane changes we were free of the worst of the traffic and on our way east past Punahou at normal freeway speeds.
Our total time from Ala Moana to the Ainakoa light, just over 18 minutes.
So what about the other route to the University on-ramp?
Our producer messaged us with the results, and that route clocked in just over 18 minutes as well.
According to James Edition, the seller based in Esloo Netherlands, the limited edition Ferrari's current mileage is at 118 km (73mi) and it also features the Ferrari 458 Speciale's 600PS (447kW) naturally aspirated V8 engine. Then why is it more special? Read on.
The limited edition Ferrari was initially developed into a concept car as a tribute to Sergio Pininfarina, a renowned designer from Turin, Italy, who passed away in 2012. A year after the prototype's premiere, Ferrari has put the car into production with only six examples in total, which also falls in line with Pininfarina's 85th anniversary. All six roadsters were completely sold out following its launch at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015 with a sticker price of $3 million each.

“I thought I was going to die...”
That was the one thought that ran through security guard Sabelo Maziba's mind when angry fans attacked him following Kaizer Chiefs' loss to Free State Stars at Durban's Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday.
Video footage of Maziba cowering on the ground‚ while he was beaten with chairs‚ punched and kicked by upset fans‚ went viral after the disastrous event.
Maziba was among 18 people who suffered injuries following Kaizer Chiefs' loss in the semi-final of the Nedbank Cup.
All the injured were treated and discharged from hospital.
The assault caught the attention of Johannesburg businessman Blaine Joseph‚ founder of Billion Forex Investments‚ who hired a private investigator to trace Maziba to offer to match his salary for a year.
A year ago, things weren't looking good for Newcastle United.
The club was on a downward spiral.
The hardest thing in the Premier League is scoring goals, and Benitez would need more attacking options.
Twelve months on, the mood on Tyneside is very different – thanks to Rafa Benitez.
The club is again on the up.
Benitez has energised the team – and the city – in much the same manner as Sir Bobby Robson and Kevin Keegan.
So where will we be in a year's time? In the Premier League?
Few would bet against Newcastle winning promotion. As for the Championship title, that would be a bonus.
Brighton and Hove Albion, the league's other outstanding team, will push them hard.
Promotion is all-important to the club, and the coming weeks – on and off the pitch – will have a significant bearing on United's chance of returning to the top flight at the first attempt.
Newcastle, arguably, have the best squad in the Championship.
But Benitez would like at least one player to arrive in next month's transfer window.
The will is there. So too is the money.
However, Benitez has spoken about the difficulties United face in the window.
The club isn't looking for any more Championship specialists, and there are few players in the division that Benitez feels would be better than what he already has at St James's Park.
So then there are the players in the Premier League and Europe's other elite divisions that Benitez believes could strengthen his squad.
Clubs and agents are already demanding hugely-inflated fees for potential targets.
The players themselves would be asking for Premier League money.
Would they take a risk and join a Championship team in the New Year?
Or would they wait until next summer when United's fate will be known.
In the meantime, Newcastle must come get through the next few games without the suspended Jonjo Shelvey, banned for four more games.
And then they must do without Mohamed Diame, Christian Atsu and Chancel Mbemba, who are all expected to head to the African Cup of Nations next month.
If, and it's a big if, United can still be in an automatic promotion place when they all return from Gabon, then Benitez's side will be very confident of pushing on towards April, when Benitez feels the Championship will be decided.
Beyond that, Benitez, having transformed Newcastle in a relatively short space of time, looks more than capable of re-establishing the club in the Premier League given the right backing.
Benitez already has the nucleus of a good top-flight squad, but the gulf between the divisions is widening by the year.
And United would need to invest heavily in players in the event of promotion.
Benitez knows this, and so too does manage director Lee Charnley.
The Premier League doesn't stand still.
That's why, after years of under-investment, Newcastle repeatedly found themselves at the wrong end of the table.
Charnley trusts Benitez's judgement.
And so too does a fanbase which has seen millions wasted on players ill-equipped for either United or the Premier League.
Benitez won't get every player like, but he has a clear idea of what he wants and what the club needs.
The club's immediate needs lie in midfield given that Benitez lacks a creative player that can fill in for Shelvey.
Beyond that, Newcastle will need to find at least one striker.
Will Aleksandar Mitrovic still be at the club in 12 months' time?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Mitrovic, for his part, won't want to spend another season on the bench.
The hardest thing in the Premier League is scoring goals, and Benitez would need more attacking options.
He has Premier League players. He just needs more of them.
But it's hard to look far in the future when so much depends on the present.
United need to go through next month which ever way they can.
The players – who have shown great unity and togetherness on the field – need to stay united.
And so do supporters.
Remarkably, there were a few boos after the Boxing Day defeat to Sheffield Wednesday.
Really?

BOSTON >> A purported psychic who charged an elderly Massachusetts woman more than $3.5 million for exorcisms and “spiritual cleansing” has pleaded guilty to evading taxes.
Federal prosecutors say 41-year-old Sally Ann Johnson of south Florida ran businesses that claimed to offer “psychic readings” and “spiritual cleansing and strengthening.”
Between 2007 and 2014, prosecutors say a Martha's Vineyard woman paid Johnson more than $3.5 million for services that claimed to rid the woman of demons.
Prosecutors say Johnson didn't report the income and tried to hide the money so she wouldn't have to pay taxes on it.
Johnson pleaded guilty in the federal court in Boston Thursday and has agreed to repay the woman. She's expected to be sentenced in January.
Her attorney did not immediately respond to an email on Friday.

CNN correspondent Bill Weir is back on Saturday at 9 p.m. for another trip through “The Wonder List,” the network's original series that largely sends him to pristine habitats around the globe to learn how they will survive in the face of development, social conflict or industrialization. Though the lush look of the show can resemble what Weir calls “travel porn,” he says it's about “all of our little decisions, all 7 billion of us on this blue marble, and how they add up to sometimes to monstrous results.”
Weir's first stop is Patagonia where he conducted the first interview with Kris Thompkins since the death of her husband Doug, the outdoor clothing entrepreneur. Thompkins died in a 2015 kayaking accident in Chile, where the conservationist couple have used their fortune to buy up huge tracts of land solely to preserve it. Next week's episode took Weir to Alaska, where he examined the ongoing conflict over a massive proposed gold and copper mine, which could threaten the state's salmon population.
Weir's travels have made him highly attuned to the natural disasters that have struck the U.S. during the current hurricane season. He offered to pitch in on CNN's coverage of Hurricane Irma in Florida and Puerto Rico where he viewed the destructive results of Maria. After his return, he shared his views about the new season of “The Wonder List” and the future of this mortal coil.
There is a lot of news reporting on “The Wonder List,” but it doesn't look like a news show. It unfolds like a movie.
That's what I'm going for. I've joked that by the rules of breaking news, if Wolf Blitzer was explaining the “Star Wars” saga, he would open with “this just in — Darth Vader is Luke's father” instead of “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.” The original series format allows me to start at the beginning, introduce you to the characters and then drop the bomb on you in the fourth act where it belongs.

The Trump administration plays a role on the series this year. The president shows up for the first time during your episode about Alaska.
One of the first acts of Scott Pruitt, the new EPA administrator, was to meet with the head of the Pebble Mine group and to drop all lawsuits and essentially give them the green light to proceed with a permit. The fishermen up in Bristol Bay thought they had won that battle. It was a 10-year slog. But they couldn't find a scientist to say you could mine that gold and copper and not hurt the fishery. But this administration believes differently. So that's just the beginning. There are uranium mines in the Grand Canyon that I want to go back and follow up on. There are the Great Lakes restoration projects that conservationists have been banking on that are being gutted financially. This turnover politically has given environmental reporting a whole new challenge.
This turnover politically has given environmental reporting a whole new challenge. CNN's Bill Weir
You've traveled around the world a lot in the last few years. How is the perception of CNN right now after the beating it's taken from this White House?
Around the world we are the gold standard. If you tell a diplomat in some capitol that we're here from CNN, they sit up and pay attention. Honestly, the only issue I've run into is when I go back to visit my old high school buddies in Tulsa, Oklahoma or Wautoma, Wisconsin: “Yeah, I told my niece that my old buddy Bill Weir was coming to town and she turned her nose up ...”
Because they think you're working for the “fake news”?
Exactly. It's largely an American phenomenon and it is depressing. When I was wandering around flooded living rooms in New Orleans for Katrina at that time, no one was calling ABC News [Weir's employer at the time] to say I was making the whole thing up as part of a political agenda. Whereas when I come out to Puerto Rico, and after sounding the alarm for all these American citizens, invariably there are a few dozen who want to argue with me over what they think I saw. Regardless of any of that, the morale at CNN has never been higher and people have never been more committed to the cause they believe in, which is journalism.

It was a weekend full of tournament titles and high-scoring performances by our top local high school sports teams and athletes from Friday and Saturday. Here are the highlights, with the full list of scores below:
Rattlers girls' basketball scores first tourney title
Much is often said about the Rancho Mirage boys' basketball team's case full of trophies, but the girls' program got a chance to experience similar success over the weekend. For the first time since the varsity program began four years ago, the Rancho Mirage girls' basketball team won a tournament championship, this one coming at the Brawley Tournament through four games.
A decisive 69-36 win over Lazerte (Canada) and two wins on Friday 43-26 over Southwest and 33-23 over Central put the Rattlers in the title game Saturday against host Brawley, where the Rattlers pulled away in the second half for a 54-44 victory.
Jahnece Curtis led the team in scoring all four games, totaling 83 points in all, including 24 of the team's 33 points in the semifinals. Willow Mannes scored her career high of 16 in the game Thursday, and Liz Rosin came through with 17 in the title game.

Rams girls' soccer has breakthrough tourney wins
Also stepping out of the shadow of a heralded boys' team this weekend was the Desert Mirage girls' soccer squad.
The Rams swept their way to the title in the Holtville Soccer Tournament over the weekend, collecting the first girls' soccer tourney title in school history.
The Rams beat West Shores 4-1, tied Calexico 0-0 in pool play, then topped Southwest 2-0 in the semifinal and ran to a decisive 4-1 win over Calexico in the championship match.
In the title game, Fabiana Zavala had a pair of goals, and Fernanda Gonzalez had a goal and an assist. Jessica Centeno scored the other goal, and Yisel Ybarra and Anastasia Cruz added assists.
DCA girls' win Hesperia Christian championship
Led by Aysia Johnson's 59 points over three games, the Conqueror girls' basketball team took home the Hesperia Christian Tournament title Saturday, with wins over CSDR 44-21, Arrowhead Christian 46-29 and Ontario Christian 54-41 in the championship.
Johnson had a double-double of 24 points and 10 rebounds in the championship, and Ashley Klopfenstein had 32 points over the three games.
West Shores boys' soccer wins Eagle Cup
The Wildcats maintained their undefeated mark on the season and took home the Eagle Cup in an overtime thriller over Riverside Prep on Saturday. After a 1-0 win over Paraclete in the semis, West Shores moved on to face the Silver Knights for the second time after a 2-2 tie in pool play.
West Shores held a late 1-0 lead before falling behind 2-1 quickly with just eight minutes to play, but Alex Castro's equalizer with three minutes remaining in regulation sent the game into overtime. There, West Shores won a free kick, where Gustavo Meza found Castro open in the center of the box for the game-winning goal.

TORONTO – Mayor John Tory says he plans to discuss Toronto's lagging rental supply, a vacant property tax and the lack of real estate data when he meets Tuesday with the federal and Ontario finance ministers.
The meeting between all three levels of government was arranged earlier this month in an effort to address soaring house prices in Canada's largest city.
Last week, the head of the Bank of Canada warned of growing speculation in the Toronto housing market and said a correction there could reverberate in other parts of the country.

Provincial Finance Minister Charles Sousa is expected to address the issue in his budget next week after dropping hints that he will aim to tackle speculation.
The provincial Liberal government is facing growing pressure to do something to address housing affordability in the Greater Toronto Area, where the average price of a detached house hit $1.21 million last month, up 33.4 per cent from a year ago.

Throughout the evolution and development of our nation many good and wonderful things have occurred. After more than 200 years our constitutional republic continues to survive and function, pretty much as intended by the founders.
Currently, there are many issues and much contentiousness toward the president. Vilified, insulted and overtly criticized, he gives as good as he gets and uses social media to do it. He continues to function, in spite of all his flaws, and he continues to be successful in her governance. This to the chagrin and frustration of these detractors.
One standout position that he embraces is his support for Israel. They are the bastion and light of hope in the Middle East. The importance of supporting Israel may never be fully understood or appreciated during our lifetime, but be assured, it is a key component in this nation's survival.
Whether you hate or or love him, despite his shortcomings and tarnished history, he is the exact person we need in the oval office. For those who cannot handle that, they most likely cannot “handle the truth.” “Methinks they do protest too much.” Yet, as a nation, we continue to move forward and are, indeed, fortunate.
After being nabbed by the FBI while leaving DefCon, the security researcher who singlehandedly neutralized the WannaCry malware attack earlier this year is back online. Marcus Hutchins, a.k.a. @malwaretech, appeared for his arraignment at a federal court in Wisconsin on Monday where he entered a not guilty plea and successfully argued that he should be allowed internet access. Hutchins faces six charges related to his alleged involvement in the Kronos banking malware in 2014.
Initially, Hutchins was prevented from going online after his arrest. In court today, Hutchins was granted nearly unfettered access to the internet, with the only stipulation being that he not access the “sinkhole” he created that stopped WannaCry. Naturally, he tweeted for the first time since his arrest, addressing his case and thanking his many supporters.
i'm still on trial, still not allowed to go home, still on house arrest; but now i am allowed online. Will get my computers back soon. — MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) August 14, 2017
Things to do during defcon:
Attend parties
Visit red rock canyon
Go shooting
Be indicted by the FBI
Rent supercars — MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) August 14, 2017
Notably, as the International Business Times reports, the government appeared to acknowledge that the case against Hutchins was “historical” in nature, suggesting that it no longer considers Hutchins a threat in a seeming acknowledgement of his role preventing the spread of more recent malware. That kind of language could bode well for his case.
Hutchins, a British citizen, will now be allowed to move around the U.S. freely and relocate to Los Angeles as he awaits his trial, which is set to begin on October 23.

The American Dollar, on Tuesday, February 14, slumped against major currencies as investors reined in any expectations for a March rise in U.S. interest rates.
The dollar index dipped 0.06 percent to 100.90, above its session low of 100.70 but below its three-week peak of 101.11 struck on Monday.
The euro inched up 0.1 percent against the greenback at $1.0608 but down 0.2 percent at 120.31 yen amid political risk and disappointing regional economic data.
The euro has come under pressure in recent sessions from France's presidential election campaign and Greek bailout talks, Rueters reports.
Investors await the semi-annual economic testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday before Congress where she might drop clues on the probability on a rate increase next month as the jobs sector has improved further and inflation has shown signs of accelerating.
Analysts expect Yellen will unlikely offer firm signal for a rate move at its March 14-15 policy meeting.
The gauge of the greenback versus six major currencies pared its initial losses after data showed U.S. producer prices posted its largest monthly rise in more than four years in January, supporting the view domestic inflation is approaching the Fed's 2 percent goal.
Here are the top stories from the Monday, April 17, 2017 edition of Global News at 5 with Gord Steinke on Global Edmonton.
The former director of the Iowa DOT on Thursday said he is “eager” to help rebuild and repair the nation's highways.
Paul Trombino III has been nominated to be administrator of the Federal Highway Administration and he was quizzed by members of a U.S. Senate committee yesterday.
“The nation's highway system has long been the driving force for economic opportunity and success in the United States,” Trombino said, “and I am truly humbled at the opportunity to help advance the quality of life of Americans across the country through transportation.”
If — as expected — Trombino is confirmed by the senate for the job, he will take the lead in an agency that will be a key player in President Trump's infrastructure goals. Trombino promised to find ways to streamline the permit process for highway and bridge projects that get federal funding.
“The key ingredient, from my perspective, is providing flexibility for states,” Trombino said. “…Every state is a little bit different. Their rural needs and urban needs are different.”
The confirmation hearing was livestreamed and the video is now posted on the committee's website.
The top Democrat on the committee asked Trombino how he helped steer a 10-cent-per-gallon state gas tax increase through the Iowa legislature in 2015. Republican Joni Ernst, the Iowa Senator who's a member of the committee, said it “would really be an uphill battle” to get a federal gas tax increase through congress.
“What are other ways that we can fund our roads and bridges?” Ernst asked.
Trombino replied: “Obviously, the gas tax is a funding mechanism…There are a number of alternatives…different types of fees and other things that can be, potentially, on the table — especially as it comes to freight and other types of issues.”
But Trombino did not offer specific recommendations. He said those policy decisions will be made by congress.
Trombino worked for 17 years at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation before he became director of the Iowa DOT in 2011. Trombino left state government last year, at the end of November, to become president of a central Iowa engineering firm.

U .S.-based airlines last year had the lowest rate of lost luggage, canceled flights and passengers getting bumped off overbooked planes in decades, the U.S. Department of Transportation reported Tuesday.
But the number of discrimination complaints from passengers rose sharply in 2016 compared with the previous year, the federal agency reported.
The rate of lost or mishandled luggage was 2.7 for every 1,000 passengers in 2016, down from the rate of 3.13 in 2015. It was the lowest rate since the Transportation Department began keeping track of the data in 1987.
Seattle-based Alaska Airline had the biggest drop in the rate of lost luggage.
Airlines for America, a trade group for the nation's biggest carriers, said airlines have been investing heavily in the last few years to improve their products and services, including new airplanes and luggage management systems.
“Airlines share the same goals as our customers, which is to deliver passengers and their luggage to and from their destination as safely and efficiently as possible,” said Vaughn Jennings, a spokesman for the group.
The rate of flights canceled last year dropped to 1.17%, down from 1.5% in 2015 — the lowest rate in 22 years of comparable data, the agency reported. The rate of passengers denied boarding from overbooked flights dropped to 0.62 per 10,000 passengers in 2016, the lowest rate since 1995.
Industry experts noted that severe weather is usually to blame for most cancellations, and airlines faced fewer storms in 2016 than in previous years.
But not all airline statistics for 2016 were positive. The number of discrimination complaints filed by passengers against U.S. and international carriers jumped to 94 last year, compared with 65 in 2015, a 45% increase.
Of those complaints, 65 passengers said they were discriminated because of race, 12 because of national origin and eight based on religion, according to the Transportation Department. Seven complaints alleged sex discrimination and two were “regarding color.”
“Our members do not tolerate discrimination in any form and, in fact, have been working collaboratively with DOT, civil rights organizations and other stakeholders to ensure the well-being of everyone who takes to the skies,” Jennings said.

2017 Mid-Ohio: Dakoda Armstrong NASCAR Xfinity Race Recap
Posted by: newsla on Aug 14, 2017 - 06:49 AM 2017 Mid-Ohio: Dakoda Armstrong NASCAR Xfinity Race Recap
Dakoda Armstrong has his sights set on putting his No. 28 JGL Racing team in the season ending playoffs and no time is more crucial than the present. The New Castle, Indiana stepped up his road racing skills and steered his No. 28 WinField United Toyota to a 10th place finish in the running of the Mid-Ohio Challenge at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.
"This was definitely a good day for us," said Armstrong. "Our No. 28 WinField United Toyota wasn't too bad and I continue to learn more and more on the road courses. I was able to avoid any trouble on the track and that proved very beneficial to us. Honestly, I am not sure how I missed that last big wreck - we joked that maybe it was my "ninja like" skills that helped me dodge it. Regardless, at the end of the day we had a top-10 finish and that is what we needed."
Dakoda would start the 75-lap race in the 28th position as a result of his qualifying effort earlier on Saturday. As the green flag flew, Armstrong would slowly move forward in the field while reporting that the track seemed a little greasy but his No. 28 WinField United Toyota wasn't too bad. With some of the leaders pitting early before the end of the first stage, Dakoda would finish the stage sitting in the 11th spot.
The second stage would find Dakoda struggle a little with his No. 28 WinField United Toyota and ride just outside the top-20. With the second 20 lap stage being caution free, Armstrong would take care of his car while finishing in the 20th position at the end of the stage.
The remaining 35 laps of the race would see things turn to typical wild road course racing with multiple major wrecks on the 13-turn, 2.258-mile Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. Armstrong was able to gain valuable spots on the track during these incidents as he kept the nose of his No. 28 WinField United clean. As the checkered flag flew, Dakoda would earn his third top-10 finish of the season.
"It got wild out there late in the race and we were just fortunate to be able to steer clear of any trouble," added Dakoda. "That allowed us to put ourselves in position for a good finish and equally important - a good points day."
The 10th place finish kept Armstrong sitting in the ninth spot in the NASCAR XFINITY Series overall driver standings - 26 points behind eighth place.
Armstrong and his JGL Racing team will next head to Bristol Motor Speedway for the running of the Food City 300. The 22nd race of the NASCAR XFINITY Series season will be Friday August 18th and can be seen LIVE on NBC Sports Network at 7:30 pm ET. It can also be heard on Performance Racing Network (PRN) and SiriusXM Channel 90.

Outgoing Berlin Film Festival director Dieter Kosslick will receive the inaugural Force of Nature Filmmaking Award at the 2018 Sam Spiegel International Film Lab in Jerusalem.
The organizers of the Film Lab, the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, created the award to honor extraordinary personalities committed to the development of cinema. They said Kosslick was receiving the honor for the impact his work has had on German and world cinema, adding that he also inspired the establishment of the Jerusalem Film and Television Fund in 2008.
“A particular concern of mine has always been the national and international promotion and funding of talent and up-and-coming filmmakers. I'm exceedingly pleased to receive this award,” Kosslick said.
He will be presented with the award as the 2018 edition of the Film Lab opens on July 5. The 2019 Berlinale will be the last under Kosslick's direction with Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian taking over as co-chiefs.
The Sam Spiegel International Film Lab unveiled the dozen emerging filmmakers selected for the 2018 edition earlier this year. They will be mentored by industry figures. Three-quarters of projects that have been through the program thus far have been produced. Film Lab alums include Academy Award winner Laszlo Nemes (“Son of Saul”) and Nadav Lapid (“The Kindergarten Teacher”).
by Park Chan-Kyong The assassination of the North Korean leader's half brother illustrates the "brutal and inhuman" nature of the regime in Pyongyang, Seoul said Wednesday after Kim Jong-Nam was reportedly killed in Malaysia by female agents.
Two women are believed to have used some kind of poison for the Cold War-style killing, with reports from Malaysia and South Korea suggesting Kim Jong-Nam had been stabbed with poison-tipped needles or had chemicals sprayed in his face.
"He told the receptionist at the departure hall that someone had grabbed his face from behind and splashed some liquid on him," Selangor state's criminal investigation chief Fadzil Ahmat was reported as saying by Malaysia's The Star newspaper.
"He asked for help and was immediately sent to the airport's clinic. At this point, he was experiencing headache and was on the verge of passing out,” said Fadzil.
"At the clinic, the victim experienced a mild seizure. He was put into an ambulance and was being taken to the Putrajaya Hospital when he was pronounced dead," he said.
South Korean reports had earlier suggested the two female assassins had used poison-tipped needles during the killing, before fleeing in a taxi.
Kim had at one time been set to assume the leadership of his isolated country, but fell out of favour after an embarrassing attempt to get into Japan on a fake passport in 2001.
He has since lived in exile, mostly in the gambling haven of Macau, but he has also been spotted in other Asian countries and there have been reports of his playboy lifestyle.
Kim, 45, is believed to have been in Malaysia on a passport bearing the name Kim Chol, a known alias, according to South Korean media.
But Seoul on Wednesday confirmed that the dead man was a member of the Kim dynasty.
"Our government is certain that the murdered man is Kim Jong-Nam," said Chung Joon-Hee, a spokesman for Seoul's unification ministry that handles inter-Korea affairs.
"If confirmed, the murder of Kim Jong-Nam would be an example that shows the brutality and inhumane nature of the North Korean regime," acting leader Hwang Kyo-Ahn told a meeting of top security officials earlier, according to his spokesman.
"We're taking this incident very seriously and we're keeping close tabs on the North", Hwang said.
Kim's killing is thought to be the highest-profile death under the Jong-Un regime since the execution of the leader's uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, in December 2013.
Jong-Un has been trying to strengthen his grip on power in the face of growing international pressure over his country's nuclear and missile programmes, and regular reports have emerged on purges and executions.
Jong-Nam, known as an advocate of reform in the North, once told a Japanese newspaper that he opposed his country's dynastic system of power.
Cheong Seong-Jang, senior researcher at Seoul's Sejong Institute think-tank, said Jong-Nam had been living in near-exile so it was unlikely that Jong-Un saw him as a potential competitor for power.
"But if Jong-Nam committed an act to damage Jong-Un's authority, I think it's possible that the Reconnaissance General Bureau may have directly conducted the assassination under the orders of Jong-Un since it has been in charge of closely watching Jong-Nam," he said. DM
The US is going back to its old policy of taking on a more prominent role in the Afghanistan conundrum, and the unannounced visit by National Security Adviser (NSA) Lieutenant General H R McMaster to meet Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif speaks volumes.
After visiting Afghanistan, which is now using a more conciliatory tone in reference to Pakistan, the US is clearly looking to get Pakistan to ‘get tough' on Afghan Taliban leaders reportedly hiding out in Pakistan.
Amidst all of this, former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai has called President Ashraf Ghani a traitor for allowing the US to use the MOAB on Afghan soil.
While he now opposes any additional troops coming in from the US, his time in power will be remembered as the time when Afghanistan was closest to the US.
The current number of US soldiers present in Afghanistan is only a fraction of the total amount in place during Karzai's time in power, which is why his accusations ring hollow.
Afghanistan has already offered what could be seen as a potential olive branch to Pakistan – President Ashraf Ghani sent a letter to PM Nawaz suggesting parliamentary dialogue, while Omar Zakhiwal has suggested a joint operation to nab Mullah Fazlullah and work towards eliminating terrorists associated with factions operating in Pakistan, provided Pakistan returns the favour.
This is the first conciliatory statement from Afghanistan in months, and Pakistan should use this opportunity to mend ties.
Enough barbs have been traded, and the Afghan government's decision is one that Pakistan should receive positively.
Even though the Trump administration's Afghanistan policy is still unclear, the use of MOAB and the US NSA's visit to both Afghanistan and Pakistan indicates that the country is looking to get more involved, as of old.
While this does in no way indicate that the condition in Afghanistan is likely to improve, it is clear that the US understands that Pakistan is an important regional stakeholder which must be convinced to do its part.
For now, it seems uncertain whether the Trump Administration will use the carrot to get Pakistan and Afghanistan on the same page, or whether a sterner stance is on the cards.
Either way, this presents a unique opportunity for Pakistan, because it can use this to mend fraught ties with Afghanistan by catering to its demand of clamping down on Afghani militants.
If we do this successfully, greater regional relevance ensures that India's aims of diplomatically isolating Pakistan are not materialised and both the US and Afghanistan go back to seeing Pakistan as a crucial regional player and ally.
A foreign policy masterstroke is on the line; the government just has to take this chance.
ISLAMABAD-United States President Barack Obama has congratulated renowned Pakistani scholar and poet Professor Allama Nasiruddin Hunzai on his 100th birth anniversary and hoped that his scholarly work will further broaden vision of people in the years to come.
In a letter from the White House, President Obama wrote to centenarian Hunzai, “we are pleased to join your family and friends in wishing you a happy 100th birthday.”
Obama said, “As you celebrate this extraordinary milestone, we hope you reflect on the many memories you have made over the past century.
Your generation has shown the courage to persevere through depression and war, and the vision to broaden our liberties through changing times.”
We are grateful for your contributions to the American society, and we wish you all the best for the coming year, he added.
Nasir Hunzai born in village Hyderabad of Hunza valley in 1917, is the author of over one hundred books on various aspects of the Quranic wisdom mainly on spiritualism and sufism. In recognition of his extraordinary literary services, the government of Pakistan had conferred upon him Sitara-e-Imtiaz in 2001.
Sixty of his books have been translated to English by scholar Dr Faquir Hunzai and Rashida Hunzai.
“Book of Healing, the Wise Quran and the World of Humanity and Balance of Realities, have got attention in research institutions of the western world. Other books are: What is Soul, Rubies and Pearls, Healing through Knowledge, A Thousand Wisdoms, Fruit of Paradise and Ganj-e- Giranmaya etc.
Nasir Hunzai has composed first alphabets for Burushaski, an isolated and very old language of human kind spoken in Gilgit Baltistan and Pakistan besides authoring Burushaski Deewan, first of its kind of this language. It is indeed a source of spiritual inspiration for the people of various cultures. Half of this Deewan has been translated to English, titled “Flowers of Paradise.” He has also compiled first Burushaski Urdu dictionary jointly published by Karachi University and Burushaski Research Academy in three volumes.
He is also recipient of titles Hakimul Qalam, Lisan-e-Qaum and Baba-e-Burushaski conferred by Government of Gilgit Baltistan and other social organizations. He is also co-author of first Burushaski-German dictionary, published by Hydel Berg University Germany and co-author of book “Hunza Proverbs” compiled by Professor Tiffu, a Canadian researcher.

LOS ANGELES-Katy Perry's $25 million deal to join ‘American Idol' has reportedly caused major drama at the ABC network. The ‘Swish Swish' hitmaker signed an eye-watering contract in May to appear on the TV talent show, where she'll star alongside fellow judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan, but her salary allied to Ryan Seacrest's $15 million deal has cut deep into the show's intended budget.
A source explained: ‘'ABC was originally going to spend no more than $50 million on talent. They had to expand their budget for Lionel.''
Katy's staggering salary was personally signed off by ABC President Ben Sherwood. But it's been claimed that Katy's fortune has come at the expense of the other judges, both of whom are being paid considerably less to appear on the show.
The insider told the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column: ‘'Ben Sherwood blew the budget on Katy without thinking how that would impact other areas of the show budget. He gambled on her because of her appeal to a younger audience and huge social-media following. ‘'But Katy is effectively taking money from the other judges, who then had to be paid way less.'' In the end, though, the ABC network has been forced to increase its budget for the show in order to secure the services of Lionel and Luke.
The source explained: ‘'The negotiations with Luke and Lionel have been fraught and difficult because of [Katy's deal]. ‘'They expected similar deals to Katy, but are, in fact, getting a hell of a lot less. In the end, ABC had to cough up a second round of money to sign the other judges.''
The duo were both initially offered deals worth around $2.5 million each, but Luke and Lionel ultimately reached an agreement for around $7 million each. The network insider added: ‘'If ‘Idol' doesn't work, it will blow up big time in Sherwood's face. If it does work, he's a genius.''
Camila Cabello wants to go clubbing with Taylor Swift.
The 'Havana' hitmaker has admitted she would be disappointed if her ongoing live tour supporting the 'Look What You Made Me Do' singer on the road didn't result in them having a night on the town.
As reported by The Sun, she was asked if they'd enjoyed a big night out, and said: "Not yet because we are just getting started and everybody's running around.
"But as soon as things get more relaxed there has to be at least one summer party, otherwise it's not what I signed up for."
The 21-year-old star hasn't been too disappointed with the quiet nights so far though, as it's meant she's got to spend a lot of time unwinding with her 28-year-old friend.
She added: "No matter what, I think we are always going to have each other's backs and be great friends. It's really fun.
"I was a huge Taylor Swift fan before I even met her, so getting to go to a Taylor Swift concert is so much fun."
The tour had a shaky start for Camila, who was forced to cancel her opening slot for a Seattle show earlier this month after she was hospitalized due to dehydration.
She shared in a statement posted to her Twitter account: "So yesterday after my performance at the billboards, i was feeling really sick and ended up in the hospital to get checked out.
"They ran a lot of tests and everything is fine, but the diagnosis was basically dehydration and I also have a low grade fever - the doctors have told me I really have to get rest otherwise I won't get better - so unfortunately I won't be able to perform my set during the Reputation tour in Seattle tomorrow. I'm so sorry to let you guys down and I promise I will make it up as soon as I can."
A late Scott Harrison strike secured Hartlepool United a vital point at Accrington.
The defender's effort, with just five minutes on the clock, saw Pools twice come from behind to secure yet another result on the road.
After an even first half, in which Pools frustrated the hosts, Stanley came out with renewed intent in the second period.
And they had to wait just 10 minutes for the opener - Jake Carroll got the wrong side of his man in the area and brought the home forward down. Billy Kee slotted home the penalty from 12 yards for 1-0.
But rather than wilt under the home pressure, Pools picked themselves up, dusted themselves down and got back in it through Padraig Amond.
The Irishman's towering header at the back post converted a perfectly weighted Jordan Richards centre.
Pools were level for all of 11 second half minutes, though.
A looping corner from the right was not cleared by the visiting backline and defender Matty Pearson rose highest to head home.
But there was life in Pools yet, and as the game looked to be headed for another loss on the road, Harrison reacted quickest in a crowded area to hammer into the top corner as Stanley failed to clear.
A 34-year-old man named Hamzah Idil was arrested for punching a fellow passenger on an MRT train. Now the accused has finally been sent to jail on February 2.
The accused has now been in jail for a week after pleading guilty to assaulting 30-year-old fellow passenger Ng Shi Xiang in December 2016.
Tan Jen Tse, the district judge has also asked Hamzah to provide $500 as compensation to the victim for his medical bill and the money has to be given to the investigation officer.
According to reports, Ng took a train from Novena station at around 10 pm on that day. Hamzah also boarded the same train and was standing in the near a door.
During the court hearing, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenny Yang said that when Ng entered into the train, he tried to make his own way to the empty space behind Hamzah.
Kenny also mentioned that during that process the victim somehow bumped into Hamzah's shoulder and stepped on the defendant's foot. Then the verbal argument started between them.
The angry argument between both the passengers started to get more aggressive while the train was travelling towards Toa Payoh station, when suddenly Hamzah flew into a rage and punched Ng's face twice.
Meanwhile, an eyewitness pressed an emergency button and the MTR staff gathered in the station to control the situation.
Later, the victim was rushed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and according to Ng's medical report, doctors found bruises on his forehead and right cheek.
On Friday 2017, the DPP Kenny urged for two weeks of imprisonment. He told the court that Hamzah had behaved in a "thuggish manner" on the train.
Mohammed Shakirin Abdul Rashid, the lawyer of the accused pleaded for a fine. He said that the argument was short and Ng provoked his client to become more aggressive.
According to law, for the assault, the convict could have been sent to jail for up to two years with a fine up to $5,000.
On Tuesday, authorities sent out a missing person alert for a Montgomery man whom they considered to be "endangered." That man was found safely in Mississippi Friday.
Joseph Anthony Carr IV, 57, was found in Alabama's neighboring state. It is unclear what part Carr was located in but according to authorities, Carr is said to be in good health.
Officials initially reported Carr needed special medical equipment that was "vital to his health" and that without it, he would die.
Carr was last seen leaving his residence near Wares Ferry Road and Old Atlanta Highway last Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari drove a hard bargain and got Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to agree to his terms in framing an apology by riding on the anxiety of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief for early settlement of the defamation cases.Kejriwal on March 16 wrote to Gadkari regretting his allegations, saying he had made certain statements “without regard to its verifiability” and requested the minister to put the incident behind and bring court proceedings to a closure.Gadkari and Kejriwal on Monday filed a joint application in the Patiala House court to withdraw the defamation case.Sources said Kejriwal tendered an informal apology to Gadkari last year, but talks for a formal regret began about four months back. Two close aides of the AAP chief had held several rounds of discussion with Gadkari and his associates to arrive at the decision.“Though both the leaders had agreed to bury the past, finalising the text of the apology took some time. Once the Delhi CM was okay with admitting that his statements against the minister were unverified, the decision to file a joint application in the court was taken,” said a source.In 2014, Kejriwal had called Gadkari “one of the country's most corrupt politicians” and in response the BJP leader had slapped the Delhi CM with a defamation case.Kejriwal has also shot off similar letters to Kapil Sibal and his son Amit Sibal saying that “the allegations made against you and (your) father were unfounded.” Last week, Delhi CM had also issued an apology to former Punjab minister Bikram Majithia saying that he has now learnt that the drug trade allegations were “unfounded”.Sources also said Gadkari had suggested Kejriwal to get rid of the defamation cases by seeking apologies to focus on his responsibilities.There are reports Kejriwal intends to get rid of all 33 defamation cases against him through out-of-court settlements and reaching out to each of the leaders who he had slammed.

ENGLAND prop Alex Walmsley is facing a lengthy spell out of the game after breaking his neck.
The Dewsbury-born St Helens forward, such a hit in the World Cup, fractured a bone against Warrington Wolves recently and has undergone surgery.
“It is obviously a massive blow to our team given the fact that Alex is the best front rower in Super League,” said St Helens coach Justin Holbrook.
“But importantly the news that Alex will make a full recovery from the injury is one we all welcome.
“The surgeon has told both Alex and the club that he will make a full recovery and his neck will be stronger than ever.”
Elsewhere, organisers are pressing ahead with plans to take a Super League fixture to America, but face a race against time to enter a New York club in English competition in 2019.
It is six months since a consortium submitted an application to join the Championship, but they are still waiting to get the go-ahead.
An RFL delegation visited New York in January and has asked for more details about the business plan of the proposed new club who will still try for 2020 even if time does run out.
Meanwhile, talks are ongoing with the Red Bull Arena and US broadcasting companies about taking a Super League game to New York later this year and Ricky Wilby, the Englishman fronting the bid, says the consortium will cover all costs of the travelling teams.
Salford have expressed a willingness to switch one of their home games to the Big Apple and, although an initial proposal to move their Good Friday fixture with Catalans Dragons has fallen through, Wilby says there are two other Super Leagues clubs keen to become involved.

Don Cook had just finished delivering a care package to a young man at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton last week when he received a phone call that changed his life.
“I believe that you purchased a lottery ticket this year,” said a flight nurse with the STARS air ambulance service.” I'm happy to tell you that you won the Edmonton STARS Dream Home.”
Through tears, Cook proceeded to tell the lottery group his story. In a video posted to Facebook, he is heard saying his family had found out their landlord would be selling the house they live in now, so they were actually looking for a new home.
But it's when Cook starts talking about his late son that those in the room also started to tear up.
WATCH: 2017 STARS Lottery grand prize winners
Cook and his wife, Lynn Anderson Cook, tragically lost their son Matt in April 2010, after a battle with cancer.
Matt Cook was a young athlete who played for the Bonnyville Pontiacs and eventually, when cancer took his leg, he represented Canada in sledge hockey.
He was just 22 years old when he died.
The Cooks created the Matt Cook Foundation which provides care packages to young adults going through treatments at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton.

“This was, in particular, just a very touching moment,” STARS spokesperson Fatima Khawaja said. “This prize couldn't have gone to a more deserving family.”
At first, Cook thought the phone call was a prank.
“Once I hung up the phone, I phoned them back just to make sure it was STARS,” he told Global News. “It still hasn't sunk in.”
WATCH: 2017 STARS Lottery grand prize winners
Cook said he's bought a STARS lottery ticket for as long as he can remember. As a member of Edmonton Fire Rescue for 34 years, he said he's seen firsthand the impact the air ambulance can have.
“STARS has helped many patients and they've changed our life,” Cook said.
The Edmonton home is 2,829 square feet. The two-storey home with a double-attached garage has three bedrooms and is located in Griesbach. It's valued at $973,979.
Don Cook's ticket was pulled just days after the seven-year anniversary of his son's passing, something that isn't lost on his dad.
“I do believe Matt had lots to do with this,” he said.
“According to all the symptoms, the political opposition won in Ecuador. Simply put, there was fraud. The trap was preceded by the pre-fraud, and now we are in the post-fraud phase.” Montaner mentions in his article published in the American daily El Nuevo Herald.
He explains that pre-fraud is the stage in which the ideal climate is created to consummate the deception. The legislation is changed or adapted, electoral bodies are controlled, and electronic methods that can be easily manipulated are implemented.
Fraud is the crime committed during the election process. First, it is prepared by buying some surveys that give the official candidate a virtual victory. And then it is performed by controlling the voter's registration -the dead vote and virtual citizens are created- but the trick is the sophisticated software design.
Montaner mentions that Ecuador is currently in the post-fraud stage because the electoral body, obedient and dependent on the ruling party, has already proclaimed the triumph of Lenin Moreno to give that “victory” an air of plausibility.
Iran Focus
London, 11 Dec - Iran's decision to transfer an imprisoned American doctoral student within Evin prison has increased fears for his safety, according to Human Rights Watch.
Xiyue Wang, a Princeton Ph.D. student and US citizen, was moved to Ward 7, where a Taliban inmate threatened him in the presence of a guard, on December 6, according to a valuable source.
That source told Human Rights Watch that this same inmate had previously made a threat on Wang's life when they were both detained in Ward 209, which led to the Taliban inmate's transfer to a different cell.
Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: “Iranian authorities do not limit unfair trials and mistreatment in custody to their own citizens but impose them on foreign nationals as well. To further threaten Xiyue Wang with physical harm is outright cruelty.”
Bogus Charges
Wang, 37, was arrested by Iranian authorities on August 8, 2016, whilst doing dissertation research into Iran at the turn of the 20th century and studying Farsi, as corroborated by Princeton University, but Iran has constantly claimed that he was working on behalf the US government.
In a statement, Princeton said: “His dissertation topic was not suggested to him by Princeton, the U.S. government, or anyone else… He has no connection to any government or intelligence agencies, and the charge that he was engaged in espionage is completely false. He studied the archival materials solely for his own research, and to our knowledge did not share them with anyone at Princeton or elsewhere.”
In July 2017, it was reported that Wang had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for “cooperating with an enemy state”. This sentence was upheld by a court of appeal in September.
Iran has arrested several dual or foreign nationals on bogus charges of plotting the overthrow of the Regime or spying on behalf of a foreign government since the 2015 nuclear deal was agreed.
These include Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman and his 80-year-old father, Bagher Namazi, a former UNICEF representative, who are serving 10 years and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British charity worker, who is serving five years and is being threatened with new charges.
Boris Johnson, the UK Foreign Secretary, met with the Iranian officials this weekend to discuss Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case.
Whitson said: “Iran should stop using the arbitrary arrest and mistreatment of foreign nationals as a component of its foreign policy and treat everyone, citizen and foreigner alike, with respect for their basic human rights.”
A pedestrian was hit and killed Monday night at an East Los Angeles crossing by a Metrolink train heading to San Bernardino.
The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.

Metrolink said on its Twitter account that trains on two additional San Bernardino lines were delayed because of the incident.
No other information on the victim was immediately available. No one on the train was injured.

Introducing a toddler to their new baby sibling isn't always easy, but in this case, it was hilarious.
Ava, 22 months, came into the room while her mom Ali Lukitsch, a teacher from Trenton, Mich., was feeding her new baby sister Hannah. The tot wasn't quite sure what was going on. First, she told little sister “no biting,” and Mom had to explain what she was doing and that she was getting milk.
That's when Ava wanted to know “where the chocolate milk” at!”
From the mouths of babes…
The video, shot by Ali's sister Stephanie Legut, has been shared thousands of times on social media and new mom Ali — who just gave birth to Hannah on Sunday — says she can hardly believe the reaction. “My husband was just asking how I feel about so many people seeing me and I'm just so focused on Ava … That's just her, in a nutshell, every day, Ali told 98.7 AMP Radio. “We could pop out a million more videos like that. I'm glad that people can see her personality.”
Ava is a regular ‘little Mama' who wants to do everything for the new baby, including helping to feed her, getting her dressed, and playing with her all the time. “It's just like her little live baby doll,” mom Ali said.
So, did she get her chocolate milk?
“She loves chocolate milk, yes she does,” Ali said, laughing. “She asked me again this morning, ‘Is she getting chocolate milk? I had to say ‘No, she's not getting chocolate milk!”
Pneumonia day was observed on November 12, and it is sad to know that according to reports, 92,000 children under the age of 5 die annually in Pakistan as victims of the disease.
Despite the provision of vaccines, the number of victims keeps on increasing.

It is proposed that media coverage on the issue be increased along with awareness programs, especially for women, around the country.
Children are the future of Pakistan and we ought to protect our future.

Wissinger alleged in an interview that NLRB lawyers are soliciting workers to accept deals on the spot or within hours, without sufficient opportunity to review final terms with the labor group's attorney, and in some cases without the workers fully understanding they are waiving their right to get their jobs back. "These workers have waited years, and all of a sudden they have to make a decision in 10 minutes because the general counsel wants to help McDonald's kill its case," he said.
The six reported victims in the deadly pedestrian bridge collapse at Florida International University in Miami on Thursday afternoon were publicly identified by police on Sunday.
Among the victims was Navaro Brown, a 37-year-old African-American man who worked for Structural Technologies VSL, a company that specializes in bridge cable tension and construction systems, NBC Miami reported. Brown, who worked on-site when the 950-ton bridge failed a “stress adjustment” before it collapsed over cars on a highway, died Thursday at a local hospital.
Alexa Duran, an 18-year-old FIU student and political science major who was looking forward to law school, was also killed in the tragedy. Police recovered Duran from a vehicle on Saturday night after rescuers searched through the rubble for days during recovery efforts.
Ronaldo Fraga Hernandez, Oswald Gonzalez and Alberto Arias were also confirmed as victims who had been pulled from crushed vehicles.
A sixth victim, Brandon Brownfield, was believed to be inside one of the other cars removed from the site on Saturday night.
Police believe all the victims have been recovered, officials said to CBS News.

Brownfield had three young daughters, having moved to Florida several years ago for his job at Maxim Crane Works, according to a fundraising page for the family that had raised more than $50,000 in a few days, CBS reported. He was on his way home from work when the bridge suddenly fell to the ground.
Gonzalez and Arias owned a party rental and decoration business together. Both men were found Saturday inside their white Chevy truck after the senseless tragedy. Drivers and witnesses posted startling footage of the collapse on social media.

Investigators are still trying to piece together what caused the bridge to crumble to the pavement. Crews had been involved in “post-tensioning” to secure the bridge at the time of the collapse.
Classes resumed at FIU on Monday.

Transfer window pits players against clubs in power struggle
by Reuters News 14 Aug 2017, 20:00 IST
Football Soccer - Barnet vs Swansea City - Pre Season Friendly - London, Britain - July 12, 2017 Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson Action Images via Reuters/Adam Holt
By Neil Robinson
LONDON (Reuters) - As the days tick down towards closure of the transfer window, millions of pounds worth of soccer talent is sitting idle in a series of high-stake standoffs.
Southampton's Virgil van Dijk, Chelsea's Diego Costa and Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurdsson all failed to turn out for their contracted employer on the opening day of the Premier League season and hope to trade up before August 31.
Meanwhile, Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho is sidelined with what the club said was a back injury after handing in a transfer request intended to force a move to Barcelona against the Reds' wishes.
All four players are under contract, the golden handcuffs traditionally used to tie them to their clubs. But the modern footballer is challenging such restraints, a trend the transfer window, with its artificial timeframe, exacerbates.
Earlier this year Dimitri Payet forced a move after refusing to play for West Ham United in the last window. The club eventually reluctantly sold him to to Olympique Marseille.
Costa, who is in Brazil rather than with his Chelsea teammates, is adopting a similar strategy. In a newspaper interview on Monday, the striker threatened to sit out, unpaid if necessary, the remaining two years on his contract if Chelsea do not allow him to move.
Costa's legal representative has reportedly threatened action citing possible discrimination, although one British sports contract expert contacted by Reuters doubted if such an action would succeed.
"For a repudiation breach (of contract) Chelsea would have had to stop paying his wages, singled him out or bullied him. They won't make that sort of bad move," Richard Cramer of FrontRow Legal told Reuters.
"But they might still sell him because a manager does not want a disillusioned player, so player power is very strong."
DOWNING TOOLS
Discontent is not restricted to specific clubs. Like Coutinho, Van Dijk has also handed in a transfer request and was left out of Southampton's opening day Premier League game with Swansea City, who also omitted Sigurdsson, their star midfielder of last year, as talks continue over a possible move to Everton.
Such situations are nothing new in football. Back in 1961, one of England's greatest players, Stanley Matthews, was told by Blackpool "you forget, as a player, we made you" when he agitated for a move that would double his wages to Stoke City, while West Ham United stopped Bobby Moore from moving to Tottenham Hotspur within months of his captaining England to their 1966 World Cup win.
However, players downing tools, like Payet and Costa, is a more modern phenomenon linked to Fifa's introduction of the harmonised transfer window in the 2002-03 season.
Before then, players could switch clubs in England at any time until March each year, a cut-off point intended to safeguard competition at the business end of the season.
Ironically, the change was introduced as part of a compromise agreement with the European Commission to enhance contractual stability, but increasingly the reverse seems the case, with both Coutinho and Van Dijk now seeking moves within months of agreeing multi-year contract extensions.
Liverpool's Steve Gerrard is among those believing that, in Coutinho's case, a red line may have been crossed.
"This is a huge test for the club from top to bottom. He has just signed a five-year deal, The least he can do is give them another year," he told BT Sport.
The problem, Gerrard admits, is that even if Coutinho agrees such a compromise, there is no guarantee Barcelona will return next year. "Barcelona will have been saying to his representatives 'it's now or never'."
Many observers believe the window should close before the season starts, a suggestion the Premier League is happy to lobby for.
"The problem is we operate in a European, and often a global market, so while they might be happy that the window closed in England they would be less happy to see their Spanish, German or Italian rivals continue to trade," a spokesman said.
The League has offered to raise the issue with the European Club Association and European Professional Football League, but change appears unlikely and so the unseemly conflict between players and clubs will look set to continue until the window slams shut, probably with a huge sense of relief all round.
The Professional Footballers' Association declined a request for an interview.

Tom Cruise celebrates this American 4th of July holiday by punching no-good Brit* Henry Cavill in a new teaser video for Mission: Impossible – Fallout. (*We're sure Cavill's actually a rather nice chap who hails from the delightful-sounding Channel Islands.) It's a quick-cut tease for the upcoming actioner that opens later this month and it briefly explains just why Cruise's returning and eternally youthful Ethan Hunt is engaging in fisticuffs against newcomer Cavill's badass, August Walker. It's also a nice reminder that the film opens in just a few weeks.
Twitter all-star Christopher McQuarrie‘s Mission: Impossible – Fallout also stars Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin, Wes Bentley, and Frederick Schmidt. Look for it in theaters on July 27th.
Check out the teaser below:
Here's the official synopsis for Mission: Impossible – Fallout:
The best intentions often come back to haunt you. Mission: Impossible – Fallout finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) along with some familiar allies (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan) in a race against time after a mission gone wrong. Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.

In my post on the Annual Edge Question the other day, which gave a link to my short piece on “determinism” on the Edge website, reader Coel made this comment:
A hope for the new year is that some commenters here might persuade PCC-E that many compatibilists do not see compatibilist notions of “free will” and “choice” as carny tricks or as evasion, nor as being what we tell the little people, but that we see them as useful and indeed necessary concepts for understanding human interactions. [JAC: In fact, I have several quotes from people like Dennett that we can't spread the view of determinism in society lest there be dire social consequences; these quotes are explicitly “little people” quotes.] To that end, I shall ask a question: Is there a meaningful sense in which one can say that wearing a hijab is a “choice” in America but not a choice in Iran or Saudi Arabia? Any determinist who answers “Yes” has then adopted the essentials of the compatibilist perspective (even if they then want to re-write the language). [And I presume that no determinist will answer “no”, and say that in neither country is there any meaningful “choice” in the matter, since whether one wears a hijab is just determined by the laws of physics, are they?]
I responded with this:
What I would say, to be accurate, is this: “The government compels its citizens to wear the hijab in Iran, but doesn't in the U.S.” I do use the word “choice,” but I always realize that its dualistic connotation is illusory. And, as I've already said (but don't want to argue this again), I frankly don't care about the semantic machinations of compatibilists. You and I both know that the laws of physics underlie whether one wears a hijab or not, and where. What is important to me is to grasp PHYSICAL DETERMINISM and work out its consequences. It's a semantic trick to do compatibilism because it undercuts what virtually everyone sees as “free will”: a dualistic free will. It's as if you're saying we can redefine “religious” to mean “full of awe” because there are similarities between religious people and Carl Sagan.
Now let me expand on that brief comment.
It's a common notion of compatibilist “free will” that we have that sort of will when we experience no external compulsion that forces us to do something. So a hijabi in Iran is under legal compulsion to veil her head, while a hijabi in, say, New York is not; therefore the later has a “free choice.” That, say compatibilists, is a meaningful sort of free will. My contention is that there is no meaningful difference here.
While I agree that the forms of environmental constraint that make one wear a hijab in Iran may differ from those affecting hijabis in the U.S., I think it's important to recognize that “compulsion”, whether it comes from the government or from your parents, is a.) still mediated through your neurons to result in a given behavior; b.) still a compulsion that cannot be resisted; and c.) still dictated, at bottom, by the laws of physics.
In my response I avoided using the word “choice” because I think you can express the same idea without the confusion of “choice.” But I still use that word in my daily life, yet when I think about it I always realize that it's an ostensible or illusory choice. And in writing about free will I do try to avoid it because of its common connotations, which might confuse the reader. Or I might put quotes around it: “choice.”
Regardless, though, is there a meaningful difference between a government decree on the one hand, or one's parents and one's peers whose influence makes you wear the hijab on the other? Both are part of the environment that affects one's brain, resulting in the donning of a headscarf.
But that's not all. Your brain, though the working of the environment (both developmental and social) on your evolved neural equipment, is always the source of compulsion. If you believe, as most readers do, that at any time there is only one possible action you can take, and that is determined by your genes and environment, then you are being compelled to act by your brain. Is there a substantive difference between the government acting on your brain, making you wear a hijab because you'll be punished if you don't, your parents and peers working on your brain, making you wear a hijab because you'll get social opprobrium if you don't, or other influences working on your brain, compelling you to wear a hijab because you want to feel more “Muslim,” or you like the way it looks.
In none of those cases could you have behaved otherwise. The only distinction was which environmental circumstances dictated your actions.
That is why I think there is no meaningful difference between doing something because you're being “forced” to or because you ostensibly “choose to.” In all cases you are being forced; the only thing that differs are the relevant forces. At what point, then, do we say that an American hijabi has exercised a compatibilist form of “free will”? If her parents pressure her? If her peers pressure her mildly? And remember that, in a social creature, external societal pressures nearly always help dictate what you do.
As I've always said, I don't care so much if you want to define the absence of government compulsion—or other issues like “humans have a very complex evolved brain”—as factors giving us “compatiabilist free will”. The issue for me has always been determinism of behavior, a determinism that rests on the laws of physics. To me that's important not only because it dispels the dualistic tenets of religion, but also can give us more empathy toward the downtrodden and the malefactors, and well as mitigating the regret we might feel for not having done different things.
Compulsion is compulsion, and it's always enacted through your neurons, whether those neurons be conditioned by the Iranian government, the views of your parents, or your need to feel more “Muslim”.
Dennis Edwards, the Detroit singer who replaced David Ruffin as lead singer of The Temptations in 1968, has passed away at the age of 74. Edwards died at his home in Chicago today (2/2), according to reports from his family and CBS Chicago. Edwards began his career as lead singer of another Motown group, The Contours, before being called into replace Ruffin after the singer's fallout with the group. Edwards' voice defined the sound of The Temptations through their funkiest period, in which he sang lead on major hits like “I Can't Get Next To You,” “Papa Was a Rolling Stone,” “Cloud Nine,” and “Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today).”
He remained at the head of the group through 1977 when the group left Motown Records. Upon their return to the label in 1980, Edwards was reinstated in the group. He also released three solo albums, and his 1984 Motown debut Don't Look Any Further and its title track charted in the Top 5 of the R&B charts. Edwards continued to perform Temptations material as part of splinter group The Temptations Revue Featuring Dennis Edwards up until last year.

Families flocked to Normanby Hall Country Park for a celebration of all things cycling.
The Cycling Extravaganza was held yesterday (Sunday, August 13) and formed part of the build-up to the Tour of Britain, which will see the whole of Stage Three contested in North Lincolnshire.
The event featured a range of attractions including storytelling from North Lincolnshire Council's library and information service and bike-themed craft activities from the museum service.
A bicycle trail around the park was also included, along with yoga for cyclists and runners, sports activities from the council's Street Sports team, movement and rhythm sessions from the Imagination Library team, cycle maintenance workshops and demonstrations by Cycle Route Lincs and training and nutrition workshops by Blizard Physiotherapy and Sports Performance.
More than 120 of the world's top cyclists will pedal around the country in the eight-stage Tour of Britain, which starts in Edinburgh on Sunday, September 3, and finishes in Cardiff on Sunday, September 10.
Stage Three, on Tuesday, September 5, will see the riders cover a 172km course starting at Normanby Hall and finishing near Central Park in Scunthorpe, taking in most of North Lincolnshire's towns and villages along the way.
Three years were worth the wait: San Fransisco rockers the Fresh & Onlys are back today with a new single “Wolf Lie Down” off their latest LP of the same name. The album is out later this summer and marks the band's sixth installment of genre-blending goodness. It's primarily the work of Tim Cohen and Wymond Miles, though former members Shayde Sartin, Kyle Gibson, James Kim, and James Barone all appear in some capacity.
“Wolf Lie Down” is a tight rock track that offers a mixture of psych, garage rock, and a scoop of western twang, all coming together in the form of a righteous summer song (think the Black Keys playing at a skatepark in the midwest). The guitar-heavy track features silky smooth vocals courtesy of Cohen that tie all the song's elements together. Listen to it below.
Tracklist:
01 “Wolf Lie Down”
02 “One Of A Kind”
03 “Qualm Of Innocence”
04 “Walking Blues”
05 “Dancing Chair”
06 “Impossible Man”
07 “Becomings”
08 “Black Widow”
Wolf Lie Down is out 8/25 on Sinderlyn. Pre-order it here.

Gimlet Media's Uncivil
Our new music feature Track by Track finds musicians delving into the deeper stories behind each track on their latest album.
Since being founded by Alex Blumberg and Matthew Lieber in 2014, Gimlet Media has become one of the biggest names in podcasting, with hits like Crimetown, Startup, and Reply All. Their latest achievement is Uncivil, a gripping series unearthing previously untold tales that reshape our vision of the Civil War. The debut episode of the pod, “The Raid”, just took home a Peabody Award for News, Radio, Podcast, and Public Service Programming.
But it wasn't just the fascinating storytelling that earned Uncivil the recognition. The team behind the podcast's soundtrack — Bobby Lord, Haley Shaw, Saidu Tejan-Thomas, and Matthew Boll — have been working hard to “better represent the stories being told and push the boundaries of what can be done with original music composition and sound design in audio storytelling,” as Boll puts it. They did so for Crimetown, again for the Mars Mission crew documentary The Habitat, and now for Uncivil.
Gimlet's third official soundtrack release, the score for Uncivil came together on both sides of the Union/Confederacy line, from the Mt. Zion A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina to Gimlet's own studios in Brooklyn, New York. Together with collaborators including JC Brooks, Ann Caldwell & The Magnolia Singers, Rocko Walker, and the Mt. Zion Choir, the team created 14 tracks that are as captivating a listen as the podcast stories themselves. Blending neo-soul, spiritual, gospel, and even a bit of hip-hop, the truly original music pays homage to the Civil War era while fitting beautifully into this modern medium, a reminder that narration isn't the only place where creativity shines in podcasting.
Take a listen to the whole thing below.
For more insight on how this remarkable album came together, Boll and Lord have broken down the Uncivil OST Track by Track.
“Long John”:
Bobby Lord (Uncivil mix engineer and composer): This is one of the first tracks we made, and it's based on the traditional African-American work song “It's A Long John”. I originally based the remix off of the actual Alan Lomax recording of the workers singing, but our producer Saidu Tejan-Thomas (also a musician on the soundtrack) and host Chenjerai Kumanyika helped us to better represent black voices with purpose, rather than co-opt the uncredited and unpaid singers in the Lomax recording. In this spirit, we asked JC Brooks, a friend and popular Chicago musician, and Rocko Walker to record their own reworking of the Lomax recording.
Matthew Boll (Uncivil music director): In a lot of ways this song was the start of building the soundtrack for Uncivil. We used the original work song recording as the guide and then commissioned those two different artists to essentially cover the song. Bobby then cut up all the parts and basically wrote a composition around it. Because of this approach the score for the show became this collaboration of different parts with the voices of the artists we recorded leading the way.
“Ship of Zion”:
BL: We went to Charleston, South Carolina to record authentic gullah-style choirs to be the basis of Uncivil's sound. (Gullah refers to the African-American people who live in the US Lowcountry). One of these choirs was the Mt. Zion Church Choir, and we were lucky enough to record them rehearsing in their beautiful church on Glebe Street. They did a version of an old hymn called “The Old Ship of Zion”, and this song is based around a vocal sample from the recording.
“Well Well Well”:
BL: The second choir we recorded in Charleston are called The Magnolia Singers, led by Ann Caldwell. We were lucky enough to record the five-piece group, made up of four women and one man, singing a bunch of their favorite hymns/standards. Uncivil host Chenjerai Kumanyika gave us a lot of neo-soul references when conceptualizing the shows sound, so this song is a good reflection of that.
“Hice Dah Winduh Nora”:
BL: Our producer Saidu Tejan-Thomas originally envisioned hearing black voices humming when he envisioned the sound of Uncivil. As Ann Caldwell and The Magnolia Singers sang this song, aka “Norah, Hist The Windah”, Saidu asked them if they could do it again, this time just humming.
MB: I think this was the first song we asked them to step outside the regular arrangement of the song and kind of riff on the harmonic structure. This really great choral thing happened. The singers had such a familiarity with this song it was amazing to see them walk around it like it was nothing. Of course Bobby then brought it back, took a beat from our studio sessions, and wrote the song around it again… turned out to be one of my favorite tracks.
“I Done Done”:
BL: This was one of the first songs made for the Uncivil soundtrack. I looped the bassist's part in The Magnolia Singers' version of “I Done Done What You Told Me To Do”, and started playing bass guitar under it. This informed the sound from there on out.
“Nobody's Fault But Mine”:
BL: The earliest references for Uncivil's sound were more hip-hop based than neo-soul. This is Ann Caldwell and The Magnolia Singers performing “Nobody's Fault But Mine”, originally written by Blind Willie Johnson, mashed up with one of the earlier, more hip-hop tracks.
“I'm Done That Too”:
BL: The spiritual sequel to “I Done Done” — made from the same Magnolia Singers track.
“Road So Lonesome”:
BL: This was originally a version of “I Wish I Was In Dixie”, aka “Dixie”, for our episode “The Song”. Co-host Jack Hitt said he wanted a version of “Dixie” that sounded like it was “walked into the gates of hell.” This idea was killed, and this song was repurposed with a sample from the Mt. Zion Choir.
“Run Children Run”:
BL: Based on another traditional work song, we mixed some Magnolia Singers singing together with music we recorded in New York to try to make a frantic, disconcerting atmosphere.
“Free At Last”:
BL: The sound of Uncivil became the intersection of Chenjerai's original neo-soul vision and Saidu's choral vision. This song, featured at the end of the episode “The Portrait”, is simply an unmodified version of The Magnolia Singers performing “Free At Last”. This one was too beautiful to mess with.
“Calid B x Ann C”:
MB: We have been working with Calid B's music at Gimlet for the past year or so. He's a great composer out of Chicago (and fun fact, wrote the theme song for our other podcast The Nod!). He provided some tracks to us for the show and one worked really well to mash up with Ann Caldwell's voice.
“Can't Help From Crying”:
BL: Based on another Blind Willie Johnson song, this is another Mt. Zion performance mixed with one of our neo-soul inspired tracks. Saidu likes this one and keeps it on his desktop.
“Hold My Dying Hand”:
MB: Haley Shaw (Gimlet engineer and composer), Bobby, Saidu and I spent a day at a studio in Chelsea, NY writing and recording a bunch of beats and progressions to use as sort of bed music throughout the show. In the end they were much more useful as beat samples to put the vocal recordings we made in South Carolina on. On this track, Saidu had set up this percussion circle and started playing this beat. Everything kind of fell in line behind it. The vocals on this track are from the Mt. Zion A.M.E. Choir.
Strategically located in the Indian Ocean , Maldives remained in the throes of the worst political crisis to have hit the archipelago in the past few years with President Abdulla Yameen showing no sign of implementing the Supreme Court ruling which ordered release of all political prisoners, including former President Mohamed Nasheed . "This will be sorted out soon... I'll deal with the SC," Yameen, according to sources in Male, told a gathering of supporters on Saturday.Nasheed, jailed for 13 years in 2015 on terrorism charges, got political asylum in 2016 in the UK, where he was allowed to go for medical treatment". He has since been living in Sri Lanka.An agency report late Saturday quoted Yameen as saying that he was willing to hold early polls and also looking to ensure that the court ruling is implemented in a manner that it doesn't cause "any difficulties to people".Senior MDP (the main opposition) leader and exforeign minister Ahmed Naseem told TOIYameen was working to appoint his "cronies'' to the Supreme Court. "We believe Yameen might threaten the sitting bench with arrest if they don't revert the decision,'' said Naseem. "There is no indication that Yameen is going to abide by the court ruling. We will welcome any action by India which can help change that,'' he added. It is significant that while countries like the US, Britain, Canada and India have weighed in with the assertion that implementing the ruling was important for restoring democracy, China has remained quiet on the issue. It is no secret that Yameen has a powerful backer in Beijing.After the court ruling, Nasheed has declared that he can and will contest the elections which should take place this year.In an interaction with TOI in February 2017, Nasheed had said that India had a moral obligation to facilitate "inclusive, free and fair elections in the Maldives" in 2018.Yameen's government on Saturday announced postponement of the functioning of the Maldives' Parliament due to "security reasons" fuelling the perception that he was not going to follow the ruling.The SC order has, according to the opposition, also cancelled an anti-defection ruling of 2017, thus reinstating 12 opposition MPs. This gave the opposition a clear majority in Parliament and that's the reason the opposition believes Yameen can no longer remain in power.
LILONGWE-(MaraviPost)-The Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) on Tuesday challenged the country's media managers on elections objective reporting by refrained from sensational reporting ahead of the 2019 Tripartite Elections.
MEC chairperson Jane Ansah said the media has a critical role to play in the electoral cycle through dissemination of accurate and balanced information.
“We are engaging media managers because they are gatekeepers who work with reporters. Noting that the forthcoming tripartite elections will be highly contentious, we thought of engaging them throughout the election cycle so that they should be equipped with knowledge and skills.
“Since it is difficult to regulate the social media, people pass false information which can cause a lot of problems in the election cycle. People mask names when reporting information and post sensational information,” urges Ansah.
In his remarks, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) chief technical adviser for elections Richard Cox noted that the media is instrumental in the provision of information throughout the elections cycle; hence, the need to share a common understanding with MEC.
“The media has a powerful role to play in the electoral process. We want a common understanding between MEC and the media in terms of the work undertaken to deliver electoral services.
“We understand that the media is biased all over the world but there should be a key understanding of the work that MEC is doing in the electoral process.”
MEC organised the two day media managers workshop targeting online, electronic and print media houses in equipping them with responsible elections reporting skills.

What's faster — a World War II-era, open-cockpit SNJ trainer plane at full throttle or the eight-time World Champion offshore racing catamaran?
Crowds at the Ocean City Air Show will find out on Father's Day weekend when two GEICO Skytyper planes compete against the superboat Miss GEICO in two, one-mile races along the shoreline.
The race follows the Skytypers' 18-minute low-level, precision-flying demonstration. The squadron of six SNJ aircraft will exhibit more than 20 different tactical maneuvers used by Allied Forces to win World War II and the Korean War, including ground strafing, formation bombardment, and aerial dogfighting.
As the GEICO Skytypers conclude their aerial demonstration, the Miss GEICO will make her entrance on the water.
The solo pilots from the Skytypers will break away from the squadron and swoop down to an altitude just above the deck of their water-bound counterpart, and the air versus sea duel will begin.
“Each race is utterly unpredictable,” says Miss GEICO throttle man Scott Begovich. “You've got a liquid track with constantly changing conditions like wave size and wind strength. The water conditions greatly affect our speed and handling capability. As the World War II-era aircraft descend for the race, they get so close that it feels like they could land on the deck of the boat.”
The planes will pit their 75-year-old, 550-hp Pratt & Whitney engines against Miss GEICO's piston-powered engines that produce nearly 4,000 total horsepower.
Technically, the SNJs are rated at a top speed of 213 mph at 6,000 feet. The Miss GEICO, on the other hand, frequently approaches 200 mph during its 45-minute races against the world's fastest powerboats when conditions are ideal.
Tom Daly, GEICO Skytyper lead solo pilot, says experience and skill are the real differentiators.
“The boat will be tough to beat because it has more power and is completely state of the art,” he said. “But we rely on expert management of geometry and physics to extract the maximum output possible out of these vintage aircraft.”
“The Ocean City Air Show gives the public a rare chance to witness this air-sea duel. The race is something we only do a couple of times each year,” says Miss GEICO driver Marc Granet. “The GEICO Skytypers fly a tight demonstration, but when it comes to racing, we like to win and that's what we intend to do!”
Because nothing spells NFL dominance like a bugle boy armed with a frilly towel, the Los Angeles Chargers decided to offer a unique new sideline experience for fans.
To be dubbed the “Bolts Bugler” per ESPN's Eric D. Williams, L.A. will have one (or perhaps multiple) buglers on the sidelines to encourage fan engagement during games at StubHub Center Sunday.
A new element to the fan experience for Chargers games: Bolts Bugler. https://t.co/5BLmXpaLaX pic.twitter.com/GU3dbbMwKR — Eric Williams (@eric_d_williams) August 13, 2017
The use of buglers on the sidelines is somewhat odd, as they often put in mind soldiers playing “Taps” on such horns in honor of fallen military personnel.
However, according to Williams' images, these buglers will not be playing sad songs as they will find themselves at the forefront of the Bolts' “Fight for L.A.” campaign by looking to pump Chargers fans up.
Los Angeles takes on the Seattle Seahawks at the 30,000 capacity StubHub Center at 5 p.m. PT.
Quarterback Philip Rivers is expected to see the field for one series, and the Chargers will be taking a hard look at their offensive line and young defenders all Sunday.

Defense Secretary James N. Mattis warned Monday that if North Korea carried out its threat to launch missiles toward Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific, it could escalate to war.
“If they fire at the United States it could escalate into war very quickly,” Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. “That's called war, if they shoot at us.... You don't shoot at people in this world unless you want to bear the consequences.”
Mattis cited a classic Hollywood political satire about nuclear war to say he wasn't drawing red lines or making idle threats to spark a confrontation.
“It's not declaring war -- it's not that I'm over here, Dr. Strangelove, doing things like that,” he said.
North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile last month for the first time, and U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Pyongyang can build a nuclear warhead small enough to fit atop a long-range missile, although it's not clear if it can target U.S. cities.
The latest missile tests led to a sharp rise in tensions. The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to add new sanctions on North Korea and President Trump warned he would unleash "fire and fury" if Pyongyang continued its threats.
On Tuesday, North Korea said its autocratic ruler, Kim Jong-un, had reviewed a plan to fire four mid-range missiles over Japan and into international waters at least 20 miles off Guam, where the U.S. military operates several major bases.
Mattis said a North Korean missile hitting the U.S. territory, or the continental United States, was an act of war and would almost certainly trigger a U.S. military retaliation.
He was ambiguous as to how Washington would respond if Pyongyang launched a missile toward Guam as a show of force, and it landed far offshore.
“War is up to the president, and perhaps up to Congress,” Mattis said. “The bottom line is we will defend the country from attack.”
The U.S. military would be able to determine if a North Korean missile is headed toward Guam “within moments,” he said, because of spy satellites, radars and other high-tech sensors that track missile launches.
If necessary, "we'll take it out," Mattis said, suggesting the U.S. military would attempt to shoot it down with anti-missile interceptors on land and ships.
Earlier, Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to defuse tensions in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that said the Trump administration did not seek "regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea," issues of special concern to China, which supports Pyongyang.
Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived late Monday in Beijing to meet with Chinese military leaders. Earlier, he met with South Korea President Moon Jae-in at Osan Air Base, a U.S. Air Force base about 40 miles south of Seoul.
Dunford said in Beijing that his goal was to "continue to develop our military-to-military relationships, to mitigate the risk of miscalculation in the region and to have cooperation where those opportunities exist,” according to a Pentagon statement.
MIAMI-Rookie Wesley Bryan carded a four-under par 67 on Sunday to claim his first US PGA Tour title, edging former world number one Luke Donald by one stroke at the Heritage.
Bryan's four-under effort at Harbour Town in Hilton Head, South Carolina, gave him a 13-under par total of 271. He became the first South Carolina-born player to win the event since it was launched in 1969. Bryan also booked his invitation to next year's Masters.
After a dominant season on the developmental Web.com Tour last year, Bryan admitted he had hoped to win on the main tour in time to book a berth in this year's Masters -- which was won by Sergio Garcia last week. "But I guess the week after Augusta's not too bad," he said. After a bogey at the third, Bryan strung together four straight birdies before another bogey at the eighth.
After birdies at 13 and 15 he arrived at 17 to realize he was within sight of victory. "Honestly I wasn't nervous at all all day," he said. "Then at number 17 I got up and I just threw up a little bit in my mouth, and I was like, 'Well, shoot, I guess this is what nervous feels like.' "But I was able to get it back together," he added.
For England's Donald it was a fifth runner-up finish at Harbour Town. He got off to a rocky start with a double-bogey seven at the par-five second but had five birdies the rest of the way in his 68 for 272. It was a further stroke back to Americans Patrick Cantlay, Ollie Schniederjans and William McGirt.
Overnight leader Jason Dufner slid down the leaderboard with a five-over 76 that included a double bogey and four bogeys after his only birdie of the day, at the second hole.
SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP)  A Northern California public broadcasting station will receive $72 million for changing its channel.
The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports (http://bit.ly/2lLNzb2 ) that Sonoma County's station KRCB announced Monday that it will receive the windfall under an agreement that is part of a national effort to free up airwaves for the wireless telecom industry.
When the agreement takes effect next year, KRCB will continue to broadcast on Channel 22 but will stop doing so by UHF transmission, meaning it will only reach Sonoma County, not larger portions of the North Coast.
The money comes from a 10-month auction organized by the Federal Communications Commission. Participating commercial and public stations agreed to give up their spots on the broadcast spectrum to wireless providers such as AT&T and Verizon.

As local school committees struggle with impossibly tight budgets, an additional confounding factor has become the accommodation of students displaced from Puerto Rico as a result of the devastating hurricanes last year. In light of this, it was heartening to see the Baker administration announce that school districts will soon have access to increased funding to help them serve those evacuee students.
Springfield, having accepted the lion's share of student evacuees will receive the largest allocation of funds, $1.8 million out of the total $15 million that has been allocated statewide thus far. Chicopee and Holyoke will also see additional funding in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This kind of investment will help ensure that our public schools will have the tools they need to assist students from Puerto Rico who have come to our Commonwealth in need of help, while ensuring there is no measurable loss in quality of education to the students who already reside here.
Massachusetts is taking a leadership role in assisting our fellow Americans from Puerto Rico as they seek to cope with the devastating impact of last fall's hurricanes. In announcing these funds, Governor Baker has demonstrated that he and his team are committed to ensuring the state continues its tradition of assisting our fellow Americans at a time of distress.
Ensuring that we serve these students effectively is going to take the commitment and dedication of public officials at all levels of government. It's nice to see leaders at the state level step up and do their part.

Russian Journalist Thought Killed Is Alive Ukrainian authorities say the murder of journalist Arkady Babchenko was staged in order to catch a man they say was hired by Russian intelligence services to kill him.
Ross Brawn believes Mercedes will continue to dominate next season and he feels the sport must look at how it can improve overtaking for the future. (1:38)
Lewis Hamilton says he has not considered the prospect of retiring from Formula One before the current engine regulation cycle expires in 2020.
Hamilton, who has won three of the last four championships with Mercedes, enters the final year of his current deal in 2018. The Englishman moved clear of Michael Schumacher's record for pole positions in 2017 but has said he has made it clear he has no ambition to actively chase or beat the German's tally of seven titles.
Despite that, he sees no reason to quit F1 while he is still enjoying his racing.
"I think about what is ahead of me," the four-time world champion said. "I have spoken to those who have retired early, those who retired late and everyone says stay in as long as you can. That's not going to happen.
"The seasons are getting longer and longer and you see the things I do outside, which take a lot of my energy and time. I'm enjoying what I'm doing now. I enjoy being with this team, I love racing and I still feel at the moment I'm driving at my best."

"While the car is in this form of rules until 2021 at least, I think that's going to be the window I'm still here. Who knows? Maybe in 2021 I'll hand the baton over to [Mercedes junior] George [Russell]. He'll be there anyway before then. I'm going to keep going."
Both Mercedes drivers will be out of contract next season, with Valtteri Bottas handed a one-year contract extension earlier this year. Bottas' seat is likely to be the focus of more attention in next year's driver market speculation, with Daniel Ricciardo also entering the final year of his deal with Red Bull.
ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Four days after suffering a transverse process fracture in his back, Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr surprisingly practiced on Thursday.
Carr went through the stretch period and threw passes to receivers during the open media window portion of practice.
Officially, Carr was listed as being limited.
A day earlier, Carr was doing non-weight bearing work in the team's rehab pool at the facility as practice began.
Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said Monday that Carr would be out two to six weeks.
"He said he's sorry," Del Rio said at the time. "Great kid. He'll bounce back. I told him that the team will take care of business while he's healing and just get healed up and when he can come back, he'll come back."
Carr was injured on a sack by Adam Gotsis late in the third quarter of the Raiders' 16-10 loss at the Denver Broncos on Sunday when he was twisted down awkwardly.
"Pain," Carr said Sunday, describing what he felt when he went down. "My back didn't feel too good."
Carr, who signed a then-record five-year, $125 million contract in June, endured a fractured pinkie on his passing hand last November and a broken fibula on his right leg in Week 16.
He has passed for 753 yards with seven touchdowns and two interceptions while completing 67.9 percent of his passes thus far this season. But despite his presence on the practice field, Carr is still expected to miss at least this weekend's home game against the Baltimore Ravens.
EJ Manuel will start at quarterback for Oakland against the Ravens.
Players can typically return to play as the pain allows, even as the bone continues to heal because of the low risk involved.
Panthers quarterback Cam Newton suffered two transverse process fractures in a car accident in 2014 and missed one game. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo also missed only one game after suffering two transverse process fractures in a game in 2014, the result of a knee in the back by Washington linebacker Keenan Robinson.
New additions to the Governor's Garden
Columbia, SC (WOLO) — Spring is in the air, especially on the grounds surrounding the Governor's Mansion that are definitely a little more colorful now.
Tuesday, Governor Henry McMaster and members of the Audubon Society dedicated a garden of native plants in honor of our state's birds. And they are only getting started. Overall, the group plans to plant 500 indigenous South Carolina plants and install 13 bird houses on the Mansion grounds.
A violent Dunstable robbery which saw victims attacked with baseball bats has been described by police as “vicious” and “unprovoked”.
At around midnight on Saturday (June 10) two men were walking along Mountview Avenue when they were approached by two men carrying baseball bats.
The offenders, who had their faces covered, demanded money and when the victims refused they attacked them with the bats.
The victims were taken to hospital with serious injuries.
Detective Constable Colin Knight, investigating, said: “This was a vicious and unprovoked attack which caused serious harm to the victims. Robbery is unacceptable and violence of any kind will not be tolerated. I am keen to speak to anyone who saw two men acting suspiciously in the area at the time, or who has any information on the incident to get in touch.”

As we all know, Stephen Hawking is a medical anomaly, for he lived for over half a century with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)—a disease that usually kills you within just a few years of diagnosis. As far as I know, he had the disease for longer than any human in history.
But did he really have ALS?
The Torygraph has a new article, based on a physician's letter sent to to the Financial Times that after some effort, I finally found unpaywalled. Here it is (I think the first sentence is an unintended double entendre):
Well, this dude is a physician, and what do I know? But my impression of polio was that it does most of its damage at the outset, and doesn't get progressively worse over decades, as Hawking's illness seems to have done. Not that his polio—if that's what he had—could have been ameliorated, but didn't doctor think of that? And there must surely be a test to see if you have a virus versus ALS.
Perhaps Hawking was simply an outlier: a very rare case of hyper-longevity that has been seen in other fatal diseases. (Steve Gould's cure of mesothelioma is similar.)
Well, it's not of great import what disease killed Hawking; what I found more interesting was this article, also in the Torygraph (click on screenshot to see it).
An excerpt:
A final theory explaining how mankind might detect parallel universes was completed by Stephen Hawking shortly before he died, it has emerged. Colleagues have revealed the renowned theoretical physicist's final academic work was to set out the groundbreaking mathematics needed for a spacecraft to find traces of multiple big bangs. Currently being reviewed by a leading scientific journal, the paper, named A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation, may turn out to be Hawking's most important scientific legacy. Fellow researchers have said that if the evidence which the new theory promises had been discovered before Hawking died last week, it may have secured the Nobel Prize which had eluded him for so long.
The problem with the idea of a multiverse, an idea that fascinates me, is that it seemed largely untestable. Hawking's paper implies that this might not be the case:
Carlos Frenk, professor of cosmology at Durham University, told The Sunday Times: The intriguing idea in Hawking's paper is that [the multiverse] left its imprint on the background radiation permeating our universe and we could measure it with a detector on a spaceship.
“These ideas offer the breathtaking prospect of finding evidence for the existence of other universe.” We shall see. This is above my pay grade, so watch our Official Website Physicist™ Sean Carroll's website for updates. His latest post is a nice summary of Hawking's scientific contributions.

The drama on Sister Wives has always been up there with some of the best on reality television, but Meri Brown's catfishing scandal was one of the craziest developments on TV last year.
The drama continued on Sister Wives Season 7 Episode 6, with Meri struggling to move on in the aftermath of it, but why did Kody just want to move on from it?
He did not want the perpetrator to get any more ammunition to use against the family.
While that is definitely a good reason, Meri needed some closure and that closure came in the form of causing some more drama.
Meri decided that the best course of action would be to go meet up with a woman named Cheryl, who was targeted by the same person. She kept Kody in the dark about the whole thing until she booked her flight to Atlanta.
As you probably know if you watch Sister Wives online, Kody Brown does not like being blindsided, but there was really not much he could do about this one.
It's not like Meri was going to get the …read more

CAROLINA-The children of a South Carolina politician accused of battering his wife can be heard screaming “just stop, Daddy” on a 911 call recording.
Republican representative Chris Corley has been charged with first degree domestic violence and pointing a firearm at a person. The call was made on Monday evening, and released by police to local media. Mr Corley, 36, recently voted for legislation toughening punishments for domestic violence.
“Just stop Daddy. Just stop...Daddy, why are you doing this?'' can be heard in a recording released to the Aiken Standard newspaper.
In a second call, a woman identified by the Aiken County Sheriff's Office as Mr Corley's mother-in-law tells a dispatcher: “He beat his wife and he's threatening to kill himself.''
Mr Corley hit his wife “about the head and face with a closed fist” before pointing a handgun at her, the Aiken Standard reports, citing the arrest warrant.
The violence was allegedly committed in front of an 8-year-old child.
The couple have three children.
Mr Corley told police his wife thought he was cheating on her, and he pushed her away when she attempted to strike him, the newspaper reports.
The 36-year-old attorney is known for his efforts to keep the Confederate flag flying outside the South Carolina state house.
The flag was removed in July 2015 after the massacre of nine people in a black church in Charleston by white supremacist Dylann Roof.
During a debate on the issue last year Mr Corley suggested that the Confederate flag should be replaced with the white flag of surrender.
Mr Corley was released on a $20,000 bond and could face up to 15 years in jail if convicted of both charges.

“I'm doing this for the grandchildren of the world, including mine and their children,” said the 70-year-old. “This is insane, you can't even quantify how much fresh water this pipeline crosses.”
“This is a challenge to them. Come and get me boys.”
WATCH: Global News coverage of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion
Protesters have been tying themselves to gates and machinery in an effort to disrupt work on the controversial pipeline project.
Burnaby RCMP says it arrested 28 people on Saturday for breaching a permanent court-ordered injunction that prevents protesters from blocking access to Trans Mountain work sites. That followed arrests on Friday and the previous week.

Christenson said he climbed the barbed-wire fence at the crack of dawn so no one could see him.
“I watched the workers come in as the light came into the sky and they didn't notice me. I was really quiet,” he said. “Until one guy looked up and said, ‘How the heck did you get up there?'”

Earlier this month, on Aug. 2, a body was discovered close to Tobique Narrows. An autopsy and further investigation identified the remains as those of 42-year-old Tony Vaillancourt. Police say he had not been in contact with family or friends since April 9, 2017.

Last week, Health and Human Services drew criticism after reports that 1,475 of the children they placed last year were "missing,” according to a phone survey 30 days later. Trump administration officials responded by announcing an agreement by Health and Human Services to give the Department of Homeland Security access to information about sponsors they're still vetting, and to improve the process, fingerprinting parents who attempt to claim children. Homeland Security officials said the new coordination will better protect migrant children, but some migrant advocates worry it could deter families from claiming children.
Beck should give the Grammy back. Kanye West is wrong a lot, but he was right about this. Back in 2015, Beck took home an Album Of The Year Grammy for the thoroughly OK pastoral lifestyle-folk album Morning Phase, and Kanye pretended that he was going to storm the stage before laughing and waving it off. But after the show was over, West said that he really wasn't kidding at all: “Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyoncé.” It was nothing new to see the Grammys honoring a perfectly pleasant work over a moment-defining one, and lord knows Beck has made a lot of great music over the past few decades and deserves some sort of grand recognition. But follow-through matters. After Beyoncé lost the Album Of The Year Grammy for her self-titled album, she went on to make Lemonade, an even-more-devastating interrogation of race and gender and relationships and public image, which then went on to lose Album Of The Year to Adele. Beck, on the other hand, won Album Of The Year, and he went on to make some bullshit.
There was a quick moment, about 20 years ago, when pop music began to sound like Beck. Beck's bemused, shuffling, channel-surfing aesthetic had come along, looking like a beam of light and bringing a whole new sound and style into the mainstream. All of a sudden, everyone was doing slackjawed absurdist half-raps over dusty breakbeats. Underground standbys the Butthole Surfers scored their biggest-ever hit with a transparent Beck bite. One-hit wonders Primitive Radio Gods scored their only-ever hit with another transparent Beck bite. Hanson — three fresh-faced Oklahoma children, all of whom were big Beck fans and all of whom sort of looked like Beck — teamed up with Beck's Odelay producers the Dust Brothers to make “MMMBop,” a gloriously ecstatic burst of nonsense that arguably kicked off the whole late-'90s teen-pop wave. Pop music was reshaping itself around Beck, doing what it could to absorb him, while Beck himself was recording one-offs for indie labels like Bongload and K or making delirious album-length Prince homages. He wasn't really playing the game, and so the game changed. But Colors is what happens when Beck tries to play the game, when he tries to sound like pop music. It is a dismal and overwhelming failure.
The idea behind Colors was a good one. Immediately after making Morning Phase, Beck wanted to shake himself out of that bucolic trance, to make a joyous and funky and urgent party-music record, the sort of polyglot stew that he came up making. He started out working with Pharrell, though none of the music from those sessions made it onto the record. He wanted to make the album quickly, to release it in the same year as Morning Phase. That didn't happen, either. Instead, he ended up working with the pop super-producer Greg Kurstin. Again, this was not, on the face of it, a terrible idea. Kurstin and Beck have a history. After Kurstin was a member of '90s Beck-alikes Geggy Tah but before he became the guy who produced Adele records, Kurstin was a member of Beck's live band, and he played on a couple of Beck's '00s records. These guys know each other well. And yet Kurstin is exactly the wrong person to work on a Beck album in 2017. His gleaming, antiseptic aesthetic leeches out all the anarchic joy that Beck was, at least theoretically, trying to recapture. And so Colors is the worst kind of mess. It's a boring mess.
Musically, Colors is a lot closer to recent-vintage Maroon 5 or OK Go than it is to classic-era Beck. It's streamlined, compressed digital-power pop — not terribly executed, but terribly bereft of ideas. “I'm So Free” has a big, crunching guitar riff and pseudo-Beach Boys backing harmonies. “No Distraction” is the sort of song that a TV-show music supervisor might option if the Cars were too expensive. “Up All Night” is simplistically starry-eyed, disco-addled open-sunroof music, like Beck intentionally set out to make his very own “Get Lucky.” The whole thing has that ultra-clean session-musician sheen to it. It sounds bright, but its brightness is studiously buffered. It sounds like work.
Lyrically, Beck is back to his old free-associative tricks, but it sounds like a gimmick, not like a guy doing his best to cope with the overwhelming media-blitz that he can't quite process. A lot of the time, his lyrics feel like something a 1996 college sophomore might write if she were attempting Beck-type lyrics as an English assignment: “I'm on a tangent / Textbook ephemeral / Facts are confusing me / I'm so free now,” “Standin' on the lawn doin' jiu jitsu / Girl in a bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu.” And every once in a while, Beck will go straight from that stuff to straight-up, unalloyed cliche: “There's nothing I wouldn't rather do / I just wanna stay up all night with you.” And again, Kurstin's production is all wrong for this sort of thing. Beck's capable of conveying melody just fine, but when he's doing uptempo music, he needs to alternate his big hooks with bemused mutters that sink into the tracks. Kurstin's tracks won't let him sink in. The songs here leave Beck out there, standing in the open, looking like an asshole talking about “The apple flower doggere, the batteries burst.”
It's not all bad. At its best, the album is merely underwhelming. The two-year-old single “Dreams” has a sense of giddy propulsion that hasn't quite worn off, and the album-closing ballad “Fix Me” is genuinely pretty in its own discomfitingly shiny way. But you know how, sometimes, an underwhelming early single will find heft and context when you hear it as part of the larger whole of an album? The opposite happens here. Fully half of the songs on Colors have hit the internet, in one form or another, over the past couple of years. On their own, they were mostly not great. Heard all in a row, they drain one another of life, becoming even more gray and featureless than they were by themselves. Beck is clearly trying to make fun music, music for festivals. Instead, he's given us a grim party-time slog.
Twenty years ago, Beck was making music with its own sense of logic and swagger. He had hooks, but to get to those hooks, you had to learn to appreciate his cutting meaninglessness and his intentionally sloppy sample-everything sense of excess. Heard today, those old records still burst with life; think of how amazing “Devil's Haircut” sounded during the Chicago-montage opening credits of The Big Sick. That swagger is gone. In its place is the craven flop-sweat of desperation. He's trying to make music that will resonate now. Instead, he's made an album of music that will play at barely-perceptible volumes in mall clothing stores, music that will soundtrack Isuzu commercials for months to come. Beck's made so much good music over the years, and maybe one day he can recapture the restless silliness that he so utterly failed to conjure here. Right now, though, that Beck is gone. Baby, he's a lost cause.

San Francisco — A UPS employee opened fire at a San Francisco package delivery facility on Wednesday, killing three employees and then himself as officers closed in, police and the company said.
San Francisco assistant police chief Toney Chaplin said a news conference that two others were wounded in the shooting that prompted a massive police response in downtown San Francisco.
Police have not determined a motive. Chaplin said that the shooter was armed with an assault pistol and put the weapon to his head and pulled the trigger when police found him.
A UPS statement said the shooter and all the victims were employees. Spokesman Steve Gaut told The Associated Press that the gunman opened fire inside the facility before the drivers were sent out for their daily deliveries.
Neighbors said they heard up to eight rapid gunshots.
“It was like tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat,” said Raymond Deng, who lives across the street from the warehouse.
After the gunfire, auto shop owner Robert Kim said he saw “a mob of UPS drivers” running down the street screaming “shooter, shooter.”
Deng, 30, a data scientist for a start-up company, also saw workers fleeing and another group of about 10 who gathered on the roof and held their hands up as police arrived.
“I saw police officers go up from the ramp and then storm the buildings,” he said. “It's crazy.”
Police responding to the facility in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, about 2 ½ miles from downtown San Francisco, found wounded victims and pulled them to safety. Then they found the gunman, who killed himself.
Investigators recovered two firearms from the scene.
Uniformed UPS employees were later led out in a line by officers next to a highway. They walked away calmly with emergency vehicles nearby and gathered nearby outside a restaurant.
It came the same day a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others.

Aetna And Humana Call Off Merger After Court Decision
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jessica Hill/AP Jessica Hill/AP
Health insurance companies Aetna and Humana have called off their planned merger, citing a federal court ruling last month that blocked the deal.
"While we continue to believe that a combined company would create greater value for health care consumers through improved affordability and quality, the current environment makes it too challenging to continue pursuing the transaction," Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement.
Aetna announced it would pay Humana a $1 billion fee for backing out of the agreement. Humana announced about $370 million of that would be paid as taxes.
In January, a federal judge ruled against Aetna's proposed acquisition of Humana in a victory for former President Obama's Justice Department, which sued Aetna last year.
As we reported:
"The suit alleged that the merger would hurt competition in the health care market, leading to higher prices for consumers and fewer services for Medicare patients. "U.S. District Judge John Bates found that to be the case, writing in his decision that, 'the merger of Aetna and Humana would be likely to substantially lessen competition in markets for individual Medicare Advantage plans and health insurance sold on the public exchanges' in 364 counties. "Medicare Advantage plans are privately run but reimbursed by Medicare."
In his decision, Judge Bates also spent considerable time discussing the motive behind Aetna's decision to withdraw its insurance plans from 17 counties where Aetna and Humana both sold plans on the public exchanges.
As NPR's Scott Hensley reported, a letter leaked to reporters last summer indicated Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini had tied his company's decisions about participating in the exchanges to the Justice Department's decision on the merger.
Bates rejected Aetna's claim that it had withdrawn its insurance plans for business reasons, writing that, "Aetna tried to leverage its participation in the exchanges for favorable treatment from DOJ regarding the proposed merger."
That leveraging clearly didn't work — the DOJ sued Aetna and, with Bates's ruling and today's announcement, decisively won.
The termination of the Aetna-Humana deal comes less than a week after another federal judge blocked a proposed merger between health insurance companies Anthem and Cigna.
On Feb. 8, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the Justice Department's opposition to the Anthem-Cigna deal was well-founded, and that the merger would reduce competition in the health insurance market and raise prices, as we reported.
Anthem said it was appealing the decision, The Wall Street Journal reported.
It is troubling enough to see ourselves on the same pedestal as we were before on Mukhtara Mai case few years ago.
The recent rape case in Multan is portrays a horrible situation of our society.
It's not one rapist that should be punished, it's the clans of fifteen people responsible for a sin that cannot be forgiven at any cost.
It's a violent crime and what is more frightening is to witness so many people involve in this heinous act.
One should appreciate the efforts of Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif who held the people responsible by visiting Multan and ordering strong actions against the entire Panchayat.
Also, the viciousness against Women Centre is also an significant step by the government.
I wish and hope that such cases are discouraged in our society.

"Royal Caribbean generated a lot of discussion early last week when the web page included shorts as acceptable attire. That decision drew the ire of many traditionalists, who did not think it was appropriate. This latest website update reverses the policy and clarifies the cruise line's stance on the issue," according to the line's blog.
Technology companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Monday, driving the market to another set of milestones.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average finished at new highs. Both indexes also set record highs Friday.
Solid gains by healthcare companies also helped lift the market, outweighing losses among banks and industrial stocks. Energy stocks rose along with the price of crude oil.
Investors had their eye on bitcoin futures, which made their market debut. But traders were mostly looking ahead to the outcome of Wednesday's meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers.
“The market is kind of in a holding pattern, just sort of waiting for the Fed meeting,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab.
The S&P 500 index rose 8.49 points, or 0.3%, to 2,659.99. The index has had three up weeks in a row. The Dow rose 56.87 points, or 0.2%, to 24,386.03. The Nasdaq composite advanced 35 points, or 0.5%, to 6,875.08. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks slipped 1.88 points, or 0.1%, to 1,519.84.
The Fed is scheduled to issue an interest rate policy update Wednesday. Economists expect the central bank to lift short-term rates by 0.25 of a point. That would be the third interest rate hike by the central bank this year.
Although inflation has remained low, the central bank has seen a path to gradually raise rates as the economy and labor market have strengthened.
Technology companies accounted for much of the market's gains Monday.
Symantec rose 4.4% to $29.22. Apple went up 1.9% to $172.67 after the website Apple Insider said the company is delivering new iPhones to customers at a faster pace.
In the healthcare sector, Allergan climbed 3% to $172.76.
Bluebird Bio surged 17.9% to $201.80 after the drugmaker it reported results from an early study of a cancer treatment it is developing with Celgene. Celgene rose 1.8% to $108.
Spark Therapeutics plunged 35% to $47.72 and competitor BioMarin Pharmaceutical climbed 7.5% to $88.11 after both reported data on experimental treatments for hemophilia A.
As bitcoin futures jumped on their first day of trading on a major U.S. exchange, online retailer Overstock.com — which accepts the virtual currency — surged 22% to $55.
Shares in banks and other financial companies declined. Zions Bancorporation fell 1.9% to $49.94.
Several industrial companies also posted losses, including Verisk Analytics. Verisk fell 1.9% to $94.32.
Oil and gas prices rose, boosting energy sector stocks. Chesapeake Energy climbed 4.1% to $3.83.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 63 cents, or 1.1%, to $57.99 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $1.29, or 2%, to close at $64.69 a barrel.
In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 1 cent to $1.73 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.95 a gallon. Natural gas rose 6 cents, or 2%, to $2.83 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold slipped $1.50 to settle at $1,246.90 an ounce. Silver fell 4 cents to $15.79 an ounce. Copper rose 3 cents to $3.01 a pound.
Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.38%.
The dollar edged up to 113.52 yen from 113.51 yen. The euro rose to $1.1786 from $1.1768.

Businesses in North Lincolnshire have been urged to bid for a share of a new fund which will encourage innovation and aim to improve health through digital technology.
A total of £8 million is being made available through the Government's Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund and North Lincolnshire Council bosses are encouraging firms in the region to pursue cash from it.
The money is expected to contribute to projects across a range of technologies which could help patients with their treatments, improve clinical decision making and improve disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment and long-term care.
Projects to benefit could include those using technology such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning, informatics, data analysis and process and use of sensors and networks.
Funding available for each project is expected to be between £300,000 and £1 million, with schemes lasting up to 30 months, and businesses could attract up to 70 per cent of their costs.
Council leader Rob Waltham said: "I welcome this initiative by the Government. This funding is about driving, and being part of, the innovation agenda.
"We want businesses in North Lincolnshire to consider the opportunities this fund opens to them and we really want to see our employment grow particularly in these higher wage sectors.
"The money is being made available through the Government's Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. Projects must be led by a small or medium enterprise (SME), working with at least one partner.
"This initiative presents a great opportunity for businesses to look at ways they can improve their existing processes by using digital solutions.
"This will not only save time and money, it will ultimately improve outcomes for patients."
Applications for a share of the funding will open on Thursday, February 15 and will close at noon on Wednesday, April 18.

Actor Robson Green said the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was a fan of his former musical duo Robson and Jerome.
The TV star, who appears in the return of period drama Grantchester this weekend, said Diana and the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, would "sing along" to their tunes.
He told the Radio Times of when he learned of their adoration, while speaking about his dedicated fans who still manage to seek him out despite his remote home in Northumberland.
Green said of his fans: "They're always there anyway. All these women going 'It's him! It's him!'.
"But guess who was a huge fan of Robson and Jerome? Princess Diana.
"Fergie told me that she and Diana used to sing along to us. They danced to it on a ski trip to the Alps."
Robson and Jerome, consisting of Green and his Soldier Soldier co-star Jerome Flynn, were known for their catalogue of cover versions of songs in the 1990s.
Their biggest hits included Unchained Melody and What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted.
Green, 52, also spoke about being "devastated" when his house and possessions were washed away in a flood two years ago.
He said: "I live in an old ferryman's cottage that's 350 years old, and I love it. I've got Hadrian's Wall to the north and there are pheasants and deer in the garden every morning.
"But in 2015, my house was under 7ft of water, destroyed in a flood.
"Everything precious and personal in my life, just washed away. It was very painful, I was devastated. Not only were there salmon going down the Tyne that day, my three-piece suite was, too."
He praised the emergency services who helped him out during the incident.
"I thought, 'Well, I have my health'. And I felt I'd happily pay 50 per cent tax for the fire and rescue services because, man, they don't get enough," Green said.
"It was very moving: one came in and she said, 'Come on, we've got a cup of tea for you'."
Green reprises his role as Detective Inspector Geordie Keating in the detective drama set in the 1950s Cambridgeshire when it returns to ITV on Sunday at 9pm.

The Malawi national netball team is geared to put up stellar performances during the Quad Series and Commonwealth Games, with three professional players joining the squad in Australia.
England-based Joyce Mvula and Lauren Ngwira joined their colleagues Sunday while Melbourne Vixens top shooter, Mwawi Kumwenda, will link up with the team at Brisbane Airport in Australia today enroute to New Zealand.
Local-based Queens players left the country on Saturday and arrangements were made to link up with the three ahead of the Taini Jameson Trophy, which has been dubbed a Commonwealth Games warm up tournament.
Netball Association of Malawi (Nam) General Secretary, Carol Bapu, said the arrival of the three players is good news as the Queens need a full-strength team for the two competitions.
“We have indeed been joined by Joyce and Lauren and we are now proceeding to Australia where we will meet Mwawi,” Bapu told The Daily Times.
She said having a full squad was important as the side bids to improve its ranking after being stuck on position six in the world and second in Africa for some time.
“We want all our best players during the Commonwealth Games to enhance our chances of improving our ranking. It is important that they take part in the Taini Jameson Trophy as the coach wants to assess the side before the crucial games,” Bapu said.
The Queens left without Head Coach Griffin Saenda who withdrew from the team on doctors' recommendations.
A 51-year-old bicyclist was killed early Monday in Long Beach when he jumped on a fleeing SUV that had struck his friend and attempted to shut off the vehicle's ignition, police said.
The incident occurred just before 1:20 a.m. when a 2000 Ford Expedition struck one of two bicyclists as they crossed the intersection of Long Beach Boulevard and a nearby freeway exit, said Long Beach police Sgt. Brad Johnson.
The bicyclist who was not hit jumped onto a side step on the driver's side of the SUV and reached into the window to turn off the Ford's ignition, police said.
That's when the driver sped south on Long Beach Boulevard, police said.
As the driver made a sharp right turn at Bort Street, the bicyclist fell off and hit his head on a curb, Johnson said.
The driver then parked the SUV in middle of Long Beach Boulevard near West Adams Street and ran.
When police arrived, they found the bicyclist, a Long Beach resident who has yet to be identified, unconscious on the ground. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The bicyclist who was initially struck by the SUV suffered only minor injuries, police said.
Anyone with details about the man's death is urged to the police Det. Brian Watt at (562) 570-7355.

Two teenage boys were charged with disorderly conduct after being found tripping on LSD early Saturday morning.
South Lyon police were called to a home on Washington Street after midnight after reports of someone screaming and pounding on doors of nearby houses.
Police could not find or hear anyone until another caller told dispatch there was someone trying to get into the shed behind a neighbors home. Police found the boy, who seemed to be in a daze, running in between houses.
The boy told police that he didnt know his name and didnt provide coherent responses when asked other questions. His eyes were dilated and appeared to be impaired.

Police put the boy into handcuffs for his safety and put him in a patrol call to wait for an ambulance. The boys mother, who officers reported also seemed impaired, was advised her son was being transported to a local hospital for treatment. Child protective services was contacted due to his mothers condition and inability to respond.
While the boy was waiting in the patrol car, a 16-year-old boy approached officers and told them he and the 14-year-old had consumed LSD.
The second boy was also transported to a local hospital for treatment and met there by family members.
Police filed disorderly conduct petitions for both boys with the county prosecutors office.
Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are lauding a golden idea to stop electronic waste.
Chemistry professor Steve Foley and PhD students Hiwa Salimi and Loghman Moradi, are behind an environmentally-friendly solution that extracts gold from electronics.
“How it works, is by just passing electronic waste through it, literally in ten to twenty seconds, all the gold is leeched,” Foley said.
“Literally 99.9 per cent of the gold is gone within seconds, leaving behind all the other metals.”
READ MORE: Electronic waste skyrockets in Canada
It can solve a growing problem.
Fifty million tons of e-waste goes to waste streams worldwide, and it's increasing by up to twenty per cent every year.
“Literally ninety percent of gold is wasted. And only ten percent has an application,” Foley said.
One hundred litres of the yellow-liquid solution can produce five kilograms of gold, an amount that can go for fifty thousand dollars.
Chris Bowman with the school's Innovation Enterprise office said the idea is revolutionary.
“Because it's a nicely scalable technology and can be done on a small scale, there's a potential of maybe putting mobile factories together, that can be shipped to the sites where electronic waste is building up,” Bowman said.
“The commitment is for this to go to zero-landfill. This is not a cash grab to get the gold, and shunt the rest away.”
The plan is to begin an operation somewhere in Saskatoon in the near future.

Democrats' shameful move against Franken
I was greatly saddened this morning watching Sen. Al Franken, a well-respected and honorable man step down after being railroaded by his own party. The climate lately for measuring inappropriate behavior has reached the level of witch hunting. One doesn't have to reach too far back to recall the destruction of many lives during the McMartin case when the rallying cry was “Believe the children!”
Many of the accusations against Franken happened in the days before he was a senator, when he was a popular comic and worked in jokes, pranks and, in some cases, overtly sexist skits on SNL and other shows. His predecessors in this field include Dean Martin, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and others who made objectifying women their stock and trade. I'm not condoning this; simply pointing out that the ratings back then and sellout crowds would seem to say that this was widely accepted behavior.
The Democrats should be ashamed of themselves for refusing to see the vast difference between Franken's behavior and that of an accused predator and pedophile.

MORE LETTERS — AND HOW TO SUBMIT ONE
Not even close
A recent letter, "We've seen this before," falsely equated the legislative process that created the Affordable Care Act with the process by which President Trump's tax reform passed in the House and the Senate.
The ACA passed without a single Republican vote, but the contents of the bill were nonetheless made available to both parties multiple times throughout its development. With Democrats in charge of the Senate, the Senate health committee spent nearly 60 hours over 13 days marking up the bill that became the ACA. The Senate Finance Committee worked on the legislation for eight days — its longest markup in two decades. It considered more than 130 amendments and held 79 roll-call votes. The full Senate debated the health care bill for 25 straight days before passing it Dec. 24, 2009.
Contrast this with how the Senate and House passed their versions of the Trump tax reform plan behind closed doors with no Democrats participating. The bill was rammed through with approximately 20 hours of debate on a bill that no one even had the chance to read, since it was being amended right up until the final vote with scribbles in the margins of the bill.

At Hauser & Wirth in downtown Los Angeles, Paul McCarthy puts the original kick of Surrealism back into action.
Started a century ago, Surrealism was a movement whose works startled viewers into a heightened awareness of what was going on around them — socially, politically and culturally. Today, surreal is a word so overused that it means little more than something unexpected, entertaining and forgettable — perhaps a pitcher nearly throwing a no-hitter or a criminal smuggling snakes in a potato chip container.
For Paul McCarthy, it's a lot more than that. His incisively weird works are unforgettable. They turn cliched language into lively dialogues with lasting consequences.
To step into the big, theatrically lighted gallery that houses “Paul McCarthy. WS Spinoffs, Wood Statues, Brown Rothkos” is to be dwarfed by nine monstrous sculptures and 10 roughly textured tapestries.
Installation view of “Paul McCarthy. WS Spinoffs, Wood Statues, Brown Rothkos” at Hauser & Wirth. (Fredrik Nilsen)
Polite visitors might say that McCarthy's 12-foot-tall carpets coated with foam and polyurethane have the patina of weathered metal. But it's more truthful to describe their palette as poop-brown. That captures the abrasive honesty of McCarthy's fantasy-fueled Realism.
His figurative sculptures trigger even more conflicted emotions.
The first thing that hits you is their size, weight and the forceful authority of both. Standing 5 feet to nearly 15 feet tall, each has been cut from one or more humongous chunks of black walnut.
The wood is gorgeous, the workmanship exquisite. Both take you back to the Renaissance, when artists carved saints and kings to impress citizens with their superiority.
McCarthy's subject matter is different. Dopey, Snow White and the Prince populate his sculptures. Occasionally, they look as if they have leaped from the folk tales collected by the Brothers Grimm — by way of Disney. More often, something appears to have gone wrong — very, very wrong — in the transmission from 19th century folk tale to 20th century movie to 21st century sculpture.
Details are lost. Faces ricochet from ecstasy to agony. Horses are transformed into multi-headed beasts. Figures fuse, as if dissolving into— or rising out of — primordial soup.

In one, Dopey becomes a mutant totem pole, each of his faces bigger than the one below it. In another, a flower girl splits in two, like a cell undergoing mitosis. In two others, Snow White appears to be sick to her stomach.
The horror show that unfolds is not nearly as disgusting as it sounds. Part of that is because of the Old World elegance of the wood and the exquisiteness of the craftsmanship.
More important, McCarthy's giant knickknacks come off as believable. Although they take visitors on a wild ride through several centuries and various forms of art, they have their feet firmly planted in reality, in times whose weirdness is deeper and more troubling than the art's.

Source: No lobola, no inheritance! . . . ruling brings closure to surviving spouse debate | The Herald April 17, 2017
Daniel Nemukuyu Senior Court Reporter
CO-HABITING for decades without any payment of lobola does not upgrade a relationship to a legitimate marriage for purposes of inheritance, the High Court has ruled.
A perception had filtered the country that if a woman stays with a man for years, the lengthy period of stay with the man would qualify her as the surviving spouse in the event of death.
Some lower courts were even swayed into upgrading girlfriends to the status of surviving spouses in estate cases, but High Court judge Justice Happias Zhou, dispelled the claims.
Justice Zhou stripped the surviving spouse's status off a Harare woman Ms Easter Dzwowa in the estate of the late former Zimbabwe Electoral Commission chief elections officer Lovemore Sekeramayi after evidence of payment of lobola was not produced before the Master of High Court or a magistrate who had dealt with the case.
Ms Dzwowa was staying with Sekeramayi at the time of his death at his Chisipite house, but no proof of lobola payment was produced.
However, Sekeramayi's legitimate wife Faith and her children engaged the services of Harare lawyer Mr Norman Tsarwe of Tadiwa and Associates in the legal battle.
The family contested the decision and the matter spilled into the High Court.
Justice Zhou set aside the Master of High Court's decision recognising Ms Dzwowa as a surviving spouse.
The Court also reversed the decision of allocating Ms Dzwowa the Chisipite house in the distribution of the estate of the late Lovemore Sekeramayi.
“It is ordered that the decision of first respondent (Master) declaring that the third respondent (Ms Dzwowa) was a surviving spouse of the deceased Lovemore Chipunza Sekeramayi be and is hereby set aside.
“The allocation of the immovable property located at Number 31 Hindhead Avenue, Chisipite, Harare to the third respondent be and is hereby set aside . . .”
Justice Zhou ordered the Master of High Court to reconvene and call evidence from witnesses regarding the status of the relationship between Ms Dzwowa and the late Sekeramayi.
The judge held that the mere fact that lovers are living together was not proof of a legitimate marriage.
“Living together is not the same as being married . . . the conclusion by the first respondent that the deceased had two wives is therefore not based on any evidence which was placed before him.
“To disinherit a woman who is legally married to the deceased on the basis that she did not live in the house without considering where she would live, is in my view, grossly irregular,” ruled Justice Zhou.
Mr Sekeramayi died of suspected heart failure in his hotel room in Lesotho in 2014.
He was attending a meeting of chief elections officers for electoral management bodies from the SADC region.

Montreal comes from behind to take the game by a final score of 6–2
As the regular season comes to a close, the University of Ottawa women's hockey team were on the road facing off against the Université de Montreal Carabins on Friday, Feb. 10.
Despite starting out strong, the Gee-Gees fell apart in the third period, allowing the Carabins to score a flurry of goals that let them take the game 6–2.
While a final score like this usually indicates a complete blowout from start to finish, the first 50 minutes of regulation time showcased a very competitive match between both teams.
Unlike their Feb. 4 game against the Concordia Stingers, the Gees were able to generate some potent offence right off the bat, with forward Cindy Laurin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes of the first period. From there both teams engaged in rigorous back and forth play, with the Gees' defence and goaltender Émilie Bouchard doing a great job at protecting their 2–0 lead.
However, the Carabins would score with just over a minute left in the first, which would signal the beginning of the end for the Garnet and Grey.
Even though Mélodie Bouchard's return to the lineup on Friday breathed new life into the Gees' offence, penalty trouble provided Montreal with another goal halfway through the second period, which tied up the game up at 2–2.
The major turning point in the game came halfway through the third period, where a lazy tripping penalty from Julie Lévesque put the Carabins on the power-play yet again. Not only did Montreal forward Jessica Cormier score as a result of this penalty, but she also buried the puck with a stellar slapshot minutes later to make it a 4–2 Carabins advantage.
At that point the Gees' offence dried up, and the team only managed three shots on net the entire period. Not even an extra attacker could generate any substantial scoring opportunities for the Garnet and Grey, while Montreal managed to score on the empty net to make it 5–2.
To add insult to injury, Cormier found the back of the net yet again with a single second left in the game, securing herself the hat trick and 6–2 victory for the Carabins.
“We need to play a better team game, as we did in the first period,” said head coach Yanick Evola, looking ahead to their final game in the season. “I think this is the direction we're trying to head in right now and I have confidence that we can bounce back.”
With the playoffs rapidly approaching, Evola said that his team needs to step up their game and play more consistently like they did in the front half of the season.
“We're still working towards that great peak we had at some point during the season. We know we can do it, we've played some really good hockey, so we need to be ‘superstars' now.”
The last game of the Gees' regular season is a rematch against the Carabins on Friday, Feb. 17 in Montreal. Playoffs are expected to start during reading week.
Mumbai: The mystery around actress Anushka Sharma's role in "Sanju" was unravelled here as director Rajkumar Hirani revealed that her character as a biographer is modelled on himself and Abhijat Joshi, who have co-written the film.
At the film's trailer launch here on Wednesday, Hirani told the media: "To showcase a biopic like this, you have to compress few parts into one. Similarly, Anushka Sharma's character is derived from myself and Abhijat. She is playing a biographer from London, and she comes to India. Sanjay wants her to write a book on him whereas she doesn't want to.
"We were also sceptical at first whether we should do this character or not. So basically she is us, but not as a filmmaker... (as) a biographer."
The actress sports a messy, curly hair avatar in the movie, which talks about the ups and downs in the life of actor Sanjay Dutt. Ranbir Kapoor plays the central character in the film, which will release on June 29.

Add-ons
As far as add-ons are concerned, Mint SIM's selection is very slim:
Extra data:
1GB/month: $10
3GB/month: $20
International credit:
Mint SIM's plans contain no international calling, though unlimited international texting is included. You can add international calling credit to your account in $5, $10, or $20 increments.
You can see a list of international rates here.
Mint SIM also offers a 7-day money-back guarantee on service plans.
Mint SIM phones
Mint SIM uses T-Mobile's nationwide network. Any phone built for T-Mobile will work with Mint SIM's LTE network and Wi-Fi calling options. For Unlocked phones, the network requirements are:
Phones supporting only 1900 MHZ and 850 MHz will be able to use the service, but won't be able to access the high-speed network in many parts of the U.S.
1900 MHZ and 850 MHz will be able to use the service, but won't be able to access the high-speed network in many parts of the U.S. A fully compatible phone is one that supports the AWS bands (1700/2100 MHz), the 1900 MHz and 850 MHz bands and Band 12 (700 MHz).
If you're not sure the phone you have will work, give Mint a call at 844-646-8746 (6-6 PT Mon-Fri, 8-5 PT on Saturday) or you can chat with a specialist at the Mint SIM website.
Project Fi plans
Project Fi offers two types of plans: family and single line. What you get with each plan is the same, but you'll save money on each additional family plan line (up to 5 lines).
The Basics 1GB LTE Price $20/month $10/month Free Extras Unlimited international texting
Call and text from any Android or iPhone
Family Plan
The Basics 1GB LTE Primary line price $20/month $10/month Secondary lines (up to 5) $15/month $10/month Free Extras Unlimited international texting
Call and text from any Android or iPhone
Note: Google calls the base Project Fi plan "The Basics." No data is included and must be purchased at the rate of $10/GB. Data is not shared between lines on a family plan. Each line pays the same $10 per GB of data (domestic and international in 135 countries) with the cost of any unused data refunded at the end of each month
Add-ons
Data-only SIM:
Google offers a data-only SIM card to use in any compatible LTE device, It shares data with the primary line at the same $10/GB rate. You need to have at least one line of service and purchase a minimum of 1GB of data to use the data-only SIM card.
Data pricing:
1GB of 4G LTE: $10/month
Phone Insurance:
$5 per month per device covers accidental damages and device malfunctions. You can make one in a 12-month period. Deductibles are $79 for Pixel, $99 for Pixel XL, $69 for Nexus 5X, $99 for Nexus 6P. When you make a claim Google will ship out a replacement device the next business day.
International add-ons:
International cellular calls cost $0.20 per minute.
Google Wi-Fi services:
Your Project Fi phone service includes Wi-Fi calling and texting anywhere in the world. In addition, Google VPN services are available and allow you to connect to open Wi-Fi hotspots safely and securely.
Project Fi and Google Hangouts apps:
The Project Fi app is tied to your Google account and can be installed on any Android or iPhone. You can pay your bill, check account balances and talk to customer service through the app at no cost. The Google Hangouts app allows calls and texts using your Project Fi number on any Android or iPhone.
Project Fi phones
Project Fi only supports phones from Google. That means your selection is currently limited to:
Nexus 5X
Nexus 6P
Google Pixel
Google Pixel XL
Note: While it's possible to enable Project Fi on unsupported phones, this is against the Project Fi terms of service.
A data-only SIM is available and can be used in any compatible LTE device as long as at least one line of Fi service is active.
Which should I go with?
Google's Project Fi refunds you for any unused data every month, but the $10/GB baseline means it will always be the more expensive option when buying data. From a pure price perspective, Mint SIM is the better bargain.
That being said, if you aren't using a lot of data every month or can take advantage of the Google VPN Wi-Fi offloading, Project Fi's options and services can be compelling. Google is a bit more forward thinking than most other carriers and services like the free VPN that connects you to open WI-Fi hotspots and free international texting from any Android or iPhone can't be ignored. Nor can the excellent coverage map Project Fi offers through the combined network of T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular and Wi-Fi services.
The final thing to consider is phone choice. Your new Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone isn't supported on Project Fi, which only officially supports phones from Google. Both, and many other unlocked models, are supported by Mint SIM.
Both carriers are a great way to break free of the shackles of the Big Four carriers, but your usage will determine which is best for you.
"But when it was all over, after a 15-hour shift, and I went home, that's when I started realizing the hurt, the type of effect it's going to have on thousands of people in our great city.
"We had a lot of help there from a lot of citizens, just wonderful people. They were trying to assist in first aid, others just trying to comfort people, trying to feel for pulses, trying to assist in gathering evidence."
There were about 12 special constables and a sergeant on the scene at one point, supporting police, fire and EMS, said Mike Killingsworth, head of transit enforcement at the TTC.
"I sent a message out to the team yesterday saying how fiercely proud I am of them," he said. "I don't think the public in the city realizes the contributions that all of my members, but especially my special constables, make on a daily basis."
Franklin Edishou
A franchisee of the Pizza Nova on the corner of Yonge and Finch, Edishou was in the back of his store working alongside his wife when he saw the commotion immediately after the van struck.
The scene outside the store was traumatic: at least five people lay injured on the ground, while others were rushing to their aid.
Recognizing a major incident was unfolding, Edishou's wife — who had burst into tears — quickly left to pick up their children from school. Alone in the store, Edishou realized he could make a small contribution.
As police, fire and ambulance personnel descended, he began throwing pizzas in the oven, putting them in boxes then taking them out to first responders who he knew "couldn't have breaks, they wouldn't have anything like lunch." He also brought them water.
Having something to do helped Edishou as he attempted to process the horror of what had happened right outside his store. An Iranian immigrant, he said the scene reminded him of something that might happen in his own country, not here.
"I've been through a lot — that's why it's devastating to see this stuff in this country, it's a beautiful country, peaceful country. This happens? I have no words," said Edishou.
As he was making the pizza, he was reflecting on how the eldest of his five kids, his 17-year-old daughter, often takes the subway to Yonge and Finch, crossing the same intersection where the injured lay. It could have been anyone who was killed, he said.
Edishou is reluctant to take any credit for his actions, saying "it was nothing — a small token of appreciation."
Diego DeMatos
DeMatos, a former flight attendant, and a friend had just finished lunch and were driving north on Yonge toward the GoodLife fitness centre at Finch. He was driving slowly, searching for parking when he saw the white rental van driving at what he estimates was up to 80 kilometres an hour.
"There were two people standing at the corner waiting for the light to change to green to cross ... It was a Black female and a white male. It all happened so fast. The lady got turned back into the building and the guy got thrown into the middle of the street and the van kept going," he said.
DeMatos thought he had witnessed a hit-and-run incident. The man was bleeding from the head and the people attending to the woman were calling out for someone to give them a belt to try to stop the bleeding.
His mind was racing, his body shaking. A few metres up the road, there were four or five more people on the ground. Bystanders were screaming, panicking. Some of the victims were moving. Others were not. The sounds of sirens started filling the air.
That is when DeMatos heard someone calling for help. He saw a man attending to another victim who had been struck and was lying in the middle of the street.
DeMatos's flight training and experience had taught him to remain calm in panicked situations. He had once delivered a baby in mid-air. Another time he attended to a passenger suffering a heart attack during a flight.
"The instinct kicks in and everything rushes back into your head," he said. "I asked the guy what was wrong before I jumped in. The guy was in panic, so I took over."
The victim was in his 50s or 60s with light-coloured hair, DeMatos said. He was bleeding from the head and had suffered leg injuries. DeMatos began to perform CPR on the victim, but before long he realized the man was already dead.
"I could see there was nothing we could do. It was too late," DeMatos said.
A woman nearby came to offer her light-coloured scarf to cover the dead man's face. Then the police, fire and ambulance crews arrived and cleared people away from the scene.
Since that time, when DeMatos has not been recounting what he saw for journalists, he has been looking for pictures online in order to find out about the man he fought in vain to keep alive.
"I just want to keep following the news and see if I can find the guy ... I don't know if it was the last minutes that he had," he said, momentarily overcome with emotion. "It's important to me."
Eric Chak
He was heading back to his office near Yonge and Finch from a late lunch around 1:30 p.m. when he saw a person lying on the ground, face-down.
"I first thought it was a car accident," said the 35-year-old information security analyst with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.
Then he saw many more people, some standing and others lying on sidewalks, stretching down Yonge. There were no police yet on the scene. Seeing blood all over the place, he quickly decided to jump into action, using his limited first-aid skills.
"The injuries were very graphic," he said. "Someone was already doing chest compression on one girl, and when I checked, there was no pulse."
The image of that girl covered in blood with no vital signs haunted him as he kept trying to figure out what just happened, while trying to assist those who needed attention. There were at least five people on the sidewalk who needed CPR or help to "not choke on their own blood," he said.
When first responders arrived, Chak stepped aside and watched in horror as the girl was wrapped in an orange bag.
After the emergency responders had taken over, Chak headed back to work. He admits he "was scared but thought I was fine."
"It didn't hit me until late, when I kept drifting back to the scene and wondering whether I could have done more," he said on the phone from his home outside Newmarket. The HR office sent him home on an indefinite leave so he can recover.
"That scene yesterday was beyond what anyone can ever imagine," he said.
Katherine Liu
Outside of the Secret Garden Floral & Gift Boutique near Yonge and Finch on Tuesday, bunches of blooming flowers were set on the sidewalk. A sign amid the blooms read "With heartfelt sympathy! Please feel free to take!"
Liu, a co-owner, said the free flowers are a way to help "the world feel better."
Liu said there are a lot of pedestrians on Yonge, and that many have been stopping to pluck a stem or two from the overfilling vases and buckets on the sidewalk.
"They walk by and they just take a little flower," Liu said.
The store kept the overflowing selection of flowers stocked throughout the day.
One woman in a pink sweater paused outside the store, taking in the scene. She apprehensively plucked a few stems before walking into the store. Moments later, flowers in hand, she left wiping tears from her eyes.
A man ducked into the floral shop to make sure they could, in fact, take the flowers for free. Another woman thanked Liu profusely, and asked for an elastic to tie the stems together.
Jesse James
As police investigators started combing through the wreckage and people around the world turned to the news for details, James called on his network of Christian faith leaders in the Willowdale area. At 8 o'clock Monday night, more than a dozen people were gathered into the Puck n' Wings bar at the northeast corner of Yonge and Finch, working on a plan to serve the spiritual needs of their community.
They quickly decided to organize a 1:30 p.m. prayer vigil Tuesday at Olive Square Park, just south of the intersection as well as a 6 p.m. prayer walk near Mel Lastman Square. But they also decided on a longer-lasting contribution in an attempt to pay tribute to the 10 people killed and others who were injured by the speeding van.
"We're going to be playing music at Olive Square Park for the next 25 days — a day for every person who has been hurt, killed or injured," said James, who is a member of the Spring Garden Church. "The goal is to turn our cries of sorrow into songs of healing. We love Willowdale, we love the people here and all of us were affected by it, although some more closely than others."
The music will be played each day at 1:30 p.m., to mark the time that the attack began.
"The only instruction they have is to play songs of hope or songs of lament," James said, adding that while Christian faith leaders have initiated the project, they would like to see musicians or singers of other faiths.
"We're inviting anyone to participate. In fact, the more who participate the better. It will help to galvanize this community for a health process of healing and grief."
U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, from his golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey U.S., August 12, 2017.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump chided Merck & Co Inc's Kenneth Frazier after the drugmaker's chief executive resigned from a presidential advisory board earlier on Monday and cited a need for U.S. leaders to denounce bigotry following a violent weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.
"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!," Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.
West Yorkshire Police have revealed what is at the top of a thieves list when out looking to steal your property.
Thieves look to steal property they believe can be removed and easily sold-on, especially if it cannot be traced back to the scene of the crime.
1. Portable Computing Devices.
Due to their popularity laptop and tablet PC (iPad) theft nowadays is a significant risk. They are portable and can be sold-on easily at a good price. There are several methods to protect your hardware that have been developed, including alarms, laptop locks, and visual deterrents such as stickers or labels. Importantly be sure to register the serial number of your device on Immobilise along with your postcode which can be simply written on the back with a UV pen and added to your account as an additional identifier. It is recommended that you configure a strong password and also perform a full disk encryption (FDE) to help protect sensitive data stored inside your laptop or tablet PC.
2. Smartphones.
These days more and more people are sporting these expensive gadgets. Smart phones are also high on the list of things to steal amongst thieves, and many people find themselves victims of phone theft when taking their high-tech phones out with them. When registering your phone on Immobilise include the IMEI number which can be found easily by pressing the following keys on your handset: *#06#
This is your phones unique number and the first thing police will check for when recovering property.
3. Cash & Jewellery.
Do not leave cash or jewellery lying around the house making sure you keep valuables out of sight and where possible place them in a secure place such as a safe. The risk for burglars is increased when your possessions can link them to the scene of a crime, consider taking photos and engraving your jewellery when registering them on immobilise as this will also aid the police in identifying crime and returning property.
4. Bicycles.
In the UK a bicycle is stolen approximately every minute of the day, perhaps worsened due to the increasing popularity of expensive models, which in turn can be sold far too easily via online auctions. Invest in a quality D-Lock and be sure to register your bicycles frame number along with any pictures you have on Immobilise.
5. Home Entertainment Systems.
Many new home cinema-type HD and 3D television sets are being stolen because they are valuable, light-weight and common-place in most UK homes. Register the serial number of your TV/DVD and audio equipment on Immobilise along with your postcode which can be easily written on the back with a UV pen. Visual deterrents such as stickers or labels will help to discourage theft by letting thieves know your possessions are traceable.

Protesters who stormed a political meeting being addressed by Jacob Rees-Mogg hurled a barrage of abuse at the Tory MP before a violent scuffle broke out.
More details have emerged following a brawl at the University of the West of England in Bristol, where the outspoken Conservative MP for North East Somerset appears to come between an 'antifascist' protester an supporter.
The violence erupted during a speech Mr Rees-Mogg was making for the university's Politics and International Relations Society (PAIRS) at the university's Frenchay campus.
It is unclear whether the violence was directed at the well-known brexiteer but university students described seeing masked "antifascists" burst in on the talk in protest toward the Conservative MP.
In one video, a hooded protester is seen shouting at Mr Rees-Mogg, saying: "You're not worth debating."
A man in a white pin-striped shirt then begins pushing the protester from behind and violence briefly erupts.
Avon and Somerset Police say an investigation is now underway following what they describe as a "public order incident" at UWE Bristol on Friday, February 2, and are asking anyone with footage of the fight to send it to them to help with their inquiries.
Sebastian Salton, 19, a Bristol University student who attended the event, said: "It was interrupted by antifascists. I don't think it was assault, I think people were trying to get him out.
"There were about 200 people there, and five protesters. It took a few minutes for security to come.
"There was some negotiating. He (Mr Rees-Mogg) went over to them and said 'lets not shout them down,' but they weren't having any of it.
"They were shouting 'racist, misogynist, homophobe, sexist.' They were talking about austerity."Mr Salton described the politician as "looking shaken up" after protesters in balaclavas entered the room.
The video shown above was taken by The Jackdaw @JackDaw Politics and captures the moment the incident started.
A student who attended the event, but asked not to be named, said: "There had been a few threats to the event before on Facebook. There was security brought in for the event.
"A couple of minutes into Jacob Rees-Mogg's speech, about seven masked protesters came in from the back. Some were wearing hoods.
"They started shouting at Rees-Mogg: 'racist', 'bigot' and 'how can you work for a fascist government'.
"Rees-Mogg tried to speak to them and it quietened down for a bit; security removed some. Then there was a confrontation between a protester and an audience member. Rees-Mogg stepped in to try to separate them and he was pushed.
"The police were called but didn't enter the auditorium," he added.
Eye-witnesses attending the event said the MP, whose outspoken views on Brexit and abortion have made him popular on the right of the Conservative party but a hate figure for some leftwingers, had arrived with no security and was confronted by protesters almost immediately.
One attendee heard protesters calling him a "Nazi," a “fascist and a racist” and hurling abuse which prevented him from talking.
Student Chloe Kaye, whose video captured the brawl, said: "Someone got punched and it got very pushy.
"Eventually most of the masked men left but one of the unmasked men remained, calling him a ‘racist, sexist, misogynist'," she told the Telegraph.
"Everyone was shocked; I was pretty scared, especially the longer it went on and the more pushy it got."
She said Mr Rees Mogg stayed incredibly calm and simply tried to calm everyone down.
Will Smith, 19, and Tyler Savage, 21, both students of Politics at the Bristol University, said they did not know if Mr Rees Mogg was physically hurt during the outburst.
Mr Smith said: "There were people in balaclavas shouting 'fascist scum' and 'sexist'.
"He handled it very well and approached them to try and engage them in debate.
"He was the first to approach them."
Mr Savage added: "An older gentleman appeared to get between the protesters and Jacob."
Video footage showed a crowd shouting "out, out, out," and "fight, fight, fight".
Mr Smith said: "I think Jacob was getting in between a man and a woman. I don't think anybody was attacking Jacob, I think he was in between."
The Politics and International Relations Society issued a statement, which said: "Thank you to all who came and listened to Jacob Rees-Mogg.
"We're sorry the event was overshadowed by the actions of a few non-students, not least because it detracts from the great attitude that UWE students have towards debate and challenging political opinions: as exhibited by the record turnout."
UWE Bristol also issued a statement, which said: “We are absolutely appalled by the conduct of a small number of attendees at a Student's Union Politics & International Relations Society talk this evening.
“It is our understanding at this stage that a small group of protesters broke into the lecture theatre where the event was due to take place via the back doors. The police were called and our security attended.
"We understand that these protesters were not UWE Bristol students and did not have tickets for the event. The police are now working to identify the individuals.
“Once the situation was calmed, Mr Rees-Mogg went ahead with his speech and was escorted back to his car after the event finished. Both security and the police stayed for event to ensure everyone was safe.
“We support the democratic right of free speech and peaceful protest. However, we strongly condemn the actions of protesters who disrupted normal debate and behaved in this way. There is no place for such action on a university campus or in a civilised society.
"We are delighted that Mr Rees Mogg was able to speak and debate with our legitimate student body in a respectful manner. We would like to thank him for his composure and actions to diffuse what must have been a challenging and unprovoked incident.
"We will work with the police to identify the individuals involved and take appropriate action."
Cold front brings in wind and rain before the heat pumps back in.
Saskatoon Forecast
Tuesday
-5 is what it felt like with wind chill to start the day in Saskatoon as temperatures slipped a degree below freezing under partly cloudy skies.
A warm and breezy southwesterly wind kicked in with gusts upwards of 45 km/h during the morning, which helped boost us up into the mid-teens before noon with bone dry conditions and a rising fire danger risk.
Fire burning south of the city right now. Bone dry conditions with 36% relative humidity & breezy winds around 30 km/h. More details to come https://t.co/7vVimGNOdJ #yxe #Sask #skfire pic.twitter.com/HZjZi25EPs — Peter Quinlan (@PQuinlanGlobal) April 24, 2018

Clouds roll in overnight as we cool back down to just a few degrees shy of the freezing mark with breezy winds sticking around.
Wednesday
A cold front will bring in clouds in the morning Wednesday with a chance of midday rain as it splices through the province before clouds clear out later in the day.
Winds will also pick up along the front with gusts upwards of 40 to 50 km/h as we struggle to make it up to an afternoon high in the mid-teens.
Thursday-Friday
A massive upper ridge of high pressure pushes in the heat and sunshine for the remainder of the week across central Saskatchewan.
Beautiful blue skies and sunshine will come with a bit of wind on Thursday, as daytime highs skyrocket up into the low 20s both days.
Weekend Outlook
We climb even further into the weekend with an afternoon high popping up into the mid 20s in the sunshine on Saturday before sliding back into the low 20s on Sunday with clouds rolling back in with a system that'll bring in a chance of rain into the work week.

MID-size sedans are as popular as pimples right now and car brands are responding by loading them up with features to try to entice buyers back into the segment.
Take the updated Mazda6. Sales are down 18 per cent this year so Mazda has lifted its game - again - and completely reworked the tasty cabin as well as fitting the 2.5-litre turbo first seen in the CX-9 SUV.
The interior is now seriously impressive to look at and touch. The artificial suede inserts on the dash and door trims are an obvious example of Mazda looking to lift the feel of the cabin, though greasy fingers may take a long-term toll.
The seats have been redesigned to improve cushioning and the top-spec Atenza now has seat ventilation. Unlike most cars that blow cool air on your back and butt, the Mazda6 uses its fans to suck the hot air away from your body.
A new nose that does away with the separate fog lights in the bumper makes it easy to spot the facelift. It is part of a concerted "less is more" approach to make the car look more refined by deleting visual clutter. For the same reason the chrome strip on the back of the car is now a one-piece item to avoid gap lines.
The 2.5-litre turbo will be fitted to the GT and Atenza versions. The Sport and Touring variants continue with the naturally aspirated 2.5 (140kW/252Nm), which now has cylinder deactivation to save fuel.
The new model is available in sedan and wagon. Picture: Thomas Wielecki.
With a respectable boost in power, the 2.2-litre turbo diesel (140kW/450Nm) can be ordered in the Touring, GT and Atenza versions of the sedan or wagon.
The head-up display now projects directly on to the windscreen in place of the pop-up plastic panel on previous versions. It looks better for the driver and kept the designers happy because they could do away with the divider lines on the instrument cowl.
An eight-inch infotainment screen is operated using a dial mounted between the front seats and remains one of the easiest to operate in a mainstream model.
Mazda's marketing chief Alastair Doak predicts 3700 sales in the first year with the sedan accounting for 69 per cent.
Prices start at $32,490 and top out at $50,090. That's similar money to the likes of the Ford Mondeo and Subaru Liberty, while the VW Passat starts at $35,990 and the Toyota Camry can be had for $27,990.
The cabin has had a major makeover
In that context the Mazda6 represents good value. The safety suite is pretty comprehensive, running from autonomous emergency braking up to 80km/h to adaptive cruise control, active lane-keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot monitor. The Atenza adds a surround-view camera and adaptive LED headlamps with 80m better visibility.
The updates also reflect Mazda's move to establish itself as a premium mainstream brand, much as Honda was seen as 30 years ago. That's smart marketing and should help defend it from the European brands that are intentionally pricing their entry level mid-size sedans at the top end of the mass market models.
ON THE ROAD
The Mazda6 has long distinguished itself with its on-road manners and this version extends that approach. This is about as good as mid-size sedans get until you start spending more money on German machinery.
The steering is as precise as ever, it changes direction with poise and the 6 wasn't at all bothered by battered back roads around Ballarat. The basic balance shone through on a quick stint on gravel that also highlighted the improved underbody noise dampening.
For those technically inclined, the body has been stiffened and the suspension mounts reinforced to improve its ability to roll over ruts and potholes without upsetting the occupants.
The turbo delivers a solid surge of torque across a decent rev band and endows sinewy performance. The power delivery is akin to the better turbo diesels - without the noise, the smell and the low-down lag.
The sedan impresses on the road. Picture: Thomas Wielecki.
Fuel consumption is officially rated at 7.6L/100km; we returned 10.2L/100km after some enthusiastic driving on an engine that had less than 1000km under its belt.
The seats feel plush and on the basis of three hours seated in the Atenza they're as comfortable as they look. Rear headroom is tight for anyone over 180cm and there's not a huge gap to slide your feet under the front seat to try for more legroom, though it wasn't an issue for my 170cm frame.
The six-speed auto - there's no manual gearbox on any version - does its job without being noticed, the hallmark of a well-calibrated transmission. Paddle-shifters are there if you're so inclined but in most situations you're better off letting the auto do its thing.
There's the option to put it into sport mode to hold revs longer or you can slip it into Eco and it will shift gears early and often.
Let the auto serve up the torque and the Mazda6 is deceptively quick around a set of bends. Just as importantly, it is enjoyable and the body control means the passengers won't bother to look up from their devices to see why they're being shaken about.
The traffic sign recognition, displaying as both an icon in the dash and a red mark on the speedo, wasn't fooled on our 300km drive.
In tandem with intelligent speed assist, it is an increasingly valuable feature in states like Victoria - where driving a few km/h over the limit can have dire consequences.
WHAT'S NEW?
PRICE Entry to the Mazda6 is unchanged at $32,490 plus on-roads, while the Touring has price cuts of up to $600. The turbo GT kicks off from $43,990 and price tops out with the Atenza diesel wagon, now $550 dearer at $50,090.
TECHNOLOGY Engine improvements aside, the Mazda6 benefits from an active bonnet to protect pedestrians. The adaptive cruise control now uses both radar and a camera to enable stop and go functionality. Previous versions relied on radar and operated only above 30km/h.
PERFORMANCE The turbo engine is good for 170kW/ 420Nm (184kW on 98RON fuel). It isn't an outright performance car like the MPS variant of old though the acceleration is pretty much effortless from standstill to triple digits.
DRIVING Suspension tweaks and a stiffer body give the Mazda6 impressive composure. The car feels light from behind the wheel and responds accordingly.
DESIGN If you don't notice any fog lights on the front of the Mazda, you're looking at the new one. The wheels have also been redesigned but most of the changes are on the inside. Sweeping horizontal lines that extend from the dash into the front doors endow a European air.
THE VERDICT
The Mazda6 is a better drive than ever and the work on noise suppression and cabin quality goes a long way to justifying Mazda's bid to promote the car as "mainstream premium".

Porsche confirmed for Gran Turismo Sport Enlarge Photo
It's bad enough that the cost of membership is so high to put your backside into a Porsche. On top of that, for more than a decade, it was extremely hard to do it virtually. After years of exclusivity, Porsche has been unleashed to cross various video game franchises. Now, gamers will be able to pilot their favorite Porsche models in Playstation's "Gran Turismo."
EA held exclusive rights to Porsche vehicles through a licensing deal that lasted the entirety of the 2000s and most of this decade. Occasionally, a Porsche would slip through to various other titles, but the licensing deal meant the closest thing to piloting a digitized Porsche was often via RUF in games outside of "Need For Speed."
With the deal unsealed, Porsche will be one of many marques featured in the highly anticipated "Gran Turismo Sport" title coming later this year. Playstation officially tweeted the news of Porsche's inclusion while confirming beta testing for the game would begin in the U.S.
As for which models will be recreated in pixelized perfection, we've only been guaranteed the 911 GT3 RS thus far. "Gran Turismo Sport" will include 140 cars initially, but gamers should expect Sony and Polyphony Digital to offer up more vehicles through downloadable content.
"Gran Turismo Sport" was originally slated for release in 2016 but has been postponed to "late 2017" for now. Still, the delay hasn't stopped Sony from teasing the majesty of graphical beauty that is "GT Sport" through various trailers and the aforementioned beta that is currently underway. Hopefully, we'll get some official news on when we can expect to dive into the latest game during the annual E3 conference this June.

Baby boomers, the first post-WWII generation, are getting older and moving into retirement. Yet what should be their golden years are turning into a time of stress, health issues, and increasing responsibilities.
Our newest locally produced ViewFinder documentary is an investigatory look at the baby boomer generation and the complications they confront while aging. Boomers are pulling double duty when it comes to health care as they work to maintain their own physical and mental well-being and take on caregiver roles for their parents and spouses.
Despite these mounting challenges, baby boomers – the generation that grew up amidst the civil rights, anti-war, and women's rights movements – know how to drive social change, and now they're speaking up about healthcare. Pam Montana is one boomer vowing to fight for a cure to Alzheimer's following a surprise diagnosis that upended her retirement plans with husband Bob Linscheid. Another boomer, Susan Franklin, managed to beat cancer, while acting as a full-time caregiver to both of her parents.
Boomer's Guide to Growing Older offers up close and personal insight into the trials of baby boomer life today and what's being done to alleviate the issues. Plus, discover organizations and resources designed to help baby boomers maintain their physical and emotional health.
ViewFinder is a series of documentaries that present a unique look at our community, showcasing highlights, triumphs, issues, and personal stories in the region. You can see the premiere of ViewFinder: Boomer's Guide to Growing Older on Wednesday, June 21 at 7PM on KVIE, or visit kvie.org/viewfinder to see the episode after it airs.

It's that time of year when countless well-intentioned wannabe volunteers call the local homeless shelter to see if they can serve meals on Christmas Day. But that's not what's needed. Those kinds of volunteer holiday shifts at shelters, which many people are eager to sign up for, get filled months in advance to ensure adequate training and any necessary background checks. So if you'd like to do some good, that's long-lasting, consider becoming a regular volunteer, says Cara Eaton, marketing and communications manager at Volunteer Toronto, a charity that connects volunteers with non-profit organizations that need them. “We're trying to encourage Torontonians to be everyday champions,” she says. “Instead of people reaching out to us and volunteering just once this holiday season, we would love to see interested volunteers apply for ongoing roles because it's actually what's needed most in Toronto: the ongoing commitment to non-profits.” December is the only time of year when there's a mismatch between available volunteer opportunities at non-profits and those who want to volunteer.
Article Continued Below
“We receive hundreds of calls, emails and messages from individuals, families and groups looking to volunteer for one day around the holidays,” says Eaton, noting that serving meals in a shelter is the No. 1 request. “It's unrealistic everyone will find the specific opportunity they are looking for, even though there are many non-profits in need of volunteers.” At any time, more than 600 volunteer roles are posted on the Volunteer Toronto website, but currently few are holiday-specific, such as wrapping gifts and delivering gift packages to those in need. Matching people with volunteering roles during the holidays can be challenging because many organizations recruit for ongoing volunteer positions with a minimum three-month commitment.

Not only is this the band's eighth No. 1 album, but it is the only time in history that a group has earned a No. 1 album for four consecutive decades, from the '80s to the 2010s.
Songs of Experience is U2's 14th studio album and was released Dec. 1. The album's 186,000 equivalent sales marks the biggest first week release for a rock record this year.

Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau has seen a lot of football over his 80 years, but perhaps nothing quite like Sunday's loss to the Texans. A rookie quarterback helping his team put up 57 points is difficult to forget.
"Well, you would love to [burn the film], but you can't," LeBeau said, via the Tennessean. "You have to look at that film. You have to see where we failed. All of us. The coaches, the players, all of us. And we have to make sure that everybody understands what we have to do to go forward. And I think we've had an excellent week of practice. I think the guys are focused, and we're going to go play hard for the rest of the season."
LeBeau said the porous performance, fueled by a brilliant afternoon from Deshaun Watson, Will Fuller and especially DeAndre Hopkins, wasn't characteristic of his team.
"That's not us," LeBeau said. "We're going to prove that's not us. That is not us."
Giving up 57 points isn't really anyone. Since the NFL merger, the NFL record for points in a game is 62, which was reached by five teams and only two (the 1999 Jacksonville Jaguars and the 2011 New Orleans Saints). The Titans were another touchdown away from being alone atop that unfortunate list and, as unbelievable as it might seem, the Texans had more scoring left in them Sunday.
A blowout loss is difficult for any team to recover from, but what about a Titans team that normally has the luxury of a dominant, run-first offense? With Marcus Mariota (hamstring) less than 100 percent, will they be able to replicate the type of system that allows their defense to function at full strength? Facing the Dolphins (1-2), who are currently struggling to find the light on offense, might help. But over 80 years, LeBeau is smart enough to know that it takes time to forget about a 57-point performance.
Samsung SDI CEO Cho Nam-seong (Samsung SDI)
Korean battery maker Samsung SDI's chief executive stressed the importance of safety Monday, amid growing demand for secondary batteries powering electric vehicles and diverse digital devices.“We should establish a corporate culture that puts safety first,” Samsung SDI chief executive officer Cho Nam-seong said during the New Year's kickoff meeting at its research complex located in Suwon.The battery maker plans to improve product safety technologies by innovating its design and manufacturing methods, expanding investment in safety and overhauling its system and organization.Cho said, “A competitive edge in products comes from fundamental competitiveness in terms of development, manufacturing, quality and cost.”In order to improve the company's competitive edge, it plans to focus on developing materials, building up standard development process and strengthen the capacity of its overseas arms this year.“As to mid- to large-sized batteries, we will develop high-capacity products, and in terms of small batteries, we will improve polymer technologies and take the leadership in cylindrical batteries,” the CEO said.According to the company, Samsung SDI has been innovating its corporate culture by streamlining its reporting process, meetings and communications since last year, and will continue to settle the culture this year.“I am confident the innovative corporate culture we have pushed since last year will form the basis of becoming a 100-year-old company,” Cho said.By Shin Ji-hye ( shinjh@heraldcorp.com

Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria. In the wake of the storm, some say the U.S. government should erase Puerto Rico's crushing debt. The island's economy was already in deep crisis before the hurricane hit, and advocates argue that since the debt was caused by bad and often rapacious policy choices on the mainland, erasing it is the right thing to do. But skeptics say simply wiping out the debt would have complicated financial consequences. Should Puerto Rico's debt be forgiven?
PERSPECTIVES
President Donald Trump roiled the markets on Oct. 3 by saying Puerto Rico's debt should be wiped out:
"We have to look at their whole debt structure," he said Tuesday evening on Fox News's Hannity. "You know, they owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street, and we're going to have to wipe that out. You can say goodbye to that. I don't know if it's Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is, you can wave goodbye to that."
MORE: Trump is right -- we need to forgive Puerto Rico's debt
But Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney quickly contradicted Trump's statement:
"I think what you heard the president say is that Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out a way to solve its debt problem," he told Bloomberg News. "We are not going to bail them out. We are not going to pay off those debts. We are not going to bail out those bondholders."
Critics argue that since U.S. policies like the Jones Act are what landed the territory in a financial crisis in the first place, the least we can do is wipe the slate clean and give them a fresh start -- especially after they've suffered $95 billion in hurricane-related damage.
Thanks to the law, the price of goods from the United States mainland is at least double that in neighboring islands, including the United States Virgin Islands, which are not covered by the Jones Act. Moreover, the cost of living in Puerto Rico is 13 percent higher than in 325 urban areas elsewhere in the United States, even though per capita income in Puerto Rico is about $18,000, close to half that of Mississippi, the poorest of all 50 states.
This is a shakedown, a mob protection racket, with Puerto Rico a captive market.
Nobody was talking about debt in Puerto Rico in 1898 when the US snatched it up hoping to make a killing in the sugar markets. -- jelani cobb (@jelani9) October 3, 2017
But others say Puerto Rico got itself into this crisis, and they need to get themselves out of it.
Yea PR is done. They borrowed too much like socialists normally do. Don't expect us to pay it back. -- Eleonore Bucher (@EleonoreBucher) October 4, 2017
And while most people would be happy to see Wall Street hedge funds lose in a Puerto Rican debt forgiveness agreement, three quarters of the island's debt is owned by individuals and mutual funds that are held by mom-and-pop investors. Just wiping away that debt could create its own financial problems.
"For the most part, Main Street America owns this debt," Long said. "It's not as though these are vultures circling around the island."

YERUSHALAYIM - The parents of slain IDF soldier Hadar Goldin, Hy”d, lashed out at Haaretz on Monday for focusing on the hardships of life in Gaza while ignoring the fate of their son.
Simcha and Leah Goldin, who have been waging an aggressive campaign to pressure the Israeli government to secure the remains of their son from Hamas, were aggrieved at the newspaper's coverage of the Gaza power shortage on Monday morning:
The headline read: “Gaza Power Watch: How Many Hours of Electricity Did Gaza Get Yesterday”
The subhead: “A severe electricity shortage in Gaza leaves residents with as little as four hours of power a day in the sweltering summer heat. Who gets electricity and when?”
The picture story consisted of a photo of a Gaza housewife working in a dimly-lit kitchen, along with an elaborate timetable showing the hours of electricity supplied to Gaza City, Beit Lahia, Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis and Rafah, which were also depicted on a map of the Hamas-run enclave.
“Haaretz continues with its anti-Israel slant: Every day, they publicize how many watts of electricity Gaza receives, completely ignoring the fact that Hamas still holds captive two of our sons, who are Israeli citizens,” the Goldins wrote, referring also to Oron Shaul, Hy”d, who was killed along with their son in Gaza during 2014's Operation Protective Edge.
“We are ashamed of you and of Haaretz,” they wrote. You prefer to give a voice to needy citizens of Gaza, but you show no mercy to Israeli families whose loved ones are in Hamas' hands.”
In response, Haaretz publisher Amos Shoken said, “I feel your pain, but if today Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas cuts electricity to Gaza, does that make him your partner? Will four hours of electricity (instead of 2) make Hamas return Israelis? So there's really no connection.”
“Abbas does what his committee decides to do and not to do — to pressure Hamas. You and Haaretz are clearing Hamas of all responsibility for the situation Hamas itself created. It's shameful,” the Goldins said.

NEW DELHI: The government on Friday indicated that it may tweak the long-term capital gains tax on shares and equity mutual funds in the future to align it with norms for other sectors such as property, which will allow investors to adjust the value of their investments to inflation The indexation benefit even with a 20% tax, instead of the concessional 10% proposed in the budget on Thursday, will result in savings and will especially benefit those who stay invested for long periods."Like in the case of immovable property, we have indexation benefit but the holding period is two years and the rate is 20%. We must move in that direction for all classes of assets. Since it was one year only, we didn't want to give benefit of indexation," finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia told TOI in an interview, but did not indicate any time frame. In case of immovable property, the holding period for LTCG tax is 24 months.Several market experts have suggested that the government should allow indexation benefit, which helps those who hold their investments for a longer period. In the current regime, those who have invested in a scheme for, say, a child's education needs 10 years later, may be at a disadvantage.Adhia, however, maintained that the interests of small investors had been protected by providing exemption for gains up to Rs 1 lakh.Amid falling stock market indices, the top finance ministry official said currently there were two concessions available to investors reporting gains from investment in stock markets and the government had decided to tap into massive gains of Rs 3.67 lakh crore, which remained untaxed until last year if the investments were sold after holding them for over 12 months. "There are two concessions.Short-term capital gains tax is 15% instead of normal marginal rate of tax (of up to 30%) that you pay. Two, longterm capital gains tax is only 10% instead of 20% for other asset classes. That's why, due to the special dispensation, we are continuing STT (securities transaction tax)," he said.
(Reuters) - The brother of suspected Florida high school shooter Nikolas Cruz was arrested on Monday afternoon for trespassing at the school where 17 people were shot dead last month, according to the Broward County Sheriff' Office.
Zachary Cruz, brother of suspected Florida high school shooter Nikolas Cruz, is shown in this booking photo, after being arrested at the school where 17 people were shot dead last month, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office, in Parkland, Florida, U.S., March 19, 2018.

Zachary Cruz, 18, told deputies he went to the campus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to “reflect on the school shooting and soak it in,” according to the arrest report.
He was being held at the same Broward County jail in downtown Fort Lauderdale where his brother is being held, jail records on Monday night showed. Zachary Cruz was being held on a $25 bond, while his brother, Nikolas Cruz is charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder, and has no bond, county records showed.
Nikolas Cruz, 19, is charged with carrying out the massacre at the high school in Parkland, Florida on Feb. 14.
Zachary Cruz was warned by school officials not to enter the school but “surpassed all locked doors and gates and proceeded to ride his skateboard through school grounds” and was arrested at 4:50 pm (2050 GMT), the report said.
The report said Zachary Cruz had no connections to Broward County at this time.
The sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Zachary Cruz had legal representation.
Law enforcement officers across the country may be wearing a new kind of bulletproof vest in the near future, and the new design could very well be the work of a Wetumpka teenager.
17-year old Lucar Lynn is a senior at Wetumpka High School and has invented a new Kevlar design. Lynn's specific invention focuses not on the actual materials that make up the Kevlar vest, but instead it focuses on how the vest is designed, with particular emphasis on how the materials are woven together.
Lynn is a budding scientist. He loves math and numbers, and others agree. The teen recently won awards at a science fair in California for new Kevlar design and is currently waiting on a patent.

“The Bachelorette” Season 14 debut on ABC Monday night was down in the overnight ratings compared last season's premiere, making it the lowest-rated season premiere in the show's history. On NBC, Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals was approximately even with 2017's Game 1.
Airing from 8-10 p.m., “The Bachelorette” debuted to a 1.4 rating in adults 18-49 and 5.6 million viewers. That is down approximately 22% in the demo compared to the 1.8 drawn by last season's premiere. The previous premiere also drew 5.7 million viewers. Despite this, it was still the most-watched show of the night and the second highest-rated behind only the Stanley Cup. It should also be noted that the show typically premieres the week prior to Memorial Day rather than on Memorial Day. It was also in line with its performance last Memorial Day (1.5, 5.7 million).
Later on ABC, a new episode of “The Crossing” (0.5, 2.7 million) was down in total viewers compared to its last new episode two weeks ago.
Airing from 8-11 p.m., Game 1 is currently at a 1.6 and 4.9 million viewers, though due to the nature of live sports, these numbers could be subject to adjustment later today. As it stands currently, this year's Game 1 is down just a few percentage points in the demo from last year's opener, which drew a 1.7 and 4.9 million viewers.
The two “bonus' episodes of “Lucifer” each drew a 0.5, marking a new series low. The first episode averaged 2.6 million viewers, while the second averaged 2.3 million.
CBS aired mostly repeats except for a new episode of “Elementary” (0.4, 4 million) which is currently at a new series low.
On The CW, “Supergirl” (0.4,1.6 million) was even. The finale of “iZombie” (0.2, 0.76 million) was up in total viewers.
NBC won the night with a 1.6 and 4.8 million viewers. ABC was second with a 1.1 and 4.6 million. CBS and Fox tied for third in the demo with a 0.5. CBS was third in viewers with 3.9 million. Fox was fourth with 2.4 million. The CW averaged a 0.3 and 1.2 million.
Nagpur Soybean, Soyoil, Soymeal Open-February 2, 2018 Nagpur, Feb 2 (Reuters) – Soyabean and Cottonseed oil today moved down in Vidarbha region of Western Maharashtra on stockists selling, driven by higher imports amid weak global cues.

Europeans are having a bigger impact in the NHL now than ever before. Of the 985 players to play in at least one game this season, 268, or 27 percent, were born in Europe. Europeans have been at the pinnacle of success in recent seasons, winning five of the past 10 Hart, Art Ross, and Norris Trophy winners. But European success in the NHL hasn't just been recent.
Joe Hall, who was born in England but moved to Manitoba as a toddler, made his NHL debut in 1917 and was the first European-born player in the league. However, the first European-trained player didn't debut until Jan. 27, 1965 when Swede Ulf Sterner joined the New York Rangers. During the 1960s and 70s, Europeans started making names for themselves with the emergence of Stan Mikita.
This success continued in the 1980s and 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to the league's current landscape. With many iconic names, Europeans have had great success in the league. Let's look at the 10 greatest European forwards to ever play in the NHL.
1. Jaromir Jagr, Czech Republic (Czechoslovakia)
At this point, it looks like Jaromir Jagr's NHL career may have concluded. If that is the case, what a career it was. When he is first eligible for Hockey Hall of Fame induction three years after he formally retires, he's certain to be inducted.
He ranks third all-time in goals with 766, second in points with 1,921, and third in games played with 1,733. Despite not scoring more than 50 points in three of the past four seasons, he still ranks 25th in history with a 1.109 points-per-game rate. When you use era-adjusted scoring, Jagr is second all-time in goals with 841 and only behind Gordie Howe.
He has the awards with one Hart Memorial Trophy, five Art Ross Trophies, and is an eight-time all-star. That doesn't include the four times he finished runner-up in MVP voting and the three seasons he led the league in assists. For as impressive as his career has been, he will forever be linked to the games he lost due to work stoppages and his decision to depart for the KHL for three seasons, cutting into his peak seasons.
In recent seasons, Jagr became one of the most beloved players in the game and was notable for his insane work ethic into his 40s, even requesting a key to the Dallas Stars' practice facility. He also had his own fan club called the “Traveling Jagrs.”
2. Teemu Selanne, Finland
Of course, this list has to include the Finnish Flash. What's to be said about Teemu Selanne that hasn't already been quipped? The 2017 Hall of Fame inductee is beloved in both his homeland of Finland and North America. As one of the all-time bests, Selanne played the game well and played it with integrity.
Selanne's 684 goals are just outside the top 10, good enough for 11th all-time. He made an immediate impact, scoring 76 goals during his rookie campaign, earning him the Calder Memorial Trophy. The culmination of Selanne's career came when he finally captured the Stanley Cup in 2007.
3. Stan Mikita, Slovak Republic
Although Stan Mikita is a Canadian national, he was originally born in Sokolče, Slovak Republic under the name Stanislav Guoth. He remained in Europe until he was eight years old when he fled to Canada to escape the Communist-controlled Czechoslovakia. In Canada, he was adopted by his aunt and uncle and took their surname, Mikita.
After leading the Chicago Black Hawks to the Stanley Cup in 1961 with six goals, he emerged as one of the NHL's best players the following season. Over the course of his career, Mikita racked up 1,467 points, good enough for 14th all-time. He also earned four Art Ross Trophies, two Hart Memorial Trophies, and two Lady Byng Trophies and was an eight-time all-star. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983.
Mikita and teammate Bobby Hull were known for using extremely curved sticks, which led the NHL to limit stick curvature to half an inch. Mikita was also one of the first to use a full helmet that included ear protection after part of his right ear was ripped off by a puck.
4. Peter Stastny, Slovakia (Czechoslovakia)
Although Peter's son, Paul, is the more recognizable Stastny in today's NHL, Peter was a stellar player during the 1980s and 90s. Peter grew up in modern-day Slovakia while the Communist Bloc was still in power and didn't play his first NHL game until the 1980-81 season when he was already 24. Peter and his brother, Anton, defected from Czechoslovakia and became the first stars from the Eastern Bloc to play in the NHL. Their decisions to defect was pivotal and led to more players defecting until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
Upon arriving in North America, both Stastnys joined the Quebec Nordiques where Peter became a fan favorite, learning to speak French. He was an immediate success, winning the 1981 Calder Memorial Trophy and became the first player to score 100 points in his rookie season. He was also the second-highest scorer during the 1980s behind only Wayne Gretzky.
Peter's late arrival in the NHL meant that he only played in 977 regular season games but scored 450 goals and 1,239 points in the process. His 1.27 career points-per-game is the seventh-highest mark in league history and his points are second-most for a player with less than 1,000 games played. In 1998, Peter was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on his first ballot.
5. Jari Kurri, Finland
The original “Finnish Flash,” Jari Kurri was a member of the Edmonton Oilers teams that won five Stanley Cups, including four with Wayne Gretzky on the roster. Kurri's success is often linked to Gretzky and Mark Messier but Kurri was still plenty productive after Gretzky was traded with 195 points in 156 games until Kurri also departed Edmonton.
The Kurri-Gretzky duo is one of the best in history with Gretzky assisting on over 50 percent of Kurri's goals and Kurri assisting on 22 percent of Gretzky's. In total, Kurri scored 601 goals and had 1,398 points, 20th and 21st all-time. He did his best work in the postseason with 233 points in 200 games, leading the playoffs in goals four times.
Although he never won an MVP, he was a five-time all-star, led the league in goals once, and won the 1985 Lady Byng Trophy. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001.
6. Alexander Ovechkin, Russia (USSR)
With a bounceback season in 2017-18 and his seventh Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy, Ovechkin reconfirmed his status as the best scorer of his generation. He scored his 600th goal this season and became the fourth ever to do so in less than 1,000 games. Already 19th all-time in goals and only 32, Ovechkin is likely to get into the top 15 next seasons and has an outside chance at catching Gretzky's 894 goals by career end.
His dynamic shot and quick release have him in the conversation as the best goal scorer to ever lace-up. Using era-adjusted stats, Ovechkin's goal total jumps from 607 to 688 and to seventh all-time. Given that he has played most of his career in the “dead puck era,” the argument could be made that his is already the best ever. For him to pass Gretzky's record, he needs to average 35 goals for the next eight seasons. An outside chance, but a pursuit worth paying attention to.
In addition to his Rocket Richard Trophies, Ovechkin won the 2006 Calder Memorial Trophy, has three Hart Memorial Trophies, one Art Ross Trophy, and is an 11-time all-star. His only knock is the Washington Capitals inability to get out of the second round in the playoffs. However, despite his team's struggles, Ovechkin has averaged nearly a point-per-game in 102 career playoff games.
7. Peter Forsberg, Sweden
One player who we wish we could've seen play more NHL games is Peter Forsberg. Playing in only 708 NHL games, Forsberg amassed 885 points and never had a season where he finished with a minus rating (aside from his brief comeback in 2011 where he only played in two games).
He was part of one of the biggest trades in history when he was dealt from the Philadelphia Flyers to the Quebec Nordiques for Eric Lindros. Forsberg had immediate success, winning the 1995 Calder Memorial Trophy. He is also one the 2003 Art Ross and Hart Memorial Trophies and was a three-time all-star.
Forsberg also excelled in big games, amassing 171 points in 151 playoffs games, on his way to two Stanley Cups. Forsberg was one of the best playmakers of his generation, and his 1.25 points-per-game stands eighth all-time and he is fourth all-time in career assists-per-game. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2014.
8. Sergei Fedorov, Russia (USSR)
Sergei Fedorov is a childhood favorite. He was one of the game's most versatile players, with the ability to play forward or on defense. He translated his dual offensive and defensive prowess into two Selke Trophies as well as a Hart Memorial Trophy.
Fedorov's 1,179 career points and plus-261 rating were good enough to get him elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2015. With the Detroit Red Wings, he was part of the famed “Russian Five” unit that was unstoppable in the 1997 Playoffs, going 16-0 when one of the five scored and 0-4 when they did not. Federov won that Stanley Cup with the Red Wings and two additional Cups, one in 1998 and the second in 2002.
9. Mats Sundin, Sweden
One of the most endeared Toronto Maple Leafs in recent memory is Mats Sundin. Although he never captured Toronto's elusive Stanley Cup, he proved to be a great leader and was a model of consistency with 12 consecutive seasons of at least 70 points.
Over the course of this career, he averaged just over a point-per-game and tallied 1,349 points in total. That mark is the most of any Swede and Sundin is also the Leafs all-time leading goal scorer (420) and points getter (987). He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2012 and his number was retired by the Maple Leafs in 2016.
10. Evgeni Malkin, Russia (USSR)
The NHL may not consider Evgeni Malkin to be among the 100 greatest players of all-time, but he is certainly one of the 10 best European forwards to play. In his 12 seasons, he has 370 goals and 930 points in 784 games for a 1.19 points-per-game average. He won the 2007 Calder Memorial Trophy, has two Art Ross Trophies, and one Hart Memorial Trophy to his name.
Malkin has been his best when the lights are brightest with 162 points in 154 playoff games and won the 2009 Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP. In 2017, when his Pittsburgh Penguins won the Stanley Cup, Malkin led the postseason with 28 points. He also performs at an elite level when teammate Sidney Crosby is absent with injury. In 2011-12, when Crosby was held to 22 games, Malkin scored 50 goals and had 109 points to lead the league.
If there is one question mark to Malkin's career, it is his own ability to stay on the ice. In his 12 seasons, he has appeared in all 82 games just twice. But, in spite of his injuries, he is one of the most dynamic players of his generation and will be enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame when eligible.
As is always the case with these lists, half of the fun is the debate. Is someone missing? Should someone not be on the list? Comment below with your thoughts.
Lyft is going to start offering its drivers access to college advising and tuition discounts for classes, certificates and degrees through Guild Education. The discounts for Lyft drivers will range between five to 20 percent off, with the average Lyft driver working to earn a degree saving $4,220 per year.
The majority of Lyft drivers are part-time, with 93 percent driving less than 20 hours a week, and looking to achieve long-term goals, the company said in a press release.
“We know that many Lyft drivers are working to achieve personal or professional goals, which often include continued education and learning,” Lyft Co-founder and President John Zimmer said in a statement.” We're happy to offer this resource to help drivers succeed both on and off the platform.”
Through Guild, drivers will have access to thousands of classes from more than 80 online, non-profit universities and other learning providers. The programs include Bachelor's and Master's degrees, certificates in data science and HTML, GEDs and more.
Guild's education providers include edX, Bellevue University, University of Denver, Wilmington University and others. The startup, which raised a $21 million Series B round in September, also works with companies like Chipotle, Taco Bell and other Fortune 1000 companies.
Lyft competitor Uber has also offered education incentives to its drivers. In September, for example, Uber partnered with South Seattle College to create a scholarship program for up to three quarters of pre-paid tuition.

Standing on the rear deck of the Canadian warship HMCS St. John's, Howard Shillingford shook his head as he recalled the sound hurricane Maria made when the Category 5 storm descended on his retirement home on the tiny island of Dominica.
“The hurricane was like the devil himself,” Shillingford, a longtime resident of Newmarket, Ont., said Thursday after he and his wife Rosemary boarded the frigate in Halifax harbour to thank the crew for rescuing them last week from the devastated Caribbean island.

Shillingford, who was born in Dominica and is now a dual citizen, said he'll never forget the eerie howling of Maria as she tore the roof off the couple's house in the mountains near Giraudel.
“It talks to you. It teases you. Comes and goes. And the noise. When the roof was leaving it was like a machine gun,” he said, describing the sound the rafters made as nails were pulled from the wood. “Dat! Dat! Dat! Dat! Dat!”
“It was so powerful that the leaves from the trees were stuck on the wall. And when you pulled them off, it took the paint off.”
As the front door was blown open and the rain poured in through a gaping hole in the ceiling, the couple retreated to their bathroom with their cat.
“It was relentless,” Rosemary Shillingford said. “The noise never stopped for nine hours.”
Back in Canada, their daughter, Marlene, had reached out to federal government to determine if they could be airlifted to safety.
Almost a week later, on Sept. 24, a Sea King helicopter from the Halifax-based warship touched down in a nearby ball field and carried the couple to Dominica's airport, where a Royal Canadian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft carried them to a waiting airliner in Barbados.
“When the helicopter came, that was the best day ever,” Howard Shillingford said.

The couple, who have been visiting Dominica for the past 25 years, eventually made their way to Halifax, where their daughter works as a chief warrant officer at nearby Canadian Forces Base Shearwater.
“We want to say thank you to the Canadian Armed Forces,” Marlene Shillingford said. “Without them, they'd still be stuck on the island.”
The three were among dozens of family and friends who greeted the ship when it pulled into port under bright sunshine after a month-long humanitarian and disaster-relief mission.
In early September, the ship sailed to South Caicos, where the 230-member crew helped clear debris, completed electrical repairs and delivered fresh water. The island was heavily damaged on Sept. 7 by hurricane Irma, a Category 5 storm that churned out winds clocked at 281 kilometres per hour.
However, the ship had to leave the island after almost a week when hurricane Maria arrived. The ship's captain, Cmdr. Gord Noseworthy, had planned to return to South Caicos but the vessel was diverted to Dominica because the need for immediate help was critical.

The ship's crew again helped clear debris, deliver water and repair generators. And its Sea King crews rescued a number of other Canadians and locals stranded in more remote parts of the island.
“It was obvious that we were in a life-saving situation,” Noseworthy said. “The entire island is pretty much decimated … It will be quite a while before they recover from this traumatic event.”
As of Thursday, the island of 71,000 people remains largely paralyzed by a lack of water, electricity and communications. According to published reports, the hurricane left 27 people dead and damaged or destroyed 90 per cent of its buildings.
Noseworthy said the decision to leave the region was based on the fact that power had been restored to the island's airport and the capital, Roseau.
“It wasn't a decision that was taken lightly,” he said, adding that Roseau was in a “self-sufficient state” now that various agencies and non-government organizations were on the ground providing key supplies.
“I'm confident that the locals are well looked after with the NGOs and the various other organizations in that area.”
As for the Shillingford's, Howard said he plans to return after Christmas to sell the house.
“I don't want to live there anymore,” he said. “No way.”
Blockchain has taken the world by storm. Whether it's in the form of cryptocurrency or an application designed to cut out middlemen, people are very excited about the capabilities of the blockchain. But the talk of blockchain changing the world may still be a bit premature. We know that the technology is still in its infancy and faces significant issues that must be solved if blockchain is ever going to fulfill its massive potential.
Before blockchain can revolutionize currency and many other sectors, serious problems must be addressed. Jordan Lindsey, an early investor in crypto and the founder of the Bitcoin Growth Bot, is one of the rare few who is not afraid to take a hard look at the problems associated with blockchain. After all, that's the first step to solving those problems. Here are five problems with blockchain that must be solved.
Blockchain Has an Energy Problem
As of Monday, November 20th, 2017, Digiconomist's Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index discovered that Bitcoin uses more energy than 159 countries. This enormous amount of energy consumption presents a very real problem. Part of the problem is that every node in the blockchain network is required to verify each transaction.
This problem is compounded by the fact that Bitcoin relies on encryption to provide security and consensus across the network. For each node to prove that the transaction is legitimate, computers are required to solve complex mathematical equations. These computers must use a large amount of power in order to do so.
Smaller blockchains currently don't have the same energy problem that Bitcoin does. But as any blockchain grows larger, developers will need to find a way to reduce the computational energy required. Otherwise, the economic and environmental toll will be unsustainable.
Lack of Regulation Brings Risk
When innovators innovate, regulators are usually left scrambling to play catch-up. The innovation in blockchain has given predators many easy targets to scam while regulators are catching up. Most ICO's are legitimate, but nevertheless, some have been revealed as nothing more than Ponzi schemes.
Moreover, cryptocurrencies using blockchain have been at the center of a lot of illicit use cases. The anonymity provided by blockchain is extremely attractive to criminals engaging in terrorism, drug trade, and money laundering. Regulators also worry that cryptocurrency provides an avenue for additional tax evasion.
Many early adopters of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are currently railing against regulation since one of the central concepts behind blockchain is decentralization. In fact, coming regulation has a lot to do with the current downswing in the price of many cryptocurrencies. But regulation isn't necessarily a bad thing. Regulation can bring legitimacy to blockchain technologies that allow their adoption to become more mainstream.
Moreover, while Jordan Lindsey is sure to advise the followers of his YouTube channel to always pay attention to new regulations, it's important not to overreact. Instead, take the long view. Of course, it'll take some time to figure out regulations, but the potential of the blockchain will never be completely stymied.
The Blockchain Isn't User-Friendly
Chances are if you have even a basic understanding of blockchain technology you had to do a fair bit of reading and critical thinking to understand it. And we've all seen that blank stare on our friends' faces as we describe the digital public ledger. This problem may seem trivial, but in order for blockchain technologies to have a big effect, they need widespread adoption.
Additionally, the actual interface of many blockchain technologies is not user-friendly. Cryptocurrencies require an e-wallet which is a concept many are not familiar with and don't trust. The less technologically-inclined people will have serious difficulties using this technology.
Again, this is important because many blockchain technologies need widespread acceptance to be effective. People tend to choose the path of the least resistance, and if they can't see how blockchain technologies can make their life significantly easier they are likely to stick with the status quo. Investors like Jordan Lindsey are actively working to solve this kind of problem by educating the public on the new technologies, but more must be done.
As Blockchains Grow They Get Slower
In today's society speed is king. People want things done quicker and quicker. However, the larger a blockchain gets, the more computational power required to solve the mathematical puzzle. This additional computational power also requires more time. Bitcoin, for example, requires ten minutes per block, and during peak transaction times it can take hours for your transaction to be accepted.
This means that there is no guarantee your transaction will be completed in a reasonable amount of time. With a smaller blockchain, the nodes can handle the number of transactions and therefore you'll have a consistent amount of time until your transaction is posted. But as we see Bitcoin grow larger and larger, only certain transactions can be handled in a single 10-minute block. The result is large fees to get your transaction done quickly or a long wait.
Payment methods like cash and debit cards make transactions much quicker. People are unlikely to change systems when transactions are so inefficient. Developers must address these computational problems if the blockchain is to become more mainstream.
Banks and Government Have a Vested Interest in the Failure of the Blockchain
The simple reality is that big banking and governments have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Big banks have extreme lobbying power and can actively fight against changes that would cost them their power and money. Whereas the average citizen takes the path of the least resistance, banks will likely fight tooth and claw to make sure they aren't marginalized.
The government also benefits from the traditional system of currency which blockchain threatens to change. The Federal Reserve allows the U.S. government to print money and spend it before suffering the effects of inflation. This strategy works great for governments but not so great for the citizens. It will take a very active movement from the citizens for widespread adoption of blockchain technology.
To be fair, there are also blockchain technologies that can benefit the government. One example is data storage systems on blockchain that can streamline the large amount of data governments need to store. In fact, in a recent video on Jordan Lindsey's YouTube channel, he pointed out a provision in a bill passed by Donald Trump that called for more research into blockchain technology.
Will Blockchain Live Up to Its Potential?
Just because blockchain has serious issues doesn't mean that it isn't going to be as impactful as people think. Innovation has a way of washing away problems that naysayers come up with. Blockchain and cryptocurrency technology are still in their infancy. While it is clear the blockchain is still far from perfect, there are very smart people around the world working hard to improve and fix those issues.
The issue with computational power could be solved with an advance in data processing technology. As the technology is perfected, developers will work to create more user-friendly interfaces. Some regulation could help mainstream acceptance of blockchain and cryptocurrencies by preventing illicit activity. Ten years from now these problems could be completely obsolete. That's why investors like Jordan Lindsey will continue to invest and participate in the growing blockchain technology movement.

The K75 ALPHA Concept Will Keep You Smiling
Based in Istanbul, Mehmet Doruk Erdem is a brilliant designer who loves to mix fusion with reality, blurring the boundaries between vehicle brands, and trying to shock and awe every single one of us with his unique ideas and futuristic vehicle concepts.
A while ago he imagined a ravishing motorcycle called ‘K75 typhoon' and now the Turkish designer has joined forces with motorcycle expert Mark Atkinson to bring this streamliner motorcycle design to life. The resulting bike has been dubbed as the ‘K75 ALPHA' and it shows off an interesting blend between a traditional styling and 21-st century streamlined lines.
Based upon the classic BMW ‘K75 triple', this innovative bike features an elegant rolling chassis, with hand-made bodywork. The sculptural front fairing benefits from a neo-retro style, something of an influence in the designers' portfolio, and what's even more interesting is that these guys fabricated most of the K75 Alpha and its components from scratch – if you're going to do something, it's better you do it yourself, right?
With a bespoke chassis, a center hub pivot, hand-machined aluminum linkage, as well as a bellcrank-actuated steering system, things are bound to get interesting. Since this is still just a concept, there's no word on driving dynamics or performance numbers, obviously. However, ‘boring' is not a word I'd use when looking at this amazing thing.

OTTAWA – In a chilling videotape confession played for a jury in an Ottawa courtroom on Friday, Basil Borutski detailed how he methodically drove around Renfrew County on a clear, September day two years ago, and killed three women in a little over an hour.
“I killed them because they were not innocent,” Borutski said in the confession given to police the day after the killings in September 2015.
“They were guilty. I was innocent. I've done nothing wrong.”
Borutski, 59, is on trial for first degree murder in the deaths of 66-year-old Carol Culleton, 36-year-old Anastasia Kuzyk and 48-year-old Nathalie Warmerdam.
They were all killed in their homes in the Ottawa Valley northwest of Ottawa.
Borutski sat still and silent as the tape was played. He is representing himself, but refuses to participate, ignoring the judge and lawyers completely, staring straight ahead, often with his eyes closed.

That demeanour is in stark contrast to the video confession, where he yells and curses one moment and then sobs quietly as he weaves a terrifying narrative of the events of the fatal day.
His confession was difficult to follow at times, as he manoeuvred back and forth between the details of the killings and events that occurred in the days and even years leading up to them.
He screams as he accuses the police of harassment, threatening to shoot them if they come to his house again. He rails against crisis lines and lawyers that refuse to help him, yelling that he knew he was going to “explode” after years of people lying and having him thrown in jail for crimes he didn't commit.
“Nobody (expletive) listens to me,” he shouts. “Nobody helps me. Nobody. And I was not lying. Ever.”
As he gets to the details of how he killed Culleton, who was the first to die that day, his voice softens and he buries his head in his hands.
The night before the murders, he said, he went to see Culleton, who he claims to have dated, at her cottage on Kamaniskeg Lake, where he said she and her new boyfriend laughed at him.
Then he returned to his home, about 24 km away in Palmer Rapids, Ont., and drank rye with a neighbour while they discussed the Bible, before falling asleep on the couch.

The next morning, he borrowed a friend's car, stopped for gas and then drove back to Culleton's cottage.
“I remember thinking that God is really helping me because when I went to Carol's, Carol walked right outside,” he says, so quietly it is at times difficult to hear, with long pauses between sentences.
“And then I asked her, I said, ‘Why do you hate me, why are you doing this to me?' And then she closed the door, I was right there, and then I broke the window with my elbow and I reached in and I unlocked the door. And she said, ‘This isn't you, Basil, this is not you'.”
He said Culleton then told him a man was coming over to fix the electricity and he told her she was lying.
“There was a, a cable, a TV coil, I picked it up and I hit her with it and I wrapped it around her head. She just kept saying ‘this is not you Basil, this is not you.' And then, then I walked around the cottage.”
He said he found her purse and took her keys and phone and car. He threw the phone out the window as he drove so nobody could see the text message conversation they'd had.
He drove to Kuzyk's house, about 20 kilometres away in Wilno, Ont., and she too walked outside before going back into her home after seeing him. He followed.

“I asked Anastasia ‘why did you lie in court?' and she said ‘I didn't,' and the gun went off. Because it's just lying.”
He said God then told him to get back in the car so he did and drove to Warmerdam's home, about 30 kilometres west in Cormac, Ont.
“What happened? I just drove in, walked in the door, she was sitting there, she went around the corner, I followed her. Boom. That was it and I walked out. It was funny, like I wasn't even pulling the trigger on the gun, the gun was just going off. Boop.”
Borutski at one point said the Bible makes a distinction between killing and murder and only murder is wrong because it is taking the life of someone who is innocent. That's why, he said, he didn't shoot himself that day, because it would have been like murdering himself.
He said that throughout much of the day he experienced an out-of-body experience and described himself repeatedly as a “zombie.”
The trial resumes Tuesday.
The Department of Environmental Affairs has been slammed for allowing canned lion hunting and the export of lion bones without evidence that it has any scientific or conservation value. The British NGO Born Free Foundation says that the department is supporting a small clique of breeders and the situation is providing loopholes for wildlife traffickers. By DON PINNOCK.
In a report, Cash Before Conservation, released on 19 March, Born Free says the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) persists in allowing canned hunting, trade in lion bones and sale of rhino horn while admitting its decisions are not backed by science or conservation information.
“It is alarming,” says the report, “that the DEA has issued an export quota of 800 skeletons and permits for thousands of other skeletons and large quantities of bones since 2008 without having completed any of the research it has now commissioned. This also applies to the continued breeding of lions for hunting.”
Born Free says the DEA also cannot demonstrate that the trade in bones from captive-bred lions will in fact protect wild lions in Africa or tigers in Asia, neither can it provide any evidence that the trade will not prejudice the survival of wild lions.
“Far from contributing to lion conservation, lion breeding poses an additional threat to wild lions through the legal export of lion bones, mainly to Asia. The trade stimulates demand for lion bones, which are increasingly used as a substitute for tiger bones in wines.
“This in turn incentivises poachers to target wild lions and launder their bones into these markets.”
This appears to be confirmed by an increase of the past 18 months of wild lions killed by poachers for body parts in Southern Africa.
The report says profits are being placed before sound and ethical wildlife management. This is having an increasing impact on world opinion, and South Africa's stance on captive lion breeding has been intensely criticised, both domestically and abroad. Even the world's largest hunting organisation, Safari Club International, recently refused to acknowledge trophies from or advertise hunts of canned lions.
‘In the light of this overwhelming opposition,' says the report, ‘why does the DEA still persist in allowing the captive breeding of lions and lion bone exports?'
Born Free expressed concern that the legal trade in captive bred lion skeletons and bones may be used as a cover by criminal syndicates to launder illegally obtained bones and skeletons from wild-caught animals. According to many conservation organizations and wildlife groups, syndicates involved in the illegal trade in wildlife are exploiting rising prices for fake tiger bones.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates that as few as 20 000 wild lions remain in Africa, occupying just 8% of their historic range. Breeding facilities, mainly in the Free State and North West Province, privately own around 8 000 lions and other predators at more than 200 sites, many languishing in poor conditions.
Between 2008 and 2015, South Africa issued permits for the export of more than 5,363 lion skeletons, nearly 98% of which went to Laos and Vietnam, countries considered by global conservation and law enforcement agencies as key conduits for massive illegal international trade in wildlife.
In a written answer to a question in Parliament, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Edna Molewa, admitted that permits for the sale of lion bones and skeletons included some to the notorious Laotian wildlife trafficker Vixay Keosavang. This is despite the fact that Keosavang's role in widespread illegal wildlife trade had been noted by various law enforcement agencies in Asia from as early as 2003.
Keosavang also played a key role in one of South Africa's best known rhino poaching cases in which a Thai citizen, Chumlong Lemtonghtai, was found guilty of staging “pseudo hunts” during which a large number of rhinos were shot, ostensibly to be exported as trophies. In fact the horns were sold into the Far Eastern traditional medicine market.
Last year The Guardian reported that Keosavang was granted permission to trade in 12 different species including crocodiles, monkey and pangolin anteaters, the skins of 100,000 pythons, 250 tonnes of soft-shelled turtles (which would mean killing about 45,000 of the animals), 100 tonnes of dogs, which are commonly cooked in Vietnamese restaurants, 1,000 magpies and 20 tonnes of animal bones, probably for ‘tiger-bone' wine.
Information obtained from the Gauteng Provincial Government by researchers also shows that in 2016, permits were issued for the export of 153 lion skeletons to Vinasakhone Trading in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), a company which has repeatedly been shown to be at the centre of extensive illegal trade in wildlife.
According to the report, in South Africa captive lions bred to be killed are unashamedly exploited for profit by their captors at every stage of their often short lives. Cubs are removed within a few days of birth in order to bring their mothers back into breeding condition quickly.
“They provide unwitting tourists with cute photo props and misguided volunteers with cubs to hand-rear in the mistaken belief that they are genuine orphans and that, one day, they are destined to be returned to the wild.
“As the animals grow,” says the report, “they are used for other tourist activities such as walking with lions. The ultimate fate for many of these unfortunate animals is to be shot in a canned hunt by a paying hunter, usually from overseas, to be killed so their body parts can be exported to Asian markets, or to be cycled back into the breeding machine.”
Under the banner of sustainable use, the DEA has increasingly treated the wild creatures it should be protecting as a source of revenue. The number of predators bred in captivity in the country has increased significantly over the past 20 years and it now holds more lions in captivity than any other country in the world. During this period, South Africa became one of the few administrations advocating international sales of elephant ivory and the breeding of colour variant game species. Controversially, it also recently re-opened domestic trade in rhino horn and is the largest global exporter of live cheetahs.
According to Born Free, Minister Molewa, who used to be premier of North West Province where canned hunting of lions is widespread, appears to be working against earlier recommendations of three environmental ministers who preceded her. In 1997 Pallo Jordan recommended a moratorium of the issuing of licenses to lion breeding facilities. His successor, Vali Moosa, was outright opposed to breeding of lions for hunting and his successor, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said the practice of captive-bred hunting should be disallowed.
Molewa appears to have sidestepped the issue of canned lion hunting by insisting that the DEA does not have a mandate to look after the welfare of wild animals in captivity. She says she believes this duty falls under the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), which administers the Animal Protection Act and the Performing Animals Act (these acts were never intended to deal with the welfare of wild animals held in captivity).
In April 2015, a draft Biodiversity Management Plan for Lion (BMP) was submitted to parliament which encouraged further growth of the canned lion industry. This contradicted its mandate to conserve wild animals and to not encourage or facilitate trade unless this supported conservation efforts.
The plan was drawn up by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). It emphasised the Government's support for trade in lion parts and stated that one of the objectives of the plan was to “promote sustainable legal trade in lions and lion products”.
According to Wild Aid, this position shows that in the past five years, Van Schalkwyk's attempts to curtail the lion breeding industry has been completely rejected by the DEA under its new leadership and that the government now publicly supports the industry.
The report notes that Molewa has, on several occasions, insisted that lion bone trade has no impact on wild lions, but has not provided any official documents supporting these claims. In 2016 the DEA refused to close down lion breeding facilities because of “legal issues” and because they fell within the government's commitment to “the sustainable use of the country's biodiversity”.
A spin-off of the canned lion industry has been a boom in donkey skins. Lion and other predator breeding facilities have, for many years, bought donkeys from rural communities to feed their animals. With a sudden rise in the use of donkey skins for traditional medicine in China, lion breeders have found another lucrative export.
Several African countries, including Niger and Burkina Faso, have banned the export of the skins because the trade has dramatically reduced donkey numbers. Other countries, including South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, plan to exploit the new market and increase exports by permitting construction of new donkey abattoirs.
The North West Provincial Government, in particular, encourages trade in donkeys with China. In 2015, Premier Supra Mahumapelo met with a delegation from China and afterwards said trade in donkeys must be developed in the province to help create jobs. He called for donkey farms and an abattoir to be created specifically to provide for this trade.
Born Free says it's unclear why the DEA would choose to support the business interests of a small group of people driven by the desire to make profit from lions and their body parts at the expense of good conservation practice – and in the face of overwhelming international criticism.
“Only… lion breeders and bone and skeleton traders benefit from the predator breeding industry and the DEA has no independent information on the number of jobs created by the industry.
“Approving sales to countries where large quantities of wildlife products are laundered into markets across the region – and whose traders are implicated in the illegal trade in rhino horns, pangolins and other species of conservation importance – only compounds the situation and serves to promote trafficking.
“If South Africa is to be regarded as a responsible and ethical custodian of its wildlife and a country that cares about wildlife elsewhere in Africa and across the globe, urgent action needs to be taken to curtail the captive breeding of lions and the sale of their bones and skeletons.” DM

The bike is owned by Drew Paraguya fromthe City of Golden Friendship, Cagayande Oro. The bike sports a non-rigidmildly modified frame. The stance wasslightly lowered, then most of the originalcomponents of the bike was taken out. It wasstripped down to the bare minimum and only themost essential components were left. The bike isdubbed as the “Silver Surfer” as it was built with theSurfer/Skateboarder in mind and is equipped witha detachable surf/skateboard/long board rack.The team at Revolt Cycles decided to make theHonda TMX as the base bike because of its triedand tested reliability and powerful engine. Asidefrom that the bike is very easy to maintain asparts are readily available locally due to the bike's popularity as a mode of public transport such as a tricycle, habal-habal, or delivery bike. “It is also a great benefit for the client as he can access all of that locally for those regular maintenance and checkups. We want most of our customers or clients to be in the direction,” Mr. Jon Kevin Yu of Revolt Cycle said during an interview. “The build is a brat style setup good for a 2-person capacity. We made sure to have those big fat classic tread tires installed as it bring outthe best with its design and looks, but we had trials and errors in getting to that as we had to realign the rims several times, take out the tires andreinstall them to make sure they are centered and aligned in the middle of the bike. We also made a custom “mustache” handlebars which we made twice as the first one got ruined when the bike accidentally fell during mockup. We also did a stainless steel battery box/tray, fabricated a detachable surfboard/ skateboard rack as requested byDrew and that sweet-looking original Honda CB125 tail pipe. This project took us 2 1/2 months to build as we had the engine rebuilt and all the other parts dismantled, checked, repaired and replaced. The most challenging part for this build project might be the handlebar and fitting the muffler. For the handlebar we had to make sure itwas aligned properly and get the right height and width considering it was our first time fabricating a handlebar. For the muffler we had to fabricate a new bracket to mount on the bike. The tricky part was the kick-start. We tested 6 different kinds of kick starts so that it will not hit the muffler,” Mr. Juan Yu shared. The parts used on the bike are all carried and sold by Revolt Cycles.
You can check their Facebook Page. It's a great start for any classic bike build project such as Brats, Scramblers and Café Racer projects. They carry parts such as custom stoplights, bullet signal lights, classic pattern RT tires and custom leather seats. They also fabricate made to order parts such as handlebars and mufflers. They also fabricate stainless steel components for battery/electrical box enclosures and other special request components such as carry racks for luggage, surfboards, skateboards, and downhill long boards. Mr. Jon Kevin Yu has this message to close our interview, “First and foremost thank you to God for all the blessings. Special thanks to Drew Paraguyafor trusting us to work on his bike, to “The Jeb”RJ Ouano for the awesome photos, to the people behind the build, to our supporters, friends and especially to our family and the growing RVLT family. Thank you also to Mr. Al Camba and Mr. Arnel Santos-Yñigo for the opportunity to be featured in InsideRacing Magazine”.

Paki-stan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has come under fire from government and opposition leaders for its decision to withdraw the name of Nasir Saeed Khosa for the post of caretaker Chief Minister in the caretaker setup of Pun-jab.
“PTI's seriousness can be gauged by the fact that the party cannot stand by its own deci-sion about the candida-ture of Nasir Saeed Khosa. And yet these people claim that PTI will build a naya Paki-stan,” Kaira jibed at the rival opposition party.
Federal Information Minister Maryam Au-rangzeb said that PTI's withdrawal was yet an-other example of U-turn. “PTI's actions are based on lies and U-turns,” she said, adding that PTI has only bene-fited the ruling PML-N.
She said that running a government and resolving public's issues was not a child's play.
“You make hasty deci-sions on everything that has caused a lot of damage to the country by your politics of U-turns, confrontation and chaos,” she added.
Senior political analyst Hamid Mir described PTI's move to reverse its decision about the name of caretaker CM as an inappropriate de-cision.
“This will only create an impression as if PTI wants to delay the gen-eral elections,” Mir opined. “The constitu-tion doesn't allow the withdrawal of a name that was publicly an-nounced in consulta-tion with opposition,” he said.
Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah also ruled out the with-drawal of Nasir Khosa's name.
“There is no provision in the constitution to reverse an already agreed decision. Nasir Khosa is an honest per-son,” he added. Earlier, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhry said that Khosa's name was withdrawn over back-lash from a section of media and supporters.
Our attention has been drawn to fake campaign posters of the Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu for the 2019 governorship elections in Delta State pasted by unknown persons across the Federal Capital Territory.
The office of the Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources hereby dissociates itself from the campaign posters which he has absolutely no knowledge of. The Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources has not indicated any interest in running for any elective political office in Delta State.
Dr Kachikwu is focused on delivering on the reforms currently being implemented in the petroleum sector under the leadership of President Buhari and Ag President Osinbajo in line with his duties as Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and Chair of the Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
He remains committed to effectively representing his state of origin, Delta State in the federal cabinet to institutionalise transparency, accountability and productivity in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.
It is gratifying that, despite challenges, measurable progress has been made in achieving important milestones under Kachikwu‘s watch and today, the petroleum sector is more transparent and contributes more to the national coffers. Consolidating on this progress remains the priority of Dr. Kachikwu and he refuses to be distracted from this focus.
Dr. Kachikwu would like to urge stakeholders in both the Oil and Gas sector and indeed the general public to discountenance these unfounded speculations.
The Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources assures all Nigerians of his and Government's continued commitment to the welfare and well-being of the citizenry, while thanking them for usual cooperation and collaboration towards achieving the lofty dreams of a thriving Oil and Gas sector for Nigeria.

The Cariboo Memorial Hospital project has been brought back to life.
That's the message Minister of Health Adrian Dix delivered outside Cariboo Memorial Hospital in Williams Lake Friday morning.
“I am here today to announce that the B.C. government has approved the concept plan and we're moving the Cariboo Regional Hospital project forward to business plan stage,” Dix said. “The acceptance of the concept plan means the hospital is a go.”
Dix said having an upgraded hospital will improve health care in the region by offering single rooms for patients and ensure infection control is better, to name just a few of the many benefits.
“It will offer an element of privacy in our most difficult moments,” the minister said. “And (give) support for the workers who work here who have been dealing with an institution that is past its life.”

Dix said once the business plan is approval, the project will be put out to tender, noting the announcement is the first of its kind for the new government and also a symbolic one, considering what the community has been through with the 2017 wildfires.
“What we are saying very clearly is that … we are here and this is going to be a thriving community 10 years from now and 20 years from now and 30 years from now and thriving communities need modern hospitals and that is what we are going to deliver in Williams Lake.”

This is understandable and I do really feel she should seek a better option.
Recently, we broke up, or realistically, I got the boot (even off her Facebook friends page) as my career went south and I have a few legal matters to resolve.
I've only spent one night at her home in all the years that I've known her.
I'm 62, in love with a woman for 10 years. She has three adult children living under her roof, ages 22 to 28, all young men.
Have you a game plan for me?
Since she apparently doesn't want anything to do with me, (though she emails occasionally), am I a fool hanging on here?
I haven't seen her for four months! It's been brutal!
I know what love is and I do love her and really want her happiness to be first and foremost.
You've already surpassed the odds in a waiting game, with your 10 years of dancing around a romance that never became a live-in relationship.
Now, she's apparently decided that your business problems have made the situation problematic.
On the practical level, her sons contribute financially, while you don't or can't.
But being loved so openly and wholeheartedly as you feel about her, is hard to give up.
There may be hope.
Focus on what's needed to settle your “legal matters.”
Continue gentle email contact and let her know, occasionally, that you miss her. Also, that you're settling your own issues as quickly as you can.
After that, well, if you don't get any signs of re-interest after a couple more months, she's apparently decided that 10 years of being adored at a distance is enough talk with no mutual satisfaction.

Reader: “To “Worried New Wife” — Run! My 16-year relationship started out the same way, though he'd already been divorced for five years.
“His ex-wife had broken up his every relationship before me (I didn't know this, then).
“When I came along, their daughter was forced by the courts to visit/stay at our home, but I wasn't allowed to attend any functions or even give gifts.
“The child is now 23. The relationship was, and is still, uncomfortable between her, me and my daughter.
“It was drilled into his child when very young that I'm the reason her parents aren't together.
“There were constant lies about my daughter, even last year.
“If I had to do it over again, knowing what I know now, I'd run as fast as I can.
“He's a loving and kind person, which is why this was allowed and continued. He was crippled with fear that she'd do something drastic like claim child molestation.
“She dragged us into court, lost and was told by the judge that her whole case was simply out of vindictiveness with no substantial truth.
“She moved with their child without letting us know their location.
“Why did I stay? He'd immediately moved in with me and my kids very early in the relationship and I felt really sorry to tell him to leave.
“Also, he treats me very lovingly and was very kind to my kids.
“But me and my children paid a price. So, no, it's not worth it. I should've stayed single.”

Jimmie Johnson, a seven-time NASCAR champion with eight victories at Charlotte, did not advance out of the first round and will start 25th. Johnson was considered a strong contender to win this race given his history, but the poor qualifying may have dealt him a tough blow.
Johnson said it will be difficult to fight his way up through the field.
"I am disappointed with tonight and I am disappointed with how we are qualifying right now," Johnson said. "We just haven't put our finger on it. But we are working hard at it."
Earnhardt Jr.'s final weekend as a full-time driver at his home track got off to a bad start after crashing on a slick surface in practice.
Track officials added a substance — called PJ11 — to the high line of the track to improve grip. Earnhardt drove his car high early in the afternoon practice session, slipped and hit the wall, prompting his Hendrick Motorsports team to pull out his backup car.
Earnhardt thought the track was too slick.
"I'm avoiding it until somebody can go up there and shows me there is a lap up there," said Earnhardt. "I ain't going near it, on purpose. Might end up it accidentally a few times, but I don't think anybody is willing to go up there without seeing somebody do it first. It's obviously very slick. It's like ice."
None of the drivers crashed during qualifying.
Martin Truex Jr. said he thinks the track surface will get better and better as the weekend progresses.
"I think we just need some cars to run on that stuff and wear it in and get the track kind of prepped," Truex said. "Certainly I don't think anyone expected it to be as challenging as it was. Maybe for the future we definitely need to look at a different way to prep the track so when we go out there guys aren't running into the wall."

Islamabad-Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) acting director general Kiyal Zad Gul's self-styled policies have almost forced 119 daily wagers to lodge protest against the board and some of them have threatened to commit suicide.
Talking to The Nation, PSB workers union secretary M Akram Bhatti has said that anti-human policies of interim setup has created a lot of problems for almost all the employees, who are working at the head office in Islamabad, while other centre employees are also feeling the heat. “We have tried to meet Kiyal Zad several times, but he never spared time for us and when finally we met him and requested him to have mercy on the employees in this holy month of Ramazan and release their salaries, he refused to take responsibility and informed us that he has sent the file to IPC minister Riaz Pirzada for the approval.
“The salaries of only 64 out of 119 Grade-I to IV employees out of 119 were only paid. If the acting DG cannot take simple decisions, how was he handed over such important responsibility? We have requested to Riaz Pirzada as well, who very kindly gave approval to releasing salaries of all the Grade-I to Grade-IV employees for the time being, but rest will continue to suffer,” he added.
He said at one end, the PSB bosses were not ready to release the meager salaries of the employees, while on the other hand, they were free to pass on benefits to their blue-eyed persons, who went to attend so-called sports conference in Karachi and were provided air tickets, accommodation and hefty TA/Das. “We will not sit back and allow them to carry on with anti-workers and anti-sports policies and will soon call an emergency meeting and decide our future course of action.”
Akram said the renovation work and maintenance at the PSB was going unchecked. “The contractors are free to do whatever they like to do and nobody has any sort of check on the work while the most astonishing thing is that daily wagers, who are contractual employees and used to get honorarium on Eids, were denied this time and irrelevant persons from other IPC departments were instead included in the list. It is highly injustice and we request the IPC minister to provide justice to the PSB employees, who have been working in the organisation since long, as it is their right to get honorarium.”
Akram said the acting DG talks about rule of law and stresses upon following rules and regulations. “The real problem is that DDG Technical and Training appointment and his promotion was illegal while a committee was formed which had recommended that Shahid should have been reverted to Grade-18 but after more than two years lapse, no action was taken against him. The poor daily wagers and contractual employees' salaries were stopped and some of them even had stay orders from court, but the PSB bosses have been committing contempt of court,” Akram concluded.
Talking to The Nation, PSB Director National Federations M Azam Dar said the PSB had daily workers and contractual employees since long. “It is a complicated issue and we are trying to resolve it permanently. We have sent file to the minister for approval and in the first phase, Grade-I to IV employees will get salaries very soon, while rest have to wait for few more days.”
When asked Shahid's case, who has been enjoying countless benefits, keep on enjoying joy-rides, as he first went to Baku and now Skardu, where he has no role to play, neither Azam Dar had any answer nor DDG Administration Mansoor Ahmed. Azam said he was not well and going to perform Umrah.
It is high time when IPC minister Riaz Pirzada should intervene and ensure smooth functioning of things as there is absolutely no one, who may stop a few certain individuals from their self-styled policies. Nobody bothers to follow office timings and they keep on doing against the rules and regulations of the sports board.
But with the terrible decision to bracket it all as the ruefully narrated remembrance of the older Conrad (Pablo Schreiber), we're subjected to Captain Obvious contextualizing marked by mood-shattering interjections like “I was furious” (because Sheridan isn't already communicating that?) and “Some of us grow wiser, some of us don't.” (Oh really?) It's the kind of ersatz, actor-undercutting stab at authorial seriousness that makes it as regrettable a choice as Conrad's when he indulges in a night of vandalizing that goes horribly wrong.
The LSU Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab has confirmed a West Nile positive mosquito pool in St. Mary Parish, Jessie Boudreaux of Cajun Mosquito Control said Friday in a news release.
Officials are now following the CDC Expanded Transmission Protocol measures for West Nile virus in the Bayou Vista area, the release said.
1) Residents are encouraged to wear insect repellant, preferably one containing DEET.
Always read repellant labels carefully, especially for younger children. Also, try to wear light
colored, long sleeve clothing and socks.
2) Repair or replace broken screens on Windows and doors, and avoid using perfumes or
colognes.
3) Residents should remove any standing water around their homes or businesses. Clogged
rain gutters and pet water bowls can produce thousands of mosquitoes per week and
something as small as a coke can or bottle cap can produce a brood of mosquitoes. Please
remove any stagnant water.
4) Avoiding mosquitoes and their peak activity times of dusk and dawn is highly
recommended, but if one must be outside, please wear a repellant.
5) Again in 2017, West Nile virus has now been confirmed in St. Mary, Iberia, Lafayette and
St. Martin Parishes. Residents in these areas are being informed that there is a heightened
potential for encephalitis infection within any of these locations.
6) Personal protection and yard sanitation is recommended and encouraged.
7) During the evening hours ULV Truck mounted sprayers will be assigned to spray the Parish
of Saint Mary in an effort to reduce/maintain the vector population below critical levels as
noted in the CDC Expanded Protocol measures. Spraying will be conducted for three
consecutive evenings in the affected areas, storm / weather permitting.
8) The efficacy of these Truck Spraying operations will be determined through the use of
Gravid Traps that are scheduled for operation immediately following the completion of the
mosquito control activities. The number of mosquitoes collected will serve to quantify the
adult population and provide specimens to be submitted for testing at Louisiana Animal

Milling and paving of Spring and Cannon Streets has been rescheduled to 2018.
The South Carolina Department of Transportation postponed the work because of cold weather and holiday--related work restrictions.
When the work eventually happens, one lane of eastbound traffic on Cannon Street and one lane of westbound traffic on Spring Street will remain open.
Due to the narrowness of the streets, this traffic will be diverted into the parking lanes.
The work zone will change daily and will be clearly marked with safety barricades and flagmen. Traffic on the cross streets will be subject to intermittent traffic control as equipment works through the intersections.
The construction was originally slated to start on Dec. 4 and was later pushed back a week because of weather before the final decision came down to start sometime next year.

BLANTYRE-(MaraviPost)-A newly introduced Bwalo Likule Network says it is geared to mobilize young people in Malawi towards active participation in national development.
The Network formally known as inter- university forum for development consists of intellectuals from both public and private universities.
Speaking at a press briefing on Saturday in Blantyre, Bwalo Likule Network National Coordinator Andrew Kaponya said the network seeks to unite young Malawians of various political, religious and tribal divides towards a common goal of achieving national development.
Kaponya observed that currently youths are being relegated to unproductive activities by political parties as agents for violence.
“Sometimes young people have embraced roles that relegate them to violent issues that reflect them as being unpatriotic and negative about issues surrounding their own growth agenda. As such this delays
social economic development of the country,” he said.
The National Coordinator said the network will therefore value mind set change as a critical to national development.
“We believe that only when Malawians leave aside their political differences and support efforts to promote the living standards of people, Malawi shall achieve its development goals,” he said.
Meanwhile, the network plans to embark on unite for development campaign through community engagement and the use of the media to mobilize youths in decision making processes to promote issue based politics.
Sharing similar sentiments Director of Programs for the Network Chimwemwe Kaonga said the network is ready to encourage young people to have self confidence over their own agenda including politics.
“Bwalo Likule Network is convinced that the rate of socio-economic development could be propelled if young people embrace new ways of thinking about their development hence the need to encourage youths in
active participate in all national developments,” he said.
The network seeks to re-define the role of young people in supporting efforts in the socio-economic development of the country as well as engage the mobilized youths to a further step of practically put
mindset change into specific activities.

NEW DELHI - Indian police said Monday they have arrested 23 people after five men were bludgeoned to death by a crazed mob in yet another horrific lynching to rock the country. Local media estimate more than 25 people have been killed in recent months in similar cases sparked by false rumours spread on smartphones of child kidnapping or allegations of thievery or sexual harassment.
The latest incident saw eight men set upon in Dhule district, 330 kilometres from India's financial capital Mumbai in the western state of Maharashtra on Sunday. Police said the attack began after locals spotted one of the eight talking to a child after they disembarked from a bus near the village of Rainpada. “They were confronted by the locals who had gathered at the Sunday market after suspecting them to be child kidnappers,” Dhule police chief M Ramkumar told AFP.Three of them escaped but five were dragged to the village council office and beaten to death with sticks and blunt objects. Police said they identified the alleged attackers from a video shot during the assault. Another dozen suspects were still on the run, they added.
Those killed were from Solapur district of the same state but some 450 kilometres away. The current spate of lynchings started in May last year in eastern Jharkhand state after rumours on WhatsApp about child kidnappers led to the lynching of six men. The rumours have since resurfaced, with attacks reported in at least 11 states. The attacks — usually targeting outsiders — have left authorities scrambling to mount an effective response, with awareness campaigns and public alerts having a limited effect.
Last week a “rumour buster” official tasked with alerting the public to such hoaxes was lynched by a mob in the remote northeastern state of Tripura.
Toronto Mayor John Tory has appointed two city councillors to fill positions previously held by the late Pam McConnell.

Councillor Mihevc has previously been a strong voice at city council for poverty reduction, social justice, and newcomer issues.
He previously worked as the Toronto newcomer advocate to bring communities of all faiths together to welcome Syrian refugees to Toronto. Mihevc has also shown a resolute commitment to the student nutrition program and other services city residents depend on, stated the press release.
Mihevc is delighted to have been asked to lead the critically important work.
.@joemihevc has done admirable work on the City's @TOPublicHealth file & I'm confident he'll do a great job leading our City's poverty reduction efforts. — John Tory (@JohnTory) October 6, 2017
“I want to continue Pam McConnell's legacy to work towards one common goal to build a Toronto where each and every person and community rises to their potential and where there is no hunger, poor housing or lack of employment opportunities,” Mihevc said.
McConnell served the people of Toronto for more than 35 years and died at the age of 71 in early July from a serious undisclosed illness.
In an effort to educate and involve community leaders in the fight against litter in Louisiana, Keep Louisiana Beautiful (KLB) and 23 affiliates, including Keep St. Mary Beautifu,l participated in a statewide litter-thon on March 23 which ended with a press conference in Baton Rouge announcing the results.
Twenty-eight bags and 1,456 pounds of trash were collected by more than 76 community leaders at the third annual “Leaders Against Litter” event hosted by Keep St. Mary Beautiful. Leaders Against Litter is a signature event created by KLB and supported by Volunteer Louisiana that gives local leaders the opportunity to demonstrate their support for keeping Louisiana beautiful by leading the charge against litter in our community.
Local government officials, business and community leaders included St Mary Parish Government parish president and staff; St. Mary Parish Sheriff and deputies; City of Franklin Mayor Pro-Tern and staff; City of Morgan City mayor; City of Patterson mayor and staff; Town of Baldwin mayor; Franklin Chief of Police and officers; Franklin Foundation Hospital; Franklin Foundation Medical Center; Pelican Waste and Debris; Patterson Garden Club; Don't Trash Franklin Group; Baldwin Garden Club; Banner-Tribune; KWBJ; Agus Spa and Teche Talk. All joined Keep St. Mary Beautiful on the east and west side of Northwest Boulevard in the City of Franklin from La. 182 to the intersection of Yokely and Chatsworth Road, collecting various forms of litter to beautify the area in support of St Mary Parish and volunteerism.
Leaders used grabbers and wore event t-shirts to “lead the way to a cleaner Louisiana.” The leaders then collectively signed a Leaders Against Litter pledge confirming their commitment to speak up and spread the word that litter is not acceptable, to pick up litter whenever they see it, and to stand up and lead the way for a litter-free Louisiana.
The pledge board is now a traveling display appearing at different locations where other leaders and volunteers can sign the pledge, engaging even more individuals and extending the impact of Leaders Against Litter.
The Leaders Against Litter events kicked off the Great American Cleanup to be held in the months of March, April and May. Members of the community can become involved by contacting Keep St Mary Beautiful to learn about volunteering opportunities and cleanups at 985-518-1861.

EastEnders fans are angry with bosses over the death of two beloved characters.
As sisters Ronnie and Roxy prepared for Ronnie's wedding to Jack, there were signs that the day would end in a bad way. The night concluded with Roxy jumping into a swimming pool, with Ronnie close behind her - but neither made it out alive.
Despite knowing about their tragic death months in advance, viewers rushed to social media following the upsetting scenes to share their upset.
One viewer wrote: “@bbceastenders why do you always kill the best characters?? I'm never watching again”
While another blasted: “what is eastenders without ronnie n roxy though wtf”
“I swear I'm never watching EastEnders again," another upset fan added.
After the episode, actress Samantha Womack tweeted that she was "honestly broken".
Her co-star then added: "Thank you all for your lovely tweets. I don't really have words right now. But words will come.. in good time # R&R"
Bosses also promised an alternate ending, but it was delayed for over two hours to the anger of many fans .
BBC One Snapchat followers saw Ronnie in tears at the hospital, while another scene showed her sister lying motionless on the snooker table.
Roxy - who had recently turned to drugs - appears to have died from an overdose.
Last month, Charli XCX did a guest DJ set for Nylon Japan's 13th anniversary party. She was joined on stage by PC Music's A. G. Cook, and during their set they played an unreleased Charli cover of Cher's “Believe,” which reimagines the song in the metallic pop style of her most recent output. Their set was recently uploaded online, and you can check out the Cher cover at the 43m14s mark in the video below.
One year after launching at South by Southwest with an augmented reality treasure hunting app, the Utah-based startup Seek has returned with an update transforming its service into a “YouTube for AR”.
Rather than being focused on disappearing, site-specific augmented reality experiences, the company now wants to be a hub where developers can post their augmented reality projects for any of its users to discover.
Seek founder Jon Cheney started working on the app as a traditional treasure hunting game, which evolved from an offline business he'd started in 2016 after spending a few years working for the edtech company, Chegg.
“We were running events that started in January 2016,” Cheney told me. “We put $100 above a waterfall. We started with money and increasing amounts and said let's make an app so we can push a button and buildout clues. A month later we started the app.”
After seeing the success of Pokémon Go, Cheney decided to add AR features to his treasure hunting game.
“It turns out all you have to do to start a successful business is get $100 and bury it in the woods,” Cheney told me.
When it launched the AR-enabled version of the platform at SXSW, it used its own revenue to buy the rewards it had hidden around town. That successful launch brought the company to the attention of brands like Samsung and Cinemark, who signed contracts to develop sponsored AR-augmented treasure hunts.
In the year since, the company has expanded its roster of clients and has generated roughly $1.5 million in revenue.
To date, 1000 AR-developers have used the service to distribute projects — either commercially or on their own.
Brands are also flocking to the new model. So far, the company said that Samsung and Lionsgate are using the new service, according to Cheney. And projects with Six Flags Magic Mountain and Warner Bros. are on the way, Cheney said.
Projects can be discovered through a trending feature and a geo-located map feature which was held over from the first version of Seek, Cheney said.
For Seek, the goal isn't to develop its own AR content, but to be a hub available for Android and iPhone users to get exposure to projects in the $108 billion market for enhanced or virtual reality experiences.
Here's an example of Seek's AR offerings:
If you spend any time in downtown London, you've likely seen and heard a small group of people who preach on street corners.
The city has received dozens of complaints about the individuals and the offensive statements they make as people walk by.
During its meeting on Tuesday, the community and protective services committee moved forward with an attempt to curb the haranguing by endorsing a recommendation from staff to beef up London's nuisance bylaw to include street harassment.
In their report, staff said the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a ruling from the Niagara region that banned abusive behaviour that “unnecessarily interferes with the use and enjoyment of a Park by other persons.”
Under the London proposal, if someone were to be caught hurling abuse at others they could face a $750 ticket.
The proposed changes also include amending the rules surrounding amplified sound to require anyone who wants to use a loudspeaker to apply for a permit.
RELATED: Should you need a permit to use a loudspeaker in public?
Mayor Matt Brown said during the meeting Londoners shouldn't have to face verbal abuse when they go out.
“People from our community, mothers and fathers, individuals and children should expect to be able to go to public spaces and not see people being personally verbally abused,” said Brown.
Brown said his office, the bylaw department and city police have all received dozens of complaints about the individuals who often use megaphones and speakers to spread their message.
He said anyone who finds themselves being accosted shouldn't engage in confrontation but should report the incident to city bylaw officers and the London Police Service.
“Unless this is reported it can't be tracked,” Brown said during the meeting.
Coun. Mo Salih asked staff about some of the legal implications that could come about as a result of amending the bylaw. He questioned whether individuals could say the provision violated their right to freedom of expression under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Staff said in their report that if a municipality wants to limit the freedom, it would have to be a “reasonable limit prescribed by law and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” Staff advised further discussion should take place in camera.
Coun. Jesse Helmer voiced his support for updating the bylaw saying it's not acceptable for residents to have to put up with abusive language being hurled at them.
He told his colleagues he spoke with a couple of the individuals engaged in the preaching activities in the past when they came to city hall to ask for a possible crackdown on their behaviour.
Helmer said he asked them whether they'd considered putting an end to saying “really insulting, vile things,” to people.
“They're clearly not willing to do that,” Helmer said. “Unfortunately, it just keeps going on and on.”
City council will review the recommendation from staff and the community and protective services committee during its meeting on Tuesday, June 12.
LAHORE - Minister for Primary & Secondary Health Kh Imran Nazir inaugurated three-day National Immunization Campaign against polio by administering vaccine to children at
Government Hospital Samanabad
on Monday.
The three-day campaign will conclude on April 19 that will be followed by catch up days on April 20, 21,
As many as 18.6 million children below five years of age will be administered polio drops for which more than 44,000 teams have been constituted
Kh Imran Nazir said that Punjab remained polio free in 2016 due to effective routine immunization and successful anti-polio campaigns.
He stressed the need of consolidated efforts by all the stakeholders to eradicate polio from the country. He said that no province can eliminate polio at own. He said that as long as virus existed in any part of the country, the threat would persist for all children.
Director EPI Dr Muhammad Munir informed that 37845 mobile, 4439 fixed and 2370 transit teams have been constituted to administered polio drops. He said that transit teams appointed on the border districts would ensure polio drops to children coming from other provinces to Punjab.
THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL – MIKE BRUNKER
An explosive compound like the one found in Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock's car and home is believed to have been used last year in an alleged terrorist bombing in New York City.
Authorities say they recovered an undisclosed amount of the compound known as Tannerite from Paddock's home in Mesquite and 50 pounds from his car parked at Mandalay Bay, where he used high-powered firearms to mow down concertgoers at the adjacent Route 91 Harvest festival on Sunday.
Police have not said why the 64-year-old Paddock possessed Tannerite, which is unregulated and legally used by marksmen to create targets that emit a small cloud of smoke when they are struck. Authorities also found ammonium nitrate, another ingredient that can be used to build bombs, in his vehicle at the site of the shooting.
The second phase of important habitat improvements along a beck which runs through Peterlee Industrial Estate is set to start in early spring.
The Wear Rivers Trust, working in partnership with the Coastal Streams Partnership, Environment Agency, Northumbrian Water and local businesses will be working with local contractors to transform a section of Wapping Burn which is currently seen as more of an eyesore than an important wildlife corridor.
The Wapping Burn is a tributary of the Castle Eden Dene, which flows down through Castle Eden Dene Nature Reserve and joins the sea at Horden, has been the focus of crucial restoration efforts over the last three years.
A spokesman for the scheme said: “Many workers from the surrounding businesses were not even aware of its presence due to past neglect. It is hoped that by enhancing instream habitat and providing opportunities for local businesses to get their feet wet through helping to manage the site that wildlife will soon return.
“The improvement work, which is due to be completed by April, will include the installation of scour protection around a surface water outfall to reduce erosion, channel reprofiling, the creation of offline ponds and the planting of native wetland plants.
“Local businesses and volunteer groups will be invited to help plant up the newly created wildlife habitats and also help manage the site in the foreseeable future by removing unwanted weeds and litter.”
“Businesses have been involved in the project development stages for over two years and it is hoped future projects can be delivered to further enhance water quality and instream habitat around the Castle Eden Dene catchment by working in partnership.”
Anyone interested in helping should contact the trust on 01388 488867.
The coroner's van pulled into the driveway sometime after midnight, and for a moment — her dead daughter in her arms — LaTisha Shippy hated God.
“I had hate in my heart for him,” Shippy said. “I questioned my faith, and why this was happening. You don't lose four children and not have some of that.”
Canyon County Coroner Vicki DeGeus-Morris found Shippy in bed and the baby's body, cleaned and dressed, on a changing table in another room. “It was apparent that she had been dead for a while, as the skin was slipping off the entire torso of the baby,” DeGeus-Morris wrote in a coroner's report.
The baby had been dead inside Shippy's womb for days, DeGeus-Morris concluded, and yet Shippy had sought no medical help when she'd felt the nearly full-term baby stop moving. She and her fellow Followers of Christ consider professional medicine an engine of the devil. Instead, she had prayed.
In most states, failing to seek medical care for a nearly 40-week-old fetus might be a crime. Idaho is one of at least four states that provide religious groups broad exemptions from criminal prosecution and civil liability for the deaths of children attributable to medical neglect.
In deep-red Idaho, where the right to be left alone trumps all ideologies, lawmakers have repeatedly rejected proposed changes to the law that would impose criminal or civil penalties for failing to seek medical care for children with life-threatening conditions.
But a growing resistance to Idaho's faith-healing statute is building here in the suburbs west of Boise, home to a group of Followers of Christ, a small Christian denomination that believes in faith healing and strict shunning of those who stray from the church's teachings.
Faced with three deaths linked to faith healing in the county over the last four months, Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue has launched a campaign to change the law, and remove any religious exemptions for the legal obligation to seek medical care for children.

Donahue believes the law allows children to die unnecessarily, and painfully, in ways that the Followers of Christ may not medically understand. He has formed a unit in his department to investigate the death of every child connected to the group — and hopes his findings will prompt the coroner to conduct more complete death examinations of the children.
In Canyon County, children of church members have died from pneumonia, infection of the fetal membrane, failure to administer insulin for diabetes and other preventable causes, and critics say public officials have accepted the deaths too easily.
In the Shippy case, breaking with the custom of most American death investigations — especially those involving a child — DeGeus-Morris did not take the baby's body with her or call the sheriff.
“It's an atrocity,” said Donahue, 54, who first investigated faith-healing deaths as a Canyon County deputy. “If it was cattle being treated like this, no medical care, in distress, if you saw that from the street, we'd have a search warrant and we'd be kicking down doors.”
Donahue testified before a Senate committee in March, arguing that adults should be held criminally liable when they fail to seek medical help for seriously ailing children.
“I've heard we don't want to criminalize the parent. If the parent is criminal, we need to prosecute,” he said. “It's an embarrassment to our state.”
But Donahue may have been too optimistic about the Legislature's intentions.
“Do you think that bill is going to pass?” Majority Leader Bart Davis asked on the Senate floor during debate later that month. “It won't. Because this body is reluctant to punish people criminally for a firmly held religious belief.”
Like previous attempts to change the legislation, the bill was killed on the Senate floor.
Legislators from the Canyon County area vigorously defend the Followers' right to their religious beliefs, and DeGeus-Morris appears to be conducting few investigations of the deaths of Followers' children. The Canyon County prosecutor, citing the exemptions granted religious groups, doesn't take potential cases of medical neglect if the family involved is a member of the Followers of Christ church.
Each year, on average, three children in Idaho die of causes for which they would have otherwise been hospitalized, according to a gubernatorial task force, and the child mortality rate among the Followers of Christ from 2002 to 2011 was 10 times that of the rest of Idaho.
Yet the church has found sympathetic ears in powerful quarters.
At a news conference in January, Senate President Pro Tem Brent Hill said legislators want to recognize religious beliefs and help children. “Most of the people in this room believe that God can help heal,” he said.

Dan Sevy's voice is low and measured, the twang of his career as a country music singer lying heavy on every vowel. He has made a powerful ally in the Legislature, and when he told a Senate subcommittee about his two sons' lungs filling with fluids as they slowly drowned in their own bodies, his voice never wavered.
“We happen to practice what you call faith healing,” Sevy told committee members. “As far as adherence to any law, who do you better obey, God or man?”
Sevy has become the public face of the Followers of Christ, in part because of his relationship to Idaho state Sen. Patti Anne Lodge, who represents Sevy's district. Sevy's band served as the musical entertainment for one of Lodge's fundraisers last year, and she has emerged as one of the strongest voices opposing changes to the faith-healing law. She is not a member of the church.

(Otto Kitsinger / Associated Press)
“These are good people,” Lodge said. “They have a right to live as the law allows them without interference, that is what our Constitution [grants] them.”
On March 30, 2011, Sevy's 14-year-old son Rockwell was reported dead after having been ill for “about two weeks,” according to DeGeus-Morris' report. He had been running a fever and experiencing difficulty breathing, the report said, and died in his mother's lap. Three years earlier, in 2008, DeGeus-Morris had issued the death certificate for Rockwell's older brother, Gabriel Joe, 17. The cause of death was pneumonia.
In both cases, she confirmed the deaths, noted a lack of outward signs of trauma and left the bodies to the family.
In most death investigations in the U.S., the coroner is responsible for the body and the police are responsible for the scene. Donahue has been critical of the Canyon County coroner's office for failing to call in his department in these cases — a policy that he said could result in a dangerous assumption about the nature of the death while also potentially corrupting the scene.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Armenia prioritizes the development of multilayered trade and economic relations with Russia, president Serzh Sargsyan said in his address to the participants and guests of the Sixth Armenian-Russian Interregional Conference and second Eurasian Partnership Forum.
"The economies of our countries are closely interconnected. We are jointly implementing large-scale projects in trade-economic, scientific-technical, cultural-humanitarian and other areas of bilateral cooperation," Sargsyan said.
"Integration processes are undoubtedly contributing to the development of interregional cooperation. First of all, I mean the Eurasian Economic Union, owing to which decentralized interaction has been upgraded to a new, higher level. The Eurasian Economic Union has multiplied the creative potential of our countries, eliminated many obstacles on the way to mutually beneficial economic cooperation."
"Integration has the primary task of implementing all our initiatives and upcoming programs to improve the population's quality of life and well-being in each region," he added.
A 33-year-old man who already has 46 charges against his name, now faces additional charges after London police say they discovered an explosive device inside his home.
On April 7, officers searched the home of the suspect named in two parking lot shootings earlier this year. They say members of their explosive disposal unit were called in to examine and remove an explosive device from the home, before destroying it.
Haris Masic now faces two additional charges; one of making or having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury, and another for making or having an explosive substance without lawful excuse.
READ MORE: Accused in Westmount-area shooting faces 26 additional charges
Masic was previously charged in relation to a shooting in the parking lot of Westmount Mall on Feb. 10 and a shooting in the parking lot of a public park near Viscount and Wonderland roads on March 29.
In the first incident, officers responded to the scene around 10:32 p.m. after a young couple reported being approached by a man who attempted to rob them of their vehicle. One of the victims told investigators they saw the muzzle flash of a weapon going off.
In the second incident, investigators say a young couple in a parked vehicle was approached by a man who allegedly attempted to steal their vehicle. During the incident, police said multiple shots were fired by the suspect, resulting in a man being shot twice. A woman was assaulted with a weapon.
London police first laid 20 charges against Masic, including aggravated assault, robbery/assault with intent to steal, and carrying a concealed weapon. He was arrested around 5 p.m. April 6 in the Frontenac Road area.
At the time, police also said they recovered a firearm and seized a vehicle for investigation.

A week later, police laid an additional 26 charges against Masic. The majority of the charges against him are weapons-related offences, including three counts point a firearm, discharge firearm with intent to wound or endanger life or prevent arrest, five counts of careless storage of a firearm, four counts possess firearm obtained by crime, and aggravated assault.
Police said they'd conducted a search of the accused's home and vehicle and seized three stolen firearms, an assortment of different calibre ammunition, several items of stolen jewelry, and “an assortment of other property including electronic devices.”
The accused remains in custody and is expected to appear in court Wednesday.
We've covered networking on our home planet. But what happens when we send signals where no man has gone before?
Space networking is two-way communication between base stations on Earth, and unmanned space probes, planetary rovers, orbital satellites or manned spacecraft. These radio signals bring back messages, images and scientific discoveries. Someday they'll be used to communicate between colonies on Earth and the moon or Mars.
Of course, we can't just “call” Mars. Networking in outer space is vastly different from what we experience on Earth.
Communications travel at the speed of light. This means that it can take 20 minutes or more for a radio signal to reach a Martian planetary rover. It's like going back to dial-up.
You've Got Mail.
Beyond egregiously slow communications, space networking faces reliability challenges. Scientists can't exactly order a space probe back to the lab if it malfunctions near Pluto. Or open the trunk of a Mars rover and pull out a spare if it freezes up on the Martian surface.
All the components in space communications systems must tolerate high radiation levels, wild temperature fluctuations and a long useable life. Space.com reported that “the radiation dose received by an astronaut on even the shortest Earth-Mars round trip would be about 66 rems. This amount is like receiving a whole-body CT scan every five or six days.”
Temperature also impacts reliability. Outside Earth's atmosphere, objects in sunlight can reach 248 degrees Fahrenheit, while shaded objects can hit minus 148 degrees Fahrenheit. On Mars, the temperature varies between negative 284 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit, according to NASA.
For systems like the Mars Rover, power efficiency is another challenge. What good is a rover that uses up its power supply before transmitting data or images back to Earth?
One small step for GaN (and GaAs)
The unforgiving realm of deep space is a perfect place for gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN). Both compound semiconductor technologies are necessary for the inherently challenging conditions of space exploration and, most importantly, communications back to Earth.
GaAs is a compound semiconductor that has been the de-facto standard in space applications for decades. GaAs amplifiers and switches are rugged and dependable, and have been aboard several space platforms, including communications and navigation satellites.
However, the new and emerging standard is GaN. GaN solutions operate reliably, at higher temperatures, for 100 times longer than legacy technologies. GaN also delivers higher output power and data throughput in a smaller package, reducing energy consumption by as much as 20 percent.
Hundreds of thousands of GaAs and GaN-based networking solutions have launched aboard space applications. These include orbital satellites, which support critical programs like Boeing's Spaceway for broadband data, telecommunications and GPS.
NASA too has always relied on networking technologies to transmit its discoveries.
NASA and networking
The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was launched toward Saturn in 1997 through a cooperative mission of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Cassini-Huygens probe included crucial equipment designed to communicate with the spacecraft throughout its mission to the surface of Saturn's moon, Titan. Qorvo's gallium arsenide (GaAs) technology was at the heart of the connection that sent the findings back to Earth.
A few years later, Mars was the destination of two NASA rovers, the Spirit and Opportunity, also equipped with GaAs amplifiers. The rovers arrived in 2004 and, through a combination of superior design and interplanetary ingenuity, Spirit continued to operate and communicate with Earth until 2010. Its sister probe, Opportunity, is still operational today, sending data to scientists across the globe.
Then came New Horizons – a NASA spacecraft launched in 2006 and destined for Pluto. Communications system components helped New Horizons endure a nine-year journey and transfer the first high-resolution images of Pluto back to Earth. New Horizons is the first spacecraft to visit the Kuiper Belt, a large zone at least a billion miles beyond Neptune, which contains small, icy orbiting objects.
Similar components were aboard the Sky Crane landing radar of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and its Curiosity rover in 2012. Networking was essential in navigating the now-famous “seven minutes of terror” to lower Curiosity safely to the Martian surface.
For the sci-fi fans out there, we're also monitoring radio waves in search of intelligent life. Turns out the best way to search for aliens is with RF!
Space takes extraterrestrial networking reliability and efficiency to a whole new, “otherworldly” level.

Dahlicious, maker of a line of organic lassis, or milk-based Indian-style smoothies, is gearing up for the launch of its first non-dairy product: an organic almond milk-based kefir.
The Leominster, Mass.-based brand unveiled the new line, which will be launching this June in 24 oz. plastic PET bottles and available in Mango, Vanilla and Strawberry varieties, in January at the 2017 Fancy Food Show in San Francisco.
In an interview with BevNET, Dahlicious co-founder Jaidesh “JD” Sethi explained that part of the decision to start producing plant-based non-dairy products came from his and co-founder Ajeet Khalsa's roots in India, where Sethi said most people are vegetarian but still incorporate dairy into their diets.
“There is an innovation piece to this that really excites us, but there's also a philosophical angle,” Sethi said, noting that many of the company's employees are vegetarian. “If you look at other almond milks, they are already high in sugar, very low in protein and good stuff. Our philosophy is we want an equitable exchange. We want our yogurts, our kefirs, our almond milks, to be similar in nutrition profile to dairy milks. That's what makes us different.”
Sethi said the forthcoming almond milk-based kefir has been in development for almost two years, during which the company experimented with several base ingredients, including avocado, flax, chia, coconut and cashew before settling on almonds because of their nutritional value. In order to retain the protein and fats that Sethi said are often filtered out when creating almond milk, the company designed new technology that can grind the nut to a microscopic level so that, when integrated with water, it will mimic the composition of dairy milk.
“Being in the dairy industry, we understand the composition of milk,” he said. “In the end, we get a product that uses the whole almond. You take almonds, add water, then in the end you get very high fat, high protein, high fiber almond milk.”
Yet Dahlicious will not be selling the almond milk itself; the company's focus will be on cultured products, such as the dairy-free kefir, which contains 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein, and also on yogurt.
“Our position with these products is: high protein, high fat, high fiber, low sugar and high probiotics,” he said. “Of course consumers are saying, ‘well, that's five different things.' To make the message simple, we are saying high protein, high fiber, low sugar.”
The launch of Dahlicious's dairy-free kefir line coincides with an evolution in the company's distribution strategy. Up until 2016, the brand focused on building in the natural channel, leading to distribution in most Whole Foods regions as well as in Sprouts. This year, Sethi said the company will start branching into conventional grocery outlets including Safeway, which recently began stocking Dahlicious products in one division. They are also building a presence in the mass retail channel, as evidenced by launching in a division of Costco earlier this year, with further expansion into the retailer's Southwest region set to follow in April.
While Sethi said that developing their own line of products is the priority, Dahlicious has also been working to expand its co-packing business. He said that private label production represents about 25 percent of the company's sales, and that they have been working with “a couple or large brands and other national retailers.” He also indicated that that could grow, as the brand's 25,000 sq. ft. production facility, capable of producing 100,000 lbs. of yogurt per day, was not operating at full capacity yet.
“We've been asked many times about why we are vertically integrated,” Sethi said. “The answer is simple: it gives us the opportunity to generate a cash flow by doing co-packing, which is an integral part of our business plan, which calls for a healthy blend [of both private label and our own brand].”
“Our hope is it's one start,” Roberts said. “But we are putting him on the disabled list to make sure we get this behind us, it's really important. Kenta doesn't want to miss any starts. He doesn't want to come out of a game. We've got to make sure that he understands this is for his best interest for the rest of the year going forward.”
How do you think Trump did this week? Let us know
President Trump 's fourth week in office got off to a rough start with the resignation of his national security advisor. Michael Flynn resigned late Monday in the wake of revelations about conversations he had with a Russian official during the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. Here's a look at what's happened so far:
Tuesday
Don't you love politics? Spicer says the White House has been investigating Flynn's conduct for more than two weeks and that he had been fired because of an "eroding level of trust."
Several hours after Spicer's briefing, Pence's spokesman, Marc Lotter, says that the vice president "became aware of incomplete information that he'd received on Feb. 9 — last Thursday night — based on media accounts. He did an inquiry based on those media accounts."
Kellyanne Conway is in hot water. The Office of Government Ethics recommends that the White House investigate and possibly discipline Trump's counselor for telling people last week to buy from Ivanka Trump's fashion line.
Are you ready to rumble? Linda McMahon is. The Senate confirmed the former wrestling entertainment executive to lead the Small Business Administration.

A rainfall warning remains in effect for parts of B.C.'s South Coast Wednesday morning.
The wet weather is due to a series of frontal systems hitting the region.
Up to 100 millimetres of rain is expected to fall in Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley by Thursday morning.
Squamish will also see about 100 millimetres of rain by tomorrow.
But areas of Vancouver Island could get more. West Vancouver Island could receive between 130 and 170 millimetres by Thursday morning, while inland areas could get up to 120 millimetres.
The rainfall warning is in effect for:
Metro Vancouver
Fraser Valley
Howe Sound
Inland Vancouver Island
West Vancouver Island
East Vancouver Island
The heavy rain will taper off on Thursday afternoon as the front finally moves eastward out of the area.
Drivers are warned that heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on the roads.
High streamflow advisory
The BC River Forecast Centre has issued high streamflow advisories for central Vancouver Island and the South Coast including:
Howe Sound, including the Stawamus River and surrounding creeks
North Shore, including the Seymour River, Coquitlam River and surrounding creeks
Fraser Valley, including the Chilliwack River and surrounding creeks
Sunshine Coast, including creeks in the Gibsons and Sechelt areas
The forecast centre says at this time it does not look like the rivers will reach flood stage but low-lying areas may experience some flooding. Melting snow could also create some flooding.
The public is asked to stay clear of rivers during this period.
HEAD COACH Garry Monk has urged his Leeds United players to prepare for the three biggest games of their lives after seeing his side drop out of the Championship play-off places for the first time since late November after a shock 1-0 home loss to Wolves.
United picked the worst possible time to produce one of their most disappointing performances of the season in front of a crowd of 32,351 at Elland Road, with Fulham's 3-1 home victory over Aston Villa seeing them leapfrog the Whites into the final play-off position.
It proved a mixed Bank Holiday Monday for Yorkshire's trio of Championship promotion chasers, with Huddersfield Town pegged back late on in a 1-1 draw at Derby County to drop back to fourth spot – victory would have moved them to within five points of second-placed Newcastle United with a game in hand after the stuttering Magpies lost 3-1 at Ipswich.
Huddersfield's draw confirmed promotion to the Premier League for Brighton.
Meanwhile, Sheffield Wednesday moved up to fifth place after securing their fourth successive victory with a 2-1 triumph at QPR.
On his side's fraught afternoon against Wolves, who triumphed thanks to a goal seven minutes before the break from striker Nouha Dicko, head coach Monk said: “We have had the mentality for so long where we have been in the play-offs quite comfortably and been in that protecting mode of trying to stay in there.
“Now, we do not have that luxury any more. Now, we have to go on the hunt and sometimes it is easier with less pressure on you when you are on the hunt.
“When you are in there, it's maybe a different pressure. We have got to take care of our own business, They are the three biggest games of our lives and we have to approach it in that way.”
It was a case of ‘if only' for Huddersfield, who were tantalisingly on the cusp of moving up to the 80-point mark to maintain their outside hopes of pipping Newcastle to automatic promotion, only for ex-Town midfielder Jacob Butterfield to earn the Rams' a point after scoring an 88th-minute equaliser.
Town, without a win in Derby in 22 matches since November 1957 – with that barren run incorporating 20 defeats – had taken the lead in the first 10 minutes, courtesy of a second goal in successive games from striker Collin Quaner.
Wagner, whose side suffered late anguish just three days on from beating Preston in the final moments, and who welcome Fulham on Saturday, said: “We have always said we are not able to influence what happens on the other pitches and everyone has seen again how difficult it is to win football matches in the Championship and to get over the line.
“We got a result which was not a perfect one, but a good one, and I think this gives us every confidence for the next game to get the points we need to occupy a play-off place.
“I was very pleased with the performance. The equaliser at the end did not give us the best feeling, but I think Derby, on the one side, deserved it.”
Owls' head coach Carlos Carvalhal saw his side prevail 2-1 at Loftus Road, through goals from Adam Reach and Daniel Pudil, and was full of praise for his side's character after the game.
Carvalhal, hoping that midfield pair Kieran Lee and Sam Hutchinson can add to his squad options by returning to fitness in the near future, commented: “Anything can happen and there are three games and we must be focused. The reality is that we are feeling that we are strong at this part of the season. Physically and tactically, the mentality of this team is very strong at this moment.
“We came here to win and did our job and our winning mentality were special and strong and it is why we achieved the three points.”

"My generation did what no generation in any culture at any time in history had ever done: We broke with the parenting traditions of our foremothers and forefathers. When the time came, we refused to take the well-worn parenting baton and carry it forward. ...
The new parenting experts implied, strongly, that good parenting was all about properly interpreting and responding to a child's feelings — the canard being that pre-1960s parents did not allow their children to freely express their feelings (true), thus causing them untold psychic damage (false). That understanding caused the more emotionally intuitive of the child-rearing pair to begin believing that she alone was capable of properly executing the new set of assignments and, therefore, broke the child-rearing unity of husband and wife. As a result, what was now 'mothering' became what raising a child had never before been except in unusual circumstances: stressful, anxiety- and guilt-ridden, frustrating, and exhausting. That is, hard."
As I went on to note, the fact that emotional outbreaks are viewed as a good thing is a fairly new phenomenon. For centuries, the opposite was true; giving into one's emotions was viewed as a sign of weakness, a lack of self-command.Our modern embrace of the emotional can found in many places. As family psychologist John Rosemond recently explained , it's also seen in how we raise our children:We see many articles today talking about how hard parenting is and how unmanageable children are and how much pressure is involved in making sure our offspring get the best of everything.And it's true. Parenting is hard and children are unmanageable. But have we made the task of raising children harder than it's supposed to be by fixating so much on their emotions and desires?As John Rosemond concludes, the best way "to raise emotional tyrants" is to "feed the beast." If we want to stop the chaos erupting in schools and in our nation's streets, do parents need to return to the time-honored methods of parenting, which did not cater to the emotional whims of child?
"I don't know if there are words that can really explain what Philadelphia would be like if the Eagles win the Super Bowl," former Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski said. "It will be the biggest parade ever. I run into people all the time and it's like, 'I don't want to die before the Eagles win a Super Bowl. It's the one thing I have to have in my life.' There's incredible passion for the team."
The Chargers boast the third-best defense against the pass in the NFL, according to ESPN's NFL Matchup, as they've allowed opposing quarterbacks to post an average quarterback rating of just 76.1 (a perfect rating is 158.3).
Only the Jaguars (66.4) and Ravens (72.8) have held opposing quarterbacks to worse ratings through Week 14, and it's interesting to note that Jacksonville's defense was built by Chargers defensive coordinator Gus Bradley.
Bradley focuses on allowing his unit to play fast by running a more simple scheme than most defensive coordinators do in the NFL, and his unit has responded in at all three levels.
L.A. has long since appeared to be one of most complete rosters in football, but fans and analysts are just now beginning to see the light with the team on a four-game winning streak and after they thumped the Redskins 30-13 at the StubHub Center.
In Week 13's contest, Los Angeles held Washington's quarterback Kirk Cousins to 151 yards on 15-of-27 passing with one touchdown against one interception for a quarterback rating of just 68.6.
Moreover, the Chargers allowed Washington to amass just 201 total yards Sunday, which was the team's best defensive performance since Oct. 5, 2014, when they held the New York Jets to a paltry total of 151 yards.
KARACHI, Oct 6 (APP): An investigation has been authored by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against some of the officials of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for alleged misuse of authority in terms of amalgamation of KASB Bank into BankIslami.
The SBP Act 1956 mandates SBP to regulate the credit system of the country and empowers it through the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 for this purpose, a central bank statement said here on Friday.
It said that using its authority and powers, SBP decided to
amalgamate KASB Bank into BankIslami in 2015 after a moratorium
was imposed by the Federal Government on its request to safeguard
the interests of depositors and to ensure safety and soundness of
the banking system of the country.
This step was taken due to poor financial condition of
defunct KASB bank and its inability to meet regulatory
requirements despite opportunities being provided for an extended
period of time.
Since then a smear campaign was run in some quarters of
media to dub this action by SBP against the law and malign its
staff for misuse of authority, the SBP statement alleged.
Taking notice of these reports, the National Accountability
Bureau (NAB) initiated an inquiry into the matter and recently it
has been learnt from its press release that an investigation has
been authorized against some of the officials of SBP for alleged
misuse of authority in terms of amalgamation of KASB Bank into
BankIslami, the statement of the central bank said.
All stakeholders of the defunct KASB Bank were well aware of
the poor financial and operating conditions of defunct bank,
which was facing severe capital shortfall since 2009.
As of September 30, 2014 Capital (free of losses) of the
defunct KASB Bank was only Rs 0.958 billion against requirement
of Rs 10 billion. Moreover, its Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was
negative 4.63% against the required 10%.
It was the only bank which had a negative CAR.
Even the external auditors of the defunct KASB Bank in bank's
audited account as of December 31,2013 also expressed concern
over capital position of the bank.
State Bank of Pakistan gave ample time and opportunities to
the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank to inject further capital
into the bank so as to make it capital compliant and viable bank.
The sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank could not fulfill
their commitments for capital injection despite SBP's consistent
persuasion and instructions, nor could arrange merger of the bank
with any other bank.
Besides capital shortfall, the bank and its
sponsors were found engaged in fraudulent practices and siphoning
off more than Rs 3 billion from the bank, for which separate
complaints have been lodged with NAB, the SBP statement said.
Further, the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank introduced
M/s. Cybernaut Investment Group of China, as a potential
investor. Following the procedure, SBP required documentation to
establish their credentials and proof of availability of funds
worth US$100 million. Neither was provided. This left SBP with no
other option but to accept the offer of sole remaining interested
party, i.e. BankIslami.
No person can be handed over a bank without checking
credentials to ensure no risk for the depositors and other
stakeholders.
When any bank is amalgamated through regulatory action,
typically there is withdrawal of deposits and to avoid any bank
run liquidity is provided by central banks. For the same reasons,
to enable BankIslami to cope with post merger withdrawal of funds
by the depositors of the defunct KASB Bank from BankIslami, State
Bank provided a short term loan of Rs 15 Billion for 180 days as
a liquidity support under the legal provisions of Section 17 of
SBP Act 1956.
This amount stands fully repaid. Additionally a
long-term loan of Rs 5 Billion was also provided to BankIslami
for a period of 10 years. This loan is fully secured by sukuks of
equivalent amount. There are precedents in the past, where, State
Bank extended interest free financial assistance to the acquiring
banks resolved under Section 47 of BCO 1962.
It may be pointed out that the said money did not go to the
pockets of BankIslami or any of their shareholders but was
utilized to pay to the depositors of defunct KASB Bank.
SBP reaffirm that all of its actions in the resolution and
amalgamation of defunct KASB Bank were in accordance with the law
and aimed at to safeguard the interests of depositors and to
ensure safety and soundness of the banking system of the country.
None of the SBP officials misused authority nor were
involved in any kind of corrupt practices. All the actions taken
were permissible under the law and were duly approved by the
Ministry of Finance and SBP's Board of Directors, the SBP
statement concluded.

Julian Smith MP welcomes this week's announcement that the Tour de Yorkshire will be returning to the Ripon area as part of its 2018 route.
Next year, a number of villages around Ripon will feature in stage four of the race which this year has been extended to four days. This stage of the route will go through the villages of Burnsall, Kilnsey, Kettlewell, Masham and Pateley Bridge.
The area has hosted a number of successful cycling events in the past few years and Julian was pleased to support the Tour de Yorkshire when the route came through the area in 2016. He was also heavily involved in promoting the Yorkshire leg of the Tour de France in 2014.
Julian Smith MP said: This is fantastic news for our area. The race brings tourists and visitors to the Yorkshire Dales and promises to promote our wonderful part of the country. I am really pleased that the race will once again pass through the Ripon area and our communities will be able to work together to get involved.
A relatively simple process, but one that ended up involving its fair share of drama.
Sunderland spent yesterday continuing to discuss a potential compensation deal for Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes and his assistant, Tony Docherty.
All had seemed to be progressing well, if a touch slowly, before Aberdeen's new major shareholder addressed the press.
Fresh from selling his software company for close to £600milion last year, lifelong Dons fan Dave Cormack confirmed his major investment and a place on the board only on Tuesday.
A day later, his task was to respond to the fierce speculation over the Pittodrie manager's future, and his response was surprisingly bullish and defiant given how Aberdeen had closed ranks in the previous weeks.
“Derek is 100% focused on the team for next year. He's on vacation just now, but he's not really getting one because he's working with the team on player recruitment,” he said.
“Derek is under contract at Aberdeen for two years. He and his family are happy here, no team has been given permission to talk to Derek.
“To talk to him, there are certain conditions that have to be met, financially or otherwise. Two, Derek needs to want to talk to them, but that's the order.
“We don't need their money at all. We had a board meeting yesterday and the money is there [for the future].”
Cormack did, however, concede that he was in the dark as to whether 45-year-old McInnes wanted the Sunderland job, and that he would not tie any employee down when they wanted to be somewhere else.
“I don't know, I joined the board yesterday and I will leave the chairman to deal with that,” he said.
“His team have done an incredible job over the last four years and he is a very astute individual.
“Keep Sunderland and Derek aside for one minute – I know, through bitter experience, that trying to keep any employee with my companies, forcing somebody to stay doesn't work for anyone.
“What I would say is we would move heaven and earth to keep Derek here, but it's not just down to money. He's a very astute individual.
“I've had the opportunity to chat with him a couple of weeks ago, and he takes a holistic approach to a football club – he doesn't just think of the football operation and event the sports science, he thinks of the marketing, the communication with supporters, the off-field stuff, and that's a rarity.
“We would do our utmost – if there was permission given to any team, and he wanted to consider it – to pull out all the stops to keep him.”
They may well yet do their best.
Sunderland will still have to convince McInnes that it is the right decision for his career to leave a stable, well funded, competitive club and come to a side where uncertainty reigns.
He has failed once south of the border, at Bristol City, and knows he cannot afford to do so again.
Common sense suggests, however, that yesterday's developments mean the Black Cats are confident that the former West Brom midfielder's mind is privately made up, that the size and potential of Sunderland is worth taking a gamble on.
He will know how well he will be received should he build a competitive, hard-working side at the Stadium of Light.
The day ended with Aberdeen fans, whose hopes had been raised ever so slightly in the morning, in despair.
Sunderland fans, at long last, were able to look forward with a cautious optimism.
There are surely no more surprises to come in this protracted search.
On Friday, an army of firefighters in Ventura County hoped it was finally beginning to turn the tide on the Thomas fire.
After burning hundreds of homes, the fire was slowing as Santa Ana winds calmed down.
But over the weekend, the fire reemerged with a vengeance, pushing into Santa Barbara County and destroying more homes.
Here's a look at the fire that has refused to die.
Map of Thomas Fire Los Angeles Times
It was wind, but also a landscape filled with fuel
So how did the Thomas fire become such a monster? Heavy winds are one factor. But another is the thick brush that has not burned in a century, providing fuel.
“The fuels in there are thick and they're dead, so they're very receptive to fire,” said Steve Swindle, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department.
The fuel can spread the fire even when winds die down.
“Since it's so dry out there, it doesn't take much in the way of winds to create those critical fire weather conditions,” said Robbie Munroe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “We'll see wind gusts in that ... area between 20 and 35 mph, maybe a few mountain sites might see up to about 40, but that's the most we're expecting right now.”
When the fire shifted toward the coast Sunday morning, Monroe said winds were not necessarily the driver.
“Wind was probably not the biggest factor last night to this morning — it's probably more the complex terrain, very dry and possibly widespread fuels for the fire and the fact that it's a pretty large and ongoing fire,” he said. “The light offshore winds are certainly a factor, but not as important as they've been, say, earlier in the week when we saw much stronger winds over the fire.”
The last time some of the slopes and canyons burned in the mountains east of Santa Barbara was in the 1970s, when four firefighters operating bulldozers died in a rollover accident.
In such difficult terrain, officials with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said on Monday that they have essentially no way to get boots and hoses on the ground to attack the western front of the Thomas fire directly.
Instead, fire crews caravanned out of the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Monday and headed to the residential streets in the south-facing foothills of Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County. That's where they set up defensive positions and waited just in case the fire moved downhill.
"The terrain ... makes it super difficult for us to position with normal tactics," said Kalin Ramirez, a fire information officer.
During a news conference at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Saturday, Gov. Jerry Brown said climate change may exacerbate the weather conditions that caused the wildfires to explode. He expressed sympathy for residents who had lost their homes and animals, saying the fires were horrific and a “terrible tragedy for so many people.”
“This could be something that happens every year or every few years,” he said. “We're about to have a firefighting Christmas.”

Among California's 5 worst modern fires
In the last week, the fire has moved in various directions, west into Ventura, then north into Ojai, then west again toward the coast of southern Santa Barbara County.
“This is a complex fire,” Rich Macklin, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, said over the weekend. “There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of men and women with packs on their backs, squirting the hills, putting the wet stuff on the red stuff.”
On Sunday morning, as the blaze spread westward into the mountains, it grew to at least 230,000 acres, putting it in the top five of California's largest modern fires and creating new challenges for the exhausted crews in their sixth full day of battling it.
With the northern and eastern fronts of the fire moving mainly into uninhabited areas of Los Padres National Forest, fire officials concentrated Sunday on protecting the beach communities of Carpinteria and Montecito, the wealthy enclave to its west.
Throughout the day, the fire moved down the mountains north of Carpinteria into foothills several miles from its downtown. The flames chewed rapidly through hillsides thick with vegetation.
So where does the fire stand now in history?
The Cedar fire burned 273,246 acres in San Diego County in 2003. More than 2,800 structures were destroyed and 15 people died. The Rush fire, caused by lightning, burned 271,911 acres in California and another 43,666 acres in Nevada in 2012. The Rim fire in Tuolumne County in 2013 burned 257,314 acres and consumed 112 structures. The Zaca fire in Santa Barbara County in 2007 charred 240,207 acres and destroyed one structure. The Thomas fire surpassed the Matilija fire — which scorched 220,000 acres in Ventura County in 1932 — as the fifth largest wildfire.
While other large fires raged in California prior to 1932, those records are less reliable, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The list also does not take into account this year's wine country firestorm, the most destructive in history, because it was several different fires. Together, that complex of fires destroyed more than 10,000 structures and killed more than 40 people in October.
Trail of destruction
The Thomas fire has destroyed 524 structures and damaged 135 in the city of Ventura. In the unincorporated areas of Ventura County, 266 structures have been destroyed, while 56 were damaged. The fire consumed six structures on Sunday in Carpinteria, authorities said.
Wind speeds are expected to be on the lower end of what's been seen over the last week, forecasters say.
Over Sunday night and into Monday morning, there were wind gusts of around 20 mph across the lower mountains and foothills in the region of southeastern Santa Barbara County into southwestern Ventura County.
Officials said it could take weeks or months to finally contain the fire.
– Your Weekly Fantasy Hockey Breakdown
Each Monday, we'll take a look at the past week in fantasy hockey. Specifically, we'll dive into which players are heating up, which players are cooling down, players to target on the waiver wire, and an update on fantasy-relevant injuries. From week to week, a lot can change in a player's fantasy outlook due to line combinations, injuries, or just a simple tweak in their game and we will have you covered.
Trending Up
James Neal – VGK (LW/RW)
After going five straight games without a point, James Neal appears to be back to the form he's maintained for the majority of the season.
In his last three games, he's recorded four points (two goals, two assists), including 17 shots on goal. The veteran will continue to be a key feature in the Vegas Golden Knights offense, playing on the top line and top power-play unit. With 23 points in 29 games this season, you can continue to feel comfortable starting him in all formats.
Keith Yandle – FLA (D)
Other than a recent six-game span where he only recorded two points, it's been an overall solid season for Keith Yandle, especially the last week. In his last three games, Yandle's tallied an impressive six assists, three of which came with the man-advantage. He continues to quarterback the Florida Panthers top power-play unit, as well as playing big-time overall minutes. He's now up to 19 points in 29 games this season and is proving to be one of the better fantasy options from the blue line.
Corey Perry – ANA (RW)
With the absence of Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler, Corey Perry has been relied upon to produce more offensively, and, although he has struggled at times, he's had no problem finding the scoresheet of late. After a six-game span where he recorded just one assist, Perry's exploded, tallying five points (two goals, three assists) in his last four games. With the return of both Getzlaf and Kesler drawing nearer, Perry's fantasy outlook will continue to see an upward trend, making him much more reliable.
Trending Down
Cam Atkinson – CBJ (RW)
What's wrong with Cam Atkinson? It's a question all his fantasy owners are asking after the breakout campaign he put together last season.
After recording 62 points last season, Atkinson currently sits at just nine points through 25 games, which includes going pointless in his last six games and being designated a healthy scratch on Saturday. Perhaps being a healthy scratch will ignite a fire in him and he'll return to last season's form. But until that happens, his fantasy owners will no doubt remain frustrated.
Mikko Koivu – MIN (C)
After getting off to a nice start for the Minnesota Wild, Mikko Koivu's production has disappeared over the last couple weeks. He's now gone seven straight games without registering a single point, after tallying 15 points in his first 21 games. Given that he remains on both the top line and top power-play unit, there's no doubt the points will follow, especially with the Wild's potent man advantage. Koivu could go off at any point, so benching him would be a mistake. Just temper your expectations for now.
Mike Green – DET (D)
The start to the 2017-18 season was actually exceptional for Mike Green. He was one of the leaders in fantasy scoring for defenseman. But how quickly things can change. In his first 19 games of the season, Green recorded an impressive 18 points but has notched just one point in his last 10 games. His recent move down to the second power-play unit from the first unit may have a slight effect on his production, but certainly not this extravagant. He remains on the top pairing and continues to see heavy minutes, so he's likely to get back on track. But unfortunately, for his owners, it's hard to know when.
Waiver Wire Targets
Gabriel Landeskog – COL (LW – 49% owned)
Apparently, Gabriel Landeskog's two points in his first two games back from suspension weren't enough to gain the attention of owners, as he's still available in over half of fantasy leagues. That needs to change.
He's now up to 19 points (10 goals, nine assists) in 24 games this year, and likely won't be slowing down. He's playing big-time minutes, both five-on-five and on the power play, and also plays alongside Nathan MacKinnon, who's having a career year. Landeskog needs to be owned.
Adam Henrique – ANA (C – 49% owned)
After being listed here last week, Adam Henrique's ownership has risen 12 percent, but he's still available in more than half of all leagues. Since being traded to the Anaheim Ducks, he's been on absolute fire, tallying six points in his first five games. The question remains whether his production will increase or decrease with the return of Getzlaf and Kesler, due to ice-time and power play usage, but he's no doubt worth an add-in most formats to see what happens when they return from injury.
Alex DeBrincat – CHI (RW/LW – 46% owned)
Somehow, Alex DeBrincat's ownership has only risen five percent from last week. The outstanding rookie currently sits at 21 points through 30 games this season and continues to see big-time minutes, both even-strength and on the power play. DeBrincat's proven he can produce at the NHL-level, and as long as he continues to see heavy minutes, he definitely needs to be owned in more leagues. If he's available in your league, don't make the mistake of passing on him.
Tyler Johnson – TBL (C – 46% owned)
Being moved to the first line with Steven Stamkos should be enough convincing to add Tyler Johnson. But in case it's not enough, he's got the points to back it up too. Through 29 games this season, Johnson's up to 18 points (six goals, 12 assists), including seven points in his last four games. The Tampa Bay Lightning have one of the most potent offenses in the NHL, so if you have the chance to add a piece of it, do so now.
Reilly Smith – VGK (RW/LW – 43% owned)
Although he continues to assault the scoresheets, Reilly Smith is still owned in just 43 percent of leagues. That's way too low. He currently sits at 22 points (eight goals, 14 assists) in 29 games this season, and shows no signs of slowing down. He remains a key cog in the Vegas Golden Knights offense, an offense that's had no trouble scoring goals. If he's available in your league, why wouldn't you add him?

India whitewashed Sri Lanka 3-0 More
India registered their 5th series whitewash in Test cricket (3 Tests or more), defeating Sri Lanka by an innings and 171 runs in the third Test at Pallekele a thus recording their second successive innings victory. It was also India's first series whitewash abroad (3 Tests or more) and only the second time that India won three Tests in a Test series overseas, the previous such instance coming nearly half a century back in 1968 when India defeated New Zealand 3-1.
A brilliant opening stand from Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul followed by Hardik Pandya's blistering 108 helped India to 487. In reply, Sri Lanka could only score 135 thanks to Kuldeep Yadav's spell of 4/40. In the second innings, brilliant bowling by Ravichandran Ashwin and Mohammed Shami helped India dismiss the hosts for only 181, thus winning the match and clean-sweeping the series.
With India ending the Test series in remarkable style, let's take a look at five things that India did right in the final Test.
#5 Mohammed Shami's bowling
Shami bowled pretty well throughout the match More
The Indian bowlers did a terrific job throughout the match. Amongst the pacers, one person who really stood out was Mohammed Shami. With the ball, Shami took two wickets in the first innings, that of Dimuth Karunaratne and Upul Tharanga. The pacer's performance in the second innings was more commendable as he picked up three wickets for 32 runs.
His first scalp was night-watchman Malinda Pushpakumara following which he dismissed Kusal Mendis with a full delivery towards the leg stump which hit Mendis on the pads. Shami's third scalp was Lakshan Sandakan who nicked a length delivery straight to Wriddhiman Saha.
​
#4 Ravichandran Ashwin's second innings spell
Ashwin finished the series as the highest wicket-taker More

John Herbert's play Fortune and Men's Eyes was groundbreaking in its portrayal of homosexuality through the stories of four male prison inmates when it premiered in 1967, after Herbert himself was jailed for “gross indecency” for wearing drag. Since turning into a film in 1971 and becoming the most published script in Canada, a dramatic reading of the script with Dora Award-winning actors like Paolo Santalucia and Bruce Dow, followed by a panel discussion with playwrights Brad Fraser and Sky Gilbert and more, will celebrate the play's 50th anniversary, just after the Prime Minister tearfully apologized for Canada's homophobic history.

Celebrity Shorts at Short Cuts
Watch this if: You want to see some familiar stars do unexpected things.
Cate Blanchett, Salma Hayek, Jane Lynch and Olivia Wilde are just a few of the stars that add some wattage to TIFF Bell Lightbox's monthly showcase of new short cinema. Though Hollywood features may offer bigger paycheques, shorts most definitely give A-listers the opportunity to experiment, something Blanchett clearly relishes in “Red,” a visually stunning experimental performance piece that casts the Aussie as a spidery femme fatale. Wilde's just as adventurous as the kombucha-obsessed sister in the hilarious family comedy “Daytime Noon.” (Dec. 12, TIFF Bell Lightbox, 350 King St. W., www.tiff.net)

See this if: You think landscape painting has life in it yet.
Steve Driscoll is a painter of giant scenes of impossible, hyper-electric coloured gloss. So it may surprise some that his subject matter is the great outdoors — rocks and trees and lakes favoured, traditionally, by those with a more restrained palette. Like his key influence Peter Doig, Driscoll, has made a mission of injecting energy to that tired realm. And while it might not be everyone's ideal notion of an unspoiled nature — a recent show at the McMichael had its ups and downs — it's a fresh take on an old favourite.

Tale of a Town — Canada
Watch this if: You want an epic road trip family story.
What began as a one-off performance about Parkdale in 2008, the neighbourhood that co-creator Lisa Marie DiLiberto (alongside Charles Ketchabaw) lived in at the time, has since blossomed into a years-spanning project called Tale of a Town that has visited every province in Territory in Canada, taking the real stories of residents and turning them into performance snapshots on each town. Tale of a Town — Canada is the pinnacle of the project, created by the now-married DiLiberto and Ketchabaw, who travelled the country with two kids recording interviews and getting glimpses into city life around the country.

Though it's already garnering acclaim in the U.S., Phantom Thread won't be out in Toronto until January, which makes for a long wait for the many devotees of director Paul Thomas Anderson. The Royal relieves some of that anguish with a rare 35mm screening of Anderson's first feature Hard Eight. A terse neo-noir given a skimpy release in 1996, the movie was an early triumph not only for the filmmaker but for many of the actors who became his regular collaborators, like John C. Reilly and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. (Royal Cinema, 608 College St., 8 p.m.)

Emergency services and councillors have joined forces to tackle the growing problem of arson attacks.
The ‘Enough Is Enough' campaign, aimed at tackling deliberate fires on the coast has been launched by County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service (CDDFRS), Durham Constabulary and Durham County Council, as part of National Arson Awareness Week.
Durham's east coast area has seen a sharp increase of incidents of arson over the past four years, with deliberate fires that damage people's property rising by 127% and grass and rubbish fires increasing by 63%.
The areas seeing the biggest rise are Horden, Shotton Colliery and the Easington areas.
Chiefs say this has resulted in extensive damage not only to residents' cars and homes, but also to the local area.
The campaign will see firefighters, police and council staff out in the areas affected talking to residents in a bid to reduce the number of incidents.
Assistant chief fire officer at the fire service, Dominic Brown, said: “We've deliberately launched the campaign to coincide with National Arson Awareness Week and the lead up to the Easter holidays, when traditionally we see a spike in deliberate fires.
“If our firefighters continue to deal with this volume of deliberate fires, it may delay their response to genuine emergencies.
“This campaign is about harnessing the strong community spirit in these areas and letting residents know we are here to work with them to tackle these issues.
“Our message, is clear, the community and the authorities have had enough, and this has to stop.”
Jo Farrell, deputy chief constable of Durham Constabulary, said: “Arson damages communities, it damages property but, above all, it puts people's lives at risk.
“Our communities shouldn't have to put up with that, which is why we are doing everything we can to deal with the problem and keep people safe.”
Coun Lucy Hovvels MBE, who is Durham County Council's Cabinet member for community safety, said: “Deliberately setting things on fire can put people in real danger while there is the potential for pollution.
“Burnt out cars and other items also spoil the appearance of our beautiful county.
“We would appeal to residents and businesses to play their part in preventing arson by ensuring waste is disposed of correctly and that wheelie bins are not left in public places longer than is necessary.”
Anyone with information about deliberate fires being started should call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

UNITED NATIONS, Feb 15 (APP): Methamphetamine is increasingly being seized by law enforcement in Afghanistan, and there is also evidence that it is being produced in the country, according to the first of its kind assessment on synthetic drugs released Tuesday by the United Nations drug and crime agency.
After spending eight-months gathering information on drugs known locally as “glass,” “tears of love or “sheesha,” the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) concluded that “there are strong indications that methamphetamine use is establishing itself among opiate users, which are already one of the most vulnerable parts of Afghan society.”
“The report comes in a timely fashion, adding another layer of understanding to the very complex Afghan drugs situation,” UNODC's Director of Public Affairs, Jean-Luc Lemahieu, said.
The Afghanistan Synthetic Drugs Assessment includes missions to five provinces in Afghanistan, where interviews were conducted with over 100 key sources, drug users and law enforcement officials at government offices, health service centres and drug treatment providers.
“Increases in the number of methamphetamine seizures, together with reports of methamphetamine manufacture and increases in treatment registrations in certain parts of the country, suggest that synthetic drugs are of growing concern in Afghanistan,” says the report.
Among its findings, the report noted that the largest number of methamphetamine treatment registrations have been reported by treatment centres in Kunduz province, in the north-east of Afghanistan, and Nimroz province, to the south-west of Afghanistan.
It also found that the current national drug control law seems to provide a much lower penalty framework for methamphetamine compared to other drugs such as heroin or cocaine.
Investigators conclude that the issue must be studied more thoroughly by national and international partners.
In a first for in-car convenience features, Jaguar is teaming up with Shell to launch a new payment feature that lets you use Apple Pay or PayPal (with Android Pay coming later on) to easily pay for gas right within their vehicles at the pumps. The feature is coming to the UK first, but will roll out around the world after that.
The feature requires installation of the Shell app to make the payments possible, but it'll show up on your Jaguar's in-car infotainment touchscreen display once installed, You can then pay using either your PayPal or Apple Pay credentials as mentioned, and all of this is available as of Wednesday in the UK – provided you've got a new model Jaguar XE, XF and F-PACE car.
The app lets the driver select how much gas they want, then pre-pay for their fuel. It also shows a receipt of the payment on the display itself, and forwards along a copy to your email address.
It's true that a lot of pumps support payment at the pump via credit or debit card, but this is an even more convenient system since you never even have to take out your wallet. It's also a sign of things to come – in-car payment methods that use retailer and service provider apps, combined with stored digital payment methods like Apple and Android Pay, as well as instant receipts and transaction records seem like a huge opportunity, now that vehicles are increasingly networked and equipped with geolocation services.
Here's hoping Jaguar owners aren't the only ones who get to enjoy this luxury for long.
Justin Turner goes yard twice, his 16th and 17th homers of the season, in Dodgers' win over Padres. (0:43)
For most teams, a 4-2 week is a successful week. For the Los Angeles Dodgers, a 4-2 week actually lowered their season winning percentage.
As the Dodgers pursue the single-season record of 116 wins, let's review their week:
Last week's record: 2-1 at Arizona Diamondbacks; 2-1 vs. San Diego Padres
Record since June 7: 48-9 Season: 83-34 (.709 winning percentage)
Pace: 115-47
Record needed to get to 117 wins: 34-11 (.756 winning percentage)
This week: vs. Chicago White Sox (Tuesday and Wednesday); at Detroit Tigers (Friday-Sunday)
A short week with two off days against two bad clubs? This is the kind of week the Dodgers need to take advantage of if they want to make a serious run at the wins record. Alex Wood and Yu Darvish will start the two games against the White Sox, both on five days' rest, so they should be primed for strong outings against a young Chicago lineup.
I've been watching a lot of the Dodgers lately, and no inning summed up why this team has been so good this season better than the sixth on Saturday night against the San Diego Padres. San Diego was up 3-1 when Craig Stammen entered in relief with runners on second and third with no outs. He just wanted to limit the damage. Yasiel Puig had a terrific at-bat, fighting off a couple of tough, two-strike pitches to remain alive in the count before finally taking a 3-2 fastball just off the plate for ball four. Stammen then got Austin Barnes to fly out to shallow right field and struck out Chris Taylor and had a chance to escape with no damage.
All he had to do was get through Corey Seager, who lined a base hit to right on a 3-2 fastball:
Bases loaded. Two outs. Down by two.
Here comes the Stud. 👌 #Clutch pic.twitter.com/uENUCAVXtg — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) August 13, 2017
I love that Puig had the patience and willingness to work a walk. I love that Seager didn't swing from his heels and strike out, showing why he's hitting .360 with runners in scoring position. And I love that they got a little lucky there, with Seager getting caught in the rundown, then Puig breaking for home and beating a bad throw. Smart, good and lucky. That's how you play .700 ball.
Darvish goes 2-0 with the Dodgers, but about that bullpen Darvish's second start with the Dodgers came against the Arizona Diamondbacks, and while he wasn't as efficient as in his debut against the New York Mets, he still finished with 10 strikeouts in five innings. He fanned Paul Goldschmidt all three times he faced him and pumped his fist after getting Goldschmidt looking to end the fifth. That was a great inning, as Darvish fanned A.J. Pollock and Jake Lamb on curveballs, then froze Goldschmidt with a slider.
This is apparently Yu Darvish when he's not sharp pic.twitter.com/addeD9WYnM — Daniel Brim (@DanielBrim) August 11, 2017
Darvish allowed two runs in what would end up an 8-6 victory for the Dodgers -- and that points to the bullpen, the one problem area in the week. Not Kenley Jansen; he pitched four scoreless innings in recording four saves. But the pen gave up four runs in that game and was charged with the two losses in blowing games the Dodgers led. Manager Dave Roberts is still trying to figure out the roles for everyone ahead of Jansen and whether he can trust Tony Watson and Tony Cingrani, the two lefties acquired at the trade deadline.
Watson picked up the loss on Tuesday when he allowed three runs and gave up a home run and two walks in two-thirds of an inning. Watson did pitch a 1-2-3 inning on Saturday, but given his struggles with the Pittsburgh Pirates before coming over to the Dodgers, he has a way to go before earning key outs once the Dodgers get to the postseason.
The guy who has forced himself into a key role is veteran Brandon Morrow, who has now appeared in 27 games and pitched 26⅔ innings with 33 strikeouts, six walks, no home runs and a .173 average against. He hit 99 mph on Saturday. The sample size is obviously small, but lefties are hitting just .079 against him. Goes to show you never know where relievers will pop up from. The oft-injured Morrow was 0-5 with a 7.20 ERA for Triple-A Oklahoma City before getting called up.
Right now, Roberts' best setup options are still going to be Pedro Baez and Morrow against both sides, Josh Fields against righties and Luis Avilan against lefties. Roberts seems to get this, as Baez has entered in different innings, based on the matchups and lineup order (Roberts likes to use him against the other team's best hitters). Sure, another lefty down there would be nice, but right now, Watson and Cingrani would remain low on the pecking order.
Clayton Kershawupdate: Kershaw threw bullpen sessions on Friday and Sunday and is expected to throw a two-inning simulation game on Tuesday. It all points to the Dodgers' hoping to get Kershaw back in the rotation for September, similar to last year when he returned on Sept. 9 and made five starts before the postseason.
Seager for MVP? With Bryce Harper going down for an extended period -- he was probably the MVP favorite -- Seager's chances would seem to improve. Below are WAR leaders for National League position players entering Sunday.

Elite Farm Services workers seen throwing chickens at a Chilliwack farm in undercover video filmed by Mercy for Animals. (Submitted)
The Vancouver Humane Society (VHS) is not happy it's been nearly a year since the release of video showing violent abuse of chickens on a Chilliwack farm and yet no one has been charged.
“There would no doubt be considerable public outrage if the alleged perpetrators of these extreme acts of cruelty were not brought to justice,” VHS executive director Debra Probert said in a May 28 letter to B.C. Attorney General David Eby.
The video in question shot at an Elite Farm Services operation in Chilliwack and showed chickens being kicked, stomped on, sexually abused and having their limbs torn off.
In the wake of the undercover footage filmed by an employee working for Mercy for Animals, five employees and one supervisor of the local farm labour company involved were fired, according to the company's president.
“We are sickened with the footage and want to ensure all our suppliers and producers that this is not reflective of who we are, our fundamental beliefs or behaviour we accept from our employees,” said Dwayne Dueck of Elite Farm Services in a statement issued in June 2017.
The BC Chicken Marketing Board, too, expressed disgust at the practices seen in the video.
“This is beyond anything that any normal person would conceive of to be normal behaviour,” executive director Bill Vanderspek told Black Press in an interview nearly a year ago. “I was just disgusted.”

Given the long delay, the VHS is calling on Eby to ensure those responsible for the animal cruelty are brought to justice.
The B.C. SPCA has produced a report for Crown Counsel recommending animal cruelty charges, but no charges have been laid, according to the VHS.
“We are concerned at this undue delay and any potential impact it might have on a successful prosecution proceeding,” Probert said in her letter to Eby. “
The letter calls on the Attorney General to “take whatever action is necessary to expedite Crown Counsel's work on this case.”

Buehler, 23, is considered the best prospect in the Dodgers system. He struggled with his command at times Monday against the Marlins, but recorded five strikeouts and generated plenty of ground balls. The organization hopes he can crack the rotation later in the summer, with team officials keeping a close eye on his usage. Buehler is not expected to exceed more than 150 innings this season, after undergoing elbow ligament reconstruction in 2015.
Even though he's turning 55 next month, Tom Cruise seems ageless — and that's partially by design. In the new film The Mummy, he stars as a man who may wind up (kind of) immortal; other recent films of his, like Edge of Tomorrow, play directly with the idea of death and life being intertwined. And only a few weeks ago, Cruise confirmed the long-gestating Top Gun sequel is speeding toward a production date; it's not a sci-fi story, but the notion that Maverick will fly again, after over 30 years, reinforces that Cruise's recent career choices are attempts to stay young.
Cruise has been marked by a boyish youthfulness in many of his roles in the last three-plus decades. Add to that the fact that his last few films include a number of examples of self-performed stunts, as if he's trying to say he's not too old to run around and play. In The Mummy, there's a major set piece involving a plane spiraling out of control that was filmed inside a real plane as Cruise careens from one side of the plane's cabin to the other. (It's not nearly as dazzling as his climb up the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol, but then, what is?) Though it hasn't always been the case, Cruise these days feels more comfortable running himself ragged to prove he hasn't aged out of action movies yet.
So it makes sense for Cruise to make more science-fiction/genre films, which has been the case since he starred in Steven Spielberg's incredible sci-fi noir Minority Report. Within the last five years, Cruise has doubled down on science fiction, with movies like the aforementioned Edge of Tomorrow and Joseph Kosinski's Oblivion. Notably, he's largely chosen to move past more serious roles; American Made, Cruise's next film, is a notable exception in which he'll play a real-life figure — the first time since Bryan Singer's Nazi drama Valkyrie. (Cruise is now nearly a decade older than Barry Seal, the man he plays in American Made, ever was.) Aside from that and the action-heavy The Last Samurai, Cruise has eschewed working on more “serious” projects in the last 15 years — a long cry from the era of Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut and others.
Genre fare like The Mummy makes sense if the goal is for Cruise to try to stay perpetually young. Perhaps that's why the Mission: Impossible series keeps going on and on. In advance of Ghost Protocol in 2011, the underlying presumption was that Cruise would pass the leading-man torch to his new co-star, Jeremy Renner. Instead, Renner is not even appearing in the upcoming sixth film, opening next summer. Within the Mission: Impossible series, Cruise pushing himself makes more sense; the series is synonymous with him, to a point where it would likely be much less appealing to watch an M:I film without Cruise's Ethan Hunt.
In The Mummy, Cruise's character, Nick Morton, an Army sergeant/treasure hunter, stumbles upon a mummy's tomb and is almost instantly chosen as the human vessel for Set, the god of death. In the end, after much CGI-infused fighting, Nick is able to destroy the Mummy (Sofia Boutella), but not without first housing Set within his body. The film ends with Nick still searching for a way to break the curse, the sense being that he'll battle with the forces of evil buried inside of him until he can cure himself. Of course, it's really just an excuse to feed into the larger Dark Universe of Universal's hopeful series of monster movies.
If there's a clear hint that Cruise's agelessness may have an expiration date, it's in considering his female co-stars in some of these recent films: Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough in Oblivion, Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow and, now, Annabelle Wallis and Boutella in The Mummy. The last time Cruise's female co-star was less than 10 years younger than him was back in 2005, when Miranda Otto, five years his junior, played his ex-wife in Spielberg's War of the Worlds. (It should be noted that Otto's in only a few scenes, unlike Blunt, Wallis, Boutella, Kurylenko, Riseborough or any of Cruise's other female co-leads of recent memory.) Cruise is hardly the first male star to play opposite younger women, but the more he tries to stay the same age, the more obvious the age gap becomes and the less believable the repartee — a major problem for The Mummy, which tries and fails to build up Wallis and Cruise as a screwball-comedy-style couple.
The Mummy is, for various reasons, a weak beginning to the Dark Universe, what Universal would like to be a franchise on the same scale as the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the DC Extended Universe. Including Cruise lends the hopeful series an air of excitement, if only because of Cruise's solid hits-to-misses ratio, even as he approaches the latter half of his 50s. The Mission: Impossible series remains one of the great modern action franchises after 20 years, for example. But the more Cruise tries to stay young, the clearer it becomes that he needs to move to the next stage of his career, to embrace his senior status next to younger stars.
Emad Tammo, the 12-year-old Yazidi boy rescued from ISIS, will be reunited with his family in Winnipeg on Thursday.
His mother, Nofa Zaghla, has been anxiously awaiting the news for weeks, according to the Yazidi Association of Manitoba.
“Her happiness could not be complete until she reunites with him,” Hadji Hesso, a spokesperson for the association, said in an email.

Emad, along with his father and brother, was separated from Zaghla and the rest of his siblings after ISIS fighters attacked their village in 2014.
Zaghla and her four children spent years of their lives in captivity before coming to Winnipeg as a refugee. She had no knowledge of whether or not Emad and the rest of her family were still alive.
But Emad's picture popped up on social media last month after the battle of Mosul, when Iraqi forces were tending to him.
Zaghla has been trying to bring him home to her ever since.

Refugee associations have been urging the federal government to speed up the immigration process.
The association says Emad will arrive early Thursday morning.

Travel baseball changing way Legion teams do business
For many years, American Legion Baseball programs have had to compete with each other and with other organizations such as Connie Mack for the best players around. Over the past few years, however, a new competitor has arisen to vie for players' attention — travel baseball teams.
But, while Berryhill Post 165 manager Steve Cronkright admits that travel ball has changed the way his team goes about its business, he still thinks Legion ball can hold its own.
"We've lost a couple of kids here and there (to travel ball), but for the most part we've been able to keep our (players), and that's the main thing," said Cronkright. " ... We're still getting the best kids from this area, (although) there are occasional ones who go down to Detroit or somewhere downstate."
Cronkright said he has heard the rumors over the past few years that Legion ball is on the downturn and that travel ball is the next big thing, but he's not buying it.
"You do (hear that stuff), but ... I like to be optimistic and think that we'll be fine," he said. "I don't see any reason why we wouldn't (be fine) as long as we keep recruiting good kids and have good coaches. I think they (kids who play for us) find out that we put a pretty good product out there."
Terry Brokoff, manager for Gladwin Post 171's team, said that travel ball has affected his program to a certain extent, but he feels there are still plenty of talented players available if one is willing to get out and look hard enough.
"There are kids we would've liked to have gotten who are playing travel ball, so, sure, it has affected us in that way," Brokoff said. " ... But we're pretty happy (with the players we have). You've got to work hard to find those kids. We're a little different (than Berryhill). We're not way up north, but we're a little up north, kind of in-between. We've got to travel a little more to see good talent (that we might want to recruit).
" ... It's a difficult thing to get around to see everybody, but you do the best you can," he added. "We've had anywhere from eight to 12 different schools represented on our 18-player team."
One particular advantage that travel teams have over Legion teams, Brokoff noted, is that young players often begin playing travel ball at an early age and stay within that program as they grow older.
"Travel ball goes all of the way down to eight years old, and these kids and parents are forming relationships (at an early age) and staying in those relationships all of the way through 18 years old," he said.
Cronkright agreed that it's sometimes hard to lure players away from travel programs with which they have played since childhood.
"They (travel teams) pick kids when they're young, and they have programs for (players aged) 14 and 16 and younger," he noted. "There are not many 16-year-olds who are ready for (our level of baseball). Some are but not many."
According to Cronkright, it is a misconception that players on travel teams will receive more college exposure than those with Legion teams.
"We play a tough schedule with enough exposure (to college coaches). Some (players) think they're going to get recruited by bigger schools (by playing travel ball), but most of them end up staying right here in the Midwest for college," Cronkright said.
" ... People (need to) realize that we have good ball around here. You don't have to go south to play good baseball," he added, noting that the Escanaba tournament in which Berryhill played two weekends ago was a good example of high-caliber baseball. " ... We faced some really good (pitchers) up there."
Brokoff agreed.
"Some travel teams (require a commitment of) $3,000, $7,000, maybe even $10,000, because you have to pay for food and all your hotel rooms, and (fees and travel arrangements associated with) tournaments," he noted. "And I don't see where a lot of kids on those teams are going to (play college ball) at a higher level than the kids who are playing Legion ball in our area."
Although Cronkright said that the rise of travel ball hasn't affected Berryhill too adversely so far, he has had to make one major adjustment in order to remain competitive. Whereas Berryhill traditionally held its tryouts right after the conclusion of the high school season for several years, Post 165 now holds its tryouts indoors at Northwood in January and February in order to get a jump on filling out its roster.
"I don't particularly care for it. ... I'm not a big fan (of early tryouts), but you've got to do something (to compete with travel teams who hold early tryouts)," he said. "You can't wait until the week before the season starts like we did for years. There's a lot more competition around, and parents are taking their kids down south if they don't have a place to play up here.
"And if parents aren't sure (that their kids will make a Legion roster), they're not going to wait," he added.
Brokoff, who doesn't hold formal team tryouts but tries to watch as many area players in action as he can during the first month of the high school season, agreed that travel ball has made putting together a roster as early as possible a must.
"I would feel that (solidifying your roster) would have to be done early. We try to have our team put together by the end of April or early May," he noted. "You can't wait until the end of the high school season to do something like that. ... The way it seems now, you almost have to start putting a team together for next year by the time August comes."
While early tryouts is one advantage travel ball has over Legion ball, Brokoff pointed out that Legion ball has one big leg up on travel teams — cost, or lack thereof.
As Brokoff noted, his Post 171 team recently competed at the 48-team Battle of Omaha tournament in Nebraska against elite competition at no expense to the players or their families.
"This year, we were fortunate to make enough (through our fundraising) to take a six-day road trip to Omaha and play in that tournament. It was a five-figure cost to go on that trip, but we paid for all of the players' meals and their hotel rooms," he said.
According to Brokoff, Post 171's annual February fundraising banquet, which it has held for the past 22 years, typically generates enough money to allow him to cover the players' travel expenses, tournament fees, and uniforms, including replacement apparel if necessary.
"We've been very, very fortunate (with our fundraising). ... The last seven years, we've had a great income from that (February fundraiser) in one night," he said. "There's a lot of work going on for months and months prior to it that all culminates in that one night."
Like Post 171, Post 165 also has an annual cash cow which allows the team to foot players' expenses — its yearly Valentine's Day dance.
"Nels (Cronkright) does a really good job of raising money so that we don't have to charge the kids (to play for us). He's not the only one (who works on fundraising), but he's the one who started (the Valentine's Day dance) back in 1980, and we've had it ever since," said Steve Cronkright.
" ... We try to take care of the kids, take care of their motel rooms, and give them a little bit of money on the road to take care of their food," he added. "My grandson played on a travel team, and he had to pay quite a bit of money to get into tournaments, and he had to buy his own uniform, and he had to put himself up (in hotels) when they were traveling.
"But as long as we can keep having our Valentine's dance and making money, we're going to keep trying never to charge a kid for anything."

Rawalpindi-Unannounced loadshedding has increased misery of the residents as the heat wave continues to broil the city during Ramazan, besides triggering a massive water shortage in residential areas of the city.
Though the government and Islamabad Electricity Supply Company (IESCO) have made tall claims of not suspending power supply during Sehr and Iftar, yet the electricity supply remained suspended six to seven hours in various parts of the city. Power supply was cut off between 4am to 6:30am and from 7:30 to 9am in Dhamial, Hayyal, Bunda Nagyal, Bank Colony, Ashraf Colony, Quaid-e-Azam Colony, Dhamial Kalyal Road, Jorian, Rasoolabad Sharif, Gulshan-e-Saeed, Chakri Road, Bakra Mandi, Dhoke Syedan, Baraf Khana Chowk, Dhama Syedan, Kalyal, Landco, Gulshanabad, Rehman Markaz, Rukhshanda Mosque, Sanjoli Estate, Rah-e-Aman, Kahkashan Colony, Jarahi, Janjua Town, Dhoke Rajgan, Khayaban-e-Jinnah, Hill View, Munawar Colony, Ali Town, Dhoke Baba Miran Mustafa, Mumtaz Market, Dhoke Haji Niaz Ali, Kalhoor, Christian Colony, Mubarak Lane, Chungi Number 20, Dhoke Juma, Tulsa, Caltax Road, Morgah, Kotha Kalan and Officers Colony.
Electricity loadshedding was also observed without any intimation in areas of Saddar, Bank Road, Kashmir Road, Adam Jee Road, Hathi Chowk, Westridge, Misrial, Pirwadhai, Mareer Hassan, Mareer Chowk, Rashid Minhas Road, Civil Line, Katcheri, Lalkutri, Dheri, Tahli Mohri, Jhanda Cheechi, Moti Mehal, Tipu Road, Chaman Colony, Chaklala Scheme III, Airport Road, Shah Khalid Colony, Gulzar-e-Quaid, Shakrial, Sadiqabad, Muslim Town, Committee Chowk, Waris Khan, Raja Bazaar, Teli Mohala, Kohati Bazaar, City Saddar Road, Sootermandi, Gunjmandi, Gawalmandi, Chandni Chowk, Commercial Market, Holy Family Hospital, Satellite Town, Faizabad and Double Road irking the residents a lot. Razaq Town, Chakra, New Chakra, Dhoke Gujran, Afshan Colony, Niazi Town, Dhoke Banaras, Shalley Valley and other areas were also facing loadshedding.
Residents continue to face countless problems, including water shortage, because of the prolonged loadshedding.
“We don't have cold drinking water during Sehri and Iftar time because the fridge isn't working due to the power outages,” said Kashif, a resident of Saddar. He said that he and his family cannot even sleep during the night or day as WAPDA is suspending the power supply continuously.
“Our UPS also ran out of charge and the water supply was suspended because of loadshedding,” said Waqas Khan, another resident of Saddar. He sad even though there are always problems with power supply in the summer, the government does not make arrangements or draft policies to address the problem, he said. “Our families spend sleepless nights and days as there is no electricity in our area,” said Usman, Ali and Aftab, residents of Ali Town.
Salma Khan of Dhamial said that she spent the day without a fan and broke her fast without cold water. “The power supply is being suspended for long hours by WAPDA that has doubled our problems”, she said. Many other residents demanded the government to end the loadshedding at least during Ramazan.
DUBAI - A top Iranian official called on the Gulf Arab states on Tuesday to seize the opportunity of a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to Oman and Kuwait to improve ties, warning that a chance like this would "pass like a cloud".
Rouhani will visit Oman and Kuwait on Wednesday on his first visit to the Gulf states since taking power in 2013.
The six Arab members of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), especially Saudi Arabia, accuse Iran of using sectarianism to interfere in Arab countries and build its own sphere of influence in the Middle East. Iran denies the accusations.
"Rouhani's regional initiative to accept invitation of leaders of Oman and Kuwait signals the need for Islamic friendship and restoration of regional ties," Hamid Aboutalebi, the Iranian president's deputy chief of staff, tweeted on Tuesday.
"This regional initiative is an opportunity that our regional friends should seize. Opportunity passes like a cloud. Take advantage of the good opportunity," he added.
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain cut diplomatic relations with Iran in January 2016 after protesters torched the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates recalled their envoys in a show of solidarity with Riyadh, but Oman only expressed regret over the attack, highlighting its better ties.
Oman has traditionally resisted Gulf Arab states' efforts to close ranks against Iran. It helped to mediate secret US-Iran talks in 2013 that led to a historic nuclear deal signed in Geneva two years later.
Kuwait's foreign minister paid a rare visit to Tehran late in January to deliver a message to Rouhani on the "basis of dialogue" between Gulf Arab states and Iran.
Rouhani said Kuwait was among at least 10 countries to have offered to mediate in Iran's escalating feud with Saudi Arabia.
The Iranian president will meet Oman's Sultan Qaboos in Muscat on Wednesday before travelling on to Kuwait on the invitation of its ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Rouhani's deputy chief of staff for communications, Parviz Esmaeili, was quoted as saying on Monday by state-run Press TV.
Iran's ambassador to Kuwait, Alireza Enayati, was quoted by ISNA news agency as saying that "on this one-day visit regional issues as well as bilateral cooperation will be discussed".
One Night, the last-minute booking app for boutique hotels, is expanding internationally – starting today with London.
One Night was created by Standard International, which is the parent company of Standard Hotels. Originally the company launched an app called One Night Standard, which was a way to get great deals on same-day bookings (starting at 3pm) at Standard properties. But after seeing demand from other boutique hotels looking for a similar offering, the company launched One Night, which now offers rooms at properties in 10 U.S cities plus London.
While the general premise is similar to incumbent Hotel Tonight, One Night puts a greater emphasis on making sure only highly-curated trendy hotels make the cut. For example, in London One Night will have rooms available at The Ned, Soho House's brand-new trendy stand-alone hotel.
While The Standard's presence in London makes it a logical first step in terms of international expansion, Amar Lalvani, CEO of Standard International, explained that the team is already “looking towards other key markets throughout Europe”.
The app also has some cool features like hour-by-hour city guides that suggest activities near your hotel that you can be doing each hour. Features like this will be especially helpful as the app continues to expand internationally, as U.S travelers spending time abroad are always looking for better activity and restaurant suggestion apps.
One Night has seen strong growth since it launched in just NY and LA a little over a year ago. Since June average daily bookings grew 331%, and active users as a percentage of total downloads (i.e how many downloaders are actually using the app) grew to 48%, which is nearly double what it was last year.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell has reiterated that ace Jimmy Nelson will not resume throwing until spring training and won't be ready for Opening Day as he comes back from a shoulder injury.
Nelson was 12-6 with a 3.49 ERA last season. The right-hander was hurt Sept. 8 diving back to first after rounding the base after getting a single.
"I talked to him last week, he's doing great and he's very encouraged by how he's recovering," Counsell said Monday at the winter meetings. "Look, the loss of Jimmy Nelson, it hurts. I knew when it happened, I said this is going to hurt more in 2018 than it does the last five starts."
"But in 2018 when you go back to a 25-man roster and you lose a guy that's pitching into the seventh inning three times a month, through the seventh inning, that's when it hurts," he said.
Massive viewership for Game 7 of last year's NBA Finals lifted the series to the highest ratings for a championship matchup since 1998. But this year, the Golden State Warriors' dominance in the playoffs — cruising undefeated through the Western Conference bracket — made the possibility that the series would again go to seven games seem remote. Prior to the Finals, NBA executives were quietly tamping down ratings expectations.
It took Golden State only five games to dispatch the Cleveland Cavaliers. But the Finals still saw average viewership increase — up from an average of 20.2 million last year to 20.4 million. That growth is slightly at less than 1%. But with a less competitive series and ratings for live sports experiencing declines across the board, growth of any kind is welcome news for the NBA and its television partners — and indicative of the league's growing value in the sports-television landscape.
“We were thrilled how the ratings were after the series,” says Julie Sobieski, VP of programming for ESPN, which produced the Finals telecasts for broadcaster and Walt Disney Co. sibling ABC. “Not surprised in the sense of interest around this historic series, but really thrilled. To be up significantly and have this be the most-watched ever since 1998 just having gone through five games as opposed to seven last year — it was fantastic to see how much interest there was.”
That interest was driven by the Cavs and Warriors, who have faced each other in the last two finals — with Golden State having won in 2015 and Cleveland winning in 2016. This year, the Warriors added one of the league's best players in Kevin Durant, introducing a new factor in the competition and a fresh narrative (Durant's quest for his first title) with which to hook viewers.
The combined appeal of Durant, teammate Stephen Curry, and the Cavs' LeBron James and Kyrie Irving provided ample compensation for any fatigue fans might have felt watching two familiar teams face off.
“I do think that fans wanted to see all of that star power every night,” Sobieski says. “There was also a belief that Cleveland could have come back and won any of those games at any time.”
That belief had fuel added to it in Game 3, when Cleveland nearly pulled off an upset victory after Golden State won the first two games by a wide margin.
“I was at that game,” Sobieski says. “That place was rocking right down to the last minute of that game, and obviously that does make a huge difference. It was certainly a turning point in the series and sent everyone back to their seats for Game 4.”
In Game 4, Cleveland ruined the Golden State's shot at getting through the playoffs without a single loss, pulling off an impressive 137-116 victory. The next game would turn out to be the most-watched Game 5 of any since 1998 with an average of 24.5 million viewers.
The viewership counters recent downward trends in live-sports ratings. NFL viewership was down 8% in 2016 from the year prior. NBA regular-season action was down 6% this season from last.
That trajectory reversed in the playoffs, which saw viewership increase 4% year-to-year across ABC, TNT, ESPN, and NBA TV through the first three rounds. The upswing provided a positive end to a season that was the first covered under a new contract that sees ESPN and TNT paying a combined $2.66 billion per year to broadcast NBA games through the 2024-25 season.
“We had no reservations that we were going to see fantastic numbers out of the NBA,” Sobieski said. “It why we did the deal that we did with these guys. They're an ascendant sport.”
If this were done, the sun would not rise until 8 a.m. in early January in Los Angeles and 8:25 in San Francisco. Do we want to send our kids to school and be on our morning commute in the dark?
Tanzania has rolled out the new electronic East African Community passports to replace the existing national documents, set to be phased out by January 2020.
According to African News, the launch on Wednesday was witnessed by President John Magufuli who said the e-passport would bring lasting solution to a number of challenges associated with immigration services in the country.
‘‘I'm pleased with the changes. This is a job well done by the Immigration Department. You have my support,'‘ said Dr. Magufuli.
It will thus not be easy to make a copy of it. It will remain genuine and will also last long and contain much more pages than the previous ones.
The e-passport is embedded with a machine readable computer chip which contains the holder's biometric information on a tamper-proof page, and has been touted as a major step in curbing fraud and easing clearance at international airports where e-readers are installed.
‘‘It will thus not be easy to make a copy of it. It will remain genuine and will also last long and contain much more pages than the previous ones,'‘ said the Commissioner General of the Immigration Department, Dr. Anna Makakala.
Tanzania becomes the second East African Community (EAC) member country to roll out the e-passports after Kenya which launched the documents in September last year, 17 years after discussions to develop the Community document began.
The 35th EAC Council of Ministers meeting in last April directed member states to start issuing the regional e-passport by January 2018.
Tanzanians will continue using the old passports until 2020, when they will be totally phased out.
The new technology to print the e-passport in Tanzania was installed by US-based HID company with support from the government of Ireland and cost about US$58 million.
The new travel document will cost US$67.5 (Tsh150,000) and will be valid for ten years.

Bristol City striker Gustav Engvall could still be on the move in the next few weeks, according to the Bristol Post 's sources.
The Sweden U21 striker has been the subject of speculation regarding his future after returning to the Robins after two spells on loan at Djurgarden in the past 12 months.
The forward featured recently from the bench against Watford in the FA Cup for City, following playing back home in his native Sweden, where he scored eight goals and grabbed five assists in 24 starts for the Tele2 Arena-based Allsvenskan side.
The Post was told by a source close to Gustav Engvall that the striker would like to play more regular first team football and is considering a move abroad.
In fact, Engvall revealed this himself recently when talking to a Swedish media outlet.
We understand that Engvall's situation was discussed within the corridors of power at Ashton Gate yesterday and that the attacker was close to leaving on loan. It was described as '50/50' at one point.
We were told by more than one source that a move to Brondby looked likeliest, after some red tape was sorted out regarding whether Engvall could move club again (he can).
(Image: JMP 2017)
However, a move back to Sweden could now take place with the Swedish transfer window not closing until 4 April.
Likewise, other countries have yet to close their transfer window and may offer an escape route from BS3 if needed.
A source close to the player told the Post that in the worst case scenario Engvall would remain at the Robins until the summer and then be sold, if the player was still set on departing.
Head coach Lee Johnson told us this week - at the pre-Bolton press conference - that ultimately the decision would rest with Engvall.
"If he was sold it would have to be a good offer for us to reinvest. But my gut instinct is that I don't want us to sell Gus. I still see signs and glimpses of real quality in his movement.
"Today [Tuesday] for example he was excellent in training, with his movement, touch, confidence is up and down. If he was our young player coming through the academy we'd be shouting from the roof tops about him.
"If Gus wants to stay and compete then I'm happy with that. All of our players have to do that on a daily basis. The competition is stiff - if you have an off day it knocks you down the pecking order.
"That's the same for everybody... record signing or an U18 doing well. That competition is healthy and strong and only make the individuals better," he explained.
Bristol City are preparing to play Bolton Wanderers at 8pm on Friday evening.
Rawalpindi-Police have found the body of a 13-year-old boy who went missing mysteriously from his house in Ratta Amral area, police informed on Wednesday.
The deceased was identified as Ahtasham Khan, police added. The boy had died after touching electric wires, police said.
According to Superintendent of Police (SP) Rawal Division Behram Khan, police on information provided by locals found the dead body of the boy who reportedly went missing from his house a day ago. He said the child died of electric shock. He said it was suggested during the initial investigation that the child touched high-voltage electric wires while playing cricket in the area. The police official told that the body was moved to District Headquarters Hospital for post-mortem. On a query, the SP said it was not a murder case.
Meanwhile, a gang of five extortionists tortured a transporter over refusing to give them extortion money in the jurisdiction of Sadiqabad police station.
According to details, a transporter Abdul Sattar lodged a complaint at Sadiqabad police station that he was picking passengers from Faizabad bus terminal in a van on route number 1 when Kamran and Shaukat along with three unidentified men intercepted him and demanded extortion. He added that the five men started beating him when he refused to pay extortion money. He also alleged that the extortionists snatched Rs5,000 from him and broke his cell phone. He appealed to the police to register a case against the extortionists and arrest them. Front Desk officials lodged a complaint and forwarded it to SHO for further action.
Anti-profiteering drive
continues
The drive against profiteers and hoarders continued in the city on Wednesday as special price magistrates raided several markets in the city while imposing heavy fines on profiteers besides lodging cases with the local police.
The raids were conducted by assistant commissioners (AC) of Saddar, Cantt and City following the instructions of Acting Commissioner Talat Mehmood Gondal.
According to details, AC Saddar Tasneem Ali along with local police paid surprise visits in Adiala Road, Gulshanabad, Lalazar and Chakri Road and checked 29 shops.
As many as five shopkeepers were arrested on the orders of AC on account of not selling subsidized flour as per the orders of Punjab government. The officer also imposed Rs80,000 fine on the shopkeepers.
In Cantt and Garrison, AC Mehreen Faheem Abbasi inspected 30 shops and ordered the arrest of two shopkeepers for selling edibles at high rates. She also imposed fine on eight shopkeepers for minting money during Ramazan. Abbasi, while talking to The Nation, said she would continue a full-fledged campaign against the profiteers and hoarders in the Cantt areas.
On the other hand, AC City Maleeha Jamal along with a team of price magistrates visited markets in Pirwadhai, New Town, Sadiqabad and its suburbs and imposed a fine of Rs19,000 to several shopkeepers for selling chicken, vegetables and fruit at exorbitant rates. Police also arrested seven shopkeepers on the orders of AC and registered cases against them.
Meanwhile, Secretary Forest along with AC Cantt visited Ramazan Sasta Bazaar at Chuhar Chowk and appreciated the efforts of district government for facilitating the consumers.
He also interacted with consumers who expressed their satisfaction over the provision of quality food items at affordable rates.
RIYADH - Saudi Arabia and Iraq are to launch a joint trade commission, the Saudi cabinet announced Monday, in a sign of a thaw in ties between the two neighbours.
"The cabinet has decided to approve the establishment of the Saudi-Iraqi Coordinating Commission and to delegate the Saudi minister of trade and investments to sign on behalf of the kingdom," read a statement carried by state-run SPA news agency.
The two countries went a quarter century without diplomatic relations, which were cut following Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait after which Saudi Arabia served as the launchpad for a US-led coalition to oust Iraqi forces.
Saudi Arabia and Iraq, OPEC's top two producers, were both dealt a serious blow when oil prices plummeted following a global production glut in 2014.
Riyadh and Baghdad showed an improvement in ties in June, when Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited the kingdom followed by a series of visits by high-ranking officials.
Iraq's Energy Minister Jabbar al-Luaybi and his Saudi counterpart Khalid al-Falih last Thursday jointly announced they would strengthen their commitment to pledged oil production cuts and vowed to ensure coordination of their nations' oil policies.
OPEC and non-OPEC members have pledged to cut back on production in an effort to stabilise market prices.
While Saudi Arabia met its production limits in July, Iraq only made one-third of the cut it had pledged, according to a report published by the International Energy Agency.
Influential Iraqi Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who led a militia that fought against the US occupation of Iraq, last month made a rare trip to Saudi Arabia, a key regional ally of Washington.
The rekindling of ties comes at a time of diplomatic crisis in the Gulf after Saudi Arabia cut all ties with neighbouring Qatar in June, accusing the emirate of supporting Islamist extremists and working with Shiite Iran.
Qatar, the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, has denied the allegations.
A handful of water main breaks kept Public Works Department crews busy Tuesday in Vallejo.
On Tuesday morning, a main break on Wendy Street left approximately 20 homes without service.
Another break on Fairmont Avenue simultaneously left 36 homes without water, department officials said.
After crews addressed both locations, they moved to fix an 8-inch cast iron main break on Corcoran Avenue.
Though the Corcoran Avenue water line was temporarily shut down, no homes in the area experienced water loss due to a “redundancy in the system,” the department said.
However, repairs on the Corcoran Avenue break were slightly delayed due to break's close proximity to a multitude of schools,
Crews prepped and coned off the affected area, but did not begin repairs until the morning traffic at the schools was clear.
The Corcoran Avenue break was expected to further affect afternoon traffic as the Public Works Department continued to work on the water main.
Sacha Baron Cohen has posted a 4th of July tease for a new project that appears to take on the comedian's old foe, Donald Trump.
“He's back,” the trailer promises, “as you've never seen him before.” The words are interspersed with a “Happy Fourth of July” message from Trump and footage of the President saying “Sacha Baron Cohen, go to school! Learn about being funny.”
“Sacha graduates soon,” the teaser says, ending with a title card for Trump University that uses the actual logo for the defunct real estate training school. The new project might also include other targets, as he was also reported to have filmed a stunt with O.J. Simpson in his Las Vegas hotel room in February.

Baron Cohen and Trump have a long and antagonistic relationship. Trump has said he was the only person to immediately walk out of his interview with Baron Cohen's “Ali G.,” but Baron Cohen has said he was actually there a comparatively long nine minutes. Trump's proclamation “I never fall for scams” was recently mocked when he spoke to comedian Stuttering John while on Air Force One.
In the the 2016 satirical comedy “Grimsby,” which Baron Cohen starred in and co-wrote, Trump becomes infected with HIV after Daniel Radcliffe's blood is sprayed into his mouth due to a gunshot. Released during Trump's campaign, the movie included a disclaimer that the candidate did not actually have HIV.
Baron Cohen is currently shooting Netflix series “The Spy,” written and directed by Gideon Raff. He was previously set to star in Michael Winterbottom's “Greed,” about the world of the super-rich, though the project seems to be on hold.
His rep could not be reached for comment.

STX Entertainment has unveiled a brief teaser for the Molly's Game trailer that will be fully debuting tomorrow, August 15th. The film marks the directorial debut of Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, the guy behind The Social Network, A Few Good Men, and this little show called The West Wing. Sorkin wrote the script for Molly's Game himself (obviously) and the true story drama stars Jessica Chastain as Molly Bloom, an Olympic-class skier who ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game for more than a decade before being arrested in the middle of the night by gun-wielding FBI agents.
This trailer teaser offers our first look at footage from the film, and the structure and use of dialogue over imagery harkens back to how Sony sold The Social Network as something far more intriguing than “the Facebook movie.” As a self-described Sorkin obsessive I've been mighty curious about this one for some time, and it'll be interesting to see how Sorkin handles himself behind the camera. He's got a great team behind him, including Far from the Madding Crowd cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen, so I'm eager to see the full trailer tomorrow.
Check out the Molly's Game trailer teaser below and check back tomorrow for the full thing. The film also stars Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong, Chris O'Dowd, and Bill Camp. Molly's Game opens in theaters on November 22nd.
The September jobs report the government will release Friday morning will probably show a sharp drop in hiring compared with August because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
The two storms inflicted heavy damage in Texas, Florida and other parts of the Southeast. Thousands of businesses had to shut their doors, leaving many people temporarily out of work.
Economists have forecast that employers added just 80,000 jobs last month, barely half the 156,000 they added in August, according to data provider FactSet. That would be the lowest job gain since March.
But the storms will probably be the reason for the decline. Economists at JPMorgan Chase estimated that the hurricanes will have lowered last month's gain by 75,000, meaning that without them, a solid 150,000 or so jobs would have been added.
A hiring rebound is expected for October or November as many businesses reopen and construction companies in the affected areas ramp up repair and renovation work.
If September's hiring does drop temporarily, and October's or November's rebounds, economists and the Federal Reserve may find it hard to assess the state of the economy with any precision over the next couple of months. Even so, most Fed watchers expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate when it meets in December.

Carlo Ancelotti has hailed Antonio Conte for the “extraordinary” job he is doing at Chelsea.
Conte inherited a side that finished 10th when he took over in the summer but has revived the Blues and steered them to top spot.
They are now firm favourites to lift the title and Conte has the chance to equal a 15-year-old Premier League record at Tottenham on Wednesday night, to underline the impressive work he has done so far.
Victory at White Hart Lane would be their 14th in a row in the league, equalling the number of back-to-back victories Arsenal racked up in 2002.

And if Chelsea do topple Spurs, theirs would arguably be an even greater achievement as all of their successive wins will have come in the same season.
Ancelotti, who won a 2010 league and FA Cup Double during his two-year Chelsea reign, said: "What Conte is doing at Chelsea is extraordinary.
"Antonio has determination, ideas, personality and experience. He's mature as a coach now and I'm truly happy for him.”
And Ancelotti compared Conte's flying start in England to the success legendary player Zinedine Zidane is enjoying at Real Madrid in his first taste of senior management.
He said: "[Zinedine] Zidane has won the Club World Cup after winning the Champions League [with Real Madrid], and there were people who thought he was not a coach.
“The truth is Conte and Zidane had quality on the field and they've taken that into their new jobs with them."

Chelsea could hardly have a tougher test to pass to equal Arsenal's record in the shape of in-form Spurs.
The rivalry between the two clubs has cranked up a notch over the last couple of seasons.
Spurs hammered Chelsea 5-3 on New Year's Day two years ago in a famous win for the north Londoners, but Chelsea gained some revenge by beating Spurs in the League Cup final that season.
And they hammered the final nail in Tottenham's title coffin last term by fighting back from a 2-0 down to hold Spurs to a dramatic, ill-tempered 2-2 draw and hand Leicester the league.
Despite the animosity and their history bid defender Gary Cahill insists it is business as usual for the Blues.

He said: "It's not because it's Tottenham that's going to change in our preparation.
"It's going to be exactly the same and we expect exactly the same from each and every player come kick-off time and we'll be okay.
"It's not like all week we've been saying, 'We want this record, we want this record'. We've just kept going.
"Being aware of the record and wanting to achieve them, there's nothing wrong with that. Every player wants to be a part of records - I'm not shy about saying that - but it's not something we speak about.”
Nearly 150 cancer survivors, more than 400 of their family members and about 100 staff members — about 650 people in all — attended Bridgeport Hospital's 10th annual Survivor Safari June 10 at Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo. The event included free zoo admission, a barbecue, family entertainment and the symbolic release of butterflies to signify new beginnings and rebirth.
Oncology nurse navigator Kim Bielecki was the lead organizer. “Survivors take to heart the fact they've gone through treatment,” Bielecki said. “They can celebrate and move on because of advances in cancer treatment. Some patients have been coming to the safari for years.”
Bielecki joined Lisa Shomsky, clinical program director of Smilow Cancer Hospital services in the Bridgeport Hospital service area, in welcoming guests to the event. Both hospitals are members of Yale New Haven Health, and cancer services are among the specialties being integrated across the health system to help standardize and improve the quality of patient care.
“This is a most gratifying day but most of all, we're grateful for all of you,” Shomsky said to the survivors on hand, referring to the progress they have made along their cancer journey.
Survivor Safari was sponsored by the Kaulbach Memorial Golf Classic and Norma Pfriem Cancer Institute at Bridgeport Hospital.
Pence Expands On Trump's Remarks To Include White Supremacists
Vice President Mike Pence is on a six-day tour of South America. But even thousands of miles away, Pence had no choice but to respond to the events over the weekend in Charlottesville, Va.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Vice President Mike Pence is traveling this week in South America, and the political crisis in Venezuela is likely to dominate the discussions on that trip. But even thousands of miles away from the U.S., Pence really had no choice but to respond to the events of this weekend in Charlottesville, Va. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is traveling with the vice president. And she is with us now on the line from Cartagena, Colombia, which is the first stop on the trip.
Hey, Tam.
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey.
MARTIN: President Trump got a lot of criticism for his response to the protests in Charlottesville for not specifically calling out white supremacists in his statement after those protests. He still hasn't done so, but now his vice president is. Is that right?
KEITH: That's right. That is right. And Vice President Pence has - did last night what he has sort of perfected as vice president, which is translating Trump or saying what the president should have said - or many people thought he should have said. Here's Mike Pence last night at a press conference.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.
KEITH: So there he is saying the words that President Trump has not yet said. But then he also tried to explain what President Trump had meant by saying that violence came from many sides, something that Trump was criticized for. Vice President Pence said that there were people from, quote, "different militant perspectives" - sort of alluding to some of the more violent counterprotesters.
MARTIN: ...Which is this moral equivalency that people have been criticizing.
KEITH: Exactly.
MARTIN: So let's talk about the reason for this trip. The vice president is in South America, obviously going to talk about Venezuela - but what's the genesis of this whole trip?
KEITH: So he's visiting Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama. These are all U.S. allies and trading partners. And last night, he announced that there's a new trade agreement that will allow Colombia to export Hass avocados to the U.S. - so I guess more avocados for avo (ph) toast.
MARTIN: Good for us.
KEITH: And good for millennials. And, you know, really, this trip is about strengthening ties and also about highlighting a contrast that Pence highlighted last night between what he says is countries that represent the future - like Colombia with its peace agreement with the FARC - and countries that represent the past - like Venezuela, which he says is sliding toward dictatorship.
MARTIN: So the president weighed in on the situation in Venezuela Friday. He said the U.S. had a lot of options on the table, including military options - wasn't exactly clear what he meant by that. Has the vice president addressed the president's remarks?
KEITH: Yeah, so the vice president put the emphasis on the many options, and said that he had been sent to South America by the president to look for peaceful solutions and to work with U.S. allies in South America.
What was fascinating about this is that he was at a joint press conference standing next to Colombian President Santos and saying - Colombian President Santos said, you know, Latin America is not on board with the idea of military intervention.
MARTIN: NPR's Tamara Keith, traveling with the vice president - thanks, Tam.
KEITH: Thanks.

A 28-year-old rugby player died after taking stimulant drugs he bought over the internet, an inquest heard.
Freddie Dibben, who had been taking anabolic steroids, had been going to the gym daily and having protein shakes for a number of years.
But his parents had no idea that he had been ordering drugs online, Winchester Coroners Court in Hampshire heard.
The engineer was found dead in bed by his dad Clifford after taking Clenbuterol, a stimulant drug normally used to treat problems such as asthma and commonly used by bodybuilders.
Freddie's mum described him as an "intelligent lad" and said they want to deter other young men from 'going down this route'.
(Image: Facebook)
Pathologist Dr Victoria Eliot gave Mr Dibben's cause of death as dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart's ability to pump blood decreases due to an enlarged and weakened valve.
She said: "These drugs have some benefits - in inverted commas - in terms of physique but also have side-effects which can affect the heart."
Coroner Grahame Short said: "Young men in particular are keen to improve their physique and some resort to steroids which is a quick and easy way to put on weight and enhance muscles.
"Prior to his death Freddie was a fit man with no medical conditions. I think this case reflects how dangerous these drugs are."
(Image: www.alamy.com)
He recorded a conclusion of misadventure.
Following the inquest, his mother Lorraine said: "Freddie was an intelligent lad.
"He wasn't stupid but he thought he was in control. We want to inform other young men to make sure they don't go down this route.
"These drugs will damage your heart in such a way that you cannot undo. The risks are just not worth it.
"If we could save one man, it would be worth it."
Freddie, an engineer, played prop for the third XV at Ellingham and Ringwood Rugby Club, Hampshire, for eight years.
SYDNEY - Australia have one eye on India and Pakistan could be contemplating life without their most successful captain Misbah-ul-Haq when the final 'dead' Test begins on Tuesday in Sydney.
Steve Smith's Australians wrapped up the three-match series with a Test to spare in a dramatic second innings demolition of Pakistan in two sessions in Melbourne on Friday to open up new selection possibilities for Sydney. Shattered Pakistan could be forced to look for a new leader with 42-year-old Misbah admitting he was thinking about retirement, possibly even before the series concludes in Sydney. "I always believed that if I couldn't contribute to the team then it's no point staying there. I haven't decided (about Sydney) but let's see," Misbah said after the tourists lost by an innings and 18 runs.
While the end looms for the man who has guided his country to more victories than any other Pakistan captain -- 24 in 52 Tests -- Australia have other considerations. Spinners Steve O'Keefe and Ashton Agar have been included in a 13-man squad for a Sydney Cricket Ground wicket that is expected to turn.
Coach Darren Lehmann raised the prospect of playing two of his three spin options -- the other is Australia's most-successful off-spinner Nathan Lyon -- at the expense of paceman Jackson Bird with an all-rounder coming in. Australia goes to India for four Tests in February and March on likely turning pitches, putting the onus of O'Keefe and Agar to put in a good audition and stake a claim for a place on tour.
"It's more than likely that we're going to play two of those three spinners which means we'll also have to look to fit in an all-rounder," Lehmann said. "It might end up that someone like Jackson Bird could be the unlucky one who misses out, but that will depend on the condition of the SCG pitch. "If it looks like it's going to provide more assistance for the seamers, then we still have the option of playing all three specialist quicks and just the one spinner." The all-rounder option could rest between Zimbabwe-born Hilton Cartwright or Agar, who Lehmann puts in the versatile category, saying "he's certainly got the talent to be a batting all-rounder or a spinning all-rounder".
Left-arm spinner Agar, 23, is on track to play for the first time since his only two Tests on the 2013 Ashes tour of England, where he scored 98 on debut at Trent Bridge batting at number 11. Agar has subsequently scored two first-class hundreds and eight fifties.
Pakistan are facing their 12th straight defeat since their last Test win in Australia in Sydney 22 years ago. Misbah was disconsolate following the Melbourne second-innings debacle on good batting surface that had seen the teams score a total of 1,067 first-innings runs. "After scoring 443 you should not be in that position to lose a Test match on the last day," Misbah said. "I think we should take the blame as a batting unit because the pitch was very good on the last day."
TEAMS:
AUSTRALIA (FROM): Steve Smith (capt), David Warner, Ashton Agar, Jackson Bird, Hilton Cartwright, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Stephen O'Keefe, Matt Renshaw, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade.
PAKISTAN (FROM): Azhar Ali, Sami Aslam, Babar Azam, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq (capt), Asad Shafiq, M Nawaz, Sarfraz Ahmed, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, M Amir, M Asghar, Sohail Khan.

Engro Foods Limited has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Greenland Zone a progressive provider of farm machinery and financial assistance for the agricultural sector.
The objective of this collaboration is to enhance the productivity of dairy farms, by facilitating the acquisition of modern farm machinery and equipment, while imparting valuable training to the farmers for capacity-building.
Deployment of modern technology promises to be a game-changer for Pakistan's traditional farming sector. This will ensure the production and distribution of quality milk for the masses, while increasing the profitability and prosperity of the agricultural sector too.
This alliance enables Engro Foods and Greenland Zone to empower the local farmers, by guiding them towards farm-mechanization which will in turn lead to an increase in quality and quantity of diary production. Thus, the two organizations have pledged to nurture a healthy and prosperous society.
Engro will provide consultancy and deeper insights after evaluating the farmers' technological needs. They will then recommend the right machinery needed for higher profitability for the farmers. Greenland Zone will then facilitate the acquisition, installation, training and maintenance of the recommended equipment.
On this occasion Director Agri Business at Engro Foods Syed Saud Pasha said; “This initiative will revolutionize the performance of Pakistan's dairy livestock sector. It will provide a resourceful forum to inspire the farmers to adopt modern technology and reach greater prosperity.
Engro Foods has always been the driving force behind modernization of the farming industry. It has entered into numerous alliances to engage dairy producers located in all regions of the country.
This strategy has been driven with the aim of enabling an ecofriendly diary industry.”
This alliance is in line with the international initiative called ‘Global Dairy Development' which is also being launched in Pakistan this year. The global initiative will give momentum to sustainable development of progressive dairy farming in the country.
Engro Foods Limited, a subsidiary of Dutch based dairy cooperative, Royal Friesland Campina which owns controlling shares of Engro Foods Limited, is a public listed company incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984, with shares quoted on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Company is to manufacture, process and sell dairy products and frozen desserts. The Company also owns and operates a dairy farm.

Nine consecutive wins for Team Nova Scotia in Penticton at the South Okanagan Events Centre

By Matthew Abrey
Special to the Penticton Western News
Mary-Anne Arsenault and her Nova Scotia rink just keep on winning at the Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Penticton.
The Dartmouth-based rink brought down Tracy Fleury and Team Northern Ontario by a 6-2 score, winning their staggering ninth match in a row, earning a berth in Sunday's semifinal.
“It was so nice to put a really good game together,” said Arsenault, who has played in the Scotties 13 times. “I'm so proud of my girls. They played awesome and anytime we were in a little bit of trouble, (they) would make a double and we were back.”
Arsenault blanked the first three ends keeping the hammer for the fourth where she opened the scoring. She managed to expertly draw around the high-sitting guards with her final two stones to lay two, giving her Nova Scotia rink a 2-0 lead going into the fifth end.
Fleury earned one back in the fifth by picking and rolling across the inner blue rings to lay one, cutting Arsenault's lead to 2-1.
Arsenault fired right back making a pair of tight draws into the inner rings through a cluttered upper house to lay three in the sixth end — extending her lead to 5-1.
Fleury blanked the seventh, then drew to the button in the eighth to cut into Arsenault's lead. However, her Nova Scotia rink still found themselves down 5-2 heading into the ninth end.
The ninth end featured a jam-up heading into skips' final shots. Fleury cleared the jam-up with her last stone of the end, but Arsenault hit and stuck her hammer shot to further pad her lead at 6-2.
The teams decided to play the 10th end, even though Arsenault had a sizeable lead, but did not play the entire length. They shook hands with four rocks remaining after Northern Ontario couldn't keep enough stones in the house to justify finishing the end.
“We would have liked to have played better,” said Fleury, whose rink went 8-3 in tournament play. “But Nova Scotia played amazing and we just had some key misses. They played well and put a lot of pressure on us.”
Arsenault is now two wins away from giving Team Nova Scotia its first Scotties Tournament of Hearts national title in 14 years. Nova Scotia will play the loser of Saturday night's Page Playoff, between Manitoba and Team Wild Card, in the semifinal at 9 a.m. at the South Okanagan Events Centre to determine who will move on to the final. The winner of the Saturday night 7 p.m. draw will move directly to the final, which takes place at 4 p.m. on Sunday.
The HeartStop Lounge, located at the Penticton Trade and Convention Centre, will feature the final on one of their giant-screen TV's on Sunday, the other will be playing the Super Bowl. Tickets are not required to take in the action at the HeartStop Lounge.
For ticket information for the rest of the 2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts draws, go to www.curling.ca/2018scotties/tickets/.

The U.S. official said Trump was specifically briefed not to raise the issue and told it wouldn't play well, but the first thing the president said at the dinner was, "My staff told me not to say this." Trump then went around asking each leader whether they were sure they didn't want a military solution, according to the official, who added that each leader told Trump in clear terms they were sure.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury's top economic diplomat, David Malpass, on Friday accused China of enabling poor governance in Venezuela by propping up the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro through murky oil-for-loan investments.
In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Malpass said China's focus on commodities and opaque financing deals had hurt, not helped, countries in the region.
His attack on China's role in aiding the Venezuelan government came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ahead of a five-day tour of Latin America, raised the prospect of a Venezuelan military coup.
The Trump administration has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela's government for rights abuses and corruption. Maduro has accused Washington of seeking to oust him to improve access to the OPEC nation's oil wealth.
Malpass, Treasury's under secretary for international affairs, said Venezuela's economic crisis and lack of democratic rule were among the “biggest disappointments and disasters” of the region. Washington and the opposition blame Maduro's policies.
“Most of the blame for Venezuela's economic collapse and humanitarian disaster falls squarely on Venezuela's rulers, but China has been by far Venezuela's largest lender supporting poor governance,” Malpass said.
He said the international community and Venezuela's people would ultimately be left with rebuilding the country once democracy was restored.
“China denominated many of its loans to Venezuela in barrels of oil,” said Malpass. “This has the effects of masking the exact amount of payments that China made to Venezuelan officials and that Venezuelans are expected to make to China in the future,” he added.
Cooperation between China and the region was based on common interests and mutual needs, the Xhinhua state news agency said quoting the Chinese foreign ministry, and investments are in line with local laws.
“China is a major international buyer of Latin American bulk commodities, and imports more and more agricultural and high value-added products from the region,” Xhinhua reported, quoting spokesperson Hua Chunying.
China has said it is confident in Venezuela's ability to properly handle its debts. Venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from Russia and China, primarily through oil-for-loan deals that have crimped the country's hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.
Since 2007 China has loaned more than $50 billion to Venezuela through an oil-for-loans arrangement that helped Caracas reduce reliance on U.S. energy markets. But the flow of funds from Beijing has slowed since 2014, when abundant crude oil led to a crash in oil markets and made China less interested in maintaining its alliance with Venezuela.
Malpass also expressed concern at a decision by the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank, the biggest lender to the region, to hold its 2019 annual meeting in China, saying the gathering should be held in the Americas.
“The Bank's 60th anniversary is an important milestone to celebrate the Bank's accomplishments ... and it would be fitting to hold the meeting in the hemisphere among major donors and borrowers,” Malpass said.
The IADB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Malpass criticism.
This week's Big Question: What are your earliest memories of Jaromir Jagr?
Eric Lindros, C, retired: "I'm thinking back to world juniors when I was 16, it was 1989, our Canadian team went to watch the Czechs play one day, everyone had eyes on Jagr. As soon as he got on the ice, nobody is watching anything else. Our world junior team was glued to watching him on every shift. Just everything about him, it's like he did everything without leaving a footprint. I just remember that, our whole team just mesmerized by him."
David Pastrnak, RW, Boston Bruins: "It was a couple of days after he was traded to Florida, so [David] Krejci asked me if I wanted to meet Jagr. He was staying at the same hotel, so we met up in the yard by the pool, [he's] just chilling there, and that's when I met him for the first time. Obviously, he's a legend for us [Czechs]. I didn't say much. I was just listening to him. He's a funny guy. It's unbelievable [he's still playing]. It's his life, and he loves hockey. You can't do well in hockey if you don't love it, and he loves it a lot, and that's a big thing that sticks out for me."
Jeff O'Neill, C, retired/analyst: "My first Jagr memory was that playoff goal he scored against Chicago when he deked everybody out. That's when you're like, 'Wow, this guy is a special talent.' Then when I went to Hartford as a rookie, Paul Maurice took over as coach after 7-8 games, and he put me with Brendan Shanahan and Nelson Emerson, and whenever we played Pittsburgh, we got the Lemieux-Jagr matchup -- and it was hell. I knew that Shanny and Emerson hated me because we never touched the puck the whole game. They were playing shinny hockey with us. ... But you know, it still boggles my mind that I've been retired 10 years, and Jagr is still playing."
Roman Polak, D, Toronto Maple Leafs: "I just remember in early years he was taller than everybody else. He was big. He had that big ass out there and protected the puck, he was strong, he could skate, just a great player overall. Long stick, long reach, long hair. ... He was big in Czech. Everybody still talks about Jagr in Czech. He's still big. If he tried to be president of the country, he would be. Everybody just loves him. At age 40, he found out there's a Facebook out there, and he's done a pretty good job on the Facebook, too [laughs]."
Ray Ferraro, C, retired/analyst: "My first recollection is of him at the [1990] draft with this really long hair and that awkward Penguins hat on. Playing against him was instantly impossible -- he was too big and had too big a reach, plus an amazing skill set. I always felt he was such a great passer that is overshadowed by his scoring ability, and then all of a sudden he was among the best scorers every year."
Alex Pietrangelo, D, St. Louis Blues: "When he was in Pittsburgh, that was a bit before me, but Washington and the Rangers, that's when I remember him playing. It blows my mind. I'm 27. What is he, 44 [now 45]? I don't think I'll be able to walk when I'm 44. The way that guy still goes, it's unbelievable. It really is impressive the way he can continue to play. The best part about it is that he's playing at a level still that not many people can play at. He continues to impress. ... That's just great for the game."
Bill Guerin, RW, assistant GM, Pittsburgh Penguins: "I first met Jagr at the World Junior Championships in Finland. It was his draft year coming up, I think. Social media wasn't around, the internet wasn't around, so you couldn't brush up on guys. And just seeing this kid on the Czech team. Bobby Holik had been taken 10th overall, so he was the big guy on the team, and then you saw this Jagr kid, and you were, 'Who the hell is that?' And then you see him getting drafted pretty high, and then just from there you go, 'Oh, that's the kid from the World Juniors', and then he just kept going. I think it's amazing what he's doing. I love it. One of the reasons I love what he's doing is he just loves the game. He doesn't need the money. He doesn't need the points. He just loves the game."
Brendan Shanahan, LW, Toronto Maple Leafs president: "I just think it's interesting how he came back with such an appreciation for the NHL and the game. I think going away for a couple of years resparked the love for the game and an appreciation for the NHL. He just seems to be having so much more fun with it than he was before he left. ... When you play a long time in the NHL, there's a point in your career where you're like, 'I've seen this all before.' He stepped away from the NHL, but what makes him so unique is that he was so talented, he was able to come back. Not that he was retired overseas, but I think it was good for his body, good for his mind, and he's just like a kid again."

Tuukka Rask, G, Boston Bruins: "I played against him in the Czech Republic during the lockout. It's amazing that he still finds it fun to play the game, because it's a grinding game, and the season is long, you travel a lot, so to do that for over 25 years is very respectable. He still seems to be having fun, so who knows how long he'll keep playing."
Matt Cullen, C, Pittsburgh Penguins: "I remember playing with him with the Rangers, and the thing that stood out to me the most was how hard he worked on his game. I didn't know a whole lot about him other than that he was a pretty unique talent and just an unbelievable combination of size and skill. I was always just really impressed with the way that he was at the rink before I ever got there -- and I'm usually one of the first guys -- and he was always there and often doing something, whether it was in the pool working on his hands or out on the ice. I was just really impressed with his commitment to his game and improving his game. You don't see that sort of dedication in a guy, especially as it gets later in his career, and a guy who's been at the top for so long, so it was pretty impressive to see that. So that was something that always struck me and something that always impressed. He would be in the pool up to here [points to chest] and he would just have his stick with maybe weights on it and he would stickhandle underwater, just to have some resistance. I didn't ask a whole ton of questions because some of it was just, 'Holy cow.' He was committed. He was a hard worker."
Trevor Daley, D, Pittsburgh Penguins: "The mullet. The hair, of course. The hair, his number, the swagger he had about him. Just as a young kid growing up watching the Pittsburgh Penguins, every time you got to see Jaromir Jagr, he was just different than anyone else. Obviously, I had the chance to be around him and spend some time with him [while with the Dallas Stars]. He's so dedicated to his craft and what he does. You pick that up right away about him. You look at his age and what he's doing today, it's all because of how much he enjoys the game, how much he loves the game and then the work that he puts into the game is why he's still playing. In Dallas, he lived right next to the practice rink, and after games he would go back to the practice rink, open it up and make the Zamboni driver pass him pucks. Nothing really surprises me with that guy. He's just a guy that really loves the game, and it doesn't surprise me he's still playing."
Michael Frolik, RW, Calgary Flames: "He's from the same hometown [as] me, so I kind of meet him in the summer sometimes. But the first time, I was pretty young. I think when I was 6 years old, he came to skate with us and be on the ice with us. I remember it was pretty cool. We're not buddies or anything like that. I think he doesn't have many friends in hockey, I think he kind of separates from hockey a little bit [with his] friends. I have the big respect for him, and it's cool to have a chance to play with him on the national team and at Olympics, so it was pretty cool to see what he does off the ice and in the room."
Jay Bouwmeester, D, St. Louis Blues: "He was old when I came into the league and he's still going. He'll probably be still playing when I'm done, too. But he was a guy that was a lot bigger than you ever thought he was. Just big and wide body, stick his butt out in your face and when you're a 19-year-old defenseman like I was, there's not a whole lot you can do about that. And he's still doing it. His talent level, and what he's doing even now ... that's crazy. He's got some good genes, for sure, for his body to hang in there."
David Backes, C, Boston Bruins: "I don't know if I've had many face-to-face conversations with him, but [my first memory is] NHL '94 on Super Nintendo as a 10-year-old. I did pretty darn good. The Penguins were dynamite in that game, and if you went across the crease as Jagr on your backhand, you scored every time. He's still doing that."

Recent social media posts pertaining to human trafficking in Midland have been investigated and found to be untrue, Midland Police report.
The posts, which popped up Monday on Facebook, were first investigated by police at the end of last year, Midland Police Lt. Mike Sokol said.
“We investigated it and found that the story was false,” he said.
The story began circulating again Monday. It states a young girl was restrained by two women in a bathroom at the NCG Cinema in Midland, and was found when her mother checked on her because she was taking too long. The women were never found but the post states they gave the child heroin and were believed to be trying to subdue her as part of a sex trafficking ring.
Sokol said Internet searches yield similar false narratives from all over the state and nation.
Midland Police also posted a screen shot of the false story on the department's Facebook page to warn residents the story is not true.
PLUMES of black smoke are billowing across Sydney's CBD from a large fire on Macquarie Street.
It is understood a cafe caught alight and dozens of people have taken to social media to post images of the fire - which appears to be spreading up scaffolding on a high-rise building at the busy street.
Twelve fire trucks with 75 firefighters are on the scene. Macquarie Street is now closed commuters should expect significant delays.

A Fire and Rescue NSW spokesman said the fire is now "under control" and 20 people have been safely evacuated from the building. However, he said operations to battle the blaze are still ongoing.
The building, which is opposite the State Parliament and covered by scaffolding and safety mesh, is understood to house barristers chambers.

NSW Police said there have been no reported injuries but peak-hour commuters should expect delays.
"Emergency services are responding to a fire at a construction site on Macquarie Street at Sydney," a spokeswoman tweeted. "There have been no reported injuries. Diversions are in place."
A spokesman for Fire and Rescue NSW tweeted: "Crews are fighting a scaffolding fire on Maquarie St, no injuries reported, operations are ongoing."
"It looked like it started around level six and it's gone all the way to the top," one witness told the Daily Telegraph.
"Now it's melted down the building and stripped everything else below it.

Another witness, Ignatius Corboy, told the Today show emergency services are using an extended scaffolding device to battle the remainder of the blaze.
"It is halfway up the building, seems to be a little bit still going," he told the show. "It is all under control now, but it is certainly extensive damage on the side of the building and the scaffolding seems to be ruined as well.
He added that there was a massive emergency presence and a huge crowd of onlookers while the fire was growing, but emergency services quickly cleared the area.
"They have done a fantastic job of clearing the scene and getting it under control," he added. Witnesses say the exclusion zone starts right at the start of Macquarie Street down all the way down to the Woolloomooloo turn-off.
Another witness told 2GB he initially tried to put the fire out.
"I saw a small fire that had started on the scaffold," the witness, named Shane, told the station.
"It didn't look that big at the time, so I basically was just sitting above the awning level, so I grabbed the fire extinguisher and went up inside the staircase of the scaffold and tried to sort of attack the fire.
"But quite quickly it just got out of control and I very quickly got out of there."
It is understood the fire broke out around 7.45am and two people were trapped at the top but they have since been rescued.
Witnesses say that, within five minutes of the fire starting, the whole building was ablaze. One witness told 9 News it appeared to be started by an electrical spark, which ignited plastic mesh on a part of the construction site.
The building at 233 Macquarie St is behind the Supreme Court of NSW buildings. Macquarie St between Prince Alfred Rd and Hunter St is closed in both directions.
Two ambulance crews were on standby, a NSW Ambulance spokesman said, but there were no reported injuries.
Fire investigators tracked the cause of February's blaze to one of the construction workers' oxyacetylene blowtorches, according to a Fire and Rescue NSW spokesman.
The fire comes three months after another major building blaze in the CBD which brought the city to standstill and forced the evacuation of thousands of workers as gas bottles exploded.

Seb Larsson has reiterated that he will weigh up his options this summer after being linked with a move to Turkey.
The Swedish midfielder is out of contract at the end of the month after his Sunderland deal expired.
The Black Cats are understood to have made the player a new offer, despite being managerless, but Turkish outfit Trabzonspor have also been linked with a move for the free agent.
The 32-year-old has been on international duty with Sweden, but says he will speak to his representative during the next few days to see what his next move is.
Asked about Trabzonspor's interest, he said: “I've read about it, but I'll wait and see what my agent says.
“We will look at all the bids.
“Personally, I feel no stress about my decision. I'll weigh everything up – it feels absolutely important.”
I read about it in the newspaper. I have not had any contact with the club during the international break – that was how I wanted it.
“The idea is that my agent would have worked on it.
“We'll see you later in the week – then we will see what options are available.”
Larsson has spent six years at Sunderland after joining on a free transfer from Birmingham City.
He played almost 200 times, scoring 12 goals, but it seems his time on Wearside is likely to end now.
Larsson's agent, Per Jonsson, confirmed there had been contact from a Turkish side, while it is understood the former Arsenal man has offers from China and his homeland.
“I can confirm there is interest from Turkey and several other leagues for Sebastian Larsson,” said Jonsson. “Sebastian and I will sit down after the international matches and discuss the different options.”
Skipper John O'Shea is also weighing up his options after his contract expired.
In order to drive traffic to your website you must engage in the practice of search engine optimization, also referred to as SEO. The ultimate goal of search engine optimization is to get a specific website to appear in the first few pages of a search engine result. It is search engines that generate the most search engine traffic.
If you operate a WordPress blog, the best way to handle SEO is to grab one of the server's many plug-in options. Instead of looking around and reading articles, you can handle everything on-site. A lot of the difficult steps of the past have been automated on a site like WordPress, so tinkering with the site a little bit, can turn you into an SEO aficionado.
Always check your keyword density when working towards search engine optimization goals. 3-5 percent should be the total of links or text on a page. Spread the information on your whole site, not just on your homepage. Every page needs keywords for search engines to recognize content.
When optimizing your website, be sure to optimize your description meta tag as well. Some experts believe that keyword meta tags are nearly worthless today, as search engines no longer use them, but that descriptions will usually show up under your page title on the results page, and they are also involved in the indexing process.
The future development strategy for all companies with a web site should include a strategy for search engine optimization, getting more traffic to their site. One key point is to be aware of the use of appropriate key words. Appropriate key words should be placed strategically throughout your site, the title tag and page header are generally the most important spots for keywords, be careful with your choices.
In order for search engine robots to crawl your website easily it is important that you use flash sparingly. Do not use it when making menus or for adding text. The best way to use flash is for videos, sound and animation. While search engines can index flash, it is not done very efficiently and this is a lost opportunity for you. The easier the robots can crawl your site, the better the result will be.
Learning about social media marketing and utilizing the different platforms available really helps you with search engine optimization. There are many more social networking sites besides Twitter and Facebook. Some of the sites will even allow you to cater to a certain group. It's a good idea to join up for each one that has anything to do with your particular product or service in order to help increase your SEO.
Adopt SEO style when writing. This means repeating original keywords and related one, but not in a rigid way. You can use alternative keywords or slightly change your original keywords. Make sure to include enough reference so that your content is categorized as relevant to the keywords you want it to be associated with.
As much as possible, stay away from frames in your website. Search engines can't index framed pages. The best that they will be able to do is to index your home page. This means that, if the majority of your site uses frames, then the majority of your site will not be indexed.
A great way to increase your search engine optimization is to link other peoples content to yours and having your content linked by others. This networking strategy is excellent for promoting your site allowing other sites to do your work for you. This is a sure fire way to increase the hits on your pages.
Search engines like Google and Yahoo are constantly evolving in terms of how they find information on the web. Consequently, you will have to change your pages to correspond with the changes that are occurring in the search technology if you want to stay on the cutting edge of Search Engine Optimization.
A great program to implement in your search engine optimization is the Yahoo! Buzz Index. This tool, as its name suggests, allows you to view how popular or relevant your keywords and keyword phrases are at any given moment in time. This is great for selecting keywords you know people will search for, increasing the traffic for your page.
Applying these tactics above will certainly help your website to be found. It's important to remember, a website that is not focusing on SEO, will ultimately collapse and fall to the back pages. You can avoid this fate by using these tips so get started today so that you can improve your rankings.
A central Iowa man who's wanted in the weekend murder of his girlfriend was arrested near the U.S.-Canadian border.
Police in the Des Moines suburb of Johnston got multiple 911 calls on Saturday night of shots fired at the Providence Pointe apartment complex. When officers arrived, they found 34-year-old Agnes Yarlee who died at the scene within minutes.
Investigators put out a description of the man and his vehicle saying he was a person of interest in the case. Sunday night, 38-year-old Abraham Roberts, also of Johnston, was arrested in International Falls, Minnesota, about a mile from the Canadian border.
Roberts is being held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection until he can be extradited back to Iowa.

Claude Julien (Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports)
The Montreal Canadiens relieved Michel Therrien of his head coaching duties and replaced him with former Boston Bruins bench boss Claude Julien on Tuesday. This marks the second time in franchise history the Habs have removed Therrien and brought in Julien.
The move comes just one week after the Bruins fired Julien, who was in his 10th season with the organization and was removed amidst concerns the team could miss the playoffs for a third straight season.
Therrien, 53, previously served as the Habs head coach from 2000-01 to just past the midpoint of the 2002-03 season when Julien was hired. Julien held the position with the Canadiens until the 2005-06 season when he was fired. Julien went on to lead the New Jersey Devils during the 2006-07 season before he landed with the Bruins where he'd been ever since and helped lead them to the Stanley Cup in 2011 — the team's first in 39 years .
In 159 games as head coach with the Habs during his first stint, Julien posted a 72-62-10-15 record (53.1 percent). Julien, 56, has been heralded throughout the NHL for his work with the Bruins, where he went 419-426-94 (61.4 percent) and helped them to seven-straight playoff berths from 2007-08 t0 2013-14, including a 53-win season in 2008-09 that helped to earn him the Jack Adams Trophy as the league's best coach.
The Bruins also earned a trip to the Stanley Cup Final in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season before falling to the Chicago Blackhawks in six games.
While the Bruins have had much success under Julien, they posted a combined 83 wins over the past two seasons, missing the playoffs both years, and were just 26-23-6 through 55 games at the time he was replaced and teetering on the border of being a playoff team in the Eastern Conference.
Therrien and Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin have come under fire of late, as the team has posted just one win in seven games in the month of February and seen their commanding position as first place in the Atlantic Division begin to wither away. The Canadiens (31-19-8, 70 points) now lead the Ottawa Senators by just six points after holding a commanding lead through much of the early part of the season, thanks to winning 13 of their first 15 contests to open 2016-17.
With the Canadiens primed for what could be a deep playoff run, many are wondering what moves Bergevin will make to help push them over the hump as the NHL approaches the March 1 trade deadline and closes out the latter part of the regular season. Bergevin's only major roster move so far was on Jan. 26 when he traded for defenseman Nikita Nesterov from the Tampa Bay Lightning, but many expect that to be just a start.
Therrien's last game as head coach of the Canadiens came, ironically, against the Bruins in a 4-0 loss on Feb. 12. He was in his fifth season with the Habs in his second go-around with the franchise, and lead them to a 194-121-37 record, including Atlantic Division titles in 2013 and 2015 and a trip to the Eastern Conference Final in 2014.
His combined 271 wins during nearly eight seasons overall with the Canadiens are fourth all-time in team history behind only Toe Blake, Dick Irvin and Scotty Bowman.
“I would like to sincerely thank Michel for his relentless work with the Montreal Canadiens over his eight seasons behind the bench, including the last five seasons when we worked together. The decision to remove Michel from his coaching duties was a difficult one because I have lots of respect for him,” Bergevin said, in a press release from the Canadiens on Tuesday.
“I came to the conclusion that our team needed a new energy, a new voice, a new direction. Claude Julien is an experienced and well respected coach with a good knowledge of the Montreal market. Claude has been very successful as an NHL coach and he won the Stanley Cup. Today we hired the best available coach, and one of the league's best. I am convinced that he has the capabilities to get our team back on the winning track.”
The Canadiens are on their bye week and return to action against when they host the Winnipeg Jets on Feb. 18.

HOUSTON (AP)  Former President George H.W. Bush has been hospitalized in Houston with an infection, just after attending the funeral of his wife, Barbara, a spokesman said.
Jim McGrath said Monday on Twitter that the 93-year-old Bush is responding to treatments and appears to be recovering. He was admitted Sunday morning to Houston Methodist Hospital after an infection spread to his blood, McGrath said.
Barbara Bush was laid to rest Saturday in a ceremony attended by her husband and former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and their wives, along with current first lady Melania Trump. Mrs. Bush was 92, and she and her husband had been married 73 years  the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history.
George H.W. Bush uses a wheelchair and an electric scooter for mobility after developing a form of Parkinsons disease, and he has needed hospital treatment several times in recent years for respiratory problems.

He attended the funeral wearing a pair of knitted socks decorated in blue, red and yellow books  a tribute to his late wifes work promoting literacy.
McGrath wouldnt elaborate Monday night on the specifics of Bushs condition, saying additional updates would be issued as events warrant. But he said the 41st president was eager to get well so he can get to his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
Hes the most goal-oriented person on this planet, McGrath said.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush indicated during his eulogy Saturday that his father had been hospitalized recently at the same time Barbara Bush was in the hospital for the last time. Those hospitalizations were not publicly disclosed at the time.
I think Dad got sick on purpose so that he could be with her, Jeb Bush said.
First lady Melania Trump tweeted Monday evening that she was sending healing thoughts of strength, along with prayers, for President George HW Bush tonight.
On Friday, during the public viewing of Barbara Bushs casket, George H.W. Bush offered his hand to many of the around 2,500 people who walked through the church to pay their respects. (Continued below.)

A year ago this month, he spent two weeks in the hospital for treatment of pneumonia and chronic bronchitis, a constant irritation of the lining of tubes that carry air to ones lungs. His doctors said chronic bronchitis is a condition more prevalent with age and can aggravate the symptoms of pneumonia.
The elder Bush was hospitalized for 16 days in January 2017 for pneumonia. During that hospital stay, which included time in intensive care, doctors inserted a breathing tube and connected him to a ventilator.
He also was hospitalized in 2015 in Maine after falling at home and breaking a bone in his neck, and in December 2014 for about a week for shortness of breath. He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues.
People in their 90s with Parkinsons disease are often at higher risk of pneumonia and other infections because their swallowing process can be compromised, said Dr. David Reuben, professor of geriatric medicine at the UCLA medical school in Los Angeles.
And the stress of losing a loved one can weaken the immune system, he said.
Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, he said, while viral infections require other treatments. Infections that spread to the blood usually are not viral, however, he said.
The prognosis for such a case would depend on a number of factors, including heart rate, blood pressure and oxygenation, Reuben said.
The more of these parameters are abnormal, the more serious the case is, he said.
George Herbert Walker Bush served as president from 1989 to 1993. Born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, Bush also served as a congressman, CIA director and Ronald Reagans vice president.
Associated Press reporter Terry Wallace contributed to this story from Dallas.
(Reuters) - Apple Inc's hint of returning a ton of cash to shareholders was not enough to move investors who worried more about the iPhone maker's weak outlook amid reports of production cuts for its flagship iPhone X.
Apple shares were down about 1.4 percent at $165.42 in early trade on Friday.
The iPhone X was the first phone to get a major design overhaul since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015, and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales.
On Thursday, the Cupertino-based tech giant said it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street expected, and sees revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion and gross margins of between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for its fiscal second quarter ending in March.
Analysts were expecting $65.7 billion in sales and a gross margin of 38.9 percent for the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Analysts at Longbow Research said the revenue guidance implied a low 50 million iPhone shipment forecasts against a consensus of 58.5 million.
“We now forecast 221 million iPhone shipments for fiscal 2018, versus the prior 235 million consensus.”
On Thursday, Apple also said it was planning, over time, to “target a capital structure that is approximately net neutral,” adding that it will “take that balance down from $163 billion to zero,” referring to Apple's level of cash net of debt.
The comments sent its shares up about 3 percent Thursday after the bell.
”iPhone sell-through appears to have declined in the December quarter, which, along with weaker-than-expected
second quarter revenue guidance, reinforces our view of a saturated market,” KeyBanc analysts said in a note, cutting the rating on the stock to ”sector weight” from ”overweight.”“Further, gross margin results and guidance both missed our expectations, which reduces our view of potential profit growth going forward.”
Of 39 analysts who cover the stock, 29 rate it ‘buy' or higher. However, the mixed results triggered varied responses from analysts. At least three brokerages raised their target price on the company's stock largely banking on the possibility of cash returns, while three cut price targets.
“(Apple‘s) cash return should support the stock, but we see little to drive upside,” KeyBanc analysts said.
The Rezvani Tank arrives just in time for the Terminator comeback
What you're drooling at right now is Rezvani Motors' first SUV. Simply dubbed as the Tank, this beast strays away from the successful recipe the company is known for, and could be easily considered an extreme utility vehicle, packing angular lines, small, military-like windows, auxiliary lights, and chunky tires. Feeling scared yet?
The Terminator would not sink to that kind of feelings; better yet, Arnold would drive the hell out of this thing, and he should probably do that in the upcoming Terminator movie. On the inside, however, a cool five-seat layout, with exquisite leather seats, an infotainment system and a single-zone climate control, is way more than an Apocalypse-fighting android will ever need.
Did we mention the suicide doors? Those might come in handy as well.
Hiding in the engine bay is a massive 6.4-liter V8, capable of developing 500 ponies, and sending all its power through the on-demand four-wheel drive system. I'm sorry to say that Rezvani refused to share any technical specs or performance figures for now, but the Tank will most likely be fast and handle its business easily.
Furthermore, the Rezvani Tank may also feature thermal night vision systems as well as ballistic armor protection – now that's something the Terminator would definitely appreciate. However, considering the $178,000 starting price on this beast, it's going to be extremely hard to get your hands on one of these outrageous vehicles.

I really enjoy delivering photography courses.
I get to meet enthusiastic people, eager to learn everything they can about using their camera. It's as rewarding for me as the participants when they discover and apply techniques that were once a mystery.
Learning the technical aspects seems to be most people's priority; knowing how to balance the exposure between aperture value, shutter time and ISO, plus controlling movement and depth of field. They are valuable skills.
However, the most important part is the one looking through the viewfinder. That makes the biggest difference. An eye for a tremendous shot comes easily to some, but it is a skill that most people learn.
Composition is complex. There is much more to it than controlling exposure. It can make or break a photo. Fortunately, simple techniques can transform your images.
One of the easiest changes is moving objects away from the centre of the frame.
Look through your viewfinder. Now overlay the frame with an imaginary noughts and crosses board, dividing it into thirds. Move your main subject away from the middle, placing it on the crossing point of those thirds. If you are shooting a landscape and your picture has a horizon, place that on one on the horizontal thirds.
That technique is known as the ‘Rule of Thirds', but, I prefer to use ‘Guideline of Thirds' as rules can make photos formulaic and boring. In some photos, such as those including reflections, dividing the image symmetrically can work instead, but, the guideline is a good starting point.
Another simple practice is using leading lines. Also called lead-in lines, these are the features that lead the viewer's eye into a frame. A classic example is the shot along a jetty or pier. A path, receding fence or a line of seaweed can also work. The technique goes beyond landscapes; looking up along a tree trunk to the leaf canopy, and the line of an arm leading up to the face in a portrait.
Study a photo and note where your eye starts, where it ends up and what route it takes in between. Does it follow a clean line through the frame, or, does it dot all over the image with no clear focus?
This is the challenge for February. Remembering to also consider depth of field, take photos that comply with, or deliberately break, the Guideline of Thirds. Also include leading lines.
Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your images in Northumberland Camera Club at http://bit.ly/PicNland

Azerbaijani MP in PACE: Time to give assessment to actions of Armenian authorities
2018-04-24 19:03 | www.trend.az | 1
Baku, Azerbaijan, April 24
By Ali Gasimov - Trend:
Azerbaijan is a neighboring country with Armenia, so it cares about the situation in Armenia, member of the Azerbaijani delegation to PACE Sevinj Fataliyeva said during the PACE spring session.
She added that unfortunately due to the short-sighted policy of the Armenian authorities, the country not only found itself in regional isolation and in difficult socio-economic conditions, but also on the verge of a civil war.
Fataliyeva noted that today eyes of many people are bent on Yerevan. "But who knows what is happening in the Armenian provinces? Armenian human rights activists are actively sharing information on social networks, reporting numerous detentions and arrests."
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump “would be inclined” to permit the release of a memo written by Democrats that rebuts a Republican document alleging anti-Trump bias at the FBI, if it passes a security and legal review, a White House spokesman told CNN on Friday.
“I think the president would be inclined to release the Democratic memo should it come to us and should it be reviewed and gone through the same process and if national security and legal equities review it and say it doesn't challenge sources and methods, the information in it” is accurate, White House spokesman Raj Shah told the network.

All-time top scorers
Brazil became the all-time leading goal scorers at the World Cup in Monday's 2-0 win over Mexico. Neymar's breakthrough goal early in the second half moved Brazil onto 227 goals, one more than Germany, who had held the record with 226. Roberto Firmino then added a late goal to put Brazil at 228 World Cup goals -- two clear of the Germans, who will not be able to add to their tally for another four years after failing to make it out of the group stage for the first time in their history. Brazil and Germany's goal tallies are far and away from the rest of the field, as Argentina are third with 137. Italy (128) and France (113) are the only other teams with more than a century of World Cup goals, while Spain are stuck on 99 after losing to Russia on Sunday.
Brazil ‘firm' favourites
Brazil firmed up to 3-1 favourites to win the World Cup for the sixth time after goals from Neymar and Roberto Firmino secured a 2-0 win over Mexico and a place in the quarter-finals on Monday. France, 4-3 winners over Argentina on Saturday, remained 7-2 chances ahead of Belgium, who came in to 5-1 after rallying from two goals down to beat Japan 3-2 on Monday and set up a last eight contests against the Brazilians in Kazan. England, who play their last 16 match against Colombia on Tuesday, were back out to 6-1 along with Croatia, who needed penalties to get past Denmark on Sunday. Hosts Russia, who face the Croats in the quarter-finals, remain long shots at 20-1 despite beating former world champions Spain on penalties in the last 16.
When babies stop play
It's a decision most of us are unlikely to ever have to make: be at the birth of your child or represent your country on a world stage as they (potentially) make sporting history? England's Fabian Delph has gone with the former and left the World Cup in Russia to join his wife Natalie, who was due to give birth on 30 June. His decision has been supported by England manager Gareth Southgate who said "some things in life are more important than football". "Everybody says you only get one chance to be in a World Cup, but also there's only one day in your life when your children are born," he said. But Delph may be in the market for a return flight to Russia as Southgate added that the midfielder was "buying his wife curries and all sorts of things to try and aid the speed of process".
Perhaps the luckiest sport stars are the ones who have narrowly escaped actually having to make the decision.
Dream win for viral video boy
A Scottish dad scooped tickets to the World Cup final after a video of his young son being consoled by rival fans went viral. Iain Meiklejohn, from Edinburgh, took six-year-old Aleks to Russia to support his mum's native Poland. Aleks was devastated when the team were eliminated in the group stages but nearby fans of the winning Colombia side were filmed offering support. Their video won the hearts of Fifa who offered them a pair of dream tickets. It is a complete change in fortune for the family who were scammed when they tried to get tickets for the World Cup final in Rio four years ago. Mr Meiklejohn told BBC Radio Scotland: "The whole thing has just flipped 100%. It's just amazing, it's brilliant." Aleks was in tears when he saw Poland lose 3-0 to Colombia at the Kazan Arena.

A woman, who was inside the trailer where a double homicide occurred on Fred Nash Lane early last Wednesday morning, apparently hid in a closet while the two victims were shot to death.
KANO - One person was seriously injured when a suicide bomber aged around 10 blew herself up in a New Year's Eve attack in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri, witnesses and aid workers told AFP Sunday.
The girl approached a crowd buying noodles from a food vendor in the Customs area of the city around 9:30 pm on Saturday and detonated her explosives, they said.
Although no one has claimed responsibility the attack bore the hallmark of Boko Haram Islamists who are notorious for using suicide bombers, mostly women and young girls, in attacking civilian targets.
"The girl walked towards the crowd but she blew up before she could reach her target," said witness Grema Usman who lives in the area.
"She died instantly, while one person was seriously hurt after after he was hit by shrapnel."
"(Judging) from her corpse the girl was around 10 years old," Usman said.
An aid worker involved in the evacuation of the body gave a similar estimate of the bomber's age.
"The girl was clearly not more than 10 and this could have made her too nervous, making her to detonate the explosives prematurely," the aid worker suggested.
Borno state police spokesman Victor Isuku, meanwhile, said a second female suicide bomber was caught and lynched by an angry mob. Her bomb was safely detonated by security forces, he said.
In December two girls aged between seven and eight detonated explosives in suicide attacks on market in the city, injuring 19 people.
Authorities blamed the attack on Boko Haram, whose seven-year insurgency has killed 20,000 people and displaced 2.6 million others. The conflict has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbours.
Saturday's attack came a week after Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said the jihadist group had been routed from Sambisa forest, its last stronghold in Borno state.
Jerod Haase talks to Menlo Park Kiwanis about what's ahead for Stanford men's basketball
Stanford men's basketball coach Jerod Haase wanted to play for Stanford while growing up in South Lake Tahoe, but attended the University of California before transferring to the University of Kansas, playing for coach Roy Williams.
Jerod highlighted Stanford's upcoming men's basketball season for the audience at the Menlo Park Kiwanis Club's luncheon earlier this month, eventually yielding to questions from the audience, some of which are excerpted here.
Are you glad to be at Stanford?
Since I wanted to play ball at Stanford many years ago, I'm very happy to be here and to start another era of Stanford basketball. Stanford University is a world-class institution which represents excellence across the board. My goal is to continue this tradition. We will compete for championships by doing it the right way and graduating young men who will go on to accomplish great things in the world.
What's the upcoming schedule look like?
All I can say is that it's tough! We will be playing North Carolina in Maples right before Thanksgiving. Then we travel to Portland to play Florida in a holiday tournament, and if we win, we could play Gonzaga, Duke, Ohio State, Texas or Butler. If we win this tournament, we'll be #1 for sure. After that we will play highly-ranked Kansas before we start the Pac 12 schedule.
What kinds of players will you have this year, and how are you preparing them for the upcoming year?
Here's the situation. We have just 13 scholarships to give. We lost three players from last year's team, but there are 9-10 returning players. We have four new players and one redshirt freshman. Currently there are also two walk-ons, who are a huge part of our success in practices. Right now, we can practice just 2 hours a day, but the players can work with our strength and conditioning coaches for up to 6 hours.
How do you overcome the academic requirements Stanford places on its student athletes?
It's not as difficult as you might think, because Stanford is one of the easiest places in the U.S. to recruit to. Stanford is a strong brand. The academic piece is a big plus for us, because when we call, people listen. In addition, it creates a sort of safety net, because our players don't transfer out. There are no “one and done” players here. In fact, in 102 years, only four players have transferred out, compared to 75 or so in the U.S. who transfer out every year. This makes player development key to our program, because we know our players will be at Stanford for three or four years.
What is your coaching philosophy?
First, I hope to be at Stanford for 25 or 30 years, so I take a long-term approach. I want to make sure that we develop more than just skills in our players. I hope to instill three core values in our players. I want them to be invested in our program. I'd like them to be tough competitors. I'd like them to be selfless. These are things that will serve us well. When I evaluate players, I look for those three qualities, too.
What's the hardest part of your job?
I love coaching, recruiting, and working with my staff, but the most stressful part of my job is game day. It's always been that way for me, but I've learned how to adjust to it.

Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar on Friday announced he has signed a contract with Lahore Qalandars to act as the team's mentor.
Akhtar, considered to be one of the fastest bowlers in cricket history, announced his decision at a press conference in Lahore.
“I'm honored and privileged to be a part of this. Extremely excited, thrilled!” he said.
Qalandars owner Fawad Naeem Rana while welcoming Akhtar said the former speedster was a valuable addition to the team.
Akhtar also expressed his desire to mentor Haris Rauf, a young talent who was selected by the Qalandars during their open trials progaramme.
"Haris is from Pindi. He is the find of Aqib Javed. Aqib knows a talent when he sees one," he said.
Dec 10 (Reuters) - Britain's Labour Party is considering moving some of Bank of England's functions to Birmingham, from its current home in Threadneedle Street in the City of London, according to an interim report on the British financial system released on Sunday.
Launched by the opposition Labour Party's finance policy chief John McDonnell, the report was led by consultants GFC Economics.
The report's main recommendations included establishing BoE offices in Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast, along with two smaller regional offices in Newcastle and Plymouth. It also called for locating Labour's National Investment Bank in Birmingham.
Britain's output from high-tech industries has fallen on average over the last 10 years, the report said, with only one other EU member performing more poorly.
Investment in manufacturing, information and communications technology and other critical sectors in Britain are lagging 28 billion pounds behind investment in real estate companies, the report added.
Commenting on the report, Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said, “This important report drums home the message that our financial system isn't delivering enough investment across the whole country, and in the high-technology industries and firms of the future where it is needed most”.
The report said that the proposed recommendations will be considered for inclusion in the next Labour manifesto.
Thousands of smiling, cheering football fans turned out for the biggest party Clemson coach Dabo Swinney has thrown yet at Death Valley to celebrate the school's first national championship in 35 years.
Gov. Nikki Haley issued a proclamation naming Saturday "Clemson Tigers National Football Championship Day."
Last year, more than 30,000 people showed up for Swinney's pizza party when Clemson was picked for its first College Football Playoff berth after the 2015 season. The gathering Saturday was expected to top that, with more than 50,000 fans expected along the parade route through town and into Memorial Stadium.
Gates at Memorial Stadium opened at 7 a.m., and fans in the stadium watched the parade from inside the stadium on the video boards.
The in-stadium celebration began at 10:30 a.m.
Clemson won the title with a 35-31 victory over defending national champ Alabama last Monday night. Deshaun Watson connected with Hunter Renfrow on a 2-yard TD pass with one second left.
Clemson last won the National Championship in 1981.

ISLAMABAD - Anti Narcotics Force Tuesday informed the National Assembly panel that a survey conducted in 2012 had revealed that 6.7 million people, approximately six per cent of the population, had been using drugs in Pakistan.
A survey jointly conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Division says that these 6.7 million people used any controlled substance, including misuse of prescription drugs in 2012, Director ANF Brigadier Muhammad Basharat told the NA Standing Committee on Interior. The committee met in the chair of MNA Syed Javed Ali Shah.
The report of the survey conducted in 2012 was later released in 2013 with the title "Drug Use in 2013". The report on "Drug use in Pakistan 2013" was the result of a collaborative research effort between Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and UNODC.
Director ANF giving reference to this survey informed the committee that 4 million people in the country are hashish users, 1.1 million opiate users, 0.8 million are regular heroin users as well as 0.3 million people used opium. He said that fresh drug users' survey would be conducted in the country after the national census exercise would end.
Secretary Narcotics Control Division Ijaz Ali Khan said that 90 per cent of the world's opium was being produced in Afghanistan and out of it, 40 to 45 per cent is transported through Pakistan. He said that Pakistan had been declared poppy-free cultivation country by UNODC.
Giving briefing to the participants about the use of drugs in educational institutions, Director ANF said that ANF, ICT Police and Punjab Rangers jointly conducted an operation in December last year against drug supplies to the students and staff at Quaid-e-Azam University. "11 raids were conducted during this operation at QAU, 14 accused were arrested while 0.420kg heroin, 1.165kg hashish, 0.009kg cocaine, 0.032 LSD and 10 tins of bears were confiscated from the university premises," says the working paper of ANF submitted to the committee. The ANF officer was of the view that the use of drugs in educational institutions had not increased too much as the media was over projecting the issue. He said that ANF was in close contact with the managements of educational institutions to check the supply of drugs. He said that media had created unnecessary hype on the issue.
However, the chairman committee and MNA Naeema Kishwer stressed that the use of drugs in the educational institutions had increased considerably and there was dire need to check supplies of drugs to these.
The committee earlier had taken notice of the increasing use of drugs to the educational institutions especially of elite class schools. While the Ministry of Interior had also directed the authorities concerned for launching an operation against drug suppliers and users at QAU. The committee took up five private members bills and deferred all till the final outcome from the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control and Ministry of Law and Justice.
During discussion over the Federal Witness Protection Bill, 2015 moved by MNA Ms Aisha Syed, a representative of law ministry told the committee that government sponsored Witness Protection Bill was under consideration and a draft of the bill had been presented before the law reforms committee. The law division said that consultations with the provinces were under way as if the witness would have to be relocated then consent of the province should necessarily be needed. The chair directed that the law division should study both the bills and come up with proposals in the next meeting.
While objecting over three proposed laws regarding cannibalism, necrophilia and grave robbery, Joint Secretary Ministry of Interior Anita Turab said that these offences could not be included through amendments in the existing law as all there are of different nature.
The committee was briefed about the PSDP (Public Sector Development Projects) for the year 2017-18 for the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control. The committee with majority of votes approved the PSDP projects of the Narcotics Control Division and deferred the PSDP projects pertaining to the Ministry of Interior till its next meeting expected to be held on February 21.
The Chargers' 48-17 thumping at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday night's preseason opener was compounded by a potentially significant injury to a key starter.
Middle linebacker Denzel Perryman hurt his left ankle in the first quarter and returned to the sidelines on crutches and in a walking boot. Perryman had an MRI test Monday. The team did not issue a medical update.
“I'm not sure how bad it is right now, we'll have to wait and see,” coach Anthony Lynn said after the game. “It could be serious, but I have no idea right now.”
The team already lost projected starting right guard Forrest Lamp for the season when the second-round pick out of Western Kentucky tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the first week of training camp.
First-round pick Mike Williams, the former Clemson wide receiver, will sit out training camp while recovering from a herniated disk in his lower back, an injury he suffered in May. There is no timetable for his return.
Perryman, 24, a second-round pick out of Miami in 2015, had 80 tackles, two sacks and one interception in 12 games, 11 of them starts, last season. He sat out four games because of hamstring and knee injuries. He had 95 tackles and two sacks in 14 games as a rookie in 2015.
Perryman's injury likely will push reserve middle linebacker Korey Toomer into the starting lineup. Toomer, who had four tackles Sunday night, appeared in 13 games, with eight starts, last season, recording 69 tackles and one sack.

The most impressive part about a game-opening, 13-play, 75-yard scoring drive in which Philip Rivers completed five of six passes for 56 yards Sunday was that the quarterback left the field after the 7-minute 15-second possession without one grass stain on his uniform.

“We kept Philip clean,” left guard Matt Slauson said. “He was getting the ball out fast. We ran the ball well. Everything was rolling. Communication was fast and clean. Nobody was really unsure.”
The play of a revamped line, which will feature at least three new starters, will be a key to the Chargers offense, which is strong at the skilled positions with Rivers, running back Melvin Gordon and a fleet of talented receivers and tight ends.
The first-team line shined, giving Rivers time to carve up Seattle's first-string defense. Included on the drive was a short pass on a crossing route to tight end Hunter Henry for 17 yards and Travis Benjamin's 15-yard catch between two defenders on a third-and-nine play.
A screen pass to Branden Oliver for 14 yards gave the Chargers a first and goal at the eight, and veteran tight end Antonio Gates boxed out a Seattle defender while catching his five-yard scoring pass.
“When you have a guy like Philip, a guy who understands the system, understands the game, he puts you in the best position possible,” Gates said. “That's what he was able to do. We were so efficient. Our whole thing is trying to be balanced, and we were able to do that.”
Reserve clause
The first-team defense kept Seattle out of the end zone on Seattle's first two possessions, with cornerback Casey Hayward providing tight coverage on Tanner McEvoy on the first drive and end Melvin Ingram stopping quarterback Trevone Boykin for no gain on the second drive.
But the second- and third-team defenders, as well as the offensive reserves, were badly outplayed by Seattle's subs.
“We're going to be a good team, but it's not just about the ones,” safety Tre Boston said. “Unfortunately in football, your ones will go down every so often, and we need twos and threes who are going to pick up the slack and help us.”
Mixed bag
Cardale Jones, who is competing with Kellen Clemens for the backup quarterback job, showed some promise, evading a heavy rush and passing to newly signed tight end Matt Weiser for 38 yards before halftime and scrambling for a 13-yard gain in the fourth quarter.
But Jones, acquired from Buffalo in the first week of camp, completed only two of nine passes for 50 yards and took an 11-yard sack.
“He's still learning our system,” Lynn said. “We threw him in the fire, and he did some good things, but he also did some bad things, things he needs to improve on — his accuracy, some reads, some protections.”

DUNMORE, Pa. — A Pennsylvania mother and father are charged with endangering the welfare of their two children after knowingly leaving them home alone for three days, investigators said.
Nicole Sciortino and Vincent Licciardello, both 30, were arraigned Monday morning, according to WNEP.
According to court papers, on Wednesday, March 7, Dunmore police responded to Sciortino's home on Monroe Avenue for a report of children who had been left alone for weeks. Licciardello lives at a different address.
When officers arrived, they found a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old home by themselves. Police say the place was in deplorable condition, with food, boxes, pills and other trash on the floor. The thermostat read 58 degrees.
After tracking down the mother of two, police say Sciortino first told them she wasn't far away but later admitted that she was in Florida. According to the document, she told investigators that the children's father, Licciardello, was watching the kids and that she didn't realize it was against the law to leave her two children home alone unsupervised for an extended period of time. Sciortino added that she “didn't think it was really that bad.”
During the investigation, police found that on Monday, March 5, Licciardello dropped the kids off early in the morning at their mother's home. Over the next three days, while their mother was in Florida, he would occasionally stop by to drop food off for the unsupervised children.
Authorities say they believe the children were alone during their mother's vacation, but not for weeks, as the 911 caller alleged. Police say one child has missed 16 days of school this year, while the other has missed 26 days.
“That hurts. I'm a mom of five kids. I couldn't imagine leaving my kids for 10 minutes without an adult supervisor,” said Tamra Murphy. “Who's feeding them, who's washing their clothes, who's making sure their homework is done? That upsets me beyond it. That hurts me.”
“That's insane to me,” said Kaylia Riley. “I mean, at the end of the day, I couldn't even leave my dogs for three days by themselves, let alone children, especially small children. It's just mind-blowing.”
Sciortino and Licciardello were both charged Monday with endangering the welfare of children. Both were given $10,000 unsecured bail, so both walked free.
Investigators said the two children are staying with family friends.

When you see Blade Runner 2049, one of the things that really stands out is that the film is masterfully crafted from top to bottom. Director Denis Villeneuve and his team's choices are impeccable, from the production design to the cinematography to the costume design. And, of course, the score. Blade Runner 2049's score has been something of a hot button issue, as it was revealed this summer that Johann Johannsson, who scored Villeneuve's Arrival and Sicario to incredible results, had been replaced by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch (A Cure for Wellness) on the film. It was a surprising jolt to what had thus far sounded like a pretty smooth ride, and indeed Johannsson fans were a little displeased at the move.
However, despite the fact that it's still a bummer we didn't get a new Johannsson score, the score that Zimmer and Wallfisch put together is incredible and directly in keeping with the high quality of the rest of the film. Zimmer has been Wallfisch's mentor for some time now, but Wallfisch has really been making a name for himself with memorable scores for films like A Cure for Wellness, Annabelle: Creation, and most recently the horror hit IT. Their collaboration here is stunning, taking just enough from Vangelis' iconic Blade Runner score to make it fit inside that same world, but taking the sound to new and interesting destinations. It's at once jolting, off-putting, and surprisingly emotional, and it's now available to stream (or purchase) in its entirety.
So sit back and revisit the score in the streams below. I have a feeling this one's gonna be in regular rotation for film score nerds for some time to come.

BURQIN, West Bank (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian teenager during an arrest raid in the village of Burqin in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian health officials said on Saturday.
A Reuters witness said about 200 Palestinians were throwing stones at Israeli military vehicles when a gunshot was heard, adding that a wounded person was then carried to a car.
Israel's military said its forces had been searching in Burqin for suspects involved in the fatal drive-by shooting of an Israeli rabbi from a nearby settlement on Jan. 9.
A military spokeswoman said rioting had broken out while troops were apprehending several suspects connected with that shooting and troops responded with non-fatal “riot dispersal means” against Palestinians throwing rocks and firebombs and then with live gunfire at the main instigators.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the teenager killed on Saturday was 19 years old, while the hospital in Jenin where he was taken said he had been shot in the head.
The Israeli military spokeswoman said he had climbed onto a military vehicle and had opened its door before he was shot.
Israeli forces in the adjacent city of Jenin last month shot and killed a Palestinian gunman whom they had also suspected of involvement in the rabbi's shooting.
Tensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December. Since then at least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed.
Trump's reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who want to create an independent state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. It pulled out of Gaza in 2005.
U.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump's administration to restart negotiations has shown no real signs of progress.
Other than an age gap, there's not much separating the stories of Callum Sutherland and Cuen Eng.
Both have autism, both have been admitted to the IWK's Garron Centre because of violent behaviour and both have struggled to get the treatment they need.
But one big difference is that Eng can tell his own story.
READ MORE: N.S. family ‘scared' as boy with severe autism faces release without home supports
After hearing about nine-year-old Callum's seven-week stay at the Halifax children's hospital, Eng said he was “frustrated” to see the status quo persist since he was there in the winter of 2015.
Callum was admitted to the centre in October. His parents went public with his story last month.
In an emotional plea, Callum's mother Carly said her family is “scared” as they faced her son's discharge with no supports in place at home and no significant change in Callum's behaviour since he was admitted to the IWK.
“It's pretty familiar and really sad that nothing has changed over the many years that this has been happening,” Eng said in an interview on Friday.

Speaking publicly is difficult for him, but hearing the cycle repeat prompted Eng to go public.
“It should be common sense to help the kids that are struggling,” he said.
After a call to police on Jan. 28, 2015, Eng spent 37 days at the Garron Centre. But with no specific services and treatment for children with autism, Eng and his mother Marni Adams say it changed nothing for their family.
Services were “non-existent,” Eng said. “The entire experience wasn't pleasant.”
“There was nothing for autism,” Adams said. “So Cuen… came out of the Garron Centre no different than when he went in.”
The behavioural intervention treatment that children with autism need is publicly funded in Nova Scotia until the age of six.
After that age, children can get help through the public school system, but resources are scarce and wait times can be long. Those who are able to, pay for support privately.
Eng says he wants that to change, saying the age restriction “makes absolutely no sense.”
“People who are above the age of six are still affected by autism.”

Without getting the treatment that teaches people with autism how to navigate a world that wasn't built for them, Eng said he isn't able to regularly go to school.
Despite his sporadic attendance, he excels in academics. At the age of 15, he is taking Grade 12 chemistry and computer programming and Grade 11 English and math.
“My son is brilliant and yet can't survive in school consistently, he is so under-utilizing his brain, he is so under-utilizing his skills,” Marni Adams said.
“The lack of system that we have in place, the lack of supports for autism is really crippling my family.”
Without the supports and treatment in place, Adams said she is unable to help her son grow his skill set.
“I can't put any sort of demand on my son because I don't know if it will make him violent and if it does what is there to help me.”
‘Nobody wants to be violent'
Adams said the last time she called the police on her son, was also the last time she challenged him to go out of his comfort zone.
She said a violent incident in July 2016 again prompted her to call 911 and again the police brought Eng to the IWK.
“The hospital did nothing,” she said. “His brother and I were extremely afraid for our safety and they wanted to send him home.”
“I just realized that I can't continue to ask Cuen to do things that make him uncomfortable because he doesn't have the skills and so since then, I just don't.”
Eng said he's gone to the IWK emergency department more than 10 times but has only been admitted twice. Each time, he said he would wait a few hours in a separate room and more often than not he would have cooled off and the hospital would send him back home.
“We don't want to hurt people,” he said. “Nobody wants to be violent, it's just that we don't have any other way to deal with things.”
He says his case and those of other people with autism, show more treatment and training programs are needed to ensure kids with autism are equipped with the skills they need.
“We need more crisis prevention,” he said. “Ways to teach children with autism how to not be violent or have negative behaviour and …that should minimize the amount of crisis intervention we would need.”
He also said there should be a team dedicated to helping families who are in crisis. He says the only option for his family right now is to call 911.
‘At the current rate, there's not going to be any services in place'
Eng said more training would mean he could participate in school regularly. But he said he doesn't see the level of support changing.
“I want to further my education,” he said. “But at the current rate, there's not going to be any services in place by the time that I will be graduating.”
In the months after Eng was admitted to the IWK in 2015, Adams said she spoke with her MLA Ben Jessome, senior staff at the IWK and then-health minister Leo Glavine. She said her meeting with Glavine left her feeling optimistic.
“He had given myself and Autism Nova Scotia, quite a lot of time,” Adams said. “I thought he was an amazing listener, I felt empathy from him and I walked away and I felt hopeful.”
But she said nothing changed, so a few months later she went public. But again nothing changed, so she says she gave up.
“Since then I just want to blend I don't want any attention drawn on family, I think because I had lost hope,” she said.
Maintaining her family's “dignity” and privacy is a balancing act as they again go public. But she said she's doing it because her son wants to make a difference.
Whatever the motive of the shooter at a congressional baseball practice, some Republicans say that in the era of President Donald Trump, they're being threatened like never before.
They point to a virulent backlash against Trump that they say has gone beyond the bounds of moderate political dissent and – subtly or not – advocates violence.
“I've been saying, ‘What is it going to take for this to get some visibility,'” said Charlie Kirk, a young conservative activist. “And now here we are.”
During a news conference at the shooting scene Wednesday, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, declined to comment about whether America's political climate could be a factor. But he said, “There's too much, I believe, raw discourse that's pulling people apart.”

The gunman, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, opened fire Wednesday on Republican lawmakers and associates practicing baseball in a Virginia suburb outside Washington. A top House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, was critically wounded, as were several other people. Trump said the gunman had been killed.
Police haven't stated a motive. But Hodgkinson's strong anti-Republican stances and background as a former volunteer on Bernie Sanders campaign only added to suggestions that the shooting was politically motivated.

Such an assessment could be premature. Some initially attributed the 2011 shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords to intense partisanship, though that did not appear to be what motivated the gunman.
But prominent Republicans, including Trump's children, have long been unsettled by the rage against the president. Daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump said in a recent television interview that she did not expect the “viciousness” and “ferocity” of her father's critics.
Donald Trump Jr. is among those arguing that “liberal hate speech” leads to violence. He tweeted support for a comment by conservative political consultant Harlan Hill: “Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President.”
He was referring to a New York City production of “Julius Caesar” that portrays the assassinated title character looking like Trump in a business suit. That came on the heels of comedian Kathy Griffin posing with a bloodied rendering of Trump's head.
In both cases, there were consequences: lost sponsorships for the theatrical production and CNN dropping Griffin as host of its New Year's Eve special, despite her apology.
Kirk has been chronicling threats that get little attention outside conservative media.

John Griffin, a media arts and animation professor at the Art Institute of Washington, for example, commented on Facebook about the Republican health care plan, saying: “They should be lined up and shot. That's not hyperbole; blood is on their hands.”
When Kirk tweeted about the professor's threat, the University of Georgia chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists, a student group at the Athens campus, wrote, “This is absolutely outrageous! House Republicans should NOT be shot! They should be guillotined.”

Griffin later apologized on Facebook for using “inappropriate” language, but said it spoke to “the fear so many feel right now in this country.” Neither he nor the student group immediately responded to a request for comment Wednesday.
Democrats, in turn, point to Trump's rough language – he has urged on fights at his rallies – as justification for their own. And on Wednesday, House Democratic leader James Clyburn of South Carolina said plenty of Democrats have experienced the level of hatred as Republicans.

“I'm not a Republican. And I've had all kinds of threats against me and my family,” he said. “It's got nothing to do with partisan politics.”
Ben Shapiro, a conservative writer and radio show host, says the violent rhetoric from all viewpoints contributes to “worse politics in general.” But he warns it is a mistake to say that atmospherics causes any one act of violence.
“Yes, that sort of rage culture is destroying the country,” he said. What happened at the ballfield is “a symptom, but it's not the chief symptom.”

This year, lawmakers, particularly Republicans, have experienced rowdy, overflowing town halls that they say border on dangerous.
Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, said he has been concerned that security for members is “nothing near what it needs to be.” He said town halls now often include “a thousand people screaming, and it only takes one person off the reservation” to cause a problem.
