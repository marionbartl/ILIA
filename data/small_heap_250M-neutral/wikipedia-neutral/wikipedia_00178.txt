Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 120 (P. Oxy. 120 or P. Oxy. I 120) contains two letters, written in Greek and discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a sheet. The document was written in the 4th century. Currently it is housed at Haileybury College in Hertford Heath.
Description
This papyrus contains two letters, one on the recto side and the other on the verso. The letter on the recto side is from Hermias to their sister, asking for help. The note on the verso side is from Hermias to their son, Gunthus, asking them to come at once. The measurements of the fragment are 275 by 128 mm.
It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1898.
Text
Recto
Hermias to their sister, greeting. What remains to write to you about I do not know, for I have told you of everything till I am tired, and yet you pay no attention. When a man finds themselves in adversity they ought to give way and not fight stubbornly against fate. We fail to realize the inferiority and wretchedness to which we are born. Well, so far nothing at all has been done; make it your business to send some one to me, either Gunthus or Ammonius, to stay with me until I know the position of my affairs. Am I to be distracted and oppressed until Heaven takes pity on me? Hermias is anxious to come to you. I requested them to stay, but they refused, saying that they had pressing business and that they must go, and that their son Gennadius was unable to attend to the property, especially as they were a stranger to the place and was engaged at their post. See that matters are properly conducted on your own part, or our disasters will be complete. We are resolved not to continue in misfortune (?). Farewell; I wish you all prosperity.
Verso
Hermias to their son Gunthus, greeting. Unless Ammonius comes to me at once, put off everything or let them do your work and come yourself. Whatever you do, do not fail me in my trouble. Let me know how it was with Didymus. Can time accomplish everything after all? I pray for your health.

Wyandotte County (; county code WY) is a county in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the population was 169,245, making it Kansas's fourth-most populous county. Its county seat and most populous city is Kansas City, with which it shares a unified government. Wyandotte County is directly north of Johnson County, Kansas, and west of Kansas City, Missouri.
History
The Wyandot
The county is named after the Wyandot (also known as Wyandott or Wyandotte) Indians. They were called the Huron by the French in Canada, but called themselves Wendat. They were distantly related to the Iroquois, with whom they sometimes fought. They had hoped to keep white Americans out of their territory and to make the Ohio River the border between the United States and Canada.
One branch of the Wyandot moved to the area that is now the state of Ohio. They generally took the course of assimilation into Anglo-American society. Many of them embraced Christianity under the influence of missionaries. They were transported to the current Wyandotte County in 1843, where they set up a community and worked in cooperation with Anglo settlers. The Christian Munsee also influenced this area's early settlement.
The Wyandot in Kansas set up a constitutional form of government they had devised in Ohio. They set up the territorial government for Kansas and Nebraska, and elected one of their own territorial governor.
Other historical facts
The county was organized in 1859. Tenskwatawa (Tecumseh's brother), "the Prophet", fought at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. They were buried at Shawnee Native American historical site Whitefeather Spring, at 3818 Ruby Ave. Kansas City, which was added in 1975 to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The Kansas City Smelting and Refining Company employed over 250 men during the 1880s. The ore and base bullion is received from the mountains' mining districts and is crushed, separated and refined.
The Delaware Crossing (or "Military Crossing"; sometimes "the Secondine") was where the old Indian trail met the waters of the Kaw River. Circa 1831, Moses Grinter, one of the area's earliest permanent white settlers, set up the Grinter Ferry on the Kansas River there. Their house was known as the Grinter Place. The ferry was used by traders, freighters, and soldiers traveling between Fort Leavenworth and Fort Scott on the military road. Others crossed this area on their way to Santa Fe.
The Diocese of Leavenworth moved its see from Leavenworth, Kansas to Kansas City, Kansas on 10 May 1947. It became an archdiocese on 9 August 1952.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (2.9%) is water. It is Kansas's smallest county by area.
Topography
The county's natural topography consists of gently rolling terrain. The Kansas River forms part of the county's southern boundary. The elevation generally increases from south to north as the distance from the Kansas River and Missouri River increases.
Watersheds and streams
The county is drained by the watersheds of the Kansas River, which is part of the Missouri River watershed. It receives plentiful rainfall.

Wyandotte County is included in the Kansas City, MO-KS Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Wyandotte County's population was estimated at 163,369 in 2015, an increase of 5,864, or 3.0%, over the previous five years; it is Kansas's fourth-most populous county.
As of the 2000 census, there were 157,882 people, 59,700 households, and 39,163 families residing in the county. The population density was 1,043 people per square mile (403/km2). There were 65,892 housing units at an average density of 435 per square mile (168/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 58.18% White, 28.33% Black or African American, 1.63% Asian, 0.74% Native American, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 8.17% from other races, and 2.91% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 16.00% of the population.

Government
Law
The Kansas City Police Department also serves Wyandotte County.
Wyandotte County was a prohibition, or "dry", county until the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 and voters approved the sale of liquor by the individual drink with a 30% food sales requirement. Voters removed the food sales requirement in 1988.
The county voted "No" on the 2022 Kansas Value Them Both Amendment, an anti-abortion ballot measure, by 74% to 26%, outpacing its support of Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election.
Presidential elections
Unlike almost every other county in Kansas, Wyandotte County has been solidly Democratic ever since the New Deal. This is largely due to its highly urbanized nature and significant minority population. The only Democrat to lose Wyandotte County since 1932 has been George McGovern in Richard Nixon's 49-state landslide of 1972, when Nixon swept all 275 counties in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. Wyandotte was the only county in Kansas to vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, Adlai Stevenson II in both 1952 and 1956, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Jimmy Carter in 1980, and Walter Mondale in 1984. No Republican presidential nominee has managed even 40% of the vote since Ronald Reagan in 1984.
Economy
Village West, at the intersection of Interstates 70 and 435, has significantly fueled growth in KCK and Wyandotte County. Anchored by the Kansas Speedway, its attractions and retailers include Hollywood Casino, Legends Outlets Kansas City, Schlitterbahn Vacation Village, Cabela's, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Great Wolf Lodge, Legends Field (Kansas City) (home to the Kansas City Monarchs (American Association) of the American Association) and Children's Mercy Park (home of Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer).
Also in the area are Azura Amphitheater (commonly known as the Sandstone Amphitheater), the National Agricultural Center and Hall of Fame, Wyandotte County Park, and Sunflower Hills Golf Course.

Mr. Louie is a former self-elevating drilling barge (jackup rig) converted into an oil platform. It was the first self-elevating drilling barge classed by the American Bureau of Shipping. As an oil platform, it operates at the Saltpond Oil Field, offshore Ghana.
Description
Mr. Louie weighs 6200 tons. Its minimal operational water depth is . It has five tugs which pulled them around, and twelve legs for standing on the seabed. It has rings welded onto its cylindrical legs to provide a positive jack connection. Its footing equivalent diameter is , and approximate footing load is .
History
Mr Louie was designed by Emile Brinkmann between 1956 and 1958. The drilling barge was built by Universal Drilling Co. It was launched in 1958 and delivered in 1959. In 1958, Mr. Louie became the first self-elevating drilling barge classed by the American Bureau of Shipping.
In 1959, it was leased to Reading & Bates (now part of Transocean). The rig was valued by the leasing contract at US$4.75 million. This transaction was later challenged by the United States tax authorities as a sale agreement. In 1965, the barge was sold pursuant to contractual option to Reading & Bates.
Mr. Louie first drilled at the Gulf of Mexico, where it drilled more than 40 wells. Later it was transferred to the North Sea. In 1963, while drilling on the German Bight, a pocket of very high pressure carbon dioxide struck the well, causing a blowout. The blowout created a wide and deep crater called Figge-Maar.
In May 1964, Mr. Louie drilled the first offshore hole in the North Sea, off of Juist island. In June, it made the first North Sea gas discovery. Later it was used for natural gas exploration in the UK section of the North Sea. In 1967, Mr. Louie was a part of the unique action for that time when for the first time in the North Sea, it went to dock for reparations and maintenance and was replaced by another rig (Orion) during the drilling. After the structural repairs and maintenance work at Bremerhaven, Mr. Louie continued drilling at the North Sea for the Gas Council – Amoco group.
After the North Sea, Mr. Louie was moved to West Africa. In 1969, it passed through Gibraltar. Temporary moorings were needed and their setting into the rocky floor of Gibraltar Bay required the use of the Edwardian air lock diving-bell plant to work at depth. Between 1977 and 1978 it drilled six appraisal wells at the Saltpond Oil Field in offshore Ghana. After completing the drilling in 1978, Mr. Louie was converted into an oil platform at this field. It was officially renamed APG-1.

They studied in Edinburgh, first in the School of Art, under Mr. Hodder, and later in the life class of Robert Macgregor; afterward in Paris under Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant. Arnold thought it important for miniature painters to do work in a more realistic medium occasionally, and something of a bolder character than can be done in their speciality.
They never studied miniature painting, but took it up at the request of a patroness who complained that they could find no one who painted miniatures. This lady gave the artist a number of the Girl's Own Paper, containing directions for miniature painting, after which Arnold began to work in this speciality. They painted a miniature of Lady Evelyn Cavendish, owned by the Marquis of Lansdowne; others of the Earl and Countess of Mar and Kellie, the first of which belongs to the Royal Scottish Academy; one of Lady Helen Vincent, one of Edith Phillips, the daughter of Lionel Phillips, and several for prominent families in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Them work was exhibited in the exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Arts, London. In 1903, they exhibited miniatures of Miss M. L. Fenton, the late Mrs. Cameron Corbett, and the Hon. Thomas Erskine, younger son of the Earl of Mar and Kellie.
They married Reginald E. Arnold (d. 1938), a sculptor. For a time, their address was 7 Gloucester Mansions, Harrington Gardens, London, S.W. They died in Ascot, Berkshire, in 1959, aged 92.

Hallingskarvet National Park () is a national park in central Norway that was established by the government on 22 December 2006. The park is located in the municipalities of Hol (Viken county), Ulvik and Aurland (both in Vestland county). More precisely, the park comprises the Hallingskarv plateau and the high mountain areas to the west of it. It includes the Vargebreen glacier as well as the valleys of Såtedalen, Lengjedalen, Ynglesdalen, and parts of Raggsteindalen.
The national park covers of the Hallingskarvet mountain range and hosts large stocks of wild reindeer, an important factor in the establishment of the park. The highest point in the national park is Folarskardnuten which reaches an elevation of above sea level.
The landscape of Hallingskarvet was shaped by multiple ice ages. The park shows the geological history and the connection between this history and the variation in the species living there. It includes areas of special value and which are home to threatened or vulnerable species such as Draba cacuminum (whitlow-grass) and Botrychium lanceolatum
(lance-leaf grapefern).
The Bergen Line runs along the southern boundary of the park. There is no road access to the southern side of the park, so Finse Station, a stop on the railway line, is one of the few ways that people can access this part of the park. The Norwegian County Road 50 runs near the northern boundary of the park.
Protection and use
The main objective of this national park is to preserve a large, unique, and largely untouched area in order to protect the landscape and the biome with its ecosystem, species and populations of, amongst others, the wild reindeer. The protection is designed to safeguard a characteristic element needed to understand the geological history of the Norwegian landscape. It is also designed to protect valuable elements of the cultural heritage.
The park is open to the traditional forms of outdoor activities which require little or no technical means.
Name
The first element is halling (inhabitant of the Hallingdal valley) and the last is the finite form of skarv (mountain or mountainous area without vegetation).

In Paris, the Surrealist group led by André Breton put Salvador Dalí on "trial" for their troubling interest in Hitler as well as their painting The Enigma of William Tell. The painting depicted a deformed, semi-nude figure bearing the facial features of Vladimir Lenin, something that failed to amuse the Surrealists as many of them were communists. Dalí made a mockery of the proceedings by showing up with a thermometer in their mouth and seven thick sweaters on, which they proceeded to remove one at a time and put on again while taking their temperature. With one sweater left, Dalí told Breton that if they dreamed that night of the two of them making love to each other, they would not hesitate to paint the scene the next morning in great detail ("I don't advise it, my friend", was all Breton managed to say in response.) Then, stripping to the waist, Dalí knelt on the carpet and swore that they were no enemy of the proletariat, ending the bizarre event.

Frederick James Gardner (23 December 1910 – 26 July 1950) was a British jazz and dance band saxophonist during the 1930s and 1940s.
Early life
Their father sold artist's materials, while their mother was a dressmaker. They took up the saxophone at 15 to help to alleviate asthma. After minimal coaching they formed the semi-professional New Colorado Band in 1928, and a year later, while working as an office clerk, entered the band in a contest at Chelsea Town Hall and won. They were spotted by the founding editor of Melody Maker magazine who was distributing the prizes, and a year later secured their first professional position.
Early career
In 1933, Gardner was taken under the wing of Ray Noble and recorded with the New Mayfair Orchestra.
They played in London clubs when working with Sidney Lipton's Orchestra and at the Mayfair Hotel with Bert Firman's band and with Billy Bissett. Gardner became a prolific session musician, doubling on all the reeds, although their main instrument was alto saxophone.
They played on recordings by Benny Carter, Ray Noble, Valaida Snow, Jay Wilbur Buck Washington, and John W. Bubbles. from 1936 to 1937 they performed on the radio, led small groups, and their Swing Orchestra, which included Ted Heath. Many arrangements were scored by Gardner.
World War II
During World War II, Gardner joined the Royal Naval Patrol Service as a diesel engineer under Eastern Command. An official dance band for the RNPS called the Blue Mariners was led by George Crow. Their home was the Sparrow's Nest at Lowestoft, an entertainment venue appropriated by the Royal Navy. Other musicians in the band were drawn from the orchestras of Henry Hall and Ambrose. Gardner was regularly given special leave to continue their recording and broadcasting. Other recordings at this time were made under the band name Freddie Gardner and their Mess Mates.
Freelance work
After the war, they continued with extensive freelance work, including as a soloist with the Peter Yorke Concert Orchestra. This band was formed for the BBC and appeared in weekly radio programs such as The Starlight Hour and Sweet Serenade. Gardner's 78 rpm recording of "I Only Have Eyes for You" was recorded on 29 April 1948 two years before their death.
Death
Gardner loved golf, all forms of transport, and was a keen modeller. They were taken ill while mending one of their son Robin's bicycle in the garden of their Brooke Street home in London. An hour later, at St. Mary's Hospital, they died of a stroke on 26 July 1950 at the age of 39. Many in the profession attended their memorial service and they were buried in Willesden Cemetery.

The Repin culture was a 4th millennium BCE Eneolithic archaeological culture located in the Pontic–Caspian steppe and East European forest steppe. It developed from preceding local Neolithic cultures, and later developed into the Yamnaya culture. The economy was based on pastoralism, supplemented by hunting. This culture is sometimes classified as an earlier phase of the Yamnaya culture.
Origins and classification
The Repin culture is dated, based on radiocarbon dating of pottery shards, to 3900–3300 calibrated ВСE. According to David Anthony it probably originated in the lower Don region. The Repin culture was neighboured by the Deriivka and Kvityana cultures to the west, and the Konstantinovka culture to the south.
Some scholars consider Repin to be an early stage of the Yamnaya culture, while others have more recently preferred to classify Repin as a distinct Eneolithic culture.
According to A.T. Sinyuk, the Repin culture developed from the preceding local Neolithic cultures. Sinyuk states that the (pre-Corded Ware) Sredny Stog I and Neolithic lower Don cultures are fundamental components in the formation of the Repin culture. Sinyuk and Yuri Rassamakin suggest that the origins of the Repin culture are not connected with the Khvalynsk culture. In contrast, Nina Morgunova and Mikhail Turetskij argue that
cultural continuity between the Yamnaya, Repin, Khvalynsk, and Sredny Stog cultures is demonstrated by the funerary rites and pottery styles.
Rassamakin argues that "there is no longer good support for the simple and attractive idea of a direct evolution of Eneolithic cultures beginning with the Samara and ending with the formation of the Yamnaya culture in the Volga-Ural interfluve. It is no longer accepted by the majority of researchers."
Sites
Repin
The eponymous Repin type site, located on the middle Don upstream from Razdorskoe at the edge of the steppe grass, was excavated in the 1950s. At the site, 55% of osseous material was horse bones, 18% cattle, 9% sheep or goat, 9% pigs, and 9% red deer.. This suggests that horse meat was the most important part of the diet here.
Kyzyl Khak
A Repin antelope hunters' camp, occupied between c. 3700–3600 BCE, situated on the lower Volga. The osseous material here comprises 62% saiga antelope, 13% cattle, 9% sheep, 7% horses, and 7% onagers.
Turganik
From the Repin horizon at Turganik, Tashlinsky District, 2,000 pottery fragments from over 50 vessels have been excavated. Pottery styles and technology indicate cultural links with contemporary North Caspian and Don cultures. Evidence for metallurgy include copper ore finds, stone molds for casting copper, tools, and an ornament. Copper was sourced from local copper deposits. Animal bones are mainly domestic animals, including cattle, dog, and horse, with occasional wild animal bones such as moose, beaver, wild goat, bear, and fox. Fish bones are very rare at this site. The horse finds are considered significant as the region is one of the first places where horse domestication is thought to have occurred.
Pottery
The pottery of the Repin culture is characterised by tall vessels with profiled necks and rounded or flat bottoms, made with silt or a mixture of clay and silt, with some addition of crushed shells and organic material. The surfaces are smoothed and decorated with comb impressions. Vessels are made using molds. The pottery style combines features from nearby regional Eneolithic styles, and exhibits technological continuity with other Eneolithic steppe cultures, suggesting cultural integration and mixing that preceded the development of the Yamnaya culture proper.
The ceramic technology of the Repin culture is argued to be evidence of continuity with the earlier Khvalynsk culture.
Repin pottery type is sometimes found in the cultural layer below Yamnaya pottery, and some early Yamnaya pottery is said to be indistinguishable from the Repin type. Repin pottery has also been described as very similar to that of Sredny Stog II, while sharing almost no features with that of the Dereivka culture.
Funerary rites
Skeletons are buried in crouched supine position with bent legs to the left or to the right, with the head in the east, sprinkled with ochre, with multiple burials in flat graves. As the Repin period progresses and expands from the original middle Don region, individual burials under a tumulus, sometimes with cromlechs, become more widespread.
Economy
Livelihood was probably based on a combination of pastoralism and hunting. Evidence from Repin sites suggests that animal breeding was the main form of subsistence, with domestic animal bones comprising 80% of the osseous material. The proportion of domesticated species was typical of nomadic pastoralist societies.
David Anthony suggests that the Repin culture may have specialized in horse breeding for export to the north Caucasus region.
Finds demonstrate a relatively advanced regional tradition of metallurgy, based on extracting copper from local Kargala sandstone, which remained the main source of copper in the later Yamnaya culture.
Rassamakin states that the people of this culture lived a more settled life in the forest-steppe ecotone region, and a more nomadic lifestyle in the steppe zone.
Settlements in the Repin period were of limited number and temporary. Cattle herding gradually became more nomadic over time.
Rassamakin states that the economy of the Repin culture probably resembled that of the Deriivka culture.
Expansion
Anthony suggests that the Afanasievo culture was formed by a migration of people with a material culture of the same type as Repin, probably from the middle Volga-Ural area c. 3700–3500 BCE.
During its second phase the Repin culture had expanded to occupy the Volga, Dnieper and lower Don regions. Yuri Rassamakin suggests that the dispersal of the Repin culture to the south, south east, and south west at the end of the Eneolithic contributed to the formation of the Yamnaya culture. Trifonov considers this dispersal to be a colonization. According to Anthony, elements of Repin culture are found over a wide area at sites that precede early Yamnaya settlements.
The Repin culture is regarded by many archaeologists as an early stage of the Yamnaya culture. Viktor Trifonov, for example, states that the development of the Yamnaya culture is simply the expansion of the Repin culture to the steppe. Rassamakin however argues that Repin was only involved in the formation of the Gorodtsov culture, a late local subgroup of Yamnaya.
Language
David Anthony speculates that people of the Repin culture may have spoken a dialect of early Proto-Indo-European. They also propose that the Afanasievo separation from the Repin culture represents the separation of pre-Tocharian from early Proto-Indo-European.

Los Serenos Sefarad ("The Sefarad Watchmen") is an American Judaeo-Spanish-language Jewish hip hop group from Seattle, Washington. They were formed in 2014 by Rabbi Simon Benzaquen (vocals, songwriting), Alejandro "Alex" Hernandez (rapping, producer, guitar), and Netzaj Mendoza (producer). They released their debut album, Los Bilbilikos, in September 2017.
History
Los Serenos Sefarad was formed in January 2014 by Moroccan-born Sephardic Rabbi Simon Benzaquen and Mexican-born rapper/guitarist Alejandro "Alex" Hernandez. Benzaquen, the former rabbi of Bikur Holim Congregation in Seattle's Seward Park neighborhood, was initially uninterested in hip hop but gained a deeper understanding while overseeing the conversion studies of rapper Nissim Black (formerly D. Black), and prominently collaborated with Black on their song "Sores" and several concerts. Hernandez had moved to Seattle from Chihuahua, Mexico. One of their first collaborations in 2013 was a rap version of the Ladino Hanukkah song "Ocho Kandelikas". Their first performances in Seattle were at Seward Park's SPARK Jewish Music Festival.
On November 9, 2015, the group released their first music video, "La Vida Do Por El Raki". In 2016, they released the songs "La Serena" (The Sentinel) and "Adyjo Keryda Espanya" (Goodbye My Beloved Spain), the latter written about the expulsion of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition on 1492.

David Cittadini was an important technologist in the New Zealand business market in the 1990s. They were involved in creating and leading a number of important technology developments within New Zealand, such as Object-oriented programming and Distributed object computing. They were a member of a number of New Zealand technology-related standard groups (including Standards New Zealand) and was involved in a number of international standard bodies, such as the Object Management Group, and was an energetic proponent of leading-edge approaches and technologies in New Zealand.
Technology career
 They are recorded as being the initial Technology Architect for the INCIS Project and was strongly identified as being the initiator of the leading-edge technology approach of the INCIS project. However, the August 1994 Sapphire Technology Ltd handover report, tabled as part of the 2000 Ministerial Inquiry into the project, Cittadini recommended that New Zealand Police should not proceed with the project; the project subsequently collapsed (see INCIS).
They have contributed to many technology-based books, such as Java Development on PDAs where Cittadini is credited as a key contributor by the author Daryl Wilding-McBride.  They are the author of many published technology articles, such as a Java Naming article published in the Java Developers Journal.
They were an early adopter of a number of leading-edge technologies, such as those developed by Taligent. They were the only non-IBM person on IBMs internal technology review team and was the only person to develop and release a product using Taligent technology
They created the initial firewall configuration script which is now a very important security component in numerous Unix implementations, such as FreeS/WAN.
Cittadini was one of the earliest Solutions Architect in New Zealand and Australia. They created a comprehensive Solution architecture, called the Sapphire Enterprise Architecture for analyzing, describing and building complex enterprise-based Information Technology systems.
Audio and film career
In 2013 Cittadini, along with Andrew Hills, used Binaural recording techniques and technologies on the Australian short film The Blind Passenger. On 29 August 2013 and 31 August 2013 they recorded The Metropolitan Orchestra using binaural recording techniques, the first recording of an orchestra in Australia using binaural recording techniques.

Emausaurus is a genus of thyreophoran or armored dinosaur from the Early Jurassic (Early Toarcian). Its fossils have been found in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, northern Germany. Emausaurus is the only known Toarcian thyreophoran, as well as the only dinosaur from the zone of the same age with a formal name.
Discovery and naming
The type and only species, E. ernsti, was named and described by Harmut Haubold in 1990. The generic name is composed of an acronym of Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald and the Greek / (lizard). The specific name is derived from the name of geologist Werner Ernst, who acquired the holotype specimen, SGWG 85, in the summer of 1963 from supervisor Werner Wollin at a loampit near Grimmen, in strata dating from the Toarcian. It is known by the right side of the skull, the right lower jaw, caudal vertebrae, neural arches, a radius, a metatarsal, a claw, fragments of ribs, scutes, and plates, known as EMAU SGWG 85.
Description
Emausaurus was probably a semibipedal to quadrupedal animal, being covered in an armor of osteoderms across the body. Like other thyreorphorans, it probably was an herbivore, specifically a low dwelling one, with a diet associated with ground flora, such as cycads and Bennnetitales. The body length of the holotype juvenile individual of Emausaurus has been estimated at , with a body mass of . The adult length has been estimated at , with a body mass up to . Some recent data suggest the holotype may be from a subadult rather than a juvenile. Most of the reconstruction has been based on Scelidosaurus, although it is possible that Emausaurus was a more bipedal animal, as some of the young specimens of Scelidosaurus were thought to be. Adult forms probably were more quadrupedal. Unfortunately, the type specimen is too incomplete to infer a mode of locomotion. Armor includes three conical scutes and one tall, spiny element. In 2019, David Norman examined the morphology of Scelidosaurus, comparing it with Emausaurus. In Emausaurus, the maxilla has, overall, a similar morphology to that seen in Scelidosaurus. The disarticulated maxilla of Emausaurus exhibits an anteromedially directed robust process with which it met its counterpart in the midline, creating a wedge-like structure, with no obvious offset between the alveolar margins. In Emausaurus, the structure of the frontals is not well preserved. In outline, its proportions resemble those of Scelidosaurus, but the same is true of many Ornithischia. The lacrimal bone of Emausaurus is incomplete, but includes a long, curved jugal process that evidently wrapped itself around the anterior tip of the jugal.
Very little is known of the postcranium Emausaurus, recovering parts like a multipartite odontoid (sutured to the axis centrum), similar to that of Scelidosaurus.
Emausaurus has a series of assigned osteoderms, but lacks like Scutellosaurus 'scapular osteoderms'. The major series of osteoderms found appear to come from the tail or the dorsal section.
Classification
Cladistic analyses have shown that Emausaurus was a basal member of the Thyreophora, more derived than Scutellosaurus, but less than Scelidosaurus. Scelidosaurus, Emausaurus, and Scutellosaurus cluster at the base of most trees because they can be scored for only a restricted number of anatomical characters.
The cladistic status of the specimen is relatively controversial due to its young nature. It is clearly a member of the Thyreophora, but its position may be modified if an adult specimen is found. Emausaurus may be more derived than Scelidosaurus, or even be a sister taxon to Stegosauria. The general consensus has established Emausaurus as a non-eurypodan stem thyreophoran, along with Scutellosaurus and Scelidosaurus reinforced by almost all subsequent systematic reviews of ornithischian–thyreophoran relationships. Being Emausaurus and Scutellosaurus more basal than Scelidosaurus. Emausaurus has been put on an outgroup to Ankylosauria, with Scelidosaurus and the basal stegosaur Huayangosaurus. Vickaryous et al. (2004), did the default phylogenetic analysis for ingroup ankylosaurs, due to including cranial and postcranial characters, a wide range of taxa and made no in-group relationships, although this analysis used the holotype Lesothosaurus and Huayangosaurus as outgroups, ignoring Scelidosaurus and Emausaurus. In 2020, Norman found that Scelidosaurus, along with Scutellosaurus and Emausaurus, are positioned on the stem of Ankylosauria, rather than on the stem of Thyreophora, with Emausaurus as the basal sister-taxon to Scelidosaurus. This is because Emausaurus possesses a dorsal margin of the dentary sinuous in lateral view and neither elongated nor squat proportions of metacarpal 1 'medium'. Alternatively, Emausaurus may be a basal sister-taxon to Scutellosaurus, but taking the similarities between Emausaurus and Scelidosaurus this is less likely. Yet this was contested the same year with the description of +70 specimens of Scutellosaurus, where Emausaurus was found as sister taxon of this last one and both with strong evidence for a phylogenetic placement within Thyreophora but outside of Thyreophoroidea. A cladogram following the results of Norman (2020) is shown below:
Paleoecology
Emausaurus has a sinuous jaw profile, more advanced in ankylosauromorphans, unlike the rectilinear morphology seen in the more basal genus Scutellosaurus. The changes to the jaw are considered a series of modifications reflecting changes in the diet and evolution of the food processing of this dinosaur compared to its ancestors. It seems to be adapted to eat Coriaceous flora, such as bennetites and cycads, abundant on the coeval Sorthat Formation, where probably this taxon lived. The rest of the skeleton of this genus is poorly presented, with for example the vertebrae showing no evidence of the proportional changes in the height of the neural arches and spines seen on stegosaurs. The animal was covered in osteoderms, although the few found give no indication of how extensively they were distributed across the torso. Emausaurus, based on the proportions of the preserved metacarpals that the forelimb shows adaptations for weight support, rather than grasping, having ungulal phalanges that are conical and only slightly decurved.
The partially known proximal pedal phalanges are short and block-like, with near the same proportions seen in the pes of Scelidosaurus. A series of characters that together are suggestive of graviportality and quadrupedality, making Emausaurus a low roaming herbivore. Pseudo-bipedality is not discarded, with the animal able to reach slightly taller flora. Later works however have criticised this assumption given the relationships with Scutellosaurus are more likely and recommend to not infer bipedality or cuadrupedality as the taxon is incomplete.
Paleoenvironment
The holotype of Emausaurus was found on the so-called "Emausaurus type site", which represents a shale ingression from the Ciechocinek Formation, dated from the Lower Toarcian (Tenuicostatum). The site is a boundary composed of bituminous shale, representing an ancient seashore-influenced environment, probably lagoonal, and contemporaneous with the Posidonia Shale and specifically the Sorthat Formation of the same region. Fossil wood has been found on the same location, including driftwood and other related to the Araucariaceae, present in other European environments of Toarcian age. Of the invertebrate fauna insects, bivalves, sea snails and ammonites (Genus Tiltoniceras, Eleganticeras and Lobolytoceras) have been found. The vertebrate fauna is also varied, with fossils of the fish genus Saurorhynchus, and the new genus Grimmenichthys and Grimmenodon. Reptile fossils include Ichthyosauria indet., indeterminate Plesiosauria, rhomaleosaurid plesiosaurs, indeterminate Mesoeucrocodylia (probably related with Sichuanosuchus), indeterminate Thalattosuchia and gravisaurian sauropod material, related with the north African Tazoudasaurus. A latter discovery includes a thyreophoran osteoderm, interpreted as representing a lateral of the neck or shoulder region.

Temple Beth Israel was a Reform synagogue located at 840 Highland Road in Sharon, Pennsylvania. Originally called House of Israel Congregation, it was founded in 1888 as an Orthodox congregation by Jews from Eastern Europe.
The congregation constructed its first synagogue building in 1903, and expanded it in 1924. It hired its first full-time rabbi, Maurice Moskowitz, in 1929; they served until 1934.
By the 1940s the congregation had moved to Conservative Judaism, and with the installation of M. Robert Syme (1945–1948) as rabbi, transitioned to Reform Judaism. It joined the Union for Reform Judaism in 1949, and completed its current building in 1950.
Rabbis since Syme have included Meyer M. Abramowitz (1948–1956), Robert Bergman (1957–1961), Joseph Hewzog (1961–1974), Samuel Weingart (1974–1985), Stephen L. Sniderman (1985–1996), and Jacques Cukierkorn (1996–1998) , the congregation's last full-time rabbi. It merged with Congregation Rodef Sholom of Youngstown, Ohio in July, 2013.
Early history
Jews from Eastern Europe first settled in Sharon in the 1880s. In August, 1888 they founded the Orthodox Temple Beth Israel (originally called House of Israel Congregation) so that they would have place to worship for Rosh Hashanah the following month. J.M. Rabinowitz (or Rabinovitz) served as cantor, ritual circumciser, Hebrew teacher, and ritual slaughterer.
Services were initially held on the second floor of 62 Shenango Street. The first permanent synagogue building was constructed in 1903. By 1907 the synagogue had 40 member families, and its annual revenues were $1,000 (today $). Services were held on Shabbat and the Jewish holidays. The congregational school had two teachers and 25 students. A dissenting group who wanted more traditional services formed the Shaarah Torah synagogue. A number of years later Shaarah Torah re-merged with Beth Israel.
A new sanctuary was added to the building in 1924, in time for High Holy Days that year. Beth Israel's first full-time rabbi, Maurice Moskowitz, was hired in 1929. They served until 1934, and was succeeded that year by Aaron Shapiro, who served until 1936. Shapiro was succeeded by Meyer Finkelstein, who served until 1937, and then by Harry Seeve, who served from 1937 to 1941.
Sidney Riback joined as rabbi in 1941; by this time the synagogue had moved to Conservative Judaism. By 1942 there were approximately 140 Jewish families in Sharon, and the women of House of Israel had formed a sisterhood.
Move to Reform
The members voted to reform services in 1945, and hired a new rabbi, M. Robert Syme. Born in 1920 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, they were a graduate of the Jewish Institute of Religion. When they arrived in Sharon, it had a Jewish population of approximately 150 families, and Beth Israel was its only synagogue.
Syme changed synagogue ritual, adopted the Union Prayer Book, and added a choir and organ. These changes were resisted by some members. Syme also discovered that Sharon's Orthodox Jewish population was sharing space with Beth Israel's congregation, worshiping in the basement. They felt it important that the Orthodox Jews be able to pray in the sanctuary too; so, on Friday nights they followed the Reform service in the Union Prayer Book, using an organ, while on Saturday mornings they followed the services from an Orthodox siddur (prayer book), praying without an organ. (Orthodox services normally do not use musical instruments, since the playing of musical instruments on Shabbat and many holidays are forbidden by Jewish law.) While living in Sharon, Syme also walked to synagogue and kept a kosher home, in accordance with Jewish law, to show that they were the rabbi of all of Sharon's Jews.
Looking for the greater challenge, opportunity, and money a larger congregation could provide, Syme eventually resigned in 1948, moving to Temple B'nai Abraham of Butler, Pennsylvania. Syme would become better known as rabbi of Detroit's Temple Israel, where they served for almost 47 years, starting in 1953.
Events since 1948
Syme was succeeded in 1948 by Meyer M. Abramowitz. Born in Rochester, New York in 1918, Abramowitz had an unusual educational background; they were a graduate of the Orthodox Hebrew Theological College, Columbia University and the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary of America (both in 1943), and the Reform Jewish Institute of Religion, where they were ordained in 1946. They had served from 1938 to 1944 as a cantor and director of Jewish education at the Forest Hills Jewish Center, from 1944 to 1946 as its student rabbi, and from 1946 to 1948 as its rabbi. Abramowitz served until 1956, moving the following year to Temple B'rith Sholom of Springfield Illinois, where served the rest of their rabbinical career.
In 1949, the congregation started using the Union Prayer Book for High Holy Days, and Beth Israel joined the Union for Reform Judaism (then Union of American Hebrew Congregations). That same year, the members began construction of the current building at 840 Highland Road (at Euclid Avenue). The building was completed by September 1950, in time for Rosh Hashanah.
Abramowitz was succeeded as rabbi by Robert Bergman (1957–1961) and Joseph Hewzog (1961–1974). Hewzog was succeeded by Samuel Weingart in 1974. Raised in Des Moines, Iowa, Weingart was a graduate of State University of Iowa, and had been ordained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1962. They served until 1985, and later served as rabbi of Temple Israel of West Lafayette, Indiana.
Weingart was succeeded as rabbi in 1985 by Stephen Sniderman. A native of Toronto, Canada, Sniderman was a graduate of York University and was ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1975. They served until 1996, and was succeeded that year by Jacques Cukierkorn. Cukierkorn. Due to falling membership, the synagogue closed its doors and merged with Congregation Rodef Sholom in nearby Youngstown in July 2013. The Highland Road building was sold to a local Apostolic Christian congregation for roughly $40K and renamed Greater New and Living Way Temple of the Apostolic Faith.

Brigadier Dame Mary Katherine Rosamund Colvin (25 October 1907 – 23 September 1988) was a director of the British Army Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and president of the British Horse Society.
Family
Colvin was born into a military family, one of four children and the only daughter of the Boer War veteran Lt. Col. Forrester Farnell Colvin (CBE, OBE, MC, DL; died 16 February 1936) and Isabella Katherine McClintock-Bunbury (28 December 1874 — 30 March 1963), who married on 26 July 1894. They lived at Morleys, Shermanbury Grange, Horsham, Sussex. They were a cousin of Michael Colvin, a Conservative M.P.
Career
Colvin travelled widely as a young woman, to South Africa and India. They joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in 1938, transferring to the Auxiliary Territorial Service when World War II commenced. They spent most of the war as a driver, then commanded a Central Ordnance Depot Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) Group at Weedon, Northamptonshire (1943–44). Immediately after the end of hostilities with Germany, they were posted to Hamburg to help oversee its transition to democracy and build up the local council and basic services such as housing. After two years of throwing themselves into this work, they were awarded an OBE, but had to return to Britain to be nearer to their ailing and elderly relatives.
They supervised the transition of the ATS into the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC), including moving its officer training school to Hindhead and bringing the training closer to that of male recruits. Female recruitment was low by 1954, so they were appointed to reverse the trend; designing a popular uniform for officers was part of their strategy. After more postings to Scotland and Eastern Command, in 1957 they were appointed WRAC director, still not yet 50, and two years later was given DBE. In 1961 they went to Copenhagen as Britain's main delegate to the inaugural NATO meeting of the women's services; their international peers elected them their spokesperson. That year they retired, after 23 years' service.
They devoted much of the next 25 years to the British Horse Society, working their way up from dressage judge to president. They hunted with the Blackmore Vale and lent their indoor riding school to the Rutland club (which did not have its own premises).
They were lady in waiting to Mary, the Princess Royal, the Controller Commandant of the WRAC, and accompanied them to Canada in 1962.
Death
Colvin died in 1988 in Rutland. They never married. Them personal papers are at the National Archives, along with those of other British military women, such as Dame Katharine Furse, Dame Rachel Crowdy, and Brigadier Dame Mary Coulshed.

The O.G. Hotel is one of Adelaide's oldest hotels, noted for its enigmatic name, the shortest in Australia.
History
The O.G. Hotel gained its licence before 1846, according to one reference on 6 July 1843, the proprietor being James Black.
Situated at Gilles Plains on what was then known as the road to Modbury (now designated as 246 North East Road, Klemzig), the name is generally recognised as a reference to Osmond Gilles, a major landholder in the area, though mention of this connection did not appear until the 20th century.
O.G. Road which runs alongside the hotel, does not appear in print until 1869, so it appears to have been named after the hotel.

daKAH or daKAH hip hop orchestra is an orchestra co-founded by Los Angeles composer and the orchestra's conductor Geoff Gallegos (Double G) with a diverse group of 23 musicians in 1999.
Name
According to Double G's interview with Los Angeles music reporter Ife Oshun in 2005, the name daKAH "has roots in ancient Ghana" and it refers to "a policy of societal organization and an understanding of the creative process" in which people are given tasks according to their skills, creating "a feeling of meaningful work amongst people, and the satisfaction in feeling like you're on your right path." They started capitalizing the second syllable to assist with pronunciation.
History
daKAH grew out of a wave of multidisciplinary hip-hop collectives that grew out of the Los Angeles club scene that also included the L.A. Symphony, Breakestra and Ozomatli. Among its founding members there were saxophonist Matt DeMerritt, multi-instrumentalist Gabby La La, Viola player Ashley English Tobin and trombonist Elizabeth Lea.
The orchestra got its start playing in a club in Santa Monica that primarily showcases DJs and world music. Members of the orchestra play and sing at open mic poetry and musical jam events. Along with original compositions, daKAH does arrangement, transcription and orchestration for existing hip-hop recordings and other work that has been influential for hip-hop, include Gang Starr ("Gang Starr Remix"), the Roots ("Rootrilogy"), and Parliament Funkadelic.
When Scion, a discontinued marque of Toyota, launched the Scion record label to promoting underground artists, daKAH was its first band. The Los Angeles-based orchestra has expanded steadily since its inception and received much audience acclaim for its genre-bending and culture-blending performances. In 2002, Geoff Gallegos received a Durfee Foundation Artist Award. In 2004, the orchestra was presented by Los Angeles Philharmonic as part of the Sounds About Town series, featuring Los Angeles area's premier youth orchestras, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Style
The music of daKAH, despite being first and foremost a hip-hop group, mixes European symphony orchestra with sounds from popular music with the help of musicians who bring training and experience in different musical styles to create a hip-hop orchestra, marrying two very different genres while maintaining the integrity of both. The orchestra features up to 70 pieces, with 10 rapper MCs, turntable DJs, a small chorus of hip-hop vocalists, 14 horns, winds like trumpet and bassoon, a 15-piece string section, and a percussion section.
While the combination of hip-hop and live instrumentation is not novel, daKAH pulls it off in "a grandiloquent style steeped in the feel-good vibe of the early-1990s acid jazz/hip-hop scene". Also while hip hop artists have always been sampling classical and jazz music, it is rare to find classical players, jazz hornists, and rapper MCs onstage together like with daKAH.
Members of daKAH come from widely diverse musical backgrounds, cultural experiences, artistic tastes, and lifestyles. They include both formally trained musicians and the self-taught and improvisers from jazz and contemporary traditions. The Los Angeles Philharmonic website describes it as "a United Nations of music." The orchestra is more appreciated as a live band at shows like Live at Grand Performances, where it performs "more durable materials" like Ashford and Simpson's "California Soul" and Parliament-Funkadelic's "Come in Out of the Rain".
The music of daKAH draws on both a West Coast tradition of drawing on funk music and what Music theorist Adam Krims categorizes as jazz/bohemian hip-hop (many of these groups are also defined as West Coast underground hip-hop). Others in this category include A Tribe Called Quest, the Black Eyed Peas (which shares a member with daKAH), and the Roots. The hip-hop of daKAH attracts audiences from a wide range of racial and ethnic backgrounds and is not measured by the East Coast-West Coast rivalry of the early 1990s.
Studio album: Unfinished Symphony (2002)
daKAH's released its first studio album, Unfinished Symphony, in 2002. The album was accompanied by The Stravingus Remixes, an anonymous remix album. According to JazzTimes, "On Unfinished Symphony, a 12-song cycle divided into two movements, the group wraps swirling cinematic orchestral arrangements around various grooves that range from ass-gripping funk to swaying reggae. For a hip-hop perspective, none of the MCs offer any lyrical brilliance worthy of the opulent ambiance." The best song in the album, according to music critic John Murph, is the R&B number "Adagio Asiago (Tryin II Sow My Love)" that features Fanny Franklin's alto, swift jazz excursions, sing-songy melodies, luxurious string arrangements and dazzling horn interplays.

Liechtenstein competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Since the nation's official debut in 1936, Liechtensteinian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, except for two occasions. Liechtenstein did not register any athletes at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and eventually joined the United States-led boycott when Moscow hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics. The 2016 delegation included two swimmers, Christoph Meier and Julia Hassler, and tennis player Stephanie Vogt. Two of the athletes debuted in the 2012 Summer Olympics, with long-distance freestyle swimmer Julia Hassler leading the squad as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Liechtenstein has yet to win a Summer Olympic medal.
Background
Liechtenstein participated in seventeen Summer Olympic Games between its debut in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of Liechtensteiners participating at any one Summer Games was 12 in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. No Liechtensteiner has ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics. However, Liechtenstein has won nine medals at the Winter Olympic Games. All of the Liechtensteiner participants competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics through invitations by FINA or the ITF. Hassler was chosen to be Liechtenstein's flag bearer during the Parade of Nations of the opening ceremony while Meier bore the flag during the closing ceremony.
Swimming
Liechtenstein received a universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics. Christoph Meier made their Olympic debut by competing in the men's 400 m individual medley event while Julia Hassler made their second appearance, with the first being in London 2012. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, they were one of three athletes to compete for Liechtenstein. They swam the 400 and 800 freestyles, finishing twenty-seventh in the 400 and 17th in the 800. Meier finished eighth in their heat and twenty-second overall with a time of 4:19.19 seconds, which set a national record but did not qualify them for the finals. Hassler started in the second lane. They came second in their heat and twenty-first overall with a time of 8:38.19 seconds. Hassler was eight seconds off the slowest qualifying time of 8:25.55 seconds by Mireia Belmonte of Spain.
Tennis
Liechtenstein received an invitation from the Tripartite Commission to send London 2012 Olympian Stephanie Vogt (world no. 274) in the women's singles for their second time into the Olympic tennis tournament. In the round of 64, Vogt lost both sets, losing the first 3–6 and the second 1–6 against Johanna Konta of Great Britain. Konta reached the quarterfinals after they beat Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia in the third round, but was knocked out in the last eight by Angelique Kerber of Germany. Following the loss, Vogt announced that they would pause their tennis career and enroll in the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich.

Aaron Commodore (born 1819 or 1820, died June 24, 1892) was an African-American business person, politician, and former slave. They served on the Virginia House of Delegates from 1875 to 1877.
Early life
Not much is concretely known about Commodore's early life. They were born into slavery around 1819 and 1820, possibly in Essex County, Virginia. They took two wives. Commodore married their first wife Lettie (or Letty) while still a slave and they died at some unknown point in time. By 1870 they were recorded as being married to Catherine (or Katherine).
Commodore was described as a large man with a strong presence and was known for their leadership qualities. This reputation led them to be selected for jury duty when Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase called for respectable African-Americans to serve on the grand jury. Commodore was not selected per their request, as they were willing to serve on the jury but did not have anyone to monitor their business while the court was in session. They declined to accept money for their travel expenses, as travel to the courthouse had been slightly difficult for him, but eventually took the money after being pressed. This interaction impressed both Chase and the United States marshal involved in the event and both men would later write about this interaction.
Politics
In November 1875 Commodore was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where they represented Essex County. Their opponent, Albert R. Micou, challenged the election but this challenge was dismissed. Commodore did not serve on the House of Delegates after 1875 but did remain active in politics. On July 31, 1884, they had to defend themselves in the Richmond Daily Whig newspaper when some local Democrats alleged that several armed African Americans had been seen at a polling location in Tappahannock during the 1883 elections, which gives off the impression that Commodore was potentially literate during this point in time.
Commodore died on June 24, 1892, likely in Tappahannock, Virginia.
In 2013 Commodore was one of several African Americans that were commemorated by the Commonwealth of Virginia for their service to the Virginia House of Delegates during the time period of 1869 to 1890.

José María Orellana Pinto (11 July 1872 – 26 September 1926) was a Guatemalan political and military leader. They were chief of staff of President Manuel Estrada Cabrera and President of Guatemala between 1921 and 1926, after overthrowing Conservative Unionist President Carlos Herrera. During their rule the Quetzal was established as the currency of Guatemala. Orellana Pinto died under suspicious circumstances in 1926 at the age of fifty-four. They were buried in the Guatemalan capital with state honors.
Early life
José María Orellana Pinto was born in El Jícaro; they were the son of Esteban Orellana and Leonora Pinto. Orellana had a military career becoming General of the Guatemalan Army. They were elected to the Guatemalan legislature on several occasions, as a member of the Liberal Party, and was also Chief of Staff of the President Estrada Cabrera; when serving as such, on 29 April 1907, they were riding alongside the president's coach when the latter suffered a bomb attack -which had been planned by the brothers Avila Echeverría and some of their relatives and friends-. Miraculously, both the president and Orellana were unharmed by the assassination attempt and almost immediately initiated the prosecution of the perpetrators.
Coup d'état against Carlos Herrera
On 5 December 1921, general Orellana -sponsored by the United Fruit Company- lead a coup d'état against president Carlos Herrera who had resisted approving the concessions granted to the United Fruit Company and its subsidiaries by their predecessor, Manuel Estrada Cabrera. Orellana had the help of several army officers, among them general Jorge Ubico.
Presidency
On 5 December 1921, Orellana was appointed as Interim President, and eventually became Constitutional President after winning the elections the following year. During their term in office, they ratified concessions that the government of Estrada Cabrera had made to the United Fruit Company (UFCO) and that Herrera had refused to ratify. They also encouraged the creation of a tripartite republic formed by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, but this was unsuccessful. In 1923, in celebration of the birth centennial of liberal writer and ideologist Dr. Lorenzo Montúfar y Rivera, the government erected a monument to their memory in Avenida Reforma.
Economy
Gum raw material extraction in the northern department of Petén was sold to Percy W. Shufeldt, who carried out the operation without paying taxes; unlike their predecessor—Carlos Herrera—Orellana gave favorable contracts such as the Shufeldt one to foreign companies. Another examples were the Electric Company, which had been expropriated from German shareholders after World War I, and was sold to the American Bond and Share Company on 4 May 1922.
Orellana promoted the construction of hundreds of kilometers of railways and was pressured by the International Railways of Central America to enforce the Méndez-Williamson railroad contract, signed in 1908 by then president Manuel Estrada Cabrera. When Estrada Cabrera was ousted, IRCA had intended to enact this agreement but the acting president Carlos Herrera refused to implement the contract; after Herrera was overthrown, Orellana ratified the contract on 10 March 1922.
The Guatemalan Congress issued the following laws during their term in office:
Ratified the Central American Union Covenant held in San Jose, Costa Rica.
Approved the contract for light, heat and electric power services, held in Guatemala City between government representatives and the Central America Power Company.
Hydrocarbons law
Ratified executive Decree 798, by which Archbishop Luis Javier Muñoz y Capurón remained in exile.
Approved the contract between the government and Emilio Capoulliez, proxy for Washington Serruys, for the installation of an electric tram.
Approved the contract between the Ministry of Development and the America Cables Incorporated company to build a public telegram office in Guatemala City
Approved the contract with AEG from Berlin, Germany, to continue and complete the Los Altos Railway and the Santa María power plant.
Approved oil exploration contracts with US companies.

Dockworkers strike: In mid-1924, Puerto Barrios workers -key to banana transport- demanded an 8-hour day and increased wages. When UFCO refused to accept, workers went on strike, with the support from all workers in the farms of the frutera. UFCO asked the Guatemalan government for help, and Orellana quickly sent troops to restore order in Puerto Barrios; the collision was brutal and resulted in numerous workers injured or dead. The strike lasted 27 days, but repression tactics finished it: 22 leaders were jailed and then expelled from the country.
Railroad strike : In late 1924, the employees of International Railways of Central America (IRCA) demanded the reduction of working hours, higher wages and respect to their labor union. Railway Society. Again, the frutera flatly refused to accept these demands and ordered Orellana's government to violently repress the strike of five thousand workers.
Cultural references
Rafael Arevalo Martinez talks about Orellana in numerous occasions in their biography of Estrada Cabrera ¡Ecce Pericles!.
Orellana is also mentioned, though not by name, in the Guatemalan novels El Señor Presidente, Viernes de Dolores and Viento Fuerte of Nobel Laureate Miguel Angel Asturias. In Viernes de Dolores, Asturias calls Orellana by their nickname: Rapadurero.
Given that during their rule the Quetzal was instituted as the Guatemalan currency, their image appears on the one quetzal bills, which are colloquially called "chemas".
Their cousin, general Manuel María Contreras Orellana later would lead a coup against interim president Baudilio Palma in December 1930.
Death
On 25 May 1926, El Imparcial -a private newspaper- had published a news flash: Martial law enacted which referred to executive decree 916, in which President Orellana had suspended the individual guarantees contained in the Constitution; the main reason for such decision was that "insidious and unpatriotic activities of certain elements" tended "to disrupt the peace and development of the country", which, at once, made it impossible to solve the national economic problem. Although El Imparcial was not circulating regularly in the previous days -due to a government boycott-, after 26 May it ceased publication indefinitely. Thereafter, only the official news outlets, such as Diario de Centro América and El Guatemalteco, could circulate, carrying irrelevant information. The story took a sudden turn on Sunday 26 September when, at 0:15 pm, Orellana died during a vacation trip to Antigua Guatemala; they were in a room at Hotel Manchén. "A violent angina attack ended the life of our illustrious president," explained Diario de Centro America in a special edition that day. These strange circumstances led to the suspicion that they were poisoned. General Lázaro Chacón assumed as interim President and immediately lifted Martial Law and allowed private newspaper to be published again.

Envy on the Coast are a post-hardcore band from Long Island, New York. They released their second full length, Lowcountry, in March 2010.
History
2003–2005: Formation
The members of Envy on the Coast began playing together in 2003, though not under that name. Initially, Ryan Hunter replaced Brian Byrne after Brian left New York to study at Berklee College of Music. In 2005, the band recruited drummer Dan Gluszak, and played their first official show in July 2005.
2006-2008: Self-titled EP and Lucy Gray
The band caught the ear of producer Bryan Russell, who recorded a five-song, self-titled EP with Envy on the Coast, which was officially released on September 19, 2006, on Photo Finish Records.
Envy on the Coast spent 2006 supporting their EP on tour with Saosin, 30 Seconds to Mars, and Angels and Airwaves, before retreating to Windham, NY to begin writing their first full-length record.
Envy on the Coast's first full-length, Lucy Gray, was released in August 2007, and was produced by Bryan Russell. The artwork was done by dredg bassist, Drew Roulette. The song title "I'm Breathing...Are You Breathing Too?" is taking from a line of Robert Bolt's play A Man For All Seasons. The song title "...Because All Suffering Is Sweet to Me" is taken from the last words of Saint Therese. The album title itself is from the poem "Lucy Gray" by William Wordsworth. Envy on the Coast released two music videos from the album for the songs "Sugar Skulls" and "Mirrors", both directed by Travis Kopach.
In the spring of 2007, Envy on the Coast took part in the first Alternative Press Tour, supporting Circa Survive and As Tall as Lions.
The band was featured in Kerrang! Magazine's July 2007 "Your 10 New Favourite Bands" issue. "Lucy Gray" was reviewed in Spin Magazine's September 2007 issue.
In November 2007, Envy on the Coast was forced to cancel their tour with From First To Last, and several college dates after lead singer Ryan Hunter's vocal problems worsened, and they needed time for treatment. However, instead of cancelling their hometown show on Long Island, the band took the stage without Ryan, and had the audience sing their set for them. The band quickly resumed touring once Ryan was healed, with a 5-date holiday tour at the end of December 2007 with Anthony Green.
On May 2, 2008, Envy On the Coast, supported one of the last The Receiving End Of Sirens shows.
2009–2010: Lowcountry
In February 2009, Envy on the Coast announced that they parted ways with their drummer, Dan Gluszak. The band enlisted Sean Beavan (Nine-Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, David Bowie) to produce their follow up to Lucy Gray, which they recorded at Red Bull Studios in Santa Monica. The band returned to NY to record a few more songs for the record, one of which was the bonus track, “Clean of You”, which was produced by Mike Sapone. In preparation for the release of their record, the band toured throughout 2009, doing scattered dates as well as multiple tours with Taking Back Sunday. The band received help on the drums from an array of players like Joe Zizzo (Sky Ferreria, Bob Moses, The Sleeping) and Matt Fazzi (Taking Back Sunday, Happy Body Slow Brain) before eventually finding a permanent fixture in Doug Rogells, via a YouTube audition. Justin Beck (Glassjaw) designed the cover art for Lowcountry. In March 2010, they toured alongside The Fall of Troy and Twin Atlantic on the "Marked Men of 2010" tour.
Released in January 2009, a photography book, Southern Comfort, authored and published by Emily Driskill, a Gold Record winning photographer, illustrated tour life with Envy on the Coast.
2010–2014: Breakup, hiatus and new projects
On July 12, 2010, the band announced via their Facebook page that they would no longer be playing together and continuing Envy on the Coast in its current form. Bossio and Velardi stated that they were no longer happy being a part of the band and left for other pursuits. Hunter and Byrne decided to move on to other endeavors rather than find musicians to replace Bossio and Velardi.
Envy on the Coast played three farewell shows on August 25, 2010 in Boston, MA at The Middle East, August 27, 2010 in Philadelphia, PA at The First Unitarian Church, and August 29, 2010 in New York, NY at Irving Plaza.
On April 4, 2011 Brian Byrne and Ryan Hunter released “Basement Tapes #1”, their first EP with their new project, North Korea, which featured Billy Rymer (Dillinger Escape Plan) on drums. They followed up with “Basement Tapes #2” on February 21, 2012. Both EPs were offered as free downloads.
On August 10, 2012 Ryan Hunter released a 5-song EP entitled “Rough Drafts” under the name Quiett Dog, their first solo endeavor.
In 2013, North Korea (now going by the name NK), released their first full length, “Nothing to be Gained Here” via Triple Crown Records on May 21, 2013. The album was produced by Mike Sapone and Ryan Hunter.
Sal Bossio and Dan Gluszak went on to form Heavy English, and released their first single “21 Flights” on July 30, 2013.
In December 2015, Ryan Hunter released a new project, 1ST VOWS. The Red EP was released on April 7, 2015, which was followed by The Green EP on December 11, 2015.
On July 28, 2016 Brian Byrne released their new project, “The Hand that Wields It”, with a 4-song self-titled EP which they produced. One of the songs, "Inertia", features a guest vocal from Hunter.
2016-2020: Reincarnation
On April 4, 2016, Ryan and Brian performed "Gift of Paralysis" and "Like I Do" as an encore at a 1ST VOWS show at Webster Hall, marking the first time they performed EOTC songs in over six years.
On May 17, 2016, Envy on the Coast officially announced a reincarnation tour via Facebook.
Following the announcement, a statement from Salvatore Bossio was posted on Sal's personal Facebook page, which revealed that they and Jeremy Velardi would not be a part of the shows, nor would original drummer, Dan Gluszak. The post claimed that there was a discussion to reunite with all original members, but "reuniting to do shows was collectively discussed at length, though we were unable to reach a unanimous decision about how exactly we would move forward, if at all." Hunter and Byrne responded to Bossio's statement via an interview with Alternative Press, verifying that it was conversations over songs that the other members wanted to omit, as well as other disagreements over the capacity in which they were to reunite that ultimately left Byrne and Hunter with the decision to move forward without them.
For the shows, the band enlisted Doug Rogells who played drums on the brief Lowcountry tour cycle and farewell shows, Gray Robertson, and Dan Ellis.
On January 20, 2017, Envy On the Coast announced their first headlining tour of 2017, including a performance at So What? Music Festival, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Lucy Gray and alluded to an upcoming release within the year.
In June 2017, Envy on the Coast released the 'Ritual' EP, their first release in seven years.
In May 2019, Envy on the Coast released "Alive After All", a 26-song live record which contains performances of Lucy Gray and Lowcountry in their entirety. The album was recorded and mixed by Ryan John.
In June 2019, Brian Byrne and Ryan Hunter announced their new project, Violent Joy, and released "Indian Summer", their first single. Their EP featuring "Indian Summer" was released January 2020.
On February 17, 2020 the official Twitter page announced a tour with The Receiving End of Sirens.

Poverty reduction in Guatemala remains as one of the key challenges to be dealt with before a more balanced and socially inclusive economic growth could be achieved.
Poverty
According to figures in 2006, 6.6 million people are still living under poverty and a third of this figure, or 2 million people, are struggling with extreme poverty.
Moreover, despite a fall in extreme poverty during the 1990s, Guatemala's dependency on exports and susceptibility to global price shocks such as the world coffee crisis and natural disasters such as the Tropical Storm Stan in 2005 has led to a subsequent increase of the poverty rate in 2004 and falling again in 2005.
Notwithstanding a recent fall in the poverty rate, both external and natural events continue to exert great influence on poverty levels in Guatemala. Consequently, poverty alleviation work in tandem with risk management policies in Guatemala.
Poverty and income inequality
Ranked with the second highest inequality rate in Latin America, (Gini coefficient of 0.55), many disparities exist between different economic sectors and income groups, reflecting a large rich-poor divide in Guatemala. Further data has shown that only 3.8 percent of the country's total income is earned by the poorest 20 percent of the population, compared with the 60.6 percent earned by the richest 20 percent of the population
Furthermore, income inequality in Guatemala is accentuated by regional differences, namely, 1) a large rural agrarian sector and 2) social exclusion.
Inequality and Agriculture
Agriculture is one of the primary sectors in Guatemala (22.2 percent of GDP), producing principal cash crops such as coffee, sugars and bananas. Together with other non-agricultural products, they contribute towards 75 percent of export earnings. The agricultural sector employs about 39 percent of the national workforce, resulting in suppressed wages and low productivity. This provides some explanation for the rural-urban dichotomy in living standards.
This problem is made worse by subsistence agriculture, resulting in low productivity and value-addedness. As a result, meagre incomes push subsistence farmers into poverty. Moreover, a denial of access to credit for vital agricultural investment has often led to farmers sinking into a vicious poverty cycle which continues through generations.
Sudden and unexpected events such as natural calamities and adverse climate conditions can also threaten agricultural harvests. It is not a matter of coincidence that the rural poor often comprised a large portion of populations living within these danger zones. Understandably, the rural poor are not able to gather sufficient resources to mitigate such emergencies, such as insurance against risk. Hence, the occurrence of such events would have recurring effects on rural dwellers, pushing them into greater poverty.
Inequality and social exclusion
Poverty appears to be largely concentrated within the regional groupings in Guatemala. To illustrate, comparisons between urban, rural and indigenous, non-indigenous people have shown that the non-indigenous groups fare considerably better than their indigenous contemporaries, comparable on a similar level to the national average of Cameroon, which ranks 144th on global HDI rankings with a score of 0.0506(HDI). As a result of social exclusion, the Q'eqchi ethnic group's HDI is relatively lower than the national average of 0.560.
Furthermore, the 38 percent poverty rate experienced by the rural indigenous population is almost twice the national average of 21.9 percent and at least 20 percent greater than their urban contemporaries, highlighting a rural-urban divide in terms of development.
In sum, the deprivation of the rural poor from opportunities of personal growth and development is a reflection of their disadvantaged economic circumstances. While the urban sector has been reaping relatively higher economic growth, the rural poor have been marginalized, bypassed and socially excluded from full economic participation in the Guatemalan economy.

Foreign debt
Lastly, coupled with a high foreign debt totaling $5,496 million according to 2006 figures, the Guatemalan economy became even more depressed with this large sum of foreign debt obligation. This has been supported by various studies that pointed out how a large foreign debt could potentially deplete a country's capital stock, thereby reducing much-needed investment opportunities vital for economic growth. However, the positive impact of economic growth on poverty reduction should be taken with a word of caution. While there is a positive GDP growth of 4.5 percent in that same fiscal year in Guatemala, it has done little to reduce poverty. With economic growth bearing no absolute causality on poverty reduction, there is a need for the social determinants of poverty to be looked into.

Relief is an unincorporated community in Mitchell County, North Carolina, United States. The community is located along the banks of the North Toe River, connected to North Carolina Highway 197 (NC 197) via Relief Road (SR 1314).
History
In 1870, the Squire Peterson's Store sold a patent medicine called Hart's Relief, in which the principal ingredient was alcohol; patrons enjoyed the “relief” it provided. In 1888, the Relief Post Office was established; during its tenure it assumed mail service from nearby Poplar (1949), Street (1917), and Tipton Hill (1951). In 1974 the post office was closed and replaced with rural letter carrier service from Green Mountain.

Moose River Mountain is a mountain in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. It is located west of Old Forge in the town of Webb in Herkimer County. In 1919, a steel fire lookout tower was built on the mountain. The tower ceased fire lookout operations at the end of the 1970, and was later removed in 1977.
History
In 1919, a Aermotor LS40 tower was built by the Conservation Commission. The tower replaced a wooden tower that operated for eight years to the southwest in the town of Lyonsdale in Lewis County. The new location offered a better view according to the Conservation Commission. It's believed that the naming of the mountain came with the moving of the tower. Due to the increased use of aerial detection which was better, the tower ceased fire lookout operations at the end of the 1970. The tower was removed in 1977, because it was deemed excess to the fire lookout operations and was classified as a "non-conforming" structure in the newly established Ha-de-ron-dah Wilderness Area.

The Anarchist insurrection of Alt Llobregat was a revolutionary general strike which took place in January 1932, principally organized by CNT unions in the mining and textile sectors. It was the first of the three insurrections carried out by the CNT during the time of the Second Spanish Republic (followed by the anarchists insurrections of January and December 1933).
History
The outbreak of the revolutionary strike was the result of the economic situation in the area and the country, and the expectations of radical social change that had created many sectors of workers since the early days of the republican era. In Catalonia, the most radical sectors of the anarchists controlled the CNT, which coincided with an increase in social conflict between workers and the republican state. Preceded by the Castilblanco events and the , the revolt began on 19 January 1932, when the miners of the San Cornelio industrial colony, in Fígols, started a strike and seized weapons from the (Catalan parapolice) and began patrolling the streets. Some workers even proclaimed "libertarian communism." The reason for the revolt was the harsh working conditions in the mines, with long hours and lack of security at the bottom of the shafts, and also the expectations raised by the new rights of assembly and association that the newly approved Spanish Constitution of 1931 recognized.
The following day the conflict had spread to other towns in Alt Llobregat such as Berga, Sallent, Cardona, Balsareny, Navarclés and Súria, where they stopped the mines and closed the shops. In Manresa workers' pickets prevented access to factories and workshops. Telephone lines were cut. In many places the republican flags were replaced by the red and black flags of the CNT. That same day a delegate from the CNT Regional Committee proclaimed in Fígols, in front of the revolutionary committee created by the miners, that "libertarian communism had arrived", news that spread throughout the area.
The following day, 21 January, Manuel Azaña declared before the Cortes: "I am not scared that there are strikes ... because it is a right recognized by law", but no one could take "an attitude of rebellion against the Republic" and that the military had the obligation to intervene against these "excesses". The government of the Republic ordered an armed intervention and thus, on 22 January, the first military units arrived in Manresa and by the next day they had already occupied all the towns in the area except Fígols. The miners had blown up a powder magazine and fled through the mountains. Republican rule was restored and the miners were fired.
On 23 January, when only Fígols remained under insurgent control, the National Committee of the CNT agreed to "give the order to stop all of Spain, accepting it with all its consequences." However, only a few isolated towns in Valencia and Aragon followed in the footsteps of Alt Llobregat. In Alcorisa the insurgents planted two bombs in the Civil Guard barracks, and in Castel de Cabra, the rioters seized "the City Hall, destroyed the tax register and all the documents that were in the archives of the municipal secretary." Infantry troops were sent from Barcelona under the command of Domingo Batet to put an end to the riots. On 24 January Fígols was recaptured by the state, and by 27 January the first anarchist insurrection against the Republic came to an end.
There were many detainees and all CNT centers in the affected regions were closed, but the repressive measure that had the greatest impact was the government's decision to apply the to a hundred detainees, who were deported to the African colonies (Morocco, Western Sahara and Guinea). On 22 January, when the troops occupied Manresa, in Barcelona several anarchist militants were arrested, among whom were the brothers Francisco Ascaso and Domingo Ascaso, Buenaventura Durruti and . They were transferred to the steamship "Buenos Aires", anchored in the port. Four days later there were already more than 200 detainees on the ship. On 28 January a hundred of the deportees started a hunger strike in protest and wrote a manifesto denouncing their defenselessness. Some managed to leave, but on 10 February the "Buenos Aires" set sail from the port of Barcelona with 104 detainees on board. After picking up other detainees in Cádiz, the ship passed through the Canary Islands and finally docked at Villa Cisneros on April 3. On the way, some of the prisoners had fallen ill, one of them died, and others were released. The last deportees returned to the Peninsula in September.
With this mass deportation, the confrontations between the CNT and the republican-socialist government became even more intense. The uprising was also a trigger for a further split within the CNT between the libertarian possibilist tendency and the anarchist, as the strategic differences of each sector began to clash. After publishing a manifesto, Ángel Pestaña and other possibilists were expelled from the CNT and formed the Syndicalist Party, with the intention of participating in state politics.

The Sonni Dynasty, Sunni Dynasty or Si Dynasty was a dynasty of rulers of the Songhai Empire of medieval West Africa. The first ruler of the dynasty, Sunni Ali Kulun probably reigned at the end of the fourteenth century. The last ruler, Sonni Baru, ruled until 1493 when the throne was usurped by the Askiya Muhammad I, the founder of the Askiya Dynasty.
Sources
The seventeenth century chronicles, the Tarikh al-Sudan and the Tarikh al-fattash describe the history of the Songhay people and provide lists of their rulers. The Tarikh al-Sudan gives a list of the earlier rulers of Za Dynasty whose mythical founder Za Alayaman lived before the 10th century and the arrival of Islam. Both chronicles provide details on Ali Kulun (or Ali Golom) the founder of the Sunni dynasty. They revolted against the hegemony of the Mali Empire. A date is not given in the chronicles but the comment in the Tarikh al-fattash that the fifth ruler was in power at time when Mansa Musa made their pilgrimage suggests that Ali Kulun reigned around the end of the 14th century.
Both chronicles associate Ali Kulun (or Ali Golom) with the Mali court. The Tarikh al-Sudan relates that their father was Za Yasoboy, and as a son of a subordinate ruler of the Mali Empire, they had to serve the sultan of Mali.
The chronicles do not specify where the early rulers lived. As there is evidence that Gao remained under Mali control until the early fifteenth century, it is probably that the early Sunni rulers controlled a region to the south, with the town of Kukiya possibly serving as their capital. As the economic strength of Mali Empire relied on controlling routes across the Sahara, it would not have been necessary to control the area to the south of Gao.
Al-Sadi, the author of the Tarikh al-Sudan uses the word Sunni or Sonni for the name of the dynasty while the Tarikh al-fattash uses the forms chi and si'i. The word may have a Malinke origin meaning "a subordinate or confidant of the ruler".
Under the rule of Sunni Sulayperson, the Songhai captured the Mema region to the west of Lake Débo. Their successor, Sunni Ali, greatly expanded the territory under Sunni control. The dynasty ended in April 1493 when Sunni Bakr Dao was defeated in battle against Askiya Muhammad I.
The two chronicles agree on the first and last rulers of the dynasty, but differ on the number and order of the intervening rulers.
Rulers according to the Tarikh al-Sudan
The names with their diacritics listed below are those given in the translation of the Tarikh al-Sudan from Arabic into English by John Hunwick. The surviving Arabic manuscripts differ both in the spelling and the vocalization of the names. This may be partly due to the difficulty of representing Songhay (or proto-Songhay) sounds in Arabic and perhaps also due to different Songhay dialects. Not all the names are listed in all the surviving manuscripts.

Johann Georg Bausum, also known as John George Bausum, (born 8 June 1812 at Rodheim vor der Höhe, near Frankfurt am Main, Germany, died 1 Aug 1855 in Penang, Straits Settlements (today Malaysia)) was a Christian Protestant missionary.
Starting from 1837, they carried on a "flourishing school" with Chinese and Malays in Province Wellesley. When the London Missionary Society, which had been involved in educational outreach to the Chinese on Penang Island since 1819, decided to withdraw from Penang in 1844 to focus their efforts on China, Bausum stepped in to take over the educational work of the LMS mission.
Life and mission work
Bausum's first marriage was to Maria Tarn Dyer, widow of Samuel Dyer, an LMS missionary, in 1845. They were an English missionary and considerably older than himself.
Samuel Dyer worked in Penang from 1827 to 1845 and then at Malacca and Singapore, and produced a "Vocabulary of the Hok-kien Dialect". Maria had three children from their first marriage, all who were born in Penang and who later became missionaries in China. Their daughter, Maria Dyer, eventually married an even more famous missionary, James Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission.
After Dyer's death in Macao, Maria returned to Penang in 1843 to take over the LMS Chinese girl's school. Here, they met Bausum and the two married in 1845. In view of Mrs. Bausum's previous contributions as the wife of an LMS missionary, the London Missionary Society decided to allow the Bausums to make use of the property in exchange for its upkeep. Maria Bausum died in 1946, and their epithet states that "She devoted their life to the extension of Christ's Kingdom among the Chinese females in the Straits...."
After Maria's death, Bausum married Jemima Poppy, a missionary who had come to Penang to work in women's education. The couple wed at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Singapore on 23 May 1848. The couple had four children, Mary Elizabeth (b. 15 October 1849), George Frederick (b. 20 November 1850), Samuel Gottlieb (b. 3 July 1853, d. 19 April 1854) and Louisa Jane (b. 3 March 1855, d. 9 March 1855). Bausum continued their mission in Penang, where they died of heart failure in 1855. The eldest daughter, Mary Elizabeth Bausum (1849–1926), who was born in Penang, sailed to China with the China Inland Mission in 1866 and had a long missionary career in China.
Bausum was an independent missionary and an avowed "dissenter" against the established church. As a way out of financial hardship, Bausum at different times considered working with the Episcopalians, the Presbyterians and the Anglicans, but could not come to any agreement with them or chose not to compromise their beliefs. They later received some support from the China Evangelization Society founded by the famous Charles Gützlaff. Like Gützlaff in China, Bausum in Penang carried on their one-man mission without funding or interference from any church.
In 1847, Bausum wrote to inform the LMS that they had purchased a parcel of land to expand the school at their own expense, which was intended as an addition to the girls' school, but the land was never transferred to the control of the LMS directors.
Following Bausum's death in 1855, the mission premises at Farquhar Street came under the temporary charge of one "G. Gottlieb" – the Harbour Master George Felix Gottlieb, a fellow German. Their letter to the LMS in London, dated January 1860, records the arrival of the Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, whom many regard as the first Brethren missionaries in the Straits Settlements.
During Bausum's time, the Chapel became a well-known gathering place for independent Protestants and non-denominational missionaries in the region. When the LMS wanted to sell off their mission properties, G. F. Gottlieb wrote to advise that a portion of the land on which the girl's school stood now belonged to Bausum's second wife, who had since remarried and was now known as Mrs. Lord. Moreover, a group of petitioners in Penang argued that the LMS had no right to sell the properties because they in part been paid for with donations collected to support the work in Penang. In 1870, the LMS directors sold off the chapel and other properties, but the Brethren managed to hang on to the site purchased by Bausum, and built a new Chapel there in 1876.

Simone Monika Strobel (c.1980 – c.11 to 17 February 2005) was a 25-year-old German kindergarten teacher and backpacker whose body was found at a sportsground in Lismore, New South Wales, six days after being reported missing from the caravan park where they had been staying. An initial inquest in 2007 found insufficient evidence to lay charges over their death.
Murder
Prior to their murder, Strobel - a German national from Würzburg, Bavaria - had been backpacking through Australia with their boyfriend, Tobias Suckfuell, Suckfuell's sister, Katrin, and their friend, Jens Martin. On 11 February 2005, the group checked in to the Lismore Tourist Caravan Park. That evening, they spent the night drinking at the Gollan Hotel, before being ejected at 11.10pm by the bar manager. The group reportedly returned to the caravan park to continue their evening.
The following morning at 10.45am, Suckfuell and Martin reported Strobel missing at the Lismore Police Station, telling the police that they had left the campsite during the night after an argument had broken out between the Suckfuell siblings. The police subsequently put out a public appeal for information and carried out an extensive search.
Strobel's nude body was discovered on 17 February 2005 by the NSW Dog Unit on a bocce court less than 100 metres from the campsite where they had disappeared, covered by palm fronds. Them cause of death is unconfirmed; investigators told the 2007 inquest that they believed their cause of death to be asphyxia or suffocation.
Investigation
Following the discovery of Strobel's body, the Richmond Police District, with assistance from the Würzburg Criminal Police, and the Würzburg Prosecutor's Office, established Strike Force Howea to investigate their murder.
A coronial inquest into Strobel's death was held in 2007, with State Coroner Paul McMahon presiding. Both Tobias and Katrin Suckfuell declined to testify, and Martin was the only member of the group to do so. Ultimately, McMahon ruled that there was insufficient evidence to lay charges for the murder.
In 2014, the Bavarian Office of Criminal Investigation announced a €10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest or conviction. In addition, on 15 October 2020, the New South Wales Government and police announced a $1 million reward.
A second coronial inquest was initially scheduled for February 2021. It has since been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Arrest
In July 2022, Tobias Moran (formerly Tobias Suckfuell) was arrested by Strike Force Howea detectives in Western Australia, in connection with Strobel's murder. They appeared before Perth Magistrates' court on 26 July 2022 and remanded in custody pending extradition to New South Wales, where they will face a court in Sydney. Upon their extradition, Moran was charged with murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Further arrest warrants were issued for Katrin Suckfuell and Jens Martin, in relation to allegations of being accessories after the fact.
Media
Strobel's murder was the subject of the book "Have You Seen Simone?" by Virginia Peters. In 2014, Moran took out an injunction to prevent its publication, and subsequently sued both Peters and the book's publisher, Schwarz Publishing, for defamation. The lawsuit was dropped in 2017.
On 15 July 2017, Strobel's murder was featured in episode 55 of Casefile True Crime Podcast. The episode was subsequently removed and remains unavailable for legal reasons and general details of the podcast itself are still publicly available.

Brian Christopher Tucker (born December 27, 1975) is an American business person and real estate developer. Tucker served as an executive at the Charles Schwab Corporation and founded Punta Brava Golf Club, a private golf and surf club with billionaire Red McCombs and Tiger Woods. Tucker serves on the board of The Century Club of San Diego, which hosts the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course as well as other charitable endeavors.
Biography
Tucker was born in Pasadena, California, and earned degrees in business and economics from Wheaton College and a master's in dispute resolution from The Strauss Institute for Dispute Resolution in the Pepperdine University School of Law, Tucker served as an executive at Charles Schwab Corporation where they managed over $1 billion in assets.
After resigning from Charles Schwab, Tucker discovered a parcel of land hidden at the tip of the Punta Banda peninsula, which extends 7 miles into the Pacific Ocean. The land sits in the middle of the Bay of Todos Santos, which on June 21, 2014 was inducted into the World Surfing Reserves and is one of the 6 events on the World Surf League's Big Wave Tour.
After putting together the project, now called Punta Brava, billionaire Red McCombs partnered with Tucker on the design and entitlement. Because of the unique topography and coastline, the land became one of the most sought after golf design projects in the industry. On June 23, 2008, Tucker met Woods on site to walk their latest routing plan a 6,835-yard par-70 course which included 5 holes with over-ocean carries.
In March 2008 Tiger Woods was awarded the design contract for Punta Brava. The project was formally announced at a private press conference and after party at the Hotel Bel Air on October 7, 2008 with McCombs, Woods, Will Smith and others. When describing the vision of the course design in an interview with Forbes, Tucker remarked "When you have a site surrounded on three sides by the Pacific and a golf designer, Tiger Woods who integrates the ocean into the design.... 17 tees or greens on/adjacent to the ocean… you have an opportunity to create something truly special." Golf writer John Paul Newport, writing for The Wall Street Journal, opined after the conference, "Judging by the layout it's possible that the course will break into the world's top 20 rankings on the day it opens. It looks to be a new and improved version of Cypress Point on California's Monterey Peninsula." In an interview with CNN, Tucker was quoted as saying, "Our goal is to shape golf course history by creating the most spectacular golf course on earth."

Cobb Theatres was an American cinema chain based in Birmingham, Alabama. The company was established in 1921, in Fayette, Alabama, expanding through the South starting in the late 1940s, and buying out General Cinema's West Central Florida theatres and Wometco Theatres in the 1990s before being bought by Regal Cinemas in 1997 and revived in 2001. Cobb operated 25 locations, the majority of which were located in Florida, with others in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina, and Virginia.
History
In 1921, Jefferson A. Richards opened their family's first movie theatre in Fayette, Alabama. Lucille Richards Cobb purchased the theatre from Jefferson in 1934. In 1947, Rowland C. Cobb bought Lucille's two theatres and started building indoor and drive-in theatres throughout northern Alabama.
Notable theatres opened by Cobb included the Thunderbird Drive-In in Atlanta (the South's largest and most modern drive-in theatre) in 1963, the United States' first four-plex theatre in 1971, Cinema City 8 at Birmingham's Roebuck Shopping Center (the largest eight-plex theatre in the US) in 1978, and Sawgrass 18 (promoted as the largest theatre east of the Rocky Mountains) in 1991. Cobb operated 27 theatres by 1965. The following year, Cobb purchased eight theatres in Birmingham, Alabama and moved the company's offices to Birmingham.
Cobb Theatres expanded into South Florida by purchasing General Cinema's theatres in West Central Florida in 1992 and Wometco Theatres in 1994 (forming Cobb Theatres II following the Wometco acquisition), bringing Cobb's screen total to 315. Robert M. Cobb succeeded Rowland as the company's CEO on December 1, 1995. On June 11, 1997, it was announced that Regal Cinemas would acquire Cobb Theatres, which had 643 screens at 67 theatres, for $200 million plus $100 million in debt; Regal completed the acquisition on July 31.
Robert M. Cobb decided to re-enter the cinema industry by forming Cobb Theatres III in 2000. Cobb opened the Dolphin 19 theatre in Miami, Florida on May 25, 2001, attracting 1.4 million visitors. Cobb grew to 11 theatres with 166 screens by 2006. In 2008, Cobb introduced CinéBistro, an elevated premium dinner-and-a-movie concept, in Miami and Tampa. Cobb expanded into Colorado, Virginia and Georgia by 2011, growing to 21 theatres with 253 screens.
In October 2017, Cobb Theatres was acquired by Mexican cinema chain Cinemex; its locations were brought under its U.S. banner CMX.

Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions
On March 8, 2017, Wardlaw ruled that Carlos Bringas-Rodriguez, a gay Mexican, must be given protection from persecution, overruling Castro-Martinez v. Holder. They ruled that Bringas-Rodriguez had suffered past prosecution, as they were abused as a child based on their sexual orientation, and that the Mexican police would not investigate the abuse because of Bringas-Rodriguez's sexual orientation.

City of Los Angeles v. Barr (Sanctuary Cities)
On July 12, 2019, in City of Los Angeles V. Barr, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a nationwide injunction issued in 2018, thus upholding preferential treatment in awarding community policing grants to cities that cooperate with immigration authorities. In the opinion, Judge Sandra Ikuta wrote, "Cooperation relating to enforcement of federal immigration law is in pursuit of the general welfare, and meets the low bar of being germane to the federal interest in providing the funding to "address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise... enhance public safety... one of the main purposes for which” the grant is intended. In their dissent, Judge Wardlaw wrote, "[The Department of Justice's] decision to implement both the illegal immigration focus area and the Cooperation Certification is foreclosed by the text, structure, and purpose of the Community Policing Act."
In July 2019, Wardlaw dissented when the 9th circuit en banc upheld Trump's gag rule which defunded abortion providers from Title X funds.
Tresóna v. Burbank High School
In March 2020, Wardlaw authored the opinion of the court on Tresóna Multimedia v. Burbank High School Vocal Music Ass'n, which held the school choir's usage of the song Magic was fair use, and that the school should be awarded attorney's fees due to Tresóna's "overreaching claims of copyright infringement".

They were born at Kristiansand in Vest-Agder, Norway. They attended the Technical School at Porsgrunn. They graduated from the Norwegian Naval Flight School (Marinens Flygeskole) at Horten in 1919. They were promoted to lieutenant in the Royal Norwegian Navy during 1922.
In 1923 with Roald Amundsen they tried to fly from Wainwright, Alaska to Spitsbergen across the North Pole, but their aircraft was damaged and they abandoned the journey. In 1925, Omdal was a mechanic on Lincoln Ellsworth and Roald Amundsen's attempted flight to the North Pole.
Disappearance
Omdal took off on December 23, 1927 from Curtiss Field on Long Island, New York with Frances Wilson Grayson, navigator Brice Goldsborough and engineer Frank Koehler headed for Harbor Grace in Newfoundland. This flight was in preparation for Grayson's planned crossing of the Atlantic Ocean to set the record for the first woman to cross. The twin-engine air-craft Dawn, an amphibious Sikorsky S-36, and its crew never arrived. No trace of the plane or the four aviators was found.
Legacy
Oscar Omdal street in Stavanger and Oscar Omdal terrace in the Hamresanden district of Kristiansand are both named after him.
In 1928, the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927, mainly in attempting oceanic flights. These include Goldsborough Lake (), Grayson Lake () and Omdahl Lake () which are in close proximity to each other in the Wabakimi Provincial Park.

Arthur Thibert is a comic book artist, primarily known as a freelance inker, although they have a substantial résumé as a penciler and has even written some comics. Thibert is best known for their work as an inker for Marvel Comics on their various X-Men titles during the 1990s.
Freelance inker
Thibert broke into comics in 1986, as an inker for WaRP Graphics' Myth Adventures. They truly latched on to the industry in 1989, becoming regular inker (over Dan Jurgens' pencils) for DC's The Adventures of Superman until 1991.
From 1991 to 2004 (with a break from 1993 to 1995), Thibert inked almost exclusively for Marvel, many of those years spent on their X-Men titles. They inked X-Factor for much of 1991, and was the regular inker of X-Men vol. 2 in 1992.
From 1993 to 1995, Thibert associated themselves with the "upstart" Image Comics, where they primarily inked covers, for such titles as Spawn, Supreme, Team Youngblood, and Brigade.
Returning to Marvel, Thibert inked Carlos Pacheco on X-Men vol. 2 from 1996 to 1998. They also returned to X-Factor in 1997. In addition, during the 1990s Thibert inked over twenty issues of The Uncanny X-Men. From 1999 to 2000, Thibert inked virtually the entire run of Bishop: The Last X-Man (over penciller Georges Jeanty). They were the regular inker of Ultimate X-Men in 2001 (over Adam Kubert), and again from 2003 to 2004 (over David Finch).
Other regular inking duties Thibert performed during this period included Fantastic Four vol. 3 (over Salvador Larroca) from 1998 to 2000; and Ultimate Spider-Man (over Mark Bagley's pencils) from 2000 to 2004.
In 2005, Thibert moved back to DC, where they inked the Outsiders from 2005 to 2007, mostly over Matthew Clark's pencils. During this period they also penciled and inked covers for The Flash. In 2007, Thibert was the regular inker of The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive; and in 2008 they returned to inking Mark Bagley on DC's Trinity title.
Creator-owned projects
In 1994, Image also published three issues of Thibert's own title Black and White.
In 2004, Image published one issue of Thibert's creator-owned series Chrono Mechanics (co-written with Rich Birdsall), a light-hearted adventure series about four very different individuals (human and otherwise) that were brought together to "fix" time. In 2006, Alias Enterprises published four more issues of the title.
Hack Shack Studios
Thibert owns and operates Art Thibert's Hack Shack Studios, a California-based art and design studio serving the "television, advertising, comic book, and movie industries. Notable clients include Marvel Comics, DC Comics, MGM, TV Guide, and MTV." Projects in the works from Hack Shack include Rock 'N' Roll Botz, Kid Everything, and The Nightmare Files.
Awards
Thibert has twice won the Wizard Fan Award for Favorite Inker, in 2001 and 2002. In addition, they were nominated for a 1992 Eisner Award for Best Inker (for their work on The Uncanny X-Men). In 2011 Thibert was awarded the Props Award for inker deserving more recognition by the Inkwell Awards.

Storeria dekayi, commonly known as De Kay's brown snake, De Kay's snake, and simply the brown snake (along with many others), is a small non-venomous species of snake in the family Colubridae. The species is native to North America and Central America.
Geographic range
S. dekayi is native to Southern Ontario and Quebec, most of the eastern half of the United States, through Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and possibly El Salvador. More specifically, this common species inhabits most wetland and terrestrial habitats east of the Great Plains from sea level to 1,400 meters (4,600 feet) above sea level.
Description
Dorsally, S. dekayi is brown to gray with a lighter center stripe bordered by small black spots; ventrally, it is lighter brown or pink with small black dots at the ends of the ventral scales. Adults usually measure less than in total length (including tail), but the record total length is . The dorsal scales are keeled, and it has no L'Oréal scale.
Reproduction
Like other natricine snakes such as water snakes (genus Nerodia) and garter snakes (genus Thamnophis), S. dekayi is a viviparous species, giving birth to live young. Sexual maturity is reached at two to three years. Mating takes place in the spring, after snakes emerge from brumation. Between 3 and 41 young are born in late summer.
Diet
S. dekayi primarily feeds on slugs, snails, and earthworms. In the southern extent of its region the snake usually preys predominantly on earth worms, however in the northern reaches of its range slugs are the predominant food source. It has specialized jaws that allow it to remove snails from their shells for consumption. Reports of other invertebrates (such as woodlice, mites, or millipedes) in the diet of S. dekayi are more than likely the result of accidental ingestion rather than intentional feeding, in which one of these invertebrates may have adhered to a slug or other prey item being consumed.
Ecology
S. dekayi is a prey item for larger snakes, large frogs and toads, birds, and many mammals including weasels.
Etymology
The specific name, dekayi, is in honor of American zoologist James Ellsworth De Kay (1792–1851), who collected the first specimen on Long Island, New York, while the generic name, Storeria, honors zoologist David Humphreys Storer.
This is the only North American snake whose binomial is a double honorific – that is, both the generic name and the specific name honor people.

The Col de la République or Col de Grand Bois () is a mountain pass in the Pilat massif within the Pilat Regional Natural Park in the Loire department of the Rhône-Alpes region in southern France. Located on the D1082 (ex-RN 82 ) in the commune of Saint-Genest-Malifaux, it connects Saint-Étienne with Annonay in the Rhône valley. The road was constructed in 1830 and the col has an altitude of 1,161 metres.
It was the first climb on the first Tour de France in 1903, but was the scene of notorious violence in 1904 that involved fighting and officials firing gunshot warnings. It has been part of the route on 13 occasions.
History
The name 'La République' and that of the nearby hamlet of 'La République' derive from the attempt by members of the Beguine religious sect to found an independent community there called the Republic of Jesus Christ. The Beguines were well established in Saint-Jean-Bonnefonds, but in November 1794 they moved 20 kilometres to the plateau to be ready for the arrival of the prophet Elijah.
Cycling
Details of the climb
From Saint-Étienne (north), the climb is 17 km long. Over this distance, it gains 644 m at an average of 3.8%. The maximum gradient is 6.3%.
From the south, the climb starts at Bourg-Argental; from here, the ascent is 12 km long, climbing 626 m at an average of 5.2%, with a maximum of 7.9%.
Vélocio
At the top is a monument in memory of Paul de Vivie, who wrote under the pseudonym Vélocio and was important in the development of bicycle touring. The col de la République was their favourite morning ride. Every year since 1922 the volunteers of the 'Comité Vélocio de Saint-Étienne' have organized the Journée Vélocio (Vélocio Day-Trip), a 12.788 km climb of the col.
Tour de France
The col de la République was the first pass of over 1,000 metres crossed by the Tour de France, in 1903 during the second stage of the first Tour de France (Lyons - Marseilles via Saint-Étienne) when Hippolyte Aucouturier was the first rider to reach the summit.
The following year, in the 1904 Tour de France, it was the scene of some of the most notorious violence in the history of the tour when supporters of the regional favourite Antoine Fauré attacked their opponents. This caused the organizers to avoid the Loire department until the 1950 Tour de France. In 1905, the tour's organiser Henri Desgrange chose to ignore the col de la République, and focused instead on the introduction of the Ballon d'Alsace, because they saw that they had missed the opportunity of publicity previously.
In the 1904 incident, Andre Fauré led the race and 200 fans tried to stop the rest of the cyclists from following him. Garin hurt their hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired shots in the air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires. Because of this help, Fauré was the first on top of the col, but was over-taken by the favourites later.
At the summit a sign post says
Col de la République
1er col à plus de 1000 mètres franchi par le tour de France cycliste le 5 juillet 1903
(The 1st col higher than 1,000 metres traversed by the cycling Tour de France on 5 July 1903)
Appearances
The col has been used 13 times in the Tour de France, and the first rider to cross the summit on each occasion was:

Somebody's Daughter is the third studio album by Australian country singer Gina Jeffreys. It was released in June 1998 and became Jeffreys' second top twenty albums after it debuted at No.13 It was certified Gold in Australia.
The album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Country Album at the 1998 ceremony. It lost out to "My Own Sweet Time " by Shanley Del.
The album contained the song "Dancin' With Elvis" which won Jeffreys their fourth 'Female Vocalist of the Year' award at the 1999 Tamworth Country Music Awards of Australia.
Review
Rosie Adsett of Country Update said; "Somebody's Daughter is the musical reflection of the maturity of Gina Jeffreys. Part of that development is Gina's partnership with one of Australia's finest musicians, Rod McCormack. Together they have written more than half the songs on this album including the very moving "That'll Be Me". The first single from this album "Dancin' With Elvis" has captured the media's imagination with its catchy tune and clever lyric. Gina's duet with Billy Dean "Have We Forgotten What Love Is" is sure to be all over the airwaves after Billy's visit "down-under" to perform at the Gympie Muster. This is the first album Gina has recorded in Nashville and it has given them the opportunity to work with some of the all-time great country musicians. Eddy Bayers on Drums, Brent Mason on Guitar, Sam Bush on Mandolin, Dave Pomeroy on Bass, Mat Rollings on Piano, and that's just some of the Nashville crew. They are joined by Aussies Michel Rose on steel, Jeff McCormack on bass, and Rod McCormack on guitar. All those involved with this work have good reason to be proud. It sounds like it was a pleasure to make this CD but it's evident that there was an enormous amount of work and talent invested in it."

The Inevitable Revolution (Неизбежный переворот) is an essay written by Leo Tolstoy on July 5, 1909 about abolishing the law of violence and replacing it with the law of love. It is generally considered a text on civil disobedience, pacifism, and anarchism, and it is Tolstoy's last non-fiction work detailing their final opinions on political, economic, and religious issues.
Content
In it, they criticize prisons, parliaments, wars, conscription, capitalism, theft, revolutionary violence, and taxes, and praises Christianity's message of love as the solution to these problems, although they recognize the law of love in other religions, as well. Tolstoy asked people not to directly commit any violence (as a soldier, etc.), not to take part in violence (working for the government, etc.), and not to approve of violence (in writing or speech, etc.).
Within the literary academic community
It was translated from Russian to English in 1975 by Dr. Ronald Sampson, lecturer in Politics at the University of Bristol, England, and published by Housmans jointly with the Fellowship of Reconciliation. It was previously published in The New York Times on September 26, 1909. The original text of the essay is drawn from the Russian Jubilee edition of Tolstoy's Complete collected works. The essay is considered critical by academics E. I. Pats'orka and A. N. Koshechko in understanding Tolstoy's pedagogical ideas. The text is also considered critical by academic G. M. Hamburg in understanding historian Boris Eikhenbaum's incorrect assessment on Tolstoy's opinion of Vekhi, a collection of essays written by the Russian intelligentsia. The academic Alexandre J. M. E. Christoyannopoulos also considers this text when comparing the political influence of religion, notably terrorism, with the peaceful and love-based vision proposed by Tolstoy. In 2018, I.F. Salmanova compared Tolstoy's 1909 diary entries with The Inevitable Revolution to reveal Tolstoy's literary mechanism.

Josef Franz, Archduke of Austria, Prince of Hungary (Josef Franz Leopold Anton Ignatius Maria; 28 March 1895 – 25 September 1957), was the eldest son of Archduke Joseph August of Austria and Princess Auguste Maria of Bavaria. As their father was the last Palatine of Hungary and was briefly considered a possible King of Hungary in 1919–1920, Josef Franz was a potential crown prince of Hungary.
They were born during the reign of their great-grandfather (on their mother's side), Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria, who was also their second cousin once removed on their father's side.

In enzymology, a polyenoic fatty acid isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoate (5Z,7E,9E,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoate
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoate, and one product, (5Z,7E,9E,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoate Delta8,11-Delta7,9-isomerase (trans-double-bond-forming). Other names in common use include PFI, eicosapentaenoate cis-Delta5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoate, cis-Delta5-trans-Delta7,9-cis-Delta14,17 isomerase, (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-eicosapentaenoate Delta8,11-Delta7,8-isomerase, (incorrect), (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-eicosapentaenoate Delta8,11-Delta7,9-isomerase, and (trans-double-bond-forming).

Spectacular! is a 2009 musical comedy-drama film that aired on Nickelodeon and YTV. It stars Canadian singer Nolan Gerard Funk, Australian singer Tammin Sursok, Victoria Justice and Simon Curtis with Matthew Bennett, Andrea Lewis, Shannon Chan-Kent, Joel Ballard, and Avan Jogia. Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, it premiered February 16, 2009 on Nickelodeon, and YTV on May 8, 2009. The soundtrack was released on February 3, 2009, with a full webstream on MTV.com released the previous week.
Spectacular! attracted 3.7 million viewers during its premiere.
Plot
As the opening credits roll, a band called Flux, apparently with no singer, starts to play at a nightclub. Among the audience is a girl named Courtney Lane (Tammin Sursok). Interspersed with the scenes of the band playing, lead singer Nikko Alexander (Nolan Gerard Funk) calmly walks into the club through the back, barely making their cue for "Don't Tell Me". At the end of the song, they kick over one of the amps, destroying it for effect. After the performance, the other members of Flux, upset by their carelessness, kick them out of the band; Nikko's girlfriend Amy (Britt Irvin), who is also in the band, dumps him. After the band members leave, Courtney frantically attempts to recruit Nikko into a show choir named "Spectacular!," of which they are leader. Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects their offer, Courtney begs them to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make their decision.
The next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the Spectacular! show choir perform "Eye of the Tiger". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group's performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering them half the group's earnings from the contest in exchange for their consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that they aren't interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named Ta-da performs "Things We Do for Love". The lead singers are Royce (Simon Curtis), who used to be the lead singer for Spectacular! but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi (Victoria Justice), Royce's new girlfriend who is a snobby and selfish girl. It is hinted they were a member of "Spectacular!" because of the number of times Courtney calls them a backstabber and that the letter I in their name stand for the "ice in their veins". Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson (Matthew Bennett), who informs them that they have a shot at getting a record deal if they can raise enough money for equipment for their demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney's offer of half the earnings from the contest Spectacular! plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for their demo. When they approach the choir Courtney remembers their mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let them join, but acquiesces after Nikko demonstrates their talent by performing "Break My Heart" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by their vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with their older brother Stavros (Christopher Jacot), does not inform their brother that they have joined show choir or that they are attempting to get a record deal because they know Stavros would not approve.
Several days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and their old band, Flux, had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into their old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from Flux. Meanwhile, Ta-da, who are also at the club, performs their song "Lonely Love Song". Nikko discovers from the other Spectacular! members that Royce is Courtney's ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing Ta-da's good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help Spectacular! win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs "Your Own Way", persuading the others to join in, Nikko sang the beginning of the song, and ask the others to show some talents, Tajid (Avan Jogia) started beatboxing, then other members Janet (Shannon Chan-Kent), Caspian (Joel Ballard) and Robin (Andrea Lewis) showcase their singing talent. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney's wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko's house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney they would be impressed and may agree to change the group's style. The choir assembles at Nikko's house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon.
Nikko learns of Spectacular!s tradition of gathering for a bowling night the week before a competition. Only four members, Nikko, Courtney, Caspian and Janet, show up at the bowling alley, where they discover that Tammi and Royce are already bowling in their lane. After a brief confrontation between the two groups, Nikko persuades the others to perform a song using "Rock The World," a spoof of the real-life video game Rock Band. Random selection chooses a song called "For the First Time", which was Courtney and Royce's old duet. They and Nikko sing it, much to Royce's jealousy, and Nikko and Courtney are becoming attracted to each other. Nikko invites Courtney over to their house for a surprise, and when they get there the whole group has assembled on Nikko's rooftop, where they all perform "Your Own Way" for Courtney. Courtney, instead of being impressed, is upset, accusing Nikko to have betrayed them by practicing another routine behind their back, and then leaves.
Later that night, Nikko goes to Courtney's house to apologize and almost has a fistfight with Royce, who has come to ask Courtney to get back together with him. Courtney rejects Royce, who tauntingly tells Nikko that Ta-Da will beat Spectacular! at the competition in the "weirdest trash talk that [Nikko's] ever heard." After Royce leaves, Nikko apologizes to Courtney for taking control of the group behind their back and offers to do things their way, but Courtney admits that the group needs a change. Courtney's mother tells Nikko that they can bring some good and change to the "Spectacular!" group and that Courtney will know how far they are actually able to push the envelope to win. The two of them decide to combine their talents and perform a song that everyone can agree upon, and Mr. Romano (Greg Germann), their music teacher, suggests a song called "Something to Believe In". Spectacular! begins intense rehearsals and all seems well ("Just Freak"), until Mr. Dickinson pays Nikko and Stavros a visit and informs them that their boss is offering Nikko and Flux a record deal after an audition and will only be available on Saturday night. Knowing that Spectacular! is scheduled to perform at the concert on Saturday night, Nikko is torn between their commitment to the choir and their one shot at getting a record deal. They try to inform Courtney of their decision to audition for the record deal, but cannot bring themselves to do it. Meanwhile, Amy informs Stavros that Nikko has joined choir and Stavros confronts Nikko in front of the members of Spectacular!, insisting that Niko drop out of choir and audition for the record deal instead. The other members of Spectacular! are upset at Nikko for bailing on them at the last minute, and Courtney feels that Nikko has betrayed them again.
Mr. Romano visits Nikko, who is having a tough time deciding what to do, at their house and reveals that they were once in a famous band as Joey Rome that could have been more successful if they hadn't flopped and broke their contract due to their fear of taking risks. Before leaving to go audition for the record deal, Courtney shows up. Nikko fears that they are mad at them for turning their back on "Spectacular!" but instead they kiss them on the cheek and wishes them luck. On concert night, Ta-Da performs "On The Wings Of A Dream" and earns much applause and acclaim from the audience. Meanwhile, Nikko and Flux perform at their audition for the record deal, but Nikko's heart is not in it and the producers notice and tell them they are not interested; Stavros says that Nikko is just warming up, and that they are better than what they are giving out. Nikko begs them to let them show where their "heart is." When it is Spectacular!s turn to sing "Something to Believe In" at the national competition, Nikko, much to Courtney's surprise and delight, arrives onstage right before the chorus, belting out a long note. Flux joins him, playing background music, and Mr. Romano reprises their dream as a rock star by playing a guitar during the song. Nikko and Courtney reconcile, and the group earns a standing ovation.
Ta-Da is announced as the winner of the contest and Spectacular! is disqualified because Flux were unregistered members of the act. Tammi reveals to Royce that they had only used them to win the contest and breaks up with him. Even though Spectacular! lost the contest, Nikko's amazing performance got them the record deal. After everyone leaves, Nikko and Courtney share a kiss. It ends with Spectacular!, Flux, and Mr. Romano in a studio together recording a song, suitably named "Everything Can Change", with Nikko and Courtney as the lead singers in the song.

Les Scadding is an English former mechanic who acquired media attention as the winner of £45,500,000 on the EuroMillions lottery in 2009, aged 53.
Following their win, they invested a portion of the money in becoming the major shareholder of Newport County A.F.C., and acted as the club's chairperson between 2012 and 2015.
Biography
Born in Bristol, Scadding and their first wife Rose-Marie had three children. At the time of their lottery win, Scadding had for some time been resident in Newport, Wales, where they lived with their second wife and co-lottery winner, Samantha Peachey-Scadding.
Scadding had been unemployed for a year before buying the winning ticket, and had overcome testicular cancer five years earlier.
In June 2009, Scadding and their wife won £45.5 million through the lottery EuroMillions. At that time aged 53, their wife 38, Scadding gave each of their three children from their first marriage an undisclosed seven-figure sum, but did not share any with their mother.
Television
In August 2014, Scadding presented a four-part TV series for ITV featuring Welsh lottery winners, titled "The Welsh Millionaires Club".
Newport County
In August 2012, Scadding succeeded Chris Blight as the chairperson of Newport County A.F.C., shortly after accepting an offer to join their board of directors. Just over eight months after they took the position, Newport defeated fellow Welsh club Wrexham in the 2013 Conference Premier play-off Final to gain promotion to the Football League following a 25-year absence under manager Justin Edinburgh.
On 18 June 2015, Scadding resigned their positions as both the chairperson and a director at Newport County. It was later reported that Scadding wished to spend more time at their holiday home in Barbados. On 1 October 2015 Newport County Supporters' Trust took over ownership of the club.

Library assessment is a process undertaken by libraries to learn about the needs of users (and non-users) and to evaluate how well they support these needs, in order to improve library facilities, services and resources. In many libraries successful library assessment is dependent on the existence of a 'culture of assessment' in the library whose goal is to involve the entire library staff in the assessment process and to improve customer service.
Although most academic libraries have collected data on the size and use of their collections for decades, it is only since the late 1990s that many have embarked on a systematic process of assessment (see sample workplans) by surveying their users as well as their collections. Today, many academic libraries have created the position of Library Assessment Manager in order to coordinate and oversee their assessment activities. In addition, many libraries publish on their web sites the improvements that were implemented following their surveys as a way of demonstrating accountability to survey participants.
Several libraries have undertaken renovation or expansion projects as a result of their assessment activities as well as enhance resource discovery tools, improve web site usability and stop redundant services.
Tools
In order to determine what is important to library users and how satisfied they are with services, resources and physical space, library assessment utilizes a variety of research methods such as: website usability testing, observation, 'In-Library Use' surveys, focus groups, interviews, wayfinding, balanced scorecard, furniture usability, photo and mapping surveys, organizational climate, statistics and satisfaction surveys. The most widely used library satisfaction survey is LibQUAL+, a service quality evaluation survey developed by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) based on ServQUAL. Other satisfaction surveys are: the SCONUL Satisfaction Survey, Insync Surveys (formerly Rodski), and Counting Opinions LibSat survey.
During last decades diffusion of public sector evaluation culture created prerequisites for libraries to guide public administration principles. It enables public administration institutions and libraries among them to activate assessment of their activities. Even some authors suggested public administration approach for assessment of the library performance, that based on the following criteria's: (i) library infrastructure; (ii) innovations; (iii) human resources; (iv) quality of the place.
USA, UK, Australia and Israel
Although library assessment has become almost ubiquitous in the United States, Australia, UK and some European countries such as Italy and Denmark since 2000, it is still relatively uncommon elsewhere. Below are a selection of library assessment sites that show the multitude of activities undertaken by assessment teams: University of Washington, USA; University of Virginia, USA; University of York, UK, Council of Australian University Libraries (CAUL).
One notable exception is Israel whose University of Haifa Younes and Soraya Nazarian Library began a systematic process of library assessment in 2007, and has been conducting a Hebrew version of the University of Washington's 'In-Library Use' survey since 2008, and LibQUAL+ Lite (also in Hebrew) since 2009 in three-yearly cycles.
Conferences
The library assessment community holds two biennial conferences: the Library Assessment Conference (LAC) in the USA and the Library Performance Measurement Conference (LibPMC), formerly the Northumbria Performance Measurement Conference which is generally held in Europe. Also relevant are the annual Qualitative and Quantitative Methods in Libraries Conference (QQML) and the annual Evidence Based Library and Information Practice Conference (EBLIP).
Courses
Although courses on library assessment are not commonplace on the curricula of library schools, in the past few years several schools have opened courses, such as: the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science and the joint Digital Library Program of Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Norway, Tallinn University, Estonia, and the University of Parma, Italy.

St. Ignatius Church is a Roman Catholic parish church of the Archdiocese of Washington located at 2315 Brinkley Rd., Fort Washington, MD 20744, in Oxon Hill, Prince George's County, Maryland. The historic church structure was constructed between 1890 and 1891. The -story structure is wood frame, with clapboarding, and shingling in imbricated pattern. It is rectangular in form with a gabled roof, projecting front belfry with spire and louvered openings, round arched openings, and modified corner buttresses. The architectural style is considered Eclectic, with elements of the Shingle and Queen Anne styles. It is the second church on site and has served as a mission and parish church. The original church, built in 1849, was partially funded by Mary Surratt, one of the conspirators involved with the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
The present church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
St. Luke's Catholic Church (Ordinariate) entered into a shared community arrangement at the historic building as of September 2019. Under the agreement between the Archdiocese of Washington and the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, the pastor of St. Luke's also serves as administrator of St. Ignatius. The principal Sunday Mass and masses during the week are now celebrated according to the Ordinariate's traditional prayer book English liturgy in Divine Worship: The Missal. Masses Saturday evening and early Sunday morning continue to be celebrated in the Ordinary Form of the Roman Missal. Details of the schedule are at the parish websites referenced below.

Isaac Newton "Ike" "Newt" Fisher (June 28, 1871 – February 28, 1947) was an American Major League Baseball catcher. They played for the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League in . Fisher helped organize the Southern Association, a higher-level minor league, and led its Nashville Baseball Club to win the first two Southern Association pennants (1901 and 1902) as a player-manager.
Early life
Fisher was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 28, 1871. Their younger brother, Bob Fisher, played seven seasons in the National League from 1912 to 1919.
Career
Fisher was a member of the Nashville Athletic Club. During the July 6, 1893, Southern League game between the Nashville Tigers and Memphis Fever Germs, they were recruited to temporarily take the place of injured outfielder Jack Keenan. They played center field and had four at-bats with no hits in their only game with the club.
Fisher began their professional career with the Southern League's Augusta Electricians in 1893, before joining the Atlanta Atlantas in 1894. In 1895, they played for the Chattanooga Warriors/Mobile Bluebirds. They continued with the Mobile Blackbirds in 1896, but also played for the Western League's Detroit Tigers. They were a member of the Western League's Columbus Senators in 1897 and played most of the 1898 season with the Minneapolis Millers.
Fisher made their major league debut on May 17, 1898, with the National League's Philadelphia Phillies. In nine games, they played eight at catcher and one at third base. Through their final game on July 1, Fisher recorded three hits, made one double, stole one base, and had a .115 batting average. They found themselves back with Minneapolis in 1899 and 1900.
In late 1900, Fisher, along with other baseball men, organized a new Southern baseball league, the Southern Association. One of its charter members was the Nashville Baseball Club, which would come to be known as the Nashville Vols in 1908. Fisher served as the team's owner and player-manager. Under their leadership from 1901 to 1905, Nashville won the first two Southern Association pennants (1901 and 1902). Fisher sold the team and retired from baseball in 1905. They briefly come out of retirement to play catcher for the South Atlantic League's Macon Peaches in 1908.
Fisher died in Chicago on February 28, 1947.

Mats Andersson, born 1954, is a Swedish financier and asset manager. After previous work at Warburg, Deutsche Bank, and Skandia Liv, they assumed the role as CEO for one of Sweden's major pension funds Fjärde AP-fonden (AP4) where they led the work to redirect investments in the energy sector towards fossil free companies within the government directive Fossilfritt Sverige (Fossil Free Sweden) that engages more than 200 companies, municipalities, counties, regions, and other organizations. They also actively collaborated with the United Nations to raise awareness of the risks climate change brings, from a finance and investment perspective.
Andersson was a driving force behind the project Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition (PDC) that was founded and co-financed by AP4 along with United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), Amundi, and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The initiative was implemented by Andersson by having AP4 significantly reduce or let go entirely of held shares in American companies with a large carbon footprint, combined with a strategy for investments on emerging markets in companies with a small footprint.
Andersson was awarded the Chief Investment Officer's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016. In 2015 they were ranked fifth on the Financial News "100 Most Influential List" in the pension fund category, and the same year fourth on the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institutes "Public Investor 100" list.
They left AP4 in March 2016 to, among other things, act as Vice Chairman of the Global Challenges Foundation with special focus on global governance and global catastrophic risks. In December 2016 they were appointed Royal Commissioner by the Swedish government to "map how the market for green bonds can be promoted.

Helcystogramma fiscinata is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1918. It is found in South Africa.
The wingspan is about 10 mm. The forewings are ochreous whitish, marked between the veins with brown lines irrorated (sprinkled) with dark fuscous, less marked and incomplete on the costal two-fifths, strong on the rest of the wing, especially two terminating beneath the apex in a suffused terminal spot. There are very oblique suffused dark fuscous lines from the costa at one-fifth, two-fifths and four-fifths, crossing the costal two-fifths. The stigmata is small, dark fuscous and slightly edged with whitish, with the plical somewhat before the first discal. The hindwings are grey.

Herbert Henry Bullmore MB ChB Edin MRCPE FRACP (12 July 1874 – 28 December 1937) was a rugby union player who represented Scotland, a leading physician and the grandfather of Australian media magnate Kerry Packer.
Life history
Bullmore was born in Ipswich, Queensland in 1874, the only son, along with five daughters, of grazier and unsuccessful political candidate Edward Augustus Bullmore, Esq and Caroline Frederica Bullmore, and was educated at Ipswich Grammar School, Queensland. While in Australia, Bullmore made a name for themselves as a sportsman, going as far as being chosen to represent Queensland at rugby union. Bullmore spent three years studying law, before deciding to undertake medical studies at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, graduating in 1902. During this time Bullmore continued to indulge their sporting nature, gaining a blue in football and rowing and starring as a sturdy second-rower for the university rugby union team. From 1901 to 1902 Bullmore was President of Edinburgh University Union. By dint of their medical degree at Edinburgh, Bullmore was available for selection to the Scotland rugby teams and was selected to represent Scotland as a forward in a match against Ireland in Belfast on 22 February 1902, with Scotland losing 5–0.
Bullmore served as a resident at the Royal Infirmary and at the Children's Hospital, Edinburgh, gaining their Membership of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1904. They then practised in Bath for a while before returning to Australia to practice as a consulting physician in Sydney.
Appointed an honorary physician at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, in 1912, Bullmore treated leading Australian cricketer Victor Trumper during Trumper's final days suffering from Bright's disease. Bullmore would later also be appointed honorary physician at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, in 193, was an honorary major in the Australian Army Medical Corps and one of the founders of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians.
While Bullmore retired from rugby, soccer and rowing to concentrate on their medical career, they continued to be involved in sporting interests, including motor cycling, tennis, golf and angling.
Bullmore died suddenly at their residence "Altona" in Point Piper, Sydney on 28 December 1937. Their funeral was held at All Saints Church, Woollahra and was cremated. Their estate was worth £9,944.
Personal life
Bullmore married Melbourne-born Elfrida Buttner, the daughter of Dr Alexander Buttner, at St Andrew's Church, Ashley-place, London on 24 August 1904 and together they had a son and four daughters. Bullmore's son Herbert James Bullmore was a Flyer-Officer in the Royal Australian Air Force who was killed in action in New Guinea during World War II, while one of Bullmore's daughters was Mary Horden, fashion editor of The Australian Women's Weekly from 1946 to 1957 and another was Gretel Packer, the wife of Sir Frank Packer and the mother of Australian media magnate Kerry Packer.

Nylon 66 (loosely written nylon 6-6, nylon 6/6, nylon 6,6, or nylon 6:6) is a type of polyamide or nylon. It, and nylon 6, are the two most common for textile and plastic industries. Nylon 66 is made of two monomers each containing 6 carbon atoms, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid, which give nylon 66 its name.
Synthesis and manufacturing
Hexamethylenediamine (top) and adipic acid (bottom), monomers used for polycondensation of Nylon 66.
Nylon 66 is synthesized by polycondensation of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid. Equivalent amounts of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid are combined with water in a reactor. This is crystallized to make nylon salt, an ammonium/carboxylate mixture. The nylon salt goes into a reaction vessel where polymerization process takes place either in batches or continuously.n(HOOC - (CH2)4 - COOH) + n(H2N - (CH2)6 - NH2) -> [-OC - (CH2)4 - CO - NH - (CH2)6 - NH - ]_n + (2n - 1)H2O Removing water drives the reaction toward polymerization through the formation of amide bonds from the acid and amine functions. Thus molten nylon 66 is formed. It can either be extruded and granulated at this point or directly spun into fibers by extrusion through a spinneret (a small metal plate with fine holes) and cooling to form filaments.
Applications
In 2011 worldwide production was two million tons. At that time, fibers consumed just over half of production and engineering resins the rest. It is not used in films due to its inability to be oriented. Fiber markets represented 55% of the 2010 demand with engineering thermoplastics being the remainder.
Nylon 66 is frequently used when high mechanical strength, rigidity, good stability under heat and/or chemical resistance are required. It is used in fibers for textiles and carpets and molded parts. For textiles, fibers are sold under various brands, for example Nilit brands or the Cordura brand for luggage, but it is also used in airbags, apparel, and for carpet fibres under the Ultron brand. Nylon 66 lends itself well to make 3D structural objects, mostly by injection molding. It has broad use in automotive applications; these include "under the hood" parts such as radiator end tanks, rocker covers, air intake manifolds, and oil pans, as well as numerous other structural parts such as hinges, and ball bearing cages. Other applications include electro-insulating elements, pipes, profiles, various machine parts, zip ties, conveyor belts, hoses, polymer-framed weapons, and the outer layer of turnout blankets. Nylon 66 is also a popular guitar nut material.
Nylon 66, especially glass fiber reinforced grades, can be effectively fire retarded with halogen-free products. Phosphorus-based flame retardant systems are used in these fire-safe polymers and are based on aluminium diethyl phosphinate and synergists. They are designed to meet UL 94 flammability tests as well as Glow Wire Ignition Tests (GWIT), Glow Wire Flammability Test (GWFI) and Comparative Tracking Index (CTI). Its main applications are in the electrical and electronics (E&E) industry.
The Remington Nylon 66 was a .22 rifle manufactured by Remington Arms from 1959 to 1989. The firearm's stock and receiver were both made from Dupont Zytel nylon resin.

A pulsating white dwarf is a white dwarf star whose luminosity varies due to non-radial gravity wave pulsations within itself. Known types of pulsating white dwarfs include DAV, or ZZ Ceti, stars, with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA; DBV, or V777 Her, stars, with helium-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB; and GW Vir stars, with atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen, and the spectral type PG 1159. (Some authors also include non-PG 1159 stars in the class of GW Vir stars.) GW Vir stars may be subdivided into DOV and PNNV stars; they are not, strictly speaking, white dwarfs but pre-white dwarfs which have not yet reached the white dwarf region on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A subtype of DQV stars, with carbon-dominated atmospheres, has also been proposed, and in May 2012, the first extremely low mass variable (ELMV) white dwarf was reported.
These variables all exhibit small (1%–30%) variations in light output, arising from a superposition of vibrational modes with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds. Observation of these variations gives asteroseismological evidence about the interiors of white dwarfs.
DAV stars
Early calculations suggested that white dwarfs should vary with periods around 10 seconds, but searches in the 1960s failed to observe this. The first variable white dwarf found was HL Tau 76; in 1965 and 1966, Arlo U. Landolt observed it to vary with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes. The reason for this period being longer than predicted is that the variability of HL Tau 76, like that of the other pulsating variable white dwarfs known, arises from non-radial gravity wave pulsations. In 1970, another white dwarf, Ross 548, was found to have the same type of variability as HL Tau 76; in 1972, it was given the variable star designation ZZ Ceti. The name ZZ Ceti also refers to this class of pulsating variable white dwarfs, which, as it consists of white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres, is also called DAV. These stars have periods between 30 seconds and 25 minutes and are found in a rather narrow range of effective temperatures between about 12,500 and 11,100 K. The measurement of the rate of change of period with time for the gravity wave pulsations in ZZ Ceti stars is a direct measurement of the cooling timescale for a DA white dwarf, which in turn can give an independent measurement of the age of the galactic disk.
DBV stars
In 1982, calculations by Don Winget and their coworkers suggested that helium-atmosphere DB white dwarfs with surface temperatures around 19,000 K should also pulsate. Winget then searched for such stars and found that GD 358 was a variable DB, or DBV, white dwarf. This was the first prediction of a class of variable stars before their observation. In 1985, this star was given the designation V777 Her, which is also another name for this class of variable stars. These stars have effective temperatures around 25,000K.
GW Vir stars
The third known class of pulsating variable white dwarfs is the GW Vir stars, sometimes subdivided into DOV and PNNV stars. Their prototype is PG 1159-035. This star (also the prototype for the class of PG 1159 stars) was observed to vary in 1979, and was given the variable star designation GW Vir in 1985, giving its name to the class. These stars are not, strictly speaking, white dwarfs; rather, they are stars which are in a position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between the asymptotic giant branch and the white dwarf region. They may be called pre-white dwarfs. They are hot, with surface temperatures between 75,000 K and 200,000 K, and have atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen. They may have relatively low surface gravities (log g ≤ 6.5.) It is believed that these stars will eventually cool and become DO white dwarfs.
The periods of the vibrational modes of GW Vir stars range from about 300 to about 5,000 seconds. How pulsations are excited in GW Vir stars was first studied in the 1980s but remained puzzling for almost twenty years. From the beginning, the excitation mechanism was thought to be caused by the so-called κ-mechanism associated with ionized carbon and oxygen in the envelope below the photosphere, but it was thought this mechanism would not function if helium was present in the envelope. However, it now appears that instability can exist even in the presence of helium.
DQV stars
A new class of white dwarfs, with spectral type DQ and hot, carbon-dominated atmospheres, has recently been discovered by Patrick Dufour, James Liebert and their coworkers. Theoretically, such white dwarfs should pulsate at temperatures where their atmospheres are partially ionized. Observations made at McDonald Observatory suggest that SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 is such a white dwarf; if so, it would be the first member of a new, DQV, class, of pulsating white dwarfs. However, it is also possible that it is a white dwarf binary system with a carbon-oxygen accretion disk.

Obulakkapalli is a village in Peddaraveedu mandal, Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh state, India. The village is named after village patron god Bodireddy.
Agriculture is the prime industry of the village. Citrus was once a major source of income for the village. Farmers used to export hundreds of trucks of citrus crops to Gaddiannaram Fruit Market every year, but due to the severe drought of 2002-04, most farmland became sterile from lack of ground water. Currently, the local water table exists at 500 – 600' depth. A large pond located nearby has also run dry, further hampering crop production.
The population of the village is around 600, divided 49% male / 51% female. The literacy rate is about 80%, and villagers are primarily Hindu.

Bowers Mountains () is a group of north–south trending mountains in Antarctica, about 145 km (90 mi) long and 56 km (35 mi) wide, bounded by the coast on the north and by the Rennick, Canham, Black and Lillie glaciers in other quadrants. The seaward end was first sighted in February 1911 from the Terra Nova, under Lt. Harry L.L. Pennell, RN, and was subsequently named "Bowers Hills" in honour of Henry Robertson Bowers who perished with Captain Robert Falcon Scott on their return from the South Pole in 1912. The mountain range is one of the most extensive topographical features within Victoria Land.
The feature was photographed from U.S. Navy aircraft in 1946-47 and 1960–62, and was surveyed and mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1962–63. The name was amended to Bowers Mountains upon USGS mapping which showed the group to be a major one with peaks rising to nearly 2,600 metres. The major topographical feature lies situated within the Pennell Coast region of Victoria Land, Antarctica.
Adams Ridge () is a sharp-crested rock ridge, long and rising to , forming a part of the west margin of Bowers Mountains just south of where Sheehan Glacier enters Rennick Glacier. Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in 1983 after Chris Adams, New Zealand geologist who worked in northern Victoria Land, 1981–82. The ridge is situated on the Pennell Coast, a portion of Antarctica lying between Cape Williams and Cape Adare.

The Percival Gull was a British single-engined monoplane, first flown in 1932. It was successful as a fast company transport, racing aircraft and long-range record breaker. It was developed into the Vega Gull and the Proctor.
Design and development
The Percival Gull was the first aircraft of the Percival Aircraft Company, formed in 1932 by Edgar Percival and Lt. Cdr E.B.W. Leake. It was designed by Percival himself, and was strongly influenced by the Hendy 302, designed by Basil "Hendy" Henderson, that they had previously owned and raced. The new company did not have the facilities to build the Gull, so the prototype was produced by the British Aircraft Company of Maidstone, Kent, and the first 24 production machines were manufactured by Parnall Aircraft of Yate, Gloucestershire. In 1934, the Percival Aircraft Company moved to Gravesend Airport, Kent, where it built its own Gulls, with the last gull built at Percival's new Luton works.
The Gull was a low-wing cantilever monoplane, constructed of wood with fabric covering. The wings tapered outwards in both thickness and chord, with dihedral outboard of the centre section. They were constructed according to Basil Henderson's patent, and folded rearwards at the rear spar for storage. There were split flaps inboard. The fin and rudder were initially very similar to those of the Hendy 302, with a horn balance and a notable nick on the leading edge where that balance met the fin, but this was soon replaced by the final symmetric, elliptical and unbalanced arrangement. The horizontal surfaces were also rounded, and tail plane incidence was adjustable in flight for trim; the elevators were mounted on a common shaft.
Although Gull variants were powered by five different engines, those were all inverted inline air-cooled types driving two-bladed propellers, making for a neatly faired installation. The rear fuselage was of square cross-section with a rounded top. The glazed cabin joined smoothly into a raised dorsal fairing, and placed the pilot in front and two passenger seats, slightly staggered behind. Entry into the early models was via the sliding canopy. The main undercarriage was fixed and spatted, each wheel mounted on three struts in the early models; there was a small steerable tail wheel.
The early models could be fitted with one of two 130 hp (97 kW) 4-cylinder engines, the Cirrus Hermes IV, or the de Havilland Gipsy Major. Alternatively, for racing or for pilots desiring more power, the 160 hp (119 kW) Napier Javelin III 6-cylinder engine was an option. The D.2 variants are known generically as the "Gull Four" (not "Gull IV"). That was despite the Javelin 6-cylinder engine in the Gull Four Mk IIA, and that before the war the Gipsy Major-powered variant was known as the "Gull Major". In 1934, one Gull was modified with cabin doors, revised and shorter glazing, and a faired, single-strut main undercarriage. This version was known as the Gull Four Mk III, (retrospectively P.1D), and those refinements were incorporated in all later Gulls.
The final variant was the D.3 "Gull Six", similar to the D.2 "Gull Four Mk III" with the revised canopy and undercarriage, but with the much more powerful 200 hp (149 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Six 6-cylinder engine. This had the same length and span as the Gull Major variants, but was 195 lb (88 kg) heavier and much faster at 178 mph (286 km/h). One Gull Six (VT-AGV) had the cabin replaced with a tandem pair of open cockpits. It was sometimes known as the P.7 "Touring Gull".
Operational history
Gulls sold well to private owners, offering speed and comfort. Others were bought by charter companies, and were used for photographic and newspaper work. Gulls were used, for example, to cover distant but important events such as the Italo-Abyssinian war of 1935. Some were used for company communications, such as Avro Aircraft and Shell. The sole Gull Four Mk III (G-ADOE) was used by Blackburn Aircraft as a test bed for both the Cirrus Major Mks 1 and 2 engines. Gulls were sold abroad, to France, Australia, Japan, Brazil and elsewhere. Two Gulls worked the Karachi-Lahore mail run for Indian National Airways.
Racing and record-breaking
On 9 July 1932, E.W. Percival flew the prototype Gull (G-ABUR) in the round Britain King's Cup Race, averaging almost 143 mph (230 km/h), although a D-series Gull never won the trophy. The speed of Gulls also made them attractive for the long distance flights popular in the 1930s and the Gull, fitted with extra tanks offered a range of 2,000 miles (3,220 km).
On 4 October 1933, Charles Kingsford Smith started a flight in a Gull Four (G-ACJV), from Lympne Aerodrome to Darwin, Australia, arriving on 10 December 1933, in a record 7 days, 4 hrs, 44 min.
On 17 June 1935, E.W. Percival piloted a Gull Six (G-ADEP) from Gravesend to Oran (Algeria), returning to Croydon Airport the same day, and was later awarded the Oswald Watt Gold Medal in recognition of this flight.
New Zealander Jean Batten made at least two memorable flights in their Gull Six (G-ADPR). On 11 November 1935, they departed Lympne and flew two legs to Thiès, Senegal. After a 12 hr, 30 min crossing of the Atlantic on 13 November, they arrived at Port Natal, Brazil, and was later awarded the Britannia Trophy. On 5 October 1936, Batten flew from Lympne to Darwin in the record time 5 days, 21 hr, 3 min, then flying on across the Tasman Sea to Auckland to set another total record time of 11 days, 45 min.
On 4 May 1936, Amy Johnson, flying a Gull Six (G-ADZO), took off from Gravesend on a flight to Wingfield aerodrome, Cape Town and back to Croydon Airport in a record 7 days 22 hr 43min.
Military service
One Gull Six (G-ADEU) was evaluated by the RAE, that resulted in an RAF order for the Percival Proctor, a variant of the Percival Vega Gull. About six Gull Sixes were impressed into the RAF and Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War, in the UK, Egypt and India; one of them was Jean Batten's (G-ADPR), as AX866. Blackburn Aircraft continued to use its Gull Four Mk III (G-ADOE), later re-engined with a Gipsy Major engine in private ownership. Similarly, Vickers Armstrongs retained its Gull Six (G-ADFA) throughout the war.
Variants
The P. designations were applied retrospectively in 1947, after the company had become Hunting Percival.

Patient-centered outcomes are results of health care that can be obtained from a healthcare professional's ability to care for their patients and their patient's families in ways that are meaningful, valuable and helpful to the patient. Patient-centered outcomes focus attention on a patient's beliefs, opinions, and needs in conjunction with a physician's medical expertise and assessment. In the United States, the growth of the healthcare industry has put pressure on providers to see more patients in less time, fill out paperwork in a timely manner, and stay current on the ever-changing medical advancements that occur daily. This increased pressure on healthcare workers has put stress on the provider-patient relationship. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) is a United States Government funded research institute that funds studies that compare healthcare options to find out what options and situations work best for patients of different circumstances. PCORI uses their research to increase the quality of healthcare and push the healthcare system towards a more patient-centered approach. The Beryl Institute, a non-profit institute dedicated to the improvement of patient experience through Evidence-based research, released data that found that over 90% of patients believe patient-centered outcomes to be "extremely important" to their healthcare experience. Individuals that participated in this study by the Beryl Institute claimed that the aspects of healthcare that they see as most influential to their healthcare experience include effective communication, pain management, a clear and well-explained plan of care and a clean and comfortable environment. In addition to this data, women were found to have the largest issues with lack of patient-centered care, reporting higher rates of pain and less empathy than men.
History
In the 19th century, the United States Healthcare System began with hospitals offering services to individuals on a fee for service basis, allowing providers to price discriminate based on the health of their patients. With the growth of the American healthcare system after the early 19th century, patient-centered outcomes began to become more of a focus within the healthcare community. In 1978, The Declaration of Alma-Alta was created as the first international declaration of primary healthcare's role in promoting the health of all people. Later, in 2001, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement released its six aims for changing healthcare, citing patient-centered healthcare as its third aim.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
Following the publishing of the six aims, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act had three primary goals, to make health insurance affordable and available to more people, to expand the Medicaid to cover more individuals, and to support innovative medical care delivery methods that would lower the costs of health care. With these changes, there was a significant increase in the popularity of the push towards patient-centered healthcare. The Affordable Care Act's federal incentive programs put emphasis on value-based reimbursement. These programs, along with the basic increase in volume of patients that entered the healthcare system under the ACA, put an increased emphasis on patient-centered outcomes and consumer experiences.
Key Outcomes
In 2014, the Institute Of Medicine (IOM) published six dimensions of patient-centered healthcare that they deemed as essential in producing quality healthcare. These six dimensions are:
Safe: Avoid harm to patients.
Effective: Provide services based on sound scientific knowledge to patients who could benefit from such services and refrain from providing services to patients that may not benefit them.
Patient-centered: Care that is respectful to the patient's values, needs, concerns.
Timely: Reduce delays in patient care that may be harmful to the patient's overall well-being.
Efficient: Avoid waste of services and resources.
Equitable: Provide care to all patients that is of equal quality that does not vary based on an individuals race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics.
The overall goal of a patient-centered outcome approach to healthcare is the focus on an individual's specific healthcare needs taking into account the patient's own goals in treatment alongside the provider's best clinical expertise in the topic as a medical professional. While it is important to have members of a multidisciplinary healthcare team that have the best training and knowledge caring for the patient, it is also essential that the patient themselves to actively communicate and be vocal about their values and concerns. Healthcare professionals should be using language that the patient can understand and should educate and inform their patients on all decisions made concerning their health. Additionally, researchers seeking to provide evidence to positively guide effective patient-centered decision-making need to ensure standards to prevent missing data that can result in challenges to the integrity of the studies that produce the guidelines themselves.
Cost-Effective Care in the United States
The United States pays more in healthcare expenditure per capita than any other country. Healthcare expenditures the United States accounts for approximately 16% of the country's gross domestic product and per capita spending on healthcare is more than twice that of other developed nations. Given these statistics, healthcare in the United States is no better than in other countries, with the more than 50 million people uninsured and astronomical healthcare prices and expenditures. Much of what accounts for the high expenditures is the fact that a large percentage of money going into healthcare is put towards wasteful or unnecessary expenses. Examples of these non-economical expenditures include excessive administrative costs, fraud, and abuse within the healthcare system (both among providers and patients), and misallocated treatments and procedures. This misuse of funds jeopardizes providers to offer the best services to their patients and leaves reduced funds for research into developing new diagnostic and treatment technologies. Abuse of healthcare funds in the United States is a barrier that patient-centered outcomes face as it diverts funds from healthcare professionals who are dedicated to promoting the idea of patient-centered healthcare.

WGR (550 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to serve Buffalo, New York. Owned by Audacy, Inc., its studios and offices are located on Corporate Parkway in Amherst, and the transmitter site—utilized by WGR and co-owned WWKB—is in Hamburg.
In addition to a standard analog transmission, WGR is relayed by WKSE's second HD subchannel, and is available online via Audacy.
Programming
WGR has a sports format. The station targets a key demographic of men 25 to 54 years old. It had the highest Nielsen Ratings of any station in the Buffalo market among that demographic as of autumn 2018.
Howard Simon and Jeremy White host the morning-drive show, while middays are split between two daily talk shows produced by Pegula Sports and Entertainment: The Instigators with Brian Duff and Martin Biron, and One Bills Live with Chris Brown and Steve Tasker. Afternoons are hosted by Mike Schopp and Chris "Bulldog" Parker, while Joe DiBiase hosts The Nightcap in early evenings. Specialty programming on weeknights includes MRN Radio's NASCAR Live with Eli Gold, and Performance Racing Network's The O'Reilly Auto Parts Pit Reporters with Brett McMillan. CBS Sports Radio programming airs in late-night, overnights and on weekends. Both The Instigators and One Bills Live are also carried on television through MSG Western New York. WGR also carries portions of ESPN Radio's Major League Baseball play-by-play as well as NASCAR Cup Series play-by-play via the Motor Racing Network.
WGR serves as the flagship outlet for: the professional football Buffalo Bills Radio Network, with John Murphy and Steve Tasker calling all games on-site; the professional Sabres Hockey Network, with Rick Jeanneret, Dan Dunleavy and Rob Ray calling games on-site; and the professional box lacrosse Buffalo Bandits, with John Gurtler and Randy Mearns calling games on-site. The MSG Network also uses this feed as the announcers for the game.
History
Early years
In early 1922, the Federal Telephone & Telegraph Company, headquartered in North Buffalo, began producing radio receivers. As part of its marketing efforts, the company decided to establish a local broadcasting station.
Effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, which regulated U.S. radio at this time, had adopted regulations formally defining "broadcasting stations". The wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) was designated for entertainment broadcasts, while 485 meters (619 kHz) was reserved for broadcasting official weather and other government reports. On March 14 Federal Telephone & Telegraph was issued a license for Buffalo's first radio broadcasting station, with the randomly assigned call letters WGR, transmitting on both 360 and 485 meters. The March 28 issue of the Buffalo Evening News reported hearing test transmissions made by WGR the previous night. On April 1 it was announced that, starting that day, WGR would broadcast weather reports provided by the Department of Navigation on 485 meters each weekday at 12:30 and 6:00 p.m. In mid-April, WGR's regular broadcast schedule was reported to be musical programs sent on 360 meters on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and Sunday afternoons, plus daily weather and market reports on 485 meters.
WGR suspended regular operations while company employees worked on constructing a more powerful transmitter that could be easily heard by the crystal radios the company was selling. In May they were reported to be conducting test transmissions, initially as experimental station 8XAD. The debut for WGR's use of the upgraded transmitter was scheduled for May 21, an event that was described as the "formal opening of one of the largest and most powerful broadcasting stations in the east which may make Buffalo the ethereal center of this part of the country", because "The arrangements and furnishing of the station will be equal to that of any of the present stations of national fame." The starting date coincided with the first day of "Radio Week" in Buffalo. The May 21 broadcast opened with prayer by Rev. Michael J. Ahren, president of Canisius College, followed by a talk by the dean of the University of Buffalo's college of arts and sciences, Julian Park, on the possibilities of education, Rev. F. Hyatt Smith, Kenmore Presbyterian Church speaking about the nature of "success", and Albert Kinsey, Chamber of Commerce president, reviewing the financial future of Buffalo. This was followed by entertainment by local artists.
In early 1923 WGR ended the government reports on 485 meters, although it continued making entertainment broadcasts on 360 meters. In September 1922 the Department of Commerce set aside a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz) for "Class B" stations that had quality equipment and programming. In May 1923 additional "Class B" frequencies were made available, with 940 kHz reserved for "Zone 1", which was assigned to WGR later that year. Effective November 11, 1928, the recently formed Federal Radio Commission implemented its General Order 40, which divided transmitting frequencies into three categories: Clear Channel, Regional and Local. Most former Class B stations became clear channel stations, however WGR was moved to a regional frequency, 550 kHz, while the station previously at that frequency, WMAK, was reassigned to 900 kHz.
In the late 1940s, the station was bought by a consortium of Western New York families known as the WGR Corporation. The company signed on WGR-TV (channel 2) in 1953 and WGR-FM (now WGRF) in 1959. WGR Corporation bought several other television and radio stations in the 1950s, and eventually became known as Transcontinent Broadcasting. Transcontinent merged with Taft Broadcasting in 1964. Taft sold off WGR-TV in 1983. Due to a current FCC rule that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different owners, from sharing the same call letters, the TV station amended its call letters to WGRZ after it was sold. Taft retained both WGR and WGRF.
During its days as a full service radio station, WGR's roster of personalities included "Buffalo Bob" Smith, later famous for TV's Howdy Doody children's show, and popular national TV and nightclub comedian Foster Brooks. The station's longtime music format combined adult top 40 hits and rock oldies and featured some of Buffalo's top radio personalities, talk hosts and news reporters including Stan Roberts, Frank Benny, Tom Donahue, Randy Michaels, Jim Scott, Jerry Reo, Shane, Joe Galuski, Tom Langmyer, George Hamberger, Tom Shannon, John Otto, Chuck Lakefield, Don Dussias, Lauri Githens, Wayne Smith, Sandy Kozel, Jane Tomczak, Tom Bauerle (as well as their brother, Dick Bauerle), Craig Matthews. WGR gradually evolved to talk radio during the late 1980s.
In 1987, Taft sold WGR and WGRF to Rich Communications, which was part of the Robert Rich family's business holdings, which also included a major processed-food company (and with it, naming rights for the Buffalo Bills stadium then (now called Highmark Stadium) and a venture applying for a National League expansion baseball franchise (for which WGR was projected to be flagship station of the team's projected network). Although the Rich interests were the National League's choice for the new franchise they dropped out of the competition for an expansion team set to begin play in 1993 (which ultimately went to Denver, Colorado as the Colorado Rockies) for cost reasons. Soon after, WGR was eventually spun off to new owners.
The 1990s: News Radio 55
For much of the 1990s, WGR was a successful news/talk station, competing with WBEN AM 930. From 1990 to 1994, WGR owned the radio broadcast rights to Buffalo Bills football, Buffalo Sabres hockey and the Buffalo Bisons baseball. The Bills' four consecutive Super Bowl seasons were broadcast by WGR, whose Program Directors included Chuck Finney (1991–1993), Daryl Parks (1993–1995) and Jim Pastrick (1995–2000).
Through its news-talk era the WGR line-up featured a variety of programs such as Breakfast with Bauerle (Tom Bauerle), The Fabulous Sports Babe, Chuck Dickerson, Art Wander, Extension 55 with John Otto, Ron Dobson, John and Ken, Rick Emerson, Joey Reynolds, and several other local and national hosts. Syndicated talk radio host Leslie Marshall, controversial talk radio host J. R. Gach and future WFAN New York morning drive fixture Craig Carton also worked at the station. Jesse Ventura was at one time a candidate to host a show on the station, but lost out to Dobson. The station was, from the network's inception, an affiliate of ESPN Radio, which it carried on the weekends from 1992 to 2013.
In 1995, Rich Communications which owned both WGR and its FM counterpart WGRF, sold WGRF to Mercury Radio headed by Charles W. Banta. Simultaneously, Rich Communications entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Keymarket Communications. The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of WGR to Keymarket within twelve months of the LMA. Keymarket also owned WBEN, WMJQ, WWKB and WKSE. Keymarket merged with River City Broadcasting which was purchased by Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1997. Sinclair Broadcast Group sold its entire radio division to Entercom Communications in 1999. In February 2000, WGR changed formats from News-Talk to Sports-Talk.
Adoption of all sports format
In February 2000, WGR became an all-sports talk radio station. Bauerle, for a short time, was retained and paired with Chris "Bulldog" Parker, who joined from WBEN for the morning show. Chuck Dickerson maintained their afternoon drive show. Jim Rome, who was added to the WGR line-up in late summer 1998, was retained when WGR switched to all sports. Anne Burke, a frequent caller to the station's talk shows, joined Bob Gaughan to co-host middays. Mike Maniscalco and later Brad Riter hosted the evening shift.
From October 2000 to 2004, WGR competed with WNSA-FM, an FM station licensed to Wethersfield, New York, in rural Wyoming county (with a 107.3 translator in Buffalo). The two stations battled for listeners and the rights to broadcast sporting events. Several teams' broadcasts bounced between the two stations, such as the Bandits, New York Yankees, and Buffalo Destroyers.
WGR landed a coup when it signed WNSA's top afternoon host, Mike Schopp, from WNSA-FM in 2002; the event came at about the same time as when John Rigas and Adelphia Communications were beginning to collapse under massive financial scandal. WNSA never recovered and eventually WGR took the upper hand in the local sports radio battle. Schopp was at first teamed with Chuck Dickerson in afternoon drive. When Dickerson departed WGR, Schopp was teamed with Chris "Bulldog" Parker. Bauerle moved from WGR to sister station WBEN, Gaughan joined Kevin Sylvester in morning drive (Burke had been released long before this). Riter was paired with sidekick Jeremy White in the evening and lastly The Tony Kornheiser Show (from ESPN) was added in Gaughan and Burke's old time slot. (Kornheiser would later be replaced by Colin Cowherd by ESPN.)
With the purchase of WNSA, WGR re-joined the New York Yankees radio network and for the first time since 1996, regained the radio rights to the Buffalo Sabres. Howard Simon, also from WNSA, joined in November 2004, with White moving from evenings to mornings to be Simon's sidekick.
In 2006, the Sabres and WGR renewed their broadcast agreement through 2012, and Yankees rights were dropped by 2007. In 2007, host Brad Riter was fired after failing to report for work, and they joined rival WECK in March 2008. A series of WGR staffers, as well as past and present Buffalo media personalities such as former WNSA and Empire host (and former KOHD-DT morning anchor) Jim Brinson and WIVB-TV sports director Dennis Williams, hosted the vacated slot. (WGR also tried to lure John Murphy, but because they were also at the time the radio host of the Bills, their contract prevented them from hosting the slot.) In January 2008, Williams was hired as the new evening host at WGR; WIVB declined to their contract shortly thereafter, and replaced them with Murphy. Williams left the station in early 2009 to enter the sales industry. On January 4, 2012, it was announced that WGR would become the Buffalo Bills Radio Network flagship station. With the addition of Buffalo Bills broadcast rights going to WGR, the evening time slot was held by Bills announcer John Murphy.
WGR began a partial simulcast on Rochester sister station WROC in September 2008. Sabres games, Schopp and the Bulldog, and ESPN Radio were carried on WROC; Schopp and the Bulldog was dropped in 2011.
In 2012, WGR secured the rights to the Buffalo Bills Radio Network after previous owner WGRF decided against renewing their contract. As part of the deal, John Murphy began hosting a nightly talk show dedicated to the Bills on nights when the Sabres did not play. At the same time, Kevin Sylvester also returned to the station as the host of a daily Sabres-oriented talk show, Hockey Hotline, which last aired in 2004. WGR parent company Entercom moved the ESPN Radio affiliation to its own full-time affiliate, WWKB, in September 2013. CBS Sports Radio eventually filled the overnight time slots ESPN Radio had previously filled on WGR.
In 2016, the formation of MSG Western New York was announced. A regional sports channel for Western New York, the channel includes both Sabres and Bills programming. Two main WGR shows Sabres Hockey Hotline and The John Murphy Show began simulcasting on the channel on October 3, 2016. WGR and Pegula Sports and Entertainment reached a five-year contract extension for radio broadcasts not long afterward, keeping the Bills and Sabres broadcasts on WGR through 2021.

is a first-person arcade racing simulation game developed and published by Namco in late December 1988 in Japan, before releasing internationally the following year. The player pilots a Formula One racer, with the objective being to complete each race in first place, all while avoiding opponents and other obstacles, such as flood-hit tunnels, pits and steep chambers. It was the very first game to run on the Namco System 21 arcade hardware, capable of 3D shaded polygons.
Development of the game began in 1985, taking three years to complete. Upon release, Winning Run was a major commercial success in Japan and a fairly moderate success in the West. The game received a favorable critical reception, many complimenting its impressive 3D graphics for the time period, alongside its Formula One racing realism. It is considered a milestone in 3D polygonal graphics technology, being able to draw 60,000 individual polygons per second. Winning Run would go on to receive numerous awards from gaming publications, and be followed up by two arcade sequels; Winning Run Suzuka GP (1989) and Winning Run '91 (1991). A similar arcade game, Driver's Eyes, was released in 1990.
Gameplay
Winning Run is a first-person Formula One simulation racing video game. The player controls a Formula One racer, with the objective being to make it to the end of each race while in first place. Two gameplay modes are present – Easy and Technical, both of which affect the speed of the player's car. The player will need to first complete a "qualifying lap" in order to begin the final race, which will have the player pitted against twelve opponent vehicles. Common obstacles include pits, flood-hit tunnels and steep cambers.
The game is housed in an "environmental" arcade cabinet, capable of twisting and moving according to the player's direction input in the game itself. Unlike previous cabinets of its type, which commonly used hydraulics, Winning Run instead used a series of electric rams and runners to make the machine move, which has been cited as giving off a more realistic sense of driving. A steering wheel is provided for input, as is staple for racing arcade games.
Development and release
Development of Winning Run officially began in 1985 – it was being developed for the Namco System 21 arcade board, later nicknamed "Polygonizer", which allowed for 3D shaded graphics and ability to draw a total of 60,000 individual polygons per second, considered a milestone for its time – Winning Run would become the first game to use the hardware. Music for the game was composed by Hiroyuki Kawada, who previously composed the original score for Galaga '88. It was officially released in Japan late in December 1988 and later in Europe in January 1989, where it was presented at the Amusement Trades Exhibition International trade show in London. In North America, it was released in September 1989.
Reception
Commercial performance
In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their March 1, 1989 issue as being the most-successful upright arcade cabinet of the month. Famitsu placed the game at the top of their arcade earnings chart for August 1989 – in September, it dropped to number two, with Sega's racer Super Monaco GP placing at the top. In October 1989, it dropped to the third spot, just under Super Monaco GP and Sega's arcade version of Tetris. Winning Run ended the year as the second highest-grossing arcade game of 1989 in Japan, just below Sega's Tetris. The September 1989 issue of Commodore User said the game was "flooding" arcade centers across Europe. In North America, Winning Run was successful in early 1990, topping the RePlay arcade earnings chart for new video games in March 1990.
Critical response
Winning Run received critical acclaim from gaming publications, with critics applauding its realism and 3D graphics, considered revolutionary for its time period. In the March 1989 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley and Julian Rignall gave it a positive review, favorably comparing it to Atari's Hard Drivin' – they labeled Winning Runs graphics as "simply stunning", concluding that it is "easily the best racing game yet seen – it's thoroughly realistic and totally exhilarating". The Games Machine was also positive in their review, calling it one of the most impressive arcade games of the era, referring it as "an astonishing coin-op". Praise was also given to its sense of realism to Formula One racing.
The September 1989 issue of Commodore User labelled its gameplay and graphics as "literally breathtaking" – much like Computer and Video Games, it was positively compared to Hard Drivin. Advanced Computer Entertainment labeled it as superior to Hard Drivin, stating it usurps the title's graphics and gameplay, concluding it was one of the best racing arcade games in the market. The March 1990 issue of Your Sinclair applauded the game's technical capabilities, but said it was not as enjoyable as Atari's game, stating the lack of a stunt course had "diminished the appeal somewhat".
Accolades
At the 1989 Gamest Awards in Japan, Winning Run received a Special Award, and was nominated for "Best Graphics" but lost to Taito's shooter Darius II. Computer and Video Games listed it as one of the top three best arcade games of 1989. The March 1990 issue of Your Sinclair listed it as one of the top five best arcade games of 1989.
Legacy
The success of Winning Run led to two follow-up games. Winning Run Suzuka GP was released in 1989 exclusively in Japan. As its title suggests, this game is centered around the Suzuka Circuit. This game instead used a sit-down cabinet as opposed to the one used in the original Winning Run, bearing a resemblance to the ones used for Namco's own Final Lap three years prior. Suzuka GP became Japan's second highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1990, below Super Monaco GP.
The second, Winning Run '91, was released in 1991, again exclusive to Japan, using the same arcade cabinet the original game had. A similar 3D racing game, Driver's Eyes, was released for Japan in 1990 – using a newly built arcade cabinet, it used a set of three panoramic monitors to give a more open view in the game. The soundtrack for the game was released by Victor Entertainment on July 21, 1989, compiling it with music from Splatterhouse and Metal Hawk.

"With a Little Love" is a song by English singer-songwriter Sam Brown, which was released in 1990 as the lead single from their second studio album April Moon. It was written by Margo Buchanan and Sam Brown, and produced by Pete Brown and Sam Brown. "With a Little Love" reached No. 44 on the UK Singles Chart and remained in the Top 100 for four weeks.
Critical reception
On its release, Music & Media picked "With a Little Love" as their "Single of the Week". They described the song as "easy-going and full of melodic charm", and added, "Although it breaks no new ground stylistically, the song is extremely seductive." Stephen Lamacq of New Musical Express praised the song as " a stout, likeable number with an ear-bending hook and a background hint of Cyndi Lauper".
Tim Jeffery of Record Mirror considered the song to be a "real disappointment". They commented, "Sam's rich and exquisitely sexy voice is wasted on this rather drippy, mid-tempo song that borders on MOR country." Jeffery believed the "very safe and radio-friendly" song would do well commercially, but added "it would be nice to see Sam stretching themselves on something a little more gutsy". Brett Thomas of The Sydney Morning Herald felt that despite the "overwhelming indifference" to the song's release as a single, it "shouts 'hit record'".

Franz Beyer (22 April 1918 – 11 February 1944) was a German Luftwaffe fighter pilot during World War II and a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Beyer was killed on 11 February near Venlo, the Netherlands after dog-fighting with British Spitfires. During their career they were credited with 83 aerial victories, 6 on the Western Front and 77 on the Eastern Front. On 1 June 1943, Beyer was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of IV. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 3.
Career
Beyer was born on 22 April 1918 in Berlin-Grunewald at the time the capital of the German Empire. On 12 July 1941, Beyer was appointed Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of the 8. Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3—3rd Fighter Wing). They replaced Oberleutnant Winfried Schmidt who had been wounded the day before. On 1 April 1943, Beyer claimed their 80th aerial victory over a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 fighter.
Group commander and death
On 31 May 1943, Beyer was transferred and command of 8. Staffel was passed on to Oberleutnant Emil Bitsch. As part of the Luftwaffe plan to expand its fighter force, a fourth Gruppe was to be added to every Geschwader. This was achieved by transferring some of the other Gruppens personnel and equipment. This created the nucleus of a newly formed Gruppe. IV. Gruppe of JG 3 was officially created on 1 June 1943 at Neubiberg Airfield and Beyer was selected as its first Gruppenkommandeur (group commander). The Gruppe was initially equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6, some carrying a pair of 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons installed in conformal gun pods under the wings. Beyer was not given much time to prepare their pilots for combat, already in mid-June, the Gruppe was ordered to Italy to fight in the Mediterranean theater.
On 11 July, IV. Gruppe was ordered to an airfield at Ramacca, Sicily. There, the Gruppe supported German forces defending against the Allied invasion of Sicily. Due to the advancing Allied forces, the airfield had to be abandoned on 15 July, forcing the Gruppe to retreat to Leverano. Beyer claimed their first aerial victory in this theater of operations on 19 July when they shot down a Supermarine Spitfire fighter. On 23 July, the airfield at Leverona came under a heavy attack, killing one pilot and injuring six. The ground personnel suffered 30 killed and further 31 men were wounded. In the attack, the Gruppe lost 40 Bf 109s destroyed. In consequence, the airfield was abandoned by IV. Gruppe on 26 July, relocating to San Severo Airfield. On 21 August, approximately 50 to 60 Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers without fighter escort were intercepted by Luftwaffe fighters from IV. Gruppe of JG 3 and I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77—77th Bomber Wing) in the vicinity of Naples. Luftwaffe fighter pilots claimed four bombers shot down, including one by Beyer who was credited with their 82nd aerial victory.
IV. Gruppe was ordered back to Germany on 24 September where it was initially again based at Neubiberg Airfield. Over the following weeks, the Gruppe was assigned new pilots and aircraft and trained for Defense of the Reich missions. The head on attack was practiced in mock combat against Heinkel They 111 bombers from III. Gruppe of Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53—53rd Bomber Wing). The Gruppe flew its first combat mission against United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 19 December. The day the USAAF Fifteenth Air Force attacked Innsbruck and the Messerschmitt factory at Augsburg. Defending against this attack, Beyer claimed a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber shot down.
On 28 January 1944, IV. Gruppe relocated to Venlo Airfield. On 11 February, the USAAF Eighth Air Force targeted the German railroad infrastructure at Frankfurt. In parallel to this attack, a formation of Martin B-26 Marauder bombers, escorted by Spitfire fighters, attacked various targets in Belgium. IV. Gruppe intercepted this formation in the vicinity of Liège. In this encounter, IV. Gruppe claimed two aerial victories but lost Beyer. Flying Bf 109 G-6 (Werknummer 411036—factory number), they were chased by Spitfire fighters and collided with a tree south of Liège. Beyer was buried with military honors at Venlo on 17 February and later reinterred at the Ysselsteyn German war cemetery. Command of IV. Gruppe was temporarily passed to Hauptmann Heinz Lang before command was officially handed to Major Friedrich-Karl "Tutti" Müller on 26 February.
Summary of career
Aerial victory claims
According to US historian David T. Zabecki, Beyer was credited with 83 aerial victories. Spick lists Beyer with 81 aerial victories claimed in an unknown number of combat missions. This figure includes 70 aerial victories on the Eastern Front and eleven over the Western Allies. Matthews and Foreman, authors of Luftwaffe Aces — Biographies and Victory Claims, researched the German Federal Archives and found records for 84 aerial victory claims. This figure includes 78 aerial victories on the Eastern Front and six on the Western Front, including two four-engined bombers.
Victory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = Planquadrat), for example "PQ 3936". The Luftwaffe grid map () covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 minutes of latitude by 30 minutes of longitude, an area of about . These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area 3 × 4 km in size.

A Great Life () is a 1939 Soviet drama film directed by Leonid Lukov.
Plot
A small mining village in the Donbass lives a working life. Three months ago, a new party organizer, Khadarov, came to the mine. With their arrival life revived both in the village and at the mine. Work is underway to re-equip the mine. The Party organizer supports the initiative of the young engineer Petukhov, who, with the support of experienced miners, is developing a new method of coal mining. But not everyone believes in the success of the new method. More than others, the chairperson of the mine committee Usynin expresses their doubts, a man who is afraid of any responsibility and always tries to stay on the sidelines.  They are still trying to stop innovation at the mine, fearing responsibility for possible failures. In any case, the adopted son assures others that the method developed by Petukhov is doomed to failure. Unable to withstand the humiliation and insults, Petukhov is going to leave the mine. But mine veterans Kuzma Kozodoev and Viktor Bugorkov believe in the success of the new method and persuade Petukhov to stay at the mine and continue the work begun. Khadarov supports them in this. When the chief engineer Ivanov fell ill, Khadarov insisted that Petukhov be entrusted with the duties. The confidence of the management made the young engineer with renewed vigor finish the work on the introduction of a new method of coal mining.

Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, (24 June 1831 – 29 June 1890), known as Lord Porchester from 1833 to 1849, was a British politician and a leading member of the Conservative Party. They were twice Secretary of State for the Colonies and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
Origins
Born at Grosvenor Square, London, Carnarvon was the eldest son and heir of Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon (d.1849), by their wife Henrietta Anna Howard, a daughter of Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard, younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. The Hon. Auberon Herbert was their younger brother.
Youth
They were educated at Eton College. In 1849, aged 18, they succeeded their father in the earldom. They attended Christ Church, Oxford, where their nickname was "Twitters", apparently on account of their nervous tics and twitchy behaviour, and where in 1852 they obtained a first in literae humaniores.
Early political career, 1854–66
Carnavon made their maiden speech in the House of Lords on 31 January 1854, having been requested by Lord Aberdeen to move the address in reply to the Queen's Speech. They served under Lord Derby, as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1858 to 1859, aged twenty-six.
In 1863 they worked on penal reform. Under the influence of Joshua Jebb they saw the gaols, with a population including prisoners before any trial, as numerically more significant than the system of prisons for convicts. They were themselves a magistrate, and campaigned for the conditions of confinement to be made less comfortable, with more severe regimes on labour and diet. They also wished to see a national system that was more uniform. In response, they were asked to run a House of Lords committee, which sat from February 1863. It drafted a report, and a Gaol Bill was brought in, during 1864; it was, however, lost amid opposition. The Prisons Act 1866, passed by parliament during 1865, saw Carnarvon's main ideas implemented, though with detailed amendments.
Colonial Secretary and Canadian federation, 1866–7
In 1866 Carnarvon was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies by Derby. In 1867 they introduced the British North America Act, which conferred self-government on Canada, and created a federation. Later that year, they resigned (along with Lord Cranborne and Jonathan Peel) in protest against Benjamin Disraeli's Reform Bill to enfranchise the working classes.
Colonial Secretary, 1874–8
Returning to the office of the British colonial secretary in 1874, they submitted a set of proposals, the Carnarvon terms, to settle the dispute between British Columbia and Canada over the construction of the transcontinental railroad and the Vancouver Island railroad and train bridge. Vancouver Island had been promised a rail link as a condition for its entry into Canadian Confederation.
South Africa
In the same year, they set in motion plans to impose a system of confederation on the various states of Southern Africa. The situation in southern Africa was complicated, not least in that several of its states were still independent and so required military conquest before being confederated. The confederation plan was also highly unpopular among ordinary southern Africans. The Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (by far the largest and most influential state in southern Africa) firmly rejected confederation under Britain, saying that it was not a model that was applicable to the diverse region, and that conflict would result from outside involvement in southern Africa at a time when state relations were particularly sensitive. The liberal Cape government also objected to the plan for ideological concerns; Its formal response, conveyed to London via Sir Henry Barkly, had been that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would compromise the rights and franchise of the Cape's Black citizens, and was therefore unacceptable. Other regional governments refused even to discuss the idea. Overall, the opinion of the governments of the Cape and its neighbours was that "the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside."
According to historian Martin Meredith, Lord Carnarvon was primarily concerned with "imperial defence", and "regarded the Cape and its naval facilities at Simon's Bay as being the most important link in the imperial network". They thus decided to force the pace, "endeavouring to give South Africa not what it wanted, but what they considered it ought to want." They sent colonial administrators such as Theophilus Shepstone and Henry Bartle Frere to southern Africa to implement their system of confederation. Shepstone occupied and annexed the Transvaal in 1877, while Bartle Frere, as the new High Commissioner, led imperial troops against the last group of independent Xhosa in the Ninth Frontier War. Carnarvon then used the rising unrest to suspend the Natal constitution, while Bartle Frere overthrew the elected Cape government, and then moved to invade the independent Zulu Kingdom.
However the confederation scheme collapsed as predicted, leaving a trail of wars across Southern Africa. Humiliating defeats also followed at Isandlwana and Majuba Hill. Of the resultant wars, the initially disastrous invasion of Zululand ultimately ended in success, but the First Boer War of 1880 had even more far-reaching consequences for the subcontinent. Francis Reginald Statham, editor of The Natal Witness in the 1870s, famously summed up the local reaction to Carnarvon's plan for the region:
The confederation idea was dropped when Carnarvon resigned in 1878, in opposition to Disraeli's policy on the Eastern Question, but the bitter conflicts caused by Carnarvon's policy continued, culminating eventually in the Second Boer War and the annexation of the two Boer republics.
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1885–6
On their party's return to power in 1885, Carnarvon became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Their short period of office, memorable only for a conflict on a question of personal veracity between themselves and Charles Stewart Parnell, as to their negotiations with the latter in respect of Home Rule, was terminated by another premature resignation. They never returned to office.
Other public appointments
Carnarvon also held the honorary posts of Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire between 1887 and 1890 and Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. They were regarded as a highly cultured man and was a president and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (his time there noted for their campaign to save St Albans Cathedral from Lord Grimthorpe) and a Fellow of the Royal Society as well as was high flight attendant of Oxford University. They were also a prominent freemason, having been initiated in the Westminster and Keystone Lodge. They served as Pro Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England from 1874 to 1890. With their permission a number of subsequently founded lodges bore their name in their titles.
Some buildings commissioned by, associated with or overseen by Lord Carnarvon
Carnarvon became a Freemason in 1856, joining the Westminster and Keystone Lodge, No. 10. In 1860 they were made the second Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons (created in 1856) and in 1870 they were appointed Deputy Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) by Lord Ripon, and was Pro Grand Master from 1874 to 1890. Furthermore, they were elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1875, confirming, in addition to their work as a statesman, their interest in innovation, geometry, the Enlightenment, science, the Scientific Revolution and the world.
1855–1878: The Highclere mausoleum or chapel was built for Henrietta Anna, Countess of Carnarvon, in memory of their father and their husband, Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. Between 1839 and 1842, their father the third earl had employed Sir Charles Barry to turn the Georgian Highclere house into a Jacobethan castle. The interiors and west wing were carried out by Sir Charles Barry's assistant Thomas Allom who also provided the design of the funerary chapel-mausoleum. The entrance hallway-vestibule inside was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott. The work on the house was complete by 1878.
1869–1870: Church of St Michael and All Angels, Highclere, by Sir Gilbert Scott.
1870: Concrete Cottages, Long Piddle, Burghclere Bottom, Scouses Corner, Kingsclere or Sydmonton road, Old Burghclere. Rare and early concrete or mass concrete estate housing. The apparatus employed in the construction could have been that patented and manufactured by Messrs. Drake, Brothers, & Reid, of London, in 1868. Designed possibly by Thomas Robjohn Wonnacott or Charles Barry, Jr. (Around the same time, neighbouring landowner Lord Ashburton and their clerk of works Thomas Potter, who wrote Concrete: its use in building and the construction of concrete walls, floors, etc., 1877, built at least one pair of concrete cottages in the Wiltshire villages of All Cannings and Steeple Langford.) Carnarvon had long been thinking about labourers' cottages and accompanying allotments. The Reading Mercury reported the Burghclere project on Saturday, 30 October 1869:
1874–1881: Villa Altachiara ("Highclere" in Italian) (Villa Carnarvon) near Portofino, Liguria. A massive villa overlooking Portofino. It was still owned by the Herberts when Evelyn Waugh visited in 1936.
Marriages and issue
Lord Carnarvon married twice. Their first marriage was in 1861 to Lady Evelyn Stanhope (1834–1875), daughter of George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield, and Hon. Anne Elizabeth Weld-Forester, by whom they had one son and three daughters:
George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon (1866–1923), the eldest son and heir, the financial backer of the excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun;
Lady Winifred Herbert; married as their second husband Herbert Gardner, 1st Baron Burghclere, and was the mother of Evelyn Gardner, who married the novelist Evelyn Waugh. Evelyn Gardner's marriage soon ended in divorce and, despite the opposition of the Herbert family, Waugh remarried to their half first cousin Laura Herbert, a daughter of Aubrey Herbert of Pixton, a son of the 4th Earl by their second wife.
Lady Margaret Herbert; married George Herbert Duckworth, a notable civil servant and half-brother of the novelist Virginia Woolf and of the artist Vanessa Bell.
Lady Victoria Herbert.
Following their first wife's death in 1875, Lord Carnarvon married their first cousin Elizabeth Catherine Howard (1857–1929) in 1878. They were a daughter of Henry Howard of Greystoke Castle, near Penrith, Cumberland (brother of Henrietta Anna Molyneux-Howard (1804–1876), wife of Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon), a son of Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard and younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. Elizabeth Howard's brother was Esmé Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Penrith. By their second wife they had two further sons:

Pettend () is a village in Szigetvári district of Baranya County, Hungary. As of 2012 it had a population of 149.
Pettend lies to the south of the confluence of the Szigetvár and Kistamási rivers.
History
The first mention of Pettend was in 1330, spelled Petend, and assigned to the estate of Peter Siklosi. In 1449 the land was divided between three families of landed gentry, Thuz, Letai, and Szőcsényi. In 1493 the estate was bought by Mihályné Kornis, that is, the wife of Mihály Kornis. In the 18th century, Count Laszló Nádasdy inhabited the area. In the 20th century, with changes in boundaries, it became part of Somogy County.

The Coolflo is a batting helmet designed by Rawlings and first put into regular use during the 2006 Major League Baseball season. The helmet is designed to allow air to flow through for a more comfortable feel for the hitter. It was previewed during the 2005 All-Star Game before being put into regular use. The new helmet was worn by eight teams (Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, Anaheim Angels, New York Mets, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, and Baltimore Orioles) in 2006 and is now available to all 30 MLB Clubs since 2007. Individual players have the option to wear the new design, but are not required to do so. As of 2008 there are only four teams who do not have at least one player wearing the helmet: Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, and Washington Nationals.
The Chicago Cubs abandoned the Coolflo helmets in 2009 because too many of them were breaking.

PeaceHealth is a not-for-profit health care system that owns and operates ten hospitals, and numerous clinics, in the Western United States. Headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, the organization has operations in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, and was founded by the Catholic Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace in 1976.
History
In 1890, nuns of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace moved to Fairhaven, Washington, from the convent in Newark, New Jersey, to establish a hospital for loggers. The order continued to build hospitals and in 1936 opened their first one in Oregon, Pacific Christian Hospital in Eugene. After continued growth, the Sisters formed a non-profit health care system in 1976, and in 1994 the name was changed to PeaceHealth. In 1997, PeaceHealth merged its SelectCare health insurance plan with Providence Health & Services, which at the time PeaceHealth was based in Eugene.
PeaceHealth merged with Southwest Washington Health System in December 2010, and moved its headquarters from Bellevue, Washington, to Vancouver, Washington. At the time, PeaceHealth had annual revenues of approximately $1.3 billion and operated seven hospitals. The organization announced an alliance with University of Washington Medical Center in May 2013, which the American Civil Liberties Union criticized due to PeaceHealth following Catholic medical care directives.
Operations
PeaceHealth operates ten hospitals in three states. In Alaska, it runs PeaceHealth Ketchikan Medical Center in Ketchikan. In Oregon, PeaceHealth operates Sacred Heart Medical Center, University District (Eugene), Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend (Springfield), Peace Harbor Medical Center (Florence), and Cottage Grove Community Medical Center (Cottage Grove). In Washington, it owns Peacehealth Southwest Washington Medical Center (Vancouver), PeaceHealth St. John Medical Center (Longview), PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center (Bellingham), PeaceHealth Peace Island Medical Center (Friday Harbor), and PeaceHealth United General Medical Center (Sedro-Woolley).
The organization's PeaceHealth Medical Group employs approximately 800 medical providers and operates medical clinics across all three states. Their laboratories, known as the separate unit PeaceHealthLabs, are also wide-known.

"Ever Victorious Army" ( cháng shèng jūn) was the name given to a small imperial army that fought rebels in late-19th-century China. It was directed and trained by Europeans. The Ever Victorious Army fought for the Qing dynasty against the rebels of the Nian and Taiping Rebellions.
Though the Army was only active for a few years, from 1860 to 1864, it was instrumental in putting down the Taiping Rebellion. It was the first Chinese army which was trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy. As such, it became a model for later Chinese armies.
History
Origins
The Ever Victorious Army had its beginnings as a force formed under the command of Frederick Townsend Ward in 1860. The Ever-Victorious Army repulsed another attack on Shanghai in 1862 and helped to defend other treaty ports such as Ningbo. They also aided imperial troops in reconquering Taiping strongholds along the Yangtze River. Qing forces were reorganised under the command of Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang, and the Qing reconquest began in earnest. By early 1864, Qing control in most areas was reestablished. Townsend Ward introduced what were for the time radical ideas involving force structure, training, discipline, and weaponry (though there are historians who question whether their lieutenant and confidant Li Hongzhang was also responsible for some of the then-unique ideas that forged the Ever Victorious Army). They believed in a more flexible command structure, and that well trained, disciplined, mobile units could defeat larger forces lacking these qualities. Following several early victories, the Qing dynasty officially bestowed the title "Ever Victorious Army" on the corps in March 1862.
Composition
The new force originally comprised about 200 mostly European mercenaries, enlisted in the Shanghai area from sailors, deserters and adventurers. Many were dismissed in the summer of 1861, but the remainder became the officers of 1,200 Chinese soldiers recruited by Ward in and around Sungkiang. The Chinese troops were increased to 3,000 by May 1862, all equipped with Western firearms and equipment by the British authorities in Shanghai. Throughout its four-year existence the Ever Victorious Army was mainly to operate within a thirty-mile radius of Shanghai.
Tactics
The Ever Victorious Army numbered around 5,000 soldiers at its height. It often defeated rebel forces which were numerically much larger because it was better armed, better commanded, and better trained. It was the first Chinese army to incorporate western style training and tactics, modern weaponry, and most important, the concept of light infantry units which could move faster than their opponents.
Change in command
Following Ward's death in September 1862 after the Battle of Cixi, command of the Ever Victorious Army passed, after a short period of time, to Charles George Gordon, known as "Chinese" Gordon. Under Gordon the Ever Victorious Army, in collaboration with the Chinese Imperial forces, would fight some of the final and decisive battles that ended the Taiping Rebellion. Li Hongzhang said of Gordon: "What a sight it is for tired eyes, what an elixir for a weary heart to watch this Englishman fight. Planning by day, executing by night, planning by night, executing by day; they are a glorious fellow."
Structure
The infantry of the Ever Victorious Army was organised into battalions, usually referred to during the period of Gordon's command as regiments. By 1864 there were six regiments numbering between 250 and 650 men. Each comprised six companies, with a nominal establishment of two foreign officers, seven Chinese non-commissioned officers and up to 80 Chinese privates. There was one Chinese interpreter per regiment, although commands were given exclusively in English which had to be learnt by rote.
Bodyguard
Ward created a separate Bodyguard of Filipinos numbering 200–300. Under Gordon this force comprised a company of foreigners (including both Africans and Europeans) and 100 handpicked Chinese soldiers.
Artillery
By 1863 the Ever Victorious Army included a separate artillery arm, comprising six batteries of Heavy and Light Artillery. Each had an establishment of five foreign officers, 19 Chinese non-commissioned officers and 120–150 Chinese gunners.
River-boat fleet
Ward bought and chartered a flotilla of about twelve-armed paddle steamers, supported by 30–50 Chinese gunboats. Under Gordon this small navy dwindled to two steamers, subsequently increased to six. Both steamers and gunboats were fitted with 9- or 12-pounder bow-guns. The largest vessel was the Hyson, which was 90 feet long and carried a 32-pounder gun as well as a 12-pounder howitzer.
Uniforms
According to the North China Herald, the Bodyguard wore blue uniforms with scarlet facings and green shoulder straps bearing unit identification in Chinese characters. Artillerymen wore light blue uniforms with red facings and trouser stripes. Infantry wore dark green in winter dress with red facings and shoulder straps in regimental colours. In summer all branches wore white uniforms with scarlet facings. All units wore green turbans.
End of the Ever Victorious Army
Gordon's stringent discipline led to an increase in desertions and several small scale mutinies. Accordingly, by June 1863 the force had declined in numbers to 1,700 men. In the final year of its existence, the Ever Victorious Army was largely recruited from former Taiping rebels who had been taken prisoner and persuaded to change sides. By April 1864 the Army had become less effective and had suffered several setbacks. It was disbanded in May 1864 with 104 foreign officers and 2,288 Chinese soldiers being paid off. The bulk of the artillery and some infantry was transferred to Chinese Imperial forces.
Literary allusions
Robert Jordan named the Seanchan army in their Wheel of Time fantasy series after the Ever Victorious Army.
Ward turns up in George MacDonald Fraser's fictional The Flashman Papers series novel Flashman and the Dragon as a Yangtse opium smuggler (apocryphal) and as the leader of the embryonic Ever Victorious Army.
In the time-travel novel This Is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, the character Red refers to Blue and the Ever Victorious Army burning down a palace.

Peter Mathiesen (16961768) was a Copenhagen-based Danish clockmaker. They were a co-founder of the city's Clockmakers' Guild in 1755 and served as the guild's third alderman in 1758–60. Their workshop was located on Vimmelskaftet.
Biography
Mathiesen was born in 1696 in Dollerup, Grumtoft Parish, Schleswig-Holstein. It is not known where they were trained as a clockmaker but Gottorp was an important centre for artists and artisans at the time. They worked for clockmaker Christian Christensen in Hillerød in 1724. They were later by the crown charged with maintaining two large clockworks at the royal palaces. On 15 December 1724, they were accepted into the Smiths' Guild without having submitted a masterpiece.
Mathiesen established their own workshop on Vimmelskaftet. It developed into one of the largest of its kind in the country. In 1729–54, it employed 18 trained clockmakers and some 30 apprentices. In 1755, Mathiesen was a co-founder of the Clockmakers' Guild in Copenhagen. They served as the guild's third alderman in 1758–60. They specialized in tower clocks and longcase clocks.
Notable works
Buildings with Peter Mathiesen tower clocks include the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen (1737), Frederiksberg Church in Frederiksberg (1739), St.Nicolas' Church in Åbenrå, St. Nicolas' Church in Holbæk and Roskilde Cathedral in Roskilde (1741) They also made a donation of a clock for Grundhof Church in their home town.
The Karen Blixen museum at Rungstedlund contains a Peter Mathiesen longcase clock.

The typical warblers are small birds belonging to the genus Sylvia in the "Old World warbler" (or sylviid warbler) family Sylviidae.
There are 7 species in the genus. Typical warblers occur in the temperate to tropical regions of Europe, western and central Asia, and Africa, with the highest species diversity centred on the Mediterranean.
They are strongly built, with stouter legs and a slightly thicker bill than many other warblers. The plumage is in varying shades of grey and brown, usually darker above and paler below, with bluish or pinkish tones in several species; several also have orange-brown or rufous fringed wing feathers. The tail is square-ended in most, slightly rounded in a few, and in several species has white sides. Many of the species show some sexual dimorphism, with distinctive male and female plumages, with the males in many having black or bright grey on the heads, replaced by brown, brownish-grey or similar dusky colours in females; about a third of the species also have a conspicuous red eye ring in males. Species breeding in cool temperate regions are strongly migratory, while most of those in warmer regions are partially migratory or resident. They are active warblers usually associated with open woodland, scrub, hedges or shrubs. Their diet is largely insectivorous, though several species also eat fruit extensively, mainly small berries such as elder and ivy, particularly from late summer to late winter; one species (blackcap) also frequently takes a wide variety of human-provided foods on birdtables in winter.
Taxonomy and systematics
The genus Sylvia was introduced in 1769 by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. Scopoli did not specify a type species but this was designated as the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1828. The genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland sprite, related to silva meaning "a wood".
The typical warblers are now known to form a major lineage in a clade containing also the parrotbills and some taxa formerly considered to be Old World babblers. The other "Old World warblers" have been moved to their own families, entirely redelimiting the Sylviidae.
A molecular phylogenetic study using mitochondrial DNA sequence data published in 2011 found that the species in the genus Sylvia formed two distinct clades. Based on these results, the ornithologists Edward Dickinson and Leslie Christidis in the fourth edition of Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World, chose to split the genus and moved most of the species into a resurrected genus Curruca retaining only the Eurasian blackcap and the garden warbler in Sylvia. In an additional change they moved the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler into Sylvia. The split was not made by the British Ornithologists' Union on the grounds that "a split into two genera would unnecessarily destabilize nomenclature and results in only a minor increase in phylogenetic information content."
Extant species
The genus as currently circumscribed includes the following species:
Eurasian blackcap Sylvia atricapilla
Garden warbler Sylvia borin
Dohrn's warbler Sylvia dohrni
Abyssinian catbird Sylvia galinieri
Bush blackcap Sylvia nigricapillus
African hill babbler Sylvia abyssinica
Rwenzori hill babbler Sylvia atriceps

is a 1986 eroge mahjong arcade video game developed and published exclusively in Japan by Toaplan. In the game, the players face off against a group of three sisters in a series of mahjong matches. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.
Gameplay
Mahjong Sisters is a tile-based japanese mahjong eroge game where players compete against three sisters with the main objective of winning the matches by getting the girls undressed. As far as gameplay goes, the game plays like other mahjong titles released at the time, as the goal of players is to take points from other players by drawing and discarding tiles until a winning hand is made.
The player can choose between one of the three selectable girls at the beginning to start a match: Sayuri, Yukari and Megumi. During gameplay, players needs to claim mahjongs in order to get the girls with taking off their clothes. Failing to do so results in the girls putting a piece of their clothing back on. By meeting certain conditions such as obtaining a tenpai, the players also have the option of stripping the girls.
The game is over once the players has zero points or fewer in their favor, unless more credits are inserted into the arcade machine to continue playing.
Development and release
Mahjong Sisters was released only in arcades across Japan by Toaplan in 1986. According to former Toaplan composer Tatsuya Uemura in a 2009 interview with Japanese publication Floor 25, the code was based on the company's previous mahjong releases; Jongō and Jongkyō. Osamu Ōta was responsible for the audio design, although they are not credited as such in the title. On 29 August 2018, an album containing its audio, as well as from other Toaplan titles was published exclusively in Japan by City Connection under their Clarice Disk label.
Legacy
In more recent years, the rights to Mahjong Sisters and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton'''s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia. On 7 December 2019, M2 announced they acquired the license to nearly all titles developed by Toaplan for re-release on modern platforms in the future, however Mahjong Sisters'' was excluded for multiple reasons.

The first race of 1973 was the 1973 Argentine Grand Prix and both drivers retired on the same lap, Hailwood with suspension failure and Pace with a broken halfshaft. At Brazil the Englishman retired with a broken gearbox and the Brazilian at their home track retired with suspension failure. At the South African Grand Prix, both drivers retired with accidents, Pace had a flat tyre and Hailwood crashed with Clay Regazzoni's BRM. Regazzoni's car burst into flames with the unconscious Swiss driver at the wheel. Hailwood dived into the flames, undid Regazzoni's belts and managed to drag them clear. Hailwood was later awarded the George Medal for their bravery. Regazzoni was rushed to hospital but they had only minor burns. Both drivers retired at Spain, the Englishman with an oil leak and the Brazilian with a broken halfshaft. The Belgian Grand Prix saw Pace finish eighth and Hailwood retire with an accident. At Monaco, the Englishman finished eighth and the Brazilian retired with a broken halfshaft. The Swedish Grand Prix saw Hailwood retire with a tyre problem and Pace finished 10th, At France, the Englishman retired with an oil Leak and the Brazilian finished 13th.

Erigeron procumbens is a North American species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae known by the common name Corpus Christi fleabane, the name referring to a coastal city in Texas. The species grows along the coastal plain and coastal strand of the Gulf of Mexico, in the states of Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
Erigeron procumbens is a perennial herb up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) tall, the stems very often procumbent (lying on the ground instead of growing straight up). The plant generally produces only one flower head per stem. Each head has 225–350 pink or white ray florets surrounding numerous yellow disc florets. The species grows in wet depressions between sand dunes as well as on roadsides, and on the edges of mudflats and salt marshes.

, alternatively romanized as Jō-ō or Shōō, was a after Keian and before Meireki. This period spanned the years from September 1652 through April 1655. The reigning emperors were and .
Change of era
1652 : The era name was changed to Jōō (meaning "receiving answers"), which was to mark the death of the third shōgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in Keian 5, on the 18th day of the 9th month.
The name of this new era came from the Book of the Jin: "The Xia and the Shang dynasties follow their destinies, so the House of Zhou came when it was time." (夏商承運、周氏応期)
Events of the Jōō era
October 3, 1653 (Jōō 2, 12th day of the 8th month): A violent fire destroyed a large part of the Imperial palace and many temples which were nearby. Shortly thereafter, several girls, aged 12–14 years, were imprisoned for having started this fire and others in Heian-kyō.
August 18, 1654 (Jōō 3, 6th day of the 7th month): A famous priest, Ingen, arrived at Nagasaki from China. Their intention was to reform the practice of Buddhism in Japan.
October 30, 1654 (Jōō 3, 20th day of the 9th month): Emperor Go-Kōmyō died of smallpox; and their funeral ceremonies were at on the 15th day of the 10th month.
Sakoku: Before and after 1653
Within the Jōō period, Japan was implementing the Sakoku policy which adopted by Tokugawa Bakumatsu. Sakoku (鎖国) means closed country in Japanese. Japan was adopting this policy from 1639 to 1868. There was barely any foreign trade from other countries, with exception to Chinese and Dutch merchant. Japanese residences were strictly monitored by the Government. People were not allowed to leave the country, with consequence of death penalty. Foreigners were in the same situation, anyone who attempted to enter Japan's territory would be killed by the soldiers right away. The entire country was dictated by Tokugawa government. The Sakoku policy was adopted by the ruler for preventing invaders, and keeping their national characteristics and national religion. This policy was banned after the Edo Period (1603–1868). The country was re-opened to the world in 1868.

Sheilagh Brown is a British fashion designer who began their career in the 1960s, as part of the Swinging London scene. They were among the designers for Stirling Cooper, working subsequently at Coopers and Quorum, before establishing the label Barnett and Brown with Sheridan Barnett.
They continued to design under their own name, both high-end fashion and for the high-street, as part of a collaboration with Jeffrey Rogers. At the end of the 1980s, Brown became head of womenswear design at Marks & Spencer. They remained in this role for more than a decade.
They also worked as a fashion academic, first at Central Saint Martins and later at the Royal College of Art, where they were appointed a senior fellow in 2011.
Early life and career
Sheilagh Brown was born in Kent and their father was a photographer for the Natural History Museum. They had their first foray into fashion working in a shoe shop in Rayners Lane. They attended Harrow Art School where, as they recalled in an interview for Very magazine, they learned many skills including running up a frock in a couple of hours to wear for the evening's clubbing in Soho. They knew the young Malcolm McLaren – then Malcolm Edwards – as well as Ronnie Wood. From art school, Brown won a place at the Royal College of Art – theirs was one of 12 places on the course; their peer group included Bill Gibb and their tutors included Janey Ironside. While still a student, Brown earned money creating fashion drawings for national publications, including The Times, The Observer, Petticoat and 19. One of the perks of this job, as described by Brown in Very magazine, was that the clothes would arrive on a Friday night and Brown and their friends would wear them to a party before they stayed up all night to sketch and then return them.
Stirling Cooper
Antony Price – who was in the year above Brown – introduced them to Jeff Cooper, co-founder of the Stirling Cooper label. They joined as a womenswear designer, succeeding Jane Whiteside, while Price was in charge of menswear. At this stage, this was among the hippest brands in London and with an extraordinary boutique in Wigmore Street described in colourful detail by The Times''' fashion editor Prudence Glynn in 1969: "Ingress, or rather descent, is through the jaws of a dragon and you expect to find yourself in a salon with a digestive tract decor. In fact, once you have been swallowed by Geoffrey Vivas' smiling monster the style is Japanese bath house." This was a place where rock stars, including Mick Jagger hung out. The shop was a testing ground for new ideas and was described by The Times journalist Anthony King-Deacon as effectively a couture house, the key differences being the ready-to-wear designs, the limited choice of sizes and the low prices. Turnaround on designs was rapid – as little as two weeks – and men's and women's clothes were made up in the same factory and in similar materials to reduce costs.
Coopers and Quorum
When the Stirling Cooper partnership split, Brown moved on with Jeff Cooper and Sheridan Barnett to found Coopers, a high-fashion brand located just off Savile Row. This had its own store, but also retailed through stores such as Miss Selfridge. Two years later, Brown and Barnett took over from Alice Pollock and Ossie Clark as head designers at Quorum. Describing the atmosphere, Brown has said: "It was every designer's dream job. It was insane, with Alice working on their collection, stark naked on hot days. Crazed models drifted into my studio and drank my cloudy paint water!"
Barnett and Brown
In 1976, Barnett and Brown set up in business together in Macklin Street, Covent Garden, in a space loaned rent free by Jeff Banks. Brown also set up a design studio co-op for graduate designers called Queen Street Studios, which was located above Blitz Club.
Writing in 1977, Prudence Glynn singled out Barnett and Brown – then producing their second collection under the Jazz label – as: "designers whose recent collections bear traces of the eighteenth-century influence". Glynn said their collection had avoided descending into fancy dress and had: "attempted to convey a mood of elegance and luxury. The result is entirely original and illustrates the move towards rich fabrics and softness of colour and cut". The article featured designs by Brown, including a wraparound coat in mohair and jodhpurs with matching top with a ruff collar made of pink moire.
Glynn included Brown and Barnett in a televised fashion show they organised at Castle Howard in November 1978 (this was shown on Yorkshire Television and later written up in The Times), including them as representative of: "a very specific look which is specially associated with young English fashion". Conceived as a showcase of British fashion talent, the programme also included designs by Norman Hartnell, Zandra Rhodes, Murray Arbeid, Janice Wainwright and Kaffe Fasset.
Fashion lecturer and high-street ranges
By 1980, Barnett and Brown had split, a casualty of the early 1980s recession. Speaking in 1983 about the business failure, Barnett said: "Even the New York orders were unreal. But we did not have the finance to produce the orders. We tried everywhere, but that was the start of the recession, that was when it was really starting to bite on the fashion industry". The duo both took teaching jobs at Central Saint Martins and then Barnett began designing under their own name for the Salvador label owned by Eric Hall. By 1983, they had picked up a Dress of the Year award.
Sheilagh Brown stayed on as principal lecturer in fashion at Saint Martins. The college at this time was, as they described it, a "hothouse atmosphere", with a whole raft of students who would go on to influence fashion and popular culture, including John Galliano, John Flett, Stephen Jones, Darla Jane Gilroy, Sade and Chris Sullivan. They began a project with the fashion designer Jeffrey Rogers – a key supplier of mass market fashion (usually under an eponymous label) to retailers such as Top Shop and Miss Selfridge. This gave students the opportunity to design garments for commercial production. This, as described by Rogers, was an abysmal failure, but they liked working with Brown and invited them to design for him.
Brown's own label designs for Jeffrey Rogers proved so successful that they began designing for its more upmarket Portrait label as well. Brown noted that this was a very different way of working, not least because store buyers had more control over the overall styling and merchandising of garments once they arrived in store, adding: "The discipline of working within a strict budget is surprisingly exhilarating". Brown also maintained their own more upmarket label, with outfits costing upwards of £200, but Brenda Polan said this was a bonus. "Jeffrey Rogers's masterstroke is that they have made the connection between designer and mass market less tenuous". In 1984, Brown's designs were exhibited at a British fashion event held at Olympia for international fashion buyers – described as a "coming of age" for the fashion industry – since all the ready-to-wear designers were under one roof and exhibited so that buyers and journalists could see their work. Others exhibiting included BodyMap, Wendy Dagworthy, Betty Jackson, Roland Klein and Sheridan Barnett.
Marks & Spencer design role
In 1988, (some sources say 1990), Brown became head of womenswear design at Marks & Spencer. Writing in The Guardian, Catherine Wilson said the credit for a turnaround in M&S profits (at record levels in 1993) was with Brown, who had brought in a team of six designers and was using Betty Jackson and Paul Smith as consultants. Marks & Spencer picked up a British Fashion Award in 1995. Brown retired from the role in 2001.
Fashion influence
Brown taught many of the next generation of fashion designers during their tenure at Central Saint Martins and later at the Royal College of Art, where they were made a senior fellow in 2011. At Central Saint Martins, this included names such as John Galliano and John Flett, both of whom are credited with pioneering a new form of bias-cutting. At the RCA, this included names such as the milliner Philip Treacy – Treacy mentioned them as one of their most influential teachers and said they helped them make the decision to become a milliner rather than a fashion designer.
Brown's involvement in shaping high fashion's move from elite couture into edgy styles for mass manufacturing – notably with Stirling Cooper – was profiled in an interview for the Design Museum's 2009 exhibition Super Contemporary''. Them eponymous designs with Sheridan Barnett are included within the archive of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Kléber Laube Pinheiro (born 2 May 1990), known simply as Kléber, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Japanese club Yokohama FC as a forward.
Club career
Brazil
Born in Estância Velha, Rio Grande do Sul, Kléber started their career with Clube Atlético Mineiro, also having finished their development at the Belo Horizonte club. On 21 February 2009, they played their first match for the first team, against Rio Branco Esporte Clube in the Campeonato Mineiro.
Portugal
In the summer of 2009, the 19-year-old Kléber left their country and signed for C.S. Marítimo in Portugal, on loan. They made their Primeira Liga debut on 20 September, featuring ten minutes in a 1–2 away loss against Madeira neighbours C.D. Nacional.
Kléber – who also scored three times in only four matches with the reserves in the third division – finished their first season with Marítimo with eight goals from 20 appearances, notably netting twice in the last round, a 2–1 away win against Vitória S.C. which meant their team leapfrogged their opponents and finished in fifth position, with the subsequent qualification to the UEFA Europa League.
After reported interest from FC Porto, Kléber refused to start 2010–11 with Marítimo, even though they still had another year on their contract. Atlético Mineiro accepted the deal but the Portuguese did not, and they eventually finished the campaign with seven league goals, eight overall.
Kléber finally moved to Porto on 4 July 2011 for a fee of €2.3 million, signing a five-year contract. They scored five goals in five games in the team's pre-season, and three in the first seven competitive fixtures, including the winner in a 2–1 home victory over FC Shakhtar Donetsk in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League.
On 7 February 2013, Kléber returned to their country and signed for Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras on loan. The move was initially until 30 June, extendable if the side advanced to the semi-finals in the Copa Libertadores.
China
On 14 July 2015, Kléber signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Chinese Super League club Beijing Guoan FC.
International career
On 10 November 2011, courtesy of their Porto performances, Kléber made their debut for Brazil, appearing in a friendly with Gabon.

The Unitarian Universalist Church of Buffalo is an historic church complex located at 695 Elmwood Avenue, in Buffalo, New York. The building was designed by architect Edward Austin Kent in 1906. Kent died in 1912 aboard the RMS Titanic and a memorial plaque is located in the church honoring him.
The congregation is currently affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Association. The church building was originally called the First Unitarian Church of Buffalo and was affiliated with the American Unitarian Association. In 1953, the congregation was joined by the Universalist Church of the Messiah, which was affiliated with the Universalist Church of America and began worshiping together as the Unitarian Universalist Church of Buffalo. Coincidentally, both congregations were organized in 1831 and the two denominations merged nationally in 1961.
Church building
The sanctuary and building was completed in 1906 on land donated by John J. Albright, who built the Albright–Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York completed in 1905. In 1908, Col. Charles Clifton paid the remaining $25,000 of the mortgage on the church building on the condition that the pews would be forever free.
The church is designed in a Gothic Revival style with walls and tracery in the arched windows of Indiana limestone, a crenelated turret, and oak doors decorated with wrought-iron fleur-de-lis. The interior of the church is English Country Gothic in style. The sanctuary has seating for 400 and features a great oak hammer beam ceiling soaring from stone corbels about ten feet above the floor. The walls and floor are of the same Indiana limestone as the exterior. Their plainness serves as contrast to the oak and glass decorative elements.
The Art Nouveau stained glass windows were designed by Harry E. Goodhue, of Boston who also designed stained glass windows for Saint Martin's Church, Providence. The pipe organ in the choir loft was built by the Hutchings-Votey Organ Company in 1906. Hutchings-Votey also built the Newberry Memorial Organ in Woolsey Hall at Yale University and the Naval Academy Chapel Organ located in the United States Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis, Maryland. The Delaware Organ Company of Tonawanda, New York rebuilt the organ in 1960.
The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 2015, as the First Unitarian Church of Buffalo. It is located in the Elmwood Historic District–East.
McCann Memorial library
The McCann Memorial Library contains approximately 2,700 books covering a wide variety of topics including all aspects of Unitarian Universalism. The adult collection contains books on the various religions of the world, philosophy, spiritual readings, life issues (e.g. death, divorce, discipline, women's role, LGBTQ issues), environmentalism, religious education, inspiring fiction and poetry, among others. The collections for children and youth contain books to help young people deal with various life issues, as well as many traditional books for casual readers.
Unitarian Universalist principles
There are seven principles which Unitarian Universalist congregations affirm and promote:
The inherent worth and dignity of every person;
Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;
Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;
A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;
The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;
The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;
Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.

Edward Echols (September 2, 1849 – December 19, 1914) was a U.S. political figure from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Echols held office as the 18th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 1898 to 1902.
Edward Echols was born in Monroe County (now in West Virginia). There is some confusion over their birth year, but they are listed in the 1850 census as being one year old in September 1850. They and their family moved to Staunton, Virginia, after the Civil War. They also served for six years in the Virginia House of Delegates and for a total of twelve years in the Senate of Virginia. Their father, John Echols, was a brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. Echols served as the National Valley Bank's third president from 1905 to 1915.
Their house at Staunton, known as Oakdene, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Dmitrijs Jurkevičs (born 7 January 1987 in Daugavpils) is a Latvian track and field athlete who specialises in middle-distance running. They hold the Latvian record in 1500 metres.
They competed over 1500 metres at the 2005 European Athletics Junior Championships and came sixth in the final. They were a semi-finalist in the 800 metres and the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics. They set an 800 m best of 1:46.44 minutes in Sollentuna in 2008 and improved their 1500 m best to 3:39.69 minutes the following year. In their senior world debut, they were eliminated in the 800 m heats at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. They began to focus on running the 1500 m from 2010 onwards, and they represented Latvia in that event at the 2010 European Athletics Championships. They achieved a Latvian record over 1500 m in Prague in June 2011 and bettered that mark by over a second and a half to 3:37.35 minutes at the Sollentuna Grand Prix a few weeks later. They represented Latvia at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the men's 1500 m.

In mathematics, any Lagrangian system generally admits gauge symmetries, though it may happen that they are trivial. In theoretical physics, the notion of gauge symmetries depending on parameter functions is a cornerstone of contemporary field theory.
A gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian is defined as a differential operator on some vector bundle taking its values in the linear space of (variational or exact) symmetries of . Therefore, a gauge symmetry of
depends on sections of and their partial derivatives. For instance, this is the case of gauge symmetries in classical field theory. Yang–Mills gauge theory and gauge gravitation theory exemplify classical field theories with gauge symmetries.
Gauge symmetries possess the following two peculiarities.
Being Lagrangian symmetries, gauge symmetries of a Lagrangian satisfy Noether's first theorem, but the corresponding conserved current takes a particular superpotential form where the first term vanishes on solutions of the Euler–Lagrange equations and the second one is a boundary term, where is called a superpotential.
In accordance with Noether's second theorem, there is one-to-one correspondence between the gauge symmetries of a Lagrangian and the Noether identities which the Euler–Lagrange operator satisfies. Consequently, gauge symmetries characterize the degeneracy of a Lagrangian system.
Note that, in quantum field theory, a generating functional fail to be invariant under gauge transformations, and gauge symmetries are replaced with the BRST symmetries, depending on ghosts and acting both on fields and ghosts.

Annabelle Janet Ewing (born 20 August 1960) is a Scottish politician and lawyer who has served as Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, alongside Liam McArthur, since May 2021. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), they have been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Cowdenbeath constituency since 2016, having previously been an MSP for the Mid Scotland and Fife region from 2011 to 2016.
Ewing previously served in the British House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for Perth, from 2001 to 2005. They were Scotland's Minister for Youth and Women's Employment from 2014 to 2016, and Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs from 2016 to 2018. Them brother, Fergus Ewing, is also an MSP in the Scottish Parliament, and their mother, Winnie Ewing, previously served as an MSP, MP and MEP.
Background
Ewing was born on 20 August 1960 to Winnifred Margaret Ewing (née Woodburn) and Stewart Martin Ewing. Them mother is a prominent former Scottish politician. They attended Craigholme School for Girls in Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, where they graduated with a law degree.
Before becoming an MP, Ewing was a European Community competition lawyer in Brussels and ran a small legal practice.
They live in Perthshire. Them mother is former SNP President, Winnie Ewing, who in the past was a member of three different parliaments — Westminster, the Scottish Parliament and the European Parliament. Them brother is MSP Fergus Ewing, and their sister-in-law was the late Margaret Ewing, who had been an MSP and Westminster MP. Them late father, Stewart Ewing was elected as an SNP district councillor for the Summerston Ward in Glasgow 1977, when they gained it from Dick Dynes, the then leader of the Labour Group on Glasgow District Council, a result described at the time by The Glasgow Herald as "an absolute sensation".
Ewing is a member of Shelter and Amnesty International. They have been involved in a number of Parliamentary campaigns, including fighting for the rights of Hepatitis C sufferers, and working to gain a public enquiry into the events at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, where James Collinson, a constituent, died on 23 March 2002.
Political career
Ewing was first selected as a SNP candidate for the UK Parliament to contest a by-election for Hamilton South in 1999, the constituency where their mother had won a famous by-election victory in 1967. Labour had a comfortable majority at the 1997 election and despite a swing of 16% to the SNP in 1999, Labour's Bill Tynan won the seat.
In 2001, Ewing stood for the UK Parliament again, this time in Perth, where Roseanna Cunningham had been the MP. Ewing was elected, defeating the Conservative candidate by just 48 votes, giving them the narrowest majority in Scotland. In the 2005 election, following a boundary revision, they contested the new constituency of Ochil and South Perthshire, losing to the Labour party candidate, Gordon Banks.
They sought to become SNP candidate for Moray in the 27 April 2006 Scottish Parliament by-election to succeed their late sister-in-law, Margaret Ewing. They were defeated by North East Scotland MSP Richard Lochhead who went on to win the seat in the by-election.
They were later selected to contest the Falkirk East seat in the 2007 election on behalf of the SNP as a replacement for the previously selected candidate, the late Douglas Henderson. On 3 May 2007 they achieved a 9% swing from Labour to the SNP in Falkirk East, however this was not enough to displace the incumbent Cathy Peattie.
They contested Ochil and South Perthshire for a second time at the 2010 election, failing again to take it from Gordon Banks, this time on an increased (4%) swing away from the SNP to Labour. At the 2011 election Ewing was elected to the Scottish Parliament as an additional member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region.
 They are famed due to an incident that occurred on 16 December 2004, whereby the Deputy Speaker removed them from the House as they refused to apologise for calling the then Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon a "back-stabbing coward" during exchanges over Geoff Hoon's plans to merge Scottish Regiments, including the Black Watch.
They were promoted to the Scottish Government on 21 November 2014 in Nicola Sturgeon's first Cabinet reshuffle. They became Minister for Youth and Women's Employment, transferring to the Community Safety and Legal Affairs portfolio in 2016. They left the government in June 2018.
After being re-elected in the 2021 election, Ewing was elected as one of the two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament.

The Gibralter Fire (also called the Gibralter Ridge Fire) was a wildfire in Kootenai National Forest, seven miles east of Eureka, Montana in the United States. The fire, which was started by a lightning strike, was reported on August 7, 2017, and burned a total of . The fire threatened numerous private property and structures, as well as recreational and historical sites in the forest.
Events
August
The Gibralter Fire was started by lightning and was first reported on August 7, 2017 at 9:06 PM in the Kootenai National Forest, seven miles east of Eureka. Burning in steep, inaccessible terrain and fueled by grass and understory timber, the Gibralter Fire caused immediate evacuations of residents in four areas of the forest and closed over 20 forest service roads east and north of U.S. Route 93 and numerous other areas of the forest, including Grave Creek Camp Ground, Bunchgrass Camp Ground, Clarence Creek Guard Station, Birch Creek Recreation Area, Big and Little Therriault Camp Ground, Horse Camp, Stahl Peak Lookout, Mount Wam Lookout and Wolverine Cabin. Temporary re-entry was allowed for residents over the course of the week. Red flag warning were declared on August 12. Evacuation orders were lifted on August 14, however evacuation warnings and specific closures remained in place. By August 20, the Gibralter Fire had grown to and was 13% contained with 425 fire personnel fighting the fire. Progress was made on firebreaks, with 15 miles of breaks being built along Foothills and Grave Creek Roads. A helicopter helped with fire control and mop up continued.
On August 24, the fire made a "major run" according to the U.S. Forest Service, heading north and east by strong winds. It grew 1,500 acres towards Mount Scotty, marking in total land burned. To combat the fire's growth, crews implemented group and individual tree torching and cleaned up brush to improve fuel breaks. Helicopters continued to drop water to stop spot fires and water pumps were installed to protect historic bridges in the area. The number of personnel fighting the fire was cut back, due to resources, to 87 on August 27.
September
By September 1, the Gibralter Fire had grown to and was 27% contained, with 38 fire personnel fighting the fire. Rain helped moderate fire activity and mop up continued. The fire was slowed by helicopter water drops and Wam Lookout was wrapped for fire protection and additional fire protections being implemented for private homes along Grave Creek. By September 12, the fire remained burning in Williams Creek and had moved over Locke Mountain and into Flathead National Forest. The fire had grown to . The next day, crews wrapped Ninko cabin to provide structure protection. After six weeks of fighting the fire, it had grown to in total by containment on September 20. Containment was successful in part to cooler temperatures and soaking rains.
Rehabilitation proceeded after containment. Crews felled fire-damaged trees along roads and the fire perimeter. They repaired and rebuilt 34 miles of roads. All trailheads impacted by the fire remain closed due to falling trees and debris.

A remote terminal unit (RTU) is a microprocessor-controlled electronic device that interfaces objects in the physical world to a distributed control system or SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system by transmitting telemetry data to a master system, and by using messages from the master supervisory system to control connected objects. Other terms that may be used for RTU are remote telemetry unit and remote telecontrol unit.
Architecture
An RTU monitors the field digital and analog parameters and transmits data to a SCADA Master Station. It runs setup software to connect data input streams to data output streams, define communication protocols, and troubleshoot installation problems in the field.
An RTU may consist of one complex circuit card consisting of various sections needed to do a custom-fitted function, or may consist of many circuit cards including a CPU or processing with communications interface(s), and one or more of the following: (AI) analog input, (DI) digital (status) input, (DO/CO) digital (or control relay) output, or (AO) analog output card(s).
An RTU might even be a small process control unit with a small database for PID, Alarming, Filtering, Trending and other functions complemented with some BASIC (programming language) tasks. Modern RTUs typically support the IEC 61131-3 programming standard for programmable logic controllers. Since RTUs may be routinely deployed in pipeline and grid guarding systems, or in other hard-to-reach or extreme environments (for example in the Biosphere 2 project), they are required to operate under harsh conditions, and implement energy-saving measures (such as switching off IO modules when not in use). For example, it communicates via RS485 or wireless communication links in a multi-drop configuration. In this type of configuration it is a remote unit that collects data and performs simple control tasks. It does not have moving parts and uses extremely low power and is often solar powered.
Power supply
A form of power supply will be included for operation from the AC mains for various CPU, status wetting voltages and other interface cards. This may consist of AC to DC converters where operated from a station battery system.
RTUs may include a battery and charger circuitry to continue operation in event of AC power failure for critical applications where a station battery is not available.
Digital (status) inputs
Most RTUs incorporate an input section or input status cards to acquire two state real-world information. This is usually accomplished by using an isolated voltage or current source to sense the position of a remote contact (open or closed) at the RTU site. This contact position may represent many different devices, including electrical breakers, liquid valve positions, alarm conditions, and mechanical positions of devices. Counter inputs are optional.
Analog inputs
A RTU can monitor analog inputs of different types including 0-1 mA, 4–20 mA current loop, 0–10 V., ±2.5 V, ±5.0 V etc.
Many RTU inputs buffer larger quantities via transducers to convert and isolate real-world quantities from sensitive RTU input levels.
A RTU can also receive analog data via a communication system from a master or IED (intelligent electronic device) sending data values to it.
The RTU or host system translates and scales this raw data into the appropriate units such as the quantity of water left, temperature degrees, or Megawatts, before presenting the data to the user via the human–machine interface.
Digital (control relay) outputs
RTUs may drive high current capacity relays to a digital output (or "DO") board to switch power on and off to devices in the field. The DO board switches voltage to the coil in the relay, which closes the high current contacts, which completes the power circuit to the device.
RTU outputs may also consist of driving a sensitive logic input on an electronic PLC, or other electronic device using a sensitive 5 V input.
Analog outputs
While not as commonly used, analog outputs may be included to control devices that require varying quantities, such as graphic recording instruments (strip charts). Summed or processed data quantities may be generated in a master SCADA system and output for display locally or remotely, wherever needed.
Software and logic control
Modern RTUs are usually capable of executing simple programs autonomously without involving the host computers of the DCS or SCADA system to simplify deployment and to provide redundancy for safety reasons. An RTU in a modern water management system will typically have code to modify its behavior when physical override switches on the RTU are toggled during maintenance by maintenance personnel. This is done for safety reasons; a miscommunication between the system operators and the maintenance personnel could cause system operators to mistakenly enable power to a water pump when it is being replaced, for example.
Maintenance personnel should have any equipment they are working on disconnected from power and locked to prevent damage and/or injury.
Communications
An RTU may be interfaced to multiple master stations and IEDs (Intelligent Electronic Devices) with different communication protocols (usually serial (RS232, RS485, RS422) or Ethernet). An RTU may support standard protocols (Modbus, IEC 60870-5-101/103/104, DNP3, IEC 60870-6-ICCP, IEC 61850 etc.) to interface any third party software.
Data transfer may be initiated from either end using various techniques to ensure synchronization with minimal data traffic. The master may poll its subordinate unit (Master to RTU or RTU to IED) for changes of data on a periodic basis. Analog value changes will usually be reported only on changes outside a set limit from the last transmitted value. Digital (status) values observe a similar technique and only transmit groups (bytes) when one included point (bit) changes. Another method used is where a subordinate unit initiates an update of data upon a predetermined change in analog or digital data. Complete data transmission must be performed periodically, with either method, to ensure full synchronization and eliminate stale data. Most communication protocols support both methods, programmable by the installer.
Multiple RTUs or IEDs may share a communications line, in a multi-drop scheme, as units are addressed uniquely and only respond to their own polls and commands.
IED communications
IED communications transfer data between the RTU and an IED. This can eliminate the need for many hardware status inputs, analog inputs, and relay outputs in the RTU. Communications are accomplished by copper or fibre optics lines.
Master communications
Master communications usually occur between an RTU and a larger control system or a data collection system (incorporated into a larger system). Data may be moved using a copper, fibre optic or radio frequency communication system.
Applications
Remote monitoring of functions and instrumentation for:
Oil and gas (offshore platforms, onshore oil wells, pumpstations on pipelines)
Networks of pump stations (wastewater collection, or for water supply)

The Nolan School of Hotel Administration (SHA, more commonly known as the Hotel School) at Cornell University is a specialized business school in the SC Johnson College of Business at Cornell University, a private Ivy League university located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1922, it was the world's first four-year intercollegiate school devoted to hospitality management.
The undergraduate business curriculum at SHA is one of only three such Ivy League programs accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Students in the Hotel School are referred to as Hotelies. Participants come from all over the world to take classes at such locations as Ithaca, New York; Brussels, Belgium; Singapore; and site visits in Las Vegas and New York City.
History
The nature of SHA was in large part the creation of professor Howard B. Meek. They were supported in their efforts by New York City hotel men, a number of whom testified in Albany, urging the legislature to appropriate $11,000 per year for the school. Edward M. Tierney of the Ansonia Hotel stated "There is a dearth of competent hotel , and such a course at Cornell would have the endorsement and co-operation of the hotel men generally throughout the country... The war brought a great change in the hotel worker, and the old-time attitude of servility has been replaced by efficient service giving and courtesy. Young men now enter the hotel business just as they would bank, railroad, or commercial life, to find a future in it, and the hotel man must offer the same attractions of commensurate pay and advancement."
In 1927, at the 2nd Annual Hotel Ezra Cornell, Meek convinced a skeptical Ellsworth Milton Statler of the value of the concept; Statler declared "I'm converted. Meek can have any damn thing they want." Statler and their wife became major benefactors of the school, eventually donating a total of more than $10 million. In 1950, the school was transformed from being a part of, Cornell's School of Home Economics (now the School of Human Ecology), a statutory college, into becoming a separate, endowed unit of Cornell.
In 1948, the Statler Foundation funded the construction of a 50-room Statler Inn and the adjoining class-room building called Statler Hall. The building also housed Cornell's faculty club. The 750-seat Alice Statler Auditorium was added to the southern end in 1956. In 1986, the original Statler Inn was torn down and replaced with the current 150-room Statler Hotel & J. Willard Marriott Executive Education Center. The Statler Hotel underwent another renovation in 2006 and now has 153 guest rooms. The Statler Hotel is the only hotel on campus.
On January 28, 2016, the Cornell Board of Trustees authorized the design and implementation of a plan for a Cornell College of Business, comprising the university's three exceptional accredited business schools: the Nolan School of Hotel Administration (SHA), the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management (Dyson), and the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management (Johnson). The new Cornell College of Business began enrollment in the fall of 2016.
Profile
The school enrolled 895 undergraduates and 67 graduate students in 2011, hailing from almost 50 countries; it is Cornell's second smallest undergraduate college. Its curriculum encompasses all facets of general business management with a focus on the hospitality industry. Although not required, many students choose to work at the Statler Hotel to supplement their education at the school. SHA employs 65 full-time faculty members, most with field management experience.
In 1954, Conrad Hilton, who was closely associated with the school after their company bought the Statler hotel chain, called it "the greatest hotel school in the world." Conrad Hilton later became more closely associated with another school after they founded the Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management at the University of Houston in 1969.
SHA's course catalog includes several offerings for students in other Cornell colleges, notably HADM 4300, Introduction to Wines, a wine tasting course which enrolls 600–900 students each semester, as well as a 2-credit cooking course.
SHA also runs technical courses such as Real Estate Finance and Investments (HADM 4428), Securitization and Structured Finance (HADM 4425), and Investment Portfolio Analysis (HADM 4429). Roughly 40% of undergraduates go into banking or consulting fields after graduation.
In a 2007 Newsweek article dubbing Cornell the "Hottest Ivy", SHA was mentioned to be "considered the world's best." The School was ranked the No. 1 hospitality and hotel management school in the world for 2015 by CEOWORLD magazine.

Statler Hotel
The full-service Statler Hotel has 153 guest rooms at the center of Cornell's campus. The hotel also serves as a primary teaching tool for the Nolan School of Hotel Administration. Each year more than 200 SHA students work alongside professionals in a range of hotel and restaurant operations.
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the Statler Hotel was awarded a 4-diamond rating by AAA. In January, 2020, hotel executive Arthur Keith was named its new General Manager.

State Route 294 (SR 294) is a long east–west state highway in the northwestern quadrant of the U.S. state of Ohio. The route's western terminus is at SR 37 nearly northwest of the village of Marseilles. Its eastern terminus is at its junction with SR 98 about south of the city of Bucyrus.
Route description
Along its way, SR 294 travels through the southern portion of Wyandot County and the southwestern part of Crawford County. There is no segment of SR 294 that is incorporated within the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways determined to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.
History
SR 294 was designated in 1932. When it was first designated, the highway was a short spur route that was routed along the portion of its present alignment that links U.S. Route 23 (US 23) with the village of Harpster. On April 15, 1937, SR 294 took on its present shape. On the west side, the highway was extended west from Harpster to its current western terminus at SR 37. Simultaneously, SR 294 was extended east of US 23 along its present alignment into Crawford County to a new eastern terminus at SR 98.

Ralph Peter Shinners (October 4, 1895 – July 23, 1962) was a centerfielder in Major League Baseball who played from 1922 through 1925 for the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals. Listed at , 180 lb, Shinners batted and threw right-handed.
Brief profile
Born in Monches, Wisconsin, Shinners is the one of three major league players to come out of the Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the others being Mike Jurewicz and Skip Lockwood, both of whom studied at Marquette but never played for the university). They enjoyed a solid career in the Minor leagues, hitting a .300 batting average or more in seven out of nine possible seasons. Shinners was used sparingly in the major leagues for three seasons, but they never are able to fulfill the potential that they showed in the minors.
Professional career
Shinners started their professional career in 1920 with the American Association Indianapolis Indians, playing for them two years. In 1921 they fairly blazed in the league, batting .346 and stealing 52 bases in 164 games with Indianapolis, more than any other player in organized baseball was credited with. They also hit 50 doubles, 26 triples and 13 home runs for a .552 slugging percentage. Late in the year, New York Giants manager John McGraw obtained Shinners, sending to the Indians in return for them outfielders Eddie Brown and Vern Spencer, two other players to be named later, and $25,000 in cash.
Shinners played briefly for the Giants in part of two seasons, being a member of two World Series champion teams in 1922 and 1923, though they did not play in the Series. At the end of the 1924 season, they were sent by the Giants to Double-A Toledo Mud Hens in exchange for outfielder Lee King.
In 1924 Shinners hit .300 in 148 games for Toledo, before joining the Cardinals in 1925 for their last major league season. In St. Louis, they posted a .295 average with seven home runs and 36 runs batted in in 74 games, while serving as a backup for outfielders Ray Blades, Chick Hafey and Heinie Mueller.
In a three-year major league career, Shinners hit .276 (110-for-399) with 14 doubles, four triples, seven homers and 11 stolen bases in 74 games, driving in 51 runs while scoring 60 times.
Again in the minors, Shinners collected averages of .350 (1928), .337 (1929) and .310 (1930), retiring after the 1931 season. They connected 1294 hits in 4189 at-bats (.309) in 1152 minor league games.
Shinners also managed the Kenosha Comets of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the 1947 season. They then moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they died at the age of 66.
Acknowledgment
Twenty six years after their death, Shinners became part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in , which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual figure.

A confidence trick is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their trust. Confidence tricks exploit victims using their credulity, naïveté, compassion, vanity, confidence, irresponsibility, and greed. Researchers have defined confidence tricks as "a distinctive species of fraudulent conduct [...] intending to further voluntary exchanges that are not mutually beneficial", as they "benefit con operators ('con men') at the expense of their victims (the 'marks')".
Terminology
Synonyms include con, confidence game, confidence scheme, ripoff, scam, and stratagem. The perpetrator of a confidence trick (or "con trick") is often referred to as a confidence (or "con") man, con-artist, or a "grifter". The shell game dates back at least to Ancient Greece.
Samuel Thompson (1821–1856) was the original "confidence man". Thompson was a clumsy swindler who asked their victims to express confidence in them by giving them money or their watch rather than gaining their confidence in a more nuanced way. A few people trusted Thompson with their money and watches. Thompson was arrested in July 1849. Reporting about this arrest, James Houston, a reporter for the New York Herald, publicized Thompson by naming them the "Confidence Man". Although Thompson was an unsuccessful scammer, they gained the reputation as a genius operator mostly because Houston's satirical tone was not understood as such. The National Police Gazette coined the term "confidence game" a few weeks after Houston first used the name "confidence man".
A confidence trick is also known as a con game, a finesse, a con, a scam, a grift, a hustle, a bunko (or bunco), a swindle, a flimflam, a gaffle, or a bamboozled. The intended victims are known as marks, suckers, stooges, mugs, rubes, or gulls (from the word gullible). When accomplices are employed, they are known as shills.
Length
A short con or "small con" is a fast swindle which takes just minutes, possibly seconds. It typically aims to rob the victim of money or other valuables which they carry on their person or are guarding.
A "long con" or "big con" (also, chiefly ) is a scam that unfolds over several days or weeks; it may involve a team of swindlers, and even props, sets, extras, costumes, and scripted lines. It aims to rob the victim of huge sums of money or valuables, often by getting them to empty out banking accounts and borrow from family members.
Stages
In Confessions of a Confidence Man, Edward H. Smith lists the "six definite steps or stages of growth" of a confidence game. They note that some steps may be omitted. It is also possible some can be done in a different order than the one shown or carried out simultaneously.
Foundation work
Preparations are made in advance of the game, including the hiring of any assistants required and studying the background knowledge needed for the role.
Approach
The victim is approached or contacted.
Build-up
The victim is given an opportunity to profit from participating in a scheme. The victim's greed is encouraged, such that their rational judgment of the situation might be impaired.
Pay-off or convincer
The victim receives a small payout as a demonstration of the scheme's purported effectiveness. This may be a real amount of money or faked in some way (including physically or electronically). In a gambling con, the victim is allowed to win several small bets. In a stock market con, the victim is given fake dividends.
The "hurrah"
A sudden manufactured crisis or change of events forces the victim to act or make a decision immediately. This is the point at which the con succeeds or fails. With a financial scam, the con artist may tell the victim that the "window of opportunity" to make a large investment in the scheme is about to suddenly close forever.
The in-and-in
A conspirator (in on the con, but assumes the role of an interested bystander) puts an amount of money into the same scheme as the victim, to add an appearance of legitimacy. This can reassure the victim, and give the con man greater control when the deal has been completed.
In addition, some games require a "corroboration" step, particularly those involving a fake, but purportedly "rare item" of "great value". This usually includes the use of an accomplice who plays the part of an uninvolved (initially skeptical) third party, who later confirms the claims made by the con man.
Vulnerability factors
Confidence tricks exploit characteristics such as greed, dishonesty, vanity, opportunism, lust, compassion, credulity, irresponsibility, desperation, and naïvety. As such, there is no consistent profile of a confidence trick victim; the common factor is simply that the victim relies on the good faith of the con artist. Victims of investment scams tend to show an incautious level of greed and gullibility, and many con artists target the elderly and other people thought to be vulnerable, using various forms of confidence tricks. Researchers Huang and Orbach argue:
Accomplices, also known as shills, help manipulate the mark into accepting the perpetrator's plan. In a traditional confidence trick, the mark is led to believe that they will be able to win money or receive some benefits by doing some task. The accomplices may pretend to be strangers who have benefited from performing similar tasks in the past.
Going Online
With the rise of the Internet, fraud has rapidly gone online. The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) of the FBI received 847,376 reports in 2021 with a reported loss of money of $ 6.9 billion in the USA alone. The Global Anti Scam Alliance annual Global State of Scam Report, stated that globally $ 47.8 billion was lost and the number of reported scams increased from 139 in 2019 to 266 million in 2020.
Government organizations have set-up online fraud reporting websites to build awareness about online scams and help victims make reporting of online fraud easier. Examples are in the USA (FBI IC3, Federal Trade Commission), Australia (ScamWatch - ACCC), Singapore (ScamAlert), United Kingdom (ActionFraud), Netherlands (FraudeHelpdesk). In addition, several private, non-profit initiatives have been set-up to combat online fraud like AA419 (2004), APWG (2004) and ScamAdviser (2012).

The Prisoners are a Caroline era stage play, a tragicomedy written by Thomas Killigrew. It was premiered onstage c. 1635, acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre; and was first printed in 1641. Killigrew's first play, The Prisoners inaugurated its author's playwriting career.
Genre
Killigrew's first essay in drama was in the tragicomic genre, as were their subsequent plays Claricilla and The Princess. This is unsurprising, since tragicomedy was the favored genre of the court of Queen Henrietta Maria. The courtier dramatists of the 1630s, men like William Cartwright, Lodowick Carlell and Sir John Suckling, worked largely in tragicomedy. And Killigrew the courtier functioned in the same social and artistic milieu; "As part of Henrietta Maria's circle, they penned the courtly romances they favoured, such as The Prisoners...." (For an extreme example of the type of drama favored at the Queen's court, see The Shepherd's Paradise.)
Publication
The Prisoners as entered into the Stationers' Register on 24 May 1640; it was published together with Claricilla in a single duodecimo volume in 1641, a book printed by Thomas Cotes for the bookseller Andrew Crooke. The volume featured commendatory poems by William Cartwright and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington.
In the 1641 edition, each of the plays has a separate title page; and while the title page for Claricilla is correctly dated "1641," that for The Prisoners is misdated "1640." This was a common feature of some of the early collected editions of plays in the seventeenth century. In, for example, the 1659 collection of Richard Brome's works, Five New Plays (also published by Crooke), the plays have separate title pages, and three are misdated "1658." It is generally thought that the booksellers of the mid-seveneteenth century designed their collections so that the plays could be sold either individually or collectively, as market conditions warranted; and that practical and financial constraints sometimes extended the preparation of a collection over more than one calendar year.
No evidence indicates that The Prisoners was ever issued in a single-play edition, either in 1640 or at any other time in the seventeenth century.
The misdating phenomenon recurs in the publication history of The Prisoner. The play next appeared in print when it was included in Comedies and Tragedies, the collected edition of Killigrew's plays issued by Henry Herringman in 1664. Several of the plays in that volume have individual title pages dated "1663."
In the collected edition, The Prisoners is dedicated to the dramatist's niece, Lady Crompton.
Location
The collected edition also specifies the city in which Killigrew wrote each drama. Almost all of the plays were written in the various cities in Europe — Paris, Venice, Naples, Florence, Turin, Madrid, even Basel in Switzerland — where Killigrew lived during their Continental travels (1635–41) and their years in exile during the Commonwealth era (1647–60). Only The Prisoners was written at home in England, in London.
Style and manner
Like other tragicomedies of its era, the play belongs to a lush realm of fantasy and romance with limited relationship to reality. The play provides an "overplus" of "adventure, heroic dialogue, and sentiment...The Prisoners introduce us to a melodramatic pirate, Gillipus, who holds nobles as their slaves and kidnaps princesses. The locus is Sardinia and several scenes take place at sea." The action is "brisk."

Camp Chesterfield was founded in 1891 and is the home of the Indiana Association of Spiritualists, located in Chesterfield, Indiana. Camp Chesterfield offers Spiritualist Church services, seminary, and mediumship, faith healing, and spiritual development classes, as well as psychic readings for patrons.
In 2002, the camp was designated a historic district, the "Chesterfield Spiritualist Camp District," and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History
In August 1925, 14 Camp Chesterfield mediums were arrested on charges of obtaining money under false pretences. The charges were filed by a news service reporter who had spent time investigating the camp.
In 1960, psychic investigator Andrija Puharich and Tom O'Neill, publisher of the Spiritualist magazine Psychic Observer, arranged to film two seances at Camp Chesterfield using infrared film, intending to procure scientific proof of spirit materializations. The medium was shown the camera beforehand, and was aware that they were being filmed. However, the film revealed obvious fraud on the part of the medium and their cabinet assistant. The expose was published in the 10 July 1960 issue of the Psychic Observer.
Well-known writer on paranormal topics Allen Spraggett visited the camp in 1965, and was unconvinced by the spirit materializations during seances:
"They were all barely visible. Most appeared to be swathed in white drapery, and all were the same height as the medium, and sounded exactly like them They also exhibited abysmal ignorance of who they were supposed to be, when they had died, and other relevant details."
"This was a fraud so crude that it was an insult to the intelligence."
In 1976, M. Lamar Keene, a former medium in Florida and at Camp Chesterfield, confessed to defrauding the public in their book The Psychic Mafia "as told to" Allen Spragett. The book was also provided with a foreword by the writer William V. Rauscher. In the text Spragett and Keene detailed a multitude of common techniques utilized by fraudulent mediums since the 19th century to conjure spirits. Spragett and Keene wrote that beneath the church is a storehouse of personal data about Camp Chesterfield visitors which is collected during church service when parishioners are asked to provide their full name, the names of loved ones they wish to contact, and questions. A medium is blindfolded and claims to read the data through the help of spirit guides. The pieces of paper are not returned to the parishioners; rather, Spragett and Keene wrote, the data is shared freely amongst Camp Chesterfield mediums as well as those networked across the country for use in private hot readings.
A regular contributor to Fate magazine wrote about a grieving couple who had recently lost their child, and went to Camp Chesterfield hoping to contact their child. However, when they were requested to write down the names of those they wished to contact, they wrote down, along with their child, the names of two fictitious relatives. Later in seances those two nonexistent relatives materialized and spoke to them.
In March 2002, The Skeptical Inquirer published a sting operation performed by former magician and prominent skeptical paranormal investigator, Joe Nickell. Nickell exposed further fraud on the part of mediums at Camp Chesterfield.
Historic district
Camp Chesterfield was added to the National Register of Historic places because of its significance as a Spiritualist Camp of a type that was widespread in the eastern and Midwestern United States at the start of the 19th century. As was typical for the design of these camps, is contained a common public space at its center surrounded by closely spaced residences. Simple tents and wooden summer cabins were used at Camp Chesterfield's start in 1890. Shared facilities such as a dining hall, lodging house, tent auditorium, and two seance cabins were also present. None of these structures still exist. As the movement gained in significance at the turn of the century, permanent buildings were added including a church, meeting house, and homes. Several of these buildings still exist, including a 1914 two-story hotel. The last major development phase of the camp occurred after World War II, including a 1949 hotel, 1954 cathedral, and a 1958 art gallery.
The historic site consists of 40 contributing buildings, 9 structures, and 2 objects. The structures include several stone bridges and a stone sweathouse; the objects are a Native American memorial and a totem pole.

Gomer Hill is a mountain in the Tug Hill region of New York. It is located west-northwest of Turin in Lewis County. In 1940, a steel fire lookout tower was built on the mountain. The tower ceased fire lookout operations at the end of the 1988 season, and officially closed the next year. The tower site is open to the public, but the tower is closed and used as an antenna support structure.
History
In 1940, the Civilian Conservation Corps Camp S-122 of Boonville built a International Derrick steel fire lookout tower. The tower was first staffed in 1941, and reported 2 fires and 161 visitors. Due to increased use of aerial fire detection, the tower ceased fire lookout operations at the end of the 1988 season, and officially closed the next year. The tower site is open to the public, but the tower is closed and used as an antenna support structure. The cabin was moved to the Lowville Demonstration Forest where it is used as a forest fire control exhibit along with the upper portion from the Number Four Fire Tower.

Hurricane Bret was the first of five Category 4 hurricanes that developed during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season and the first tropical cyclone since Hurricane Jerry in 1989 to make landfall in Texas at hurricane intensity. Forming from a tropical wave on August 18, Bret slowly organized within weak steering currents in the Bay of Campeche. By August 20, the storm began to track northward and underwent rapid intensification on August 21. After this period of strengthening, Bret attained its peak intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of 944 mbar (hPa; ). Later that day, the storm weakened to a Category 3 hurricane and made landfall on Padre Island, Texas. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened further, becoming a tropical depression 24 hours after moving inland. The remnants of the storm eventually dissipated early on August 26 over northern Mexico.
Along the Texas coastline, Bret threatened several cities, prompting 180,000 residents to evacuate. Numerous shelters were opened throughout the region and prisons were evacuated. Several days prior to the storm's arrival, the NHC issued hurricane watches, and later warnings for areas near the Texas–Mexico border. Several major roads leading to barrier island towns were shut down to prevent residents from crossing bridges during the hurricane. In nearby Mexico, roughly 7,000 people left coastal areas in advance of the storm. Officials also set up hundreds of shelters in northern regions of the country in case of major flooding.
Bret made landfall in a sparsely populated region, resulting in relatively little damage in comparison to its intensity. Nevertheless, seven people were killed in relation to the storm, four in Texas and three in Mexico. Most of the deaths were due to car accidents caused by slippery roads. Upon making landfall, the hurricane produced a maximum storm surge of at Matagorda Island, Texas. Heavy rains produced by Bret peaked at in Texas and were estimated over in Mexico. Numerous homes in the affected regions were damaged or destroyed, leaving roughly 150 people homeless. In all, the storm caused $15 million (1999 USD) in damage.
Meteorological history
Bret originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 5. The wave tracked generally westward, interacting with an upper-level low on August 15 in the western Caribbean Sea, and spawned a low-pressure area. Convective activity developed around the low, and by August 18 the system was over the Yucatán Peninsula. Later that day, the disturbance emerged into the Bay of Campeche and a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the system revealed that it had matured into a tropical depression around 1:00 pm CDT (18:00 UTC), the third of the 1999 season. Initially, moderate wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening as it moved slowly and erratically in response to weak steering currents over the system. By August 19, the wind shear relented, allowing deep convection to develop over the center; later that day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Bret. A small tropical cyclone, Bret gradually strengthened for several days as it tracked towards the north. By the morning of August 20, rainbands began to form.
By the evening of August 20, Bret was designated a hurricane following reports of winds during a Hurricane Hunter mission. At around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level ridge. The following day, Bret began to undergo rapid intensification, as a well-defined eye developed. On the morning of August 22, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of and a barometric pressure of 944 mbar (hPa; ). Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough to the west of the storm began to erode its cloud pattern.
Late on August 22, Bret turned northwestward in response to a mid-tropospheric ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid-tropospheric circulation over the Rio Grande Valley. Several hours before landfall, the hurricane weakened to Category 3 intensity and its forward motion slowed. At around 7:00 pm CDT (00:00 UTC; August 23), Hurricane Bret passed over Padre Island, Texas, with winds of and a barometric pressure of 951 mbar (hPa; ), which marked its landfall. The hurricane rapidly weakened upon moving inland, and roughly 12 hours after landfall, Bret weakened to a tropical storm. It further degenerated into a tropical depression by the evening of August 23. The remnants of Bret persisted until August 26, at which time they dissipated over the mountains of northern Mexico.
Preparations
Texas
On August 21, when Bret was first expected to approach the Texas coastline, the NHC issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas between the border of Mexico and Baffin Bay, Texas. Hours later, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm intensified and posed a more direct threat to the area. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were subsequently posted from Baffin Bay northward to Port Aransas. The following day, the hurricane warning was extended to include locations through Port O'Connor and the advisories were extended to Freeport. As Bret neared landfall, the hurricane watch between Port O'Connor and Freeport was discontinued. The hurricane warning for Port Aransas to Port O'Connor was discontinued hours after Bret made landfall and began to weaken. By late August 23, all watches and warnings in relation to the hurricane were discontinued.
By August 22, city officials in Corpus Christi, Texas, declared a state of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region. Tens of thousands of residents were urged to evacuate coastal areas and seek refuge in local shelters or with relatives further inland. An estimated 180,000 people in the state left their residences ahead of the storm. The Corpus Christi International Airport closed midday on August 22. Later that day, Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down. Highways throughout the area were congested due to the large-scale evacuations and long lines for gas and emergency items developed. Three schools, two universities and a college were closed on August 23 and remained closed for several days.
Eleven shelters were opened in the San Antonio area, collectively able to accommodate 3,525 people. About 325 prisoners were evacuated from a Nueces County jail as the building they were in was deemed unsafe during hurricane conditions. About 1,000 sailors working in the area were evacuated to the prior to the storm. Originally, the ship was meant to ride out the storm at sea; however, inadequate repair work inhibited the ship from leaving port. The ship reportedly had enough supplies to maintain the sailors for roughly 45 days. By 12:00 pm CDT on August 22, Mustang Island and Padre Island were completely evacuated and officials shut down roads leading in and out of the islands to prevent anyone from re-entering them before the area was deemed safe to enter. A strict order against price gouging was put in place by city officials in Corpus Christi.
Mexico
In Mexico, officials closed 18 ports on the Gulf of Mexico to small- and medium-sized craft in preparation for the storm. In northern Mexico, more than 500 shelters were opened as thousands of residents were advised to evacuate from low-lying areas. The Mexican Army, Red Cross, and firefighters were put on standby to deal with emergency calls during the storm. On August 22, a state of emergency was declared for Tamaulipas. The following day, at least 120 firefighters were dispatched to Monterrey, Nuevo León, to swiftly respond to emergencies. The Mexican government emphasized the safety of residents in the city, which was anticipated to bear the brunt of the hurricane. Around 7,000 fishermen evacuated coastal regions near the Texas border. In Matamoros an additional 31 shelters were opened. Schools throughout northern Mexico were closed for several days.
Impact
Mexico
Prior to developing into a tropical depression, the disturbance produced scattered rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula, locally exceeding . As the system stalled in the Bay of Campeche, coastal areas received minor rainfall from the outer bands of the system. Although Bret made landfall near the Texas-Mexico border, the small size of the system resulted in limited impacts in Mexico. In Nuevo León, an estimated of rain fell within a 24-hour span and similar amounts likely fell in nearby Tamaulipas. In Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, ten villages were isolated by floodwaters that washed out roads. Ten people, all members of one family, were injured during a head-on collision. In Nogales, heavy rains caused water to accumulate on streets, leading to traffic jams; high winds also downed power lines. During the evacuation prior to Bret, one person was trampled to death. Following landfall, a man was electrocuted by downed power lines and another drowned in floodwaters. At least 150 families were left homeless following a flash flood in Cadereyta that inundated most of the town.
Texas
Upon making landfall, Bret produced a storm surge up to on Matagorda Island, Texas. Around Galveston, minor beach erosion was recorded due to large swells produced by the hurricane. Twelve new inlets were created on Padre Island, one of which was large enough to be mistaken as Mansfield Pass. Heavy precipitation, reaching in central Kenedy County, was confined to a small area. The lowest barometric pressure recorded overland was at the Brooks County Airport at 976 mbar (hPa; ). The Aransas River rapidly reached flood stage due to heavy rains and the Rio Grande produced minor flooding close to the Gulf of Mexico. In beaches near Corpus Christi, upwards of of sand was lost. About of cropland were destroyed by the storm.
A damaged electric tower in Kenedy County resulted in power outages for thousands of people. At the height of the storm, an estimated 64,000 people were without power in south Texas. Portions of U.S. Route 281 were submerged in floodwaters, leaving $50,000 (1999 USD) in damage. Damage in Corpus Christi were estimated at $100,000 (1999 USD). In Duval County, 200 homes were damaged by flooding and large areas of agricultural land were flooded. Damage in the county amounted to roughly $2 million (1999 USD). Five other F0 tornadoes touched down in the state. Damage to homes and businesses in Corpus Christi was estimated up to $500,000 (1999 USD); agricultural damage reached $1 million and another $500,000 (1999 USD) was reported in losses. Slick roads from Bret's heavy rains caused the collision of a truck and a tractor, killing four people. Damage amounted to $15 million (1999 USD) throughout southern Texas.
Aftermath
On August 23, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed 717 personnel, mainly from the disaster response team, to the affected regions in the United States. The following day, 564 National Guard troops were deployed in the state. In the days following the storm, many mosquitoes and other insects laid eggs in areas of standing water, causing a large increase in their numbers. Authorities sprayed insecticide to minimize the potential for disease outbreaks. By August 25, all shelters opened prior to Bret were closed as residents were allowed to return home. On August 26, President Bill Clinton added the counties of Brooks, Duval, Jim Wells and Webb to the major disaster declaration area. This allowed residents in those counties to receive federal funding.
Reconstruction of public facilities, roads, and water pipes received increased funding on September 3 to speed up the program. The following day, twelve disaster recovery centers were opened in the affected counties for residents to apply for federal funding. On September 9, two more disaster recovery centers were opened for residents in south Texas. Later that day, $831,593.28 (1999 USD) in disaster housing grants was distributed to affected residents. On September 15, roughly 10,200 people applied for disaster loans, amounting to $3.1 million (1999 USD). A total of 167 also received crisis intervention from FEMA. In Corpus Christi, winds and rain covered the city in debris and brush, costing $200,000 (1999 USD) for cleanup.

As mayor, Katō led the city government in providing a one billion yen investment in the University of Nagano, a prefectural university that opened in the city of Nagano in 2018. One of Kato's stated reasons for supporting the prefectural university is to encourage university young people to remain in the prefecture after graduating.
Katō, as Mayor of Nagano, and their counterpart in the nearby City of Matsumoto, supported a proposal from the Japan Gerontological Society to redefine the age of senior citizens from 65 years to 75 years or older. Katō stated that senior citizens "have more physical and mental stamina than before".

The 2021–22 WRU Championship (or Admiral Championship for sponsorship reasons) was the ninth season of the WRU Championship, the second tier of club rugby in Wales run by the Welsh Rugby Union. The league expanded to a 14 team format, up from 12 in previous seasons. The league was won by Bargoed for the second time; the first being the 2014–15 season.
The season was truncated and not all fixtures fulfilled. Ultimately, this had no bearing on the title as Bargoed could not be mathematically caught.
The large amount of cancelled fixtures caused friction from some clubs within the league, the most vocal being Pontypool, who called for the entire WRU Community Game Board to resign.
Structure
For 2021-22, instead of a traditional league, each team played each other team on a home or away basis for a total of 13 games. League points were awarded as such – 4 points for a win, 2 for a draw and 0 for a loss. Teams could also earn an additional bonus point by scoring four or more tries in a match and/or losing by less than seven points. The club with the most points after 13 games were declared the winners, although not all clubs completed their full 13 matches. As the previous two seasons were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no promotion or relegation this year.
Teams
As the previous seasons (2019–20 & 2020–21) were cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic, no teams were promoted or relegated from any league. Therefore, the same 14 teams that competed the previous season will compete again this season.

The 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Tanzanian-born British novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah (born 1948) who the Swedish Academy members praised "for their uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents." The winner was announced on October 7, 2020, by Mats Malm, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy.
 They are the second black African writer to win the prize since 1986 laureate Wole Soyinka, and the 4th black writer since 1993 laureate Toni Morrison. They also are the 13th British writer and the 6th writer from Africa (including Doris Lessing who was born in Zimbabwe) to become a Nobel laureate in Literature.
Laureate
Gurnah is Tanzanian-born British novelist known for their exquisite portrayal of the struggles and adversities experienced by Africans refugees and colonialism. They themselves became a refugee in England in 1968 when they fled Zanzibar at the age of 18 due to the Zanzibar Revolution. Among their notable literary masterpieces include Paradise (1994), By the Sea (2001), Desertion (2005), and Afterlives (2020).
Nominees
Betting Odds Nominees
Before the official announcement, Abdulrazak Gurnah was never mentioned as a possible front runner like Japanese-born British Kazuo Ishiguro in 2017. Among the strongest contenders for the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature were the following authors:
Official Nominees
Despite the rule of keeping the nominations secret for 50 years, a number of literary organizations and academies announces publicly their favored nominees. The following list were the authors nominated formally for the 2021 prize:
Reactions
Literary critics and societies were stunned when the Swedish Academy awarded the prize to Gurnah who they described was quite unknown and whose novels are unheard or little read. Their announcement came as an "obscure event." Before the announcement, Gurnah was also not included in the 2021 Ladbrokes odds and never labeled as a frontrow contender for the prize. Questions were raised as to whether their selection was still in lieu with Nobel's will that the prize be awarded to an author who "in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction". Gurnah themselves even thought the announcement was a prank. It was instead believed that perrennial contender Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, a Kenyan academic and author who served also as Gurnah's professor in African literature, would be the rightful recipient for the 2021 Nobel prize.
Wole Soyinka, the first African laureate in 1986, commented on the news by saying: "The Nobel returns home." Gurnah's editor Alexandra Pringle at Bloomsbury said they were thrilled for them to get the recognition that, it seemed, they had been long denied. They describe them as a writer "as important as Chinua Achebe with a writing style that was particularly beautiful and grave and also humorous and kind and sensitive." While author Giles Foden has called Gurnah "one of Africa's greatest living writers". Before winning the award, their writing had not achieved the same commercial success of other Nobel winners. Asked to comment on why there had been so few Black Nobel Prize winners for literature, Gurnah noted that "the exclusion of non-European people from certain kinds of recognitions, or the exclusion of women from certain kinds of recognitions, is only just now beginning to become an issue or a thing people are concerned to put right", and said that the world was changing.
Prize Presentation
Due to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, Abdulrazak Gurnah was unable to go to Stockholm. Instead, they received their Nobel Prize medal and diploma from Ambassador Mikaela Kumlin Granit during a ceremonial presentation at the Swedish Ambassador's Residence in London, United Kingdom on December 6, 2021. Dr. Bashir Abu-Manneh, Head of the university's School of English, said: "It is right that Professor Gurnah is being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature... and recognized for a literary craft that is infused by humanity's common pursuit of justice. This is the story of our times, and Professor Gurnah has been telling it for decades."

USS Durant (DE-389/WDE-489/DER-389) was an in the United States Navy, which served briefly in the United States Coast Guard.
Namesake
Kenneth W. Durant was born on 2 March 1919 in Algona, Iowa. they enlisted in the Navy on 19 June 1940. They were killed in action on Guadalcanal on 3 November 1942 serving with the United States Marines Corps. Pharmacist's Mate Third Class Durant was posthumously awarded the Silver Star Medal for caring for the wounded and courage in facing machinegun and sniper fire in an attempt to rescue a wounded man.
Construction
Durant was launched 3 August 1943, by Brown Shipbuilding, Houston, Texas; sponsored by Mrs. S. R. Durant, mother of Pharmacist's Mate Durant; and commissioned 16 November 1943.
Service history
From 21 January to 7 February 1944, Durant served as schoolship at Norfolk, Virginia, for the training of prospective crews for escort vessels. They made eight voyages as a convoy escort to north African ports between 10 February 1944 and 12 June 1945, guarding men and supplies essential to victory in the European theater of war. On their last crossing the German submarine U-873 surrendered to the escorts.
Durant sailed from Boston, Massachusetts, 9 July 1945, and conducted refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on their way to San Diego, California, where they arrived 7 August. Four days later they got underway for Pearl Harbor, but with the end of the war in the Pacific, their stay there was brief and they returned to the east coast, arriving at New York 26 September. On 22 October, they reported to Jacksonville, Florida, to undergo inactivation. Durant was placed out of commission in reserve 27 February 1946.
Loaned to the Coast Guard 15 May 1952 Durant was commissioned as WDE-489, 9 May 1952, and served on various Pacific weather stations until placed out of commission in reserve at San Diego, 10 April 1954. They were returned to the Navy 16 June 1954, and reclassified DER-389, 7 December 1955. After conversion to a radar picket escort Durant was recommissioned 8 December 1956 and reported to San Diego for shakedown training. Sailing from San Francisco, California, 27 May 1957, they arrived at Pearl Harbor 2 June, to begin picket duty on the Pacific barrier line. Through 1962, they alternated periods of service on early warning duty with participation in exercises, air-sea rescue operations, and necessary maintenance periods.
Fate
Durant was decommissioned in June 1964, and sold for scrapping on 1 September 1974.

Now They Call Me Infidel: Why I Renounced Jihad for America, Israel, and the War on Terror is a best-selling book authored by Egyptian-American human rights activist Nonie Darwish. First published by Sentinel in 2006, the book discusses —among other topics—Darwish's change in attitude toward Jews and Israelis, Islamic extremism in the United States and Darwish's trip to Israel. The book has made Dawrish "one of the heros of the Conservative Right."
In a review for the Hoover Institution, author Aaron Mannes says that Now They Call Me Infidel provides support for the claim that "improving the status of women is essential to reform in the Muslim world." In a review for the politically conservative outlet Human Events, Larry Kelley says the "book is a blistering indictment of a misogynistic polygamous world of the supposedly moderate Egyptian society." Jim Hulston, writing in the pro Palestinian outlet Electronic Intifada, was generally critical of the book, saying, "as a whole, the book is tedious, predictable, and badly edited -- born to be bought, scanned and displayed, not actually read."

Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of larvae and adult queens. It is secreted from the glands in the hypopharynx of nurse bees, and fed to all larvae in the colony, regardless of sex or caste.
During the process of creating new queens, the workers construct special queen cells. The larvae in these cells are fed with copious amounts of royal jelly. This type of feeding triggers the development of queen morphology, including the fully developed ovaries needed to lay eggs.
Royal jelly is sometimes used in alternative medicine under the category apitherapy. It is often sold as a dietary supplement for humans, but the European Food Safety Authority has concluded that current evidence does not support the claim that consuming royal jelly offers health benefits to humans. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has taken legal action against companies that have marketed royal jelly products using unfounded claims of health benefits.
Production
Royal jelly is secreted from the glands in the heads of worker bees and is fed to all bee larvae, whether they are destined to become drones (males), workers (sterile females), or queens (fertile females). After three days, the drone and worker larvae are no longer fed with royal jelly, but queen larvae continue to be fed this special substance throughout their development.
Composition
Royal jelly is 67% water, 12.5% protein, 11% simple sugars (monosaccharides), 6% fatty acids and 3.5% 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA). It also contains trace minerals, antibacterial and antibiotic components, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and trace amounts of vitamin C, but none of the fat-soluble vitamins: A, D, E or K.
Proteins
Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are a family of proteins secreted by honey bees. The family consists of nine proteins, of which MRJP1 (also called royalactin), MRJP2, MRJP3, MRJP4, and MRJP5 are present in the royal jelly secreted by worker bees. MRJP1 is the most abundant, and largest in size. The five proteins constitute 83–90% of the total proteins in royal jelly. Royal jelly has been used in traditional medicine since ancient times, and the MRJPs are shown to be the main medicinal components. They are synthesised by a family of nine genes (mrjp genes), which are in turn members of the yellow family of genes such as in the fruitfly (Drosophila) and bacteria. They are attributed to be involved in differential development of queen larva and worker larvae, thus establishing division of labour in the bee colony.
Epigenetic effects
The honey bee queens and workers represent one of the most striking examples of environmentally controlled phenotypic polymorphism. Even if two larvae had identical DNA, one raised to be a worker, the other a queen, the two adults would be strongly differentiated across a wide range of characteristics including anatomical and physiological differences, longevity, and reproductive capacity. Queens constitute the female sexual caste and have large active ovaries, whereas female workers have only rudimentary, inactive ovaries and are functionally sterile. The queen–worker developmental divide is controlled epigenetically by differential feeding with royal jelly; this appears to be due specifically to the protein royalactin. A female larva destined to become a queen is fed large quantities of royal jelly; this triggers a cascade of molecular events resulting in development of a queen. It has been shown that this phenomenon is mediated by an epigenetic modification of DNA known as CpG methylation. Silencing the expression of an enzyme that methylates DNA in newly hatched larvae led to a royal jelly-like effect on the larval developmental trajectory; the majority of individuals with reduced DNA methylation levels emerged as queens with fully developed ovaries. This finding suggests that DNA methylation in honey bees allows the expression of epigenetic information to be differentially altered by nutritional input.
Use by humans
Cultivation
Royal jelly is harvested by stimulating colonies with movable frame hives to produce queen bees. Royal jelly is collected from each individual queen cell (honeycomb) when the queen larvae are about four days old. These are the only cells in which large amounts are deposited; when royal jelly is fed to worker larvae, it is fed directly to them, and they consume it as it is produced, while the cells of queen larvae are "stocked" with royal jelly much faster than the larvae can consume it. Therefore, only in queen cells is the harvest of royal jelly practical.
A well-managed hive during a season of 5–6 months can produce approximately of royal jelly. Since the product is perishable, producers must have immediate access to proper cold storage (e.g., a household refrigerator or freezer) in which the royal jelly is stored until it is sold or conveyed to a collection center. Sometimes honey or beeswax is added to the royal jelly, which is thought to aid its preservation.
Adverse effects
Royal jelly may cause allergic reactions in humans, ranging from hives, asthma, to even fatal anaphylaxis. The incidence of allergic side effects in people who consume royal jelly is unknown. The risk of having an allergy to royal jelly is higher in people who have other allergies.

Serica (, ) was one of the easternmost countries of Asia known to the Ancient Greek and Roman geographers. It is generally taken as referring to North China during its Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, as it was reached via the overland Silk Road in contrast to the Sinae, who were reached via the maritime routes. A similar distinction was later observed during the Middle Ages between "Cathay" (north) and "Mangi" or "China" (south). The people of Serica were the Seres (), whose name was also used for their region. Access to Serica was eased following the Han conquest of the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang) but largely blocked when the Parthian Empire fell to the Sassanids. Henry Yule summarized the classical geographers:
If we fuse into one the ancient notices of the Seres and their country, omitting anomalous statements and manifest fables, the result will be something like the "The region of the Seres is a vast and populous country, touching on the east the Ocean and the limits of the habitable world, and extending west to Imaus and the confines of Bactria. The people are civilized, mild, just, and frugal, eschewing collisions with their neighbours, and even shy of close intercourse, but not averse to dispose of their own products, of which raw silk is the staple, but which include also silk-stuffs, fine furs, and iron of remarkable quality." That is manifestly a definition of the Chinese.
Some scholars, however, contend the Seres were not the Chinese themselves but tribes speaking Indo-European languages on the western edges of the Chinese dynasties and empires who traded with the ancient Indians, such as the Yuezhi, Saka, and Tocharians.
Name
The Latin forms and derive from the Greek Sērikḗ () and Sḗres (). This seems to derive from their words for silk (, sērikós; ), which since Klaproth has often been linked to the Chinese , whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as . The Greeks and Romans knew of silk long before they understood its origin from silkworms, making sēr () a backformation. Other forms of the name include Serica Regio. Flavius Josephus, in their book Antiquities of the Jews, book 1, paragraph 147, call that region "Σηρια", that in Latin letters is "Seria".
Some classicists have argued that it was extremely improbable that a nation would be named after an insect. Lassen claimed to have identified references to the Seres in Hindu scripture, as the "Çaka [Sakas], Tukhâra [Bactria], and Kanka [Kangju]".
Accounts
Overview
Beginning in the 1st century BC with Virgil, Horace, and Strabo, Roman histories offer only vague accounts of China and the silk-producing Seres of the Far East. Florus seems to have confused the Seres with peoples of India, or at least noted that their skin complexions proved that they both lived "beneath another sky" than the Romans. The 1st-century geographer Pomponius Mela asserted that the lands of the Seres formed the center of the coast of an eastern ocean, flanked to the south by India and to the north by the Scythians of the Eurasian Steppe. The historian Ammianus Marcellinus (c. 330 – c. 400) wrote that the land of the Seres was enclosed by great natural walls around a river called Bautis, possibly a description of the Yellow River. From Turkic peoples of Central Asia the later Eastern Romans (i.e. Byzantines) derived a new name for China, Taugast (Turkic: Tabghach), during its Northern Wei (386–535) period. By the time of the Eastern Roman ruler Justinian I (r. 527–565), the Byzantines purchased Chinese silk from Sogdian intermediaries. However, they also smuggled silkworms out of China with the help of Nestorian monks, who claimed that the land of "Serindia" was located north of India and produced the finest silk.
Ctesias
The first surviving European accounts of the Seres are those in Ctesias's 5th-century BC Indica, where they call them "a people of portentous stature and longevity". The authenticity of the account is, however, disputed.
Strabo
Strabo's 1st-century Geography mentions the Seres in two asides. In the first passage, they mention that "some writers" claim the Seres to be longer lived than the Indians of Musicanus, whom Onesicritus claimed lived to the age of 130. In the second, a passage discussing the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, they mention that Apollodorus of Artemita claimed the Bactrians' borders stretched "even as far as the Seres and the Phryni".
Pomponius Mela
Pomponius Mela's De situ orbis names the Seres as one of three peoples inhabiting the eastern extremity of Asia. They place the Seres between the Indians to the south and the Scythians to the north. In a later passage, they note:
From these the course [of the Caspian shore] makes a bend and trends to the coastline which faces the east. That part which adjoins the Scythian promontory is first all impassable from snow; then an uncultivated tract occupied by savages. These tribes are the Cannibal Scythians and the Sakas, severed from one another by a region where none can dwell because of the number of wild animals. Another vast wilderness follows, occupied also by wild beasts, reaching to a mountain called Thabis which overhangs the sea. A long way from that the ridge of Taurus rises. The Seres come between the two; a race eminent for integrity and well known for the trade which they allow to be transacted behind their backs, leaving their wares in a desert spot.
Pliny
Pliny the Elder discussed the Seres in their Natural History, Book VI, chapter xx. They similarly placed the Seres beyond a wasteland on the other side of Scythia; like Vergil before him, they patently misunderstand sericulture, believing the silk to be a product of certain trees:
Then [sc. east of the Caspian], we again find tribes of Scythians and again desert tracts occupied only by wild animals, till we come to that mountain chain overhanging the sea which is called Tabis. Not till nearly half the length of the coast which looks north-east has been past do you find inhabited country. The first race then encountered are the Seres, so famous for the fleecy product of their forests ... The Seres are famous for the woolen substance obtained from their forests; after a soaking in water they comb off the white down of the leaves ... So manifold is the labour employed, and so distant is the region of the globe drawn upon, to enable the Roman maiden to flaunt transparent clothing in public ...
Ammianus also reports this version, although Pausanias knew that silk came from insects specially cultivated by the Seres for the purpose, suggesting closer attention to Roman diplomats and traders who had visited China.
Elsewhere, Pliny mentions that their iron—which they "send to us with their tissues and skins"—is the highest quality in the world, surpassing even Parthian iron.
Pliny also reports a curious description of the Seres made by an embassy from Taprobane to Emperor Claudius, suggesting they may be referring to the Indo-European populations of the Tarim Basin, such as the Tocharians:
They also informed us that the side of their island which lies opposite to India is ten thousand stadia in length, and runs in a south-easterly direction—that beyond the Emodian Mountains (Himalayas) they look towards the Serve (Seres), whose acquaintance they had also made in the pursuits of commerce; that the father of Rachias (the ambassador) had frequently visited their country, and that the Serae always came to meet them on their arrival. These people, they said, exceeded the ordinary human height, had flaxen hair, and blue eyes, and made an uncouth sort of noise by way of talking, having no language of their own for the purpose of communicating their thoughts. The rest of their information (on the Serae) was of a similar nature to that communicated by our merchants. It was to the effect that the merchandize on sale was left by them upon the opposite bank of a river on their coast, and it was then removed by the natives, if they thought proper to deal on terms of exchange. On no grounds ought luxury with greater reason to be detested by us, than if we only transport our thoughts to these scenes, and then reflect, what are its demands, to what distant spots it sends in order to satisfy them, and for how mean and how unworthy an end!
Ptolemy
The country of "Serica" is positioned in the 150 AD Ptolemy world map in the area beyond the "Imaus" (Pamir Mountains). This shows that they considered Serica to either incorporate or consist of what is now Xinjiang.
Ptolemy also positions the Sinae quite precisely:
Ptolemy also speaks of "Sera, the Capital of the Seres". Henry Yule argued that Ptolemy's misrendering of the Indian Sea as a closed basin meant that Ptolemy must also have misplaced the Chinese coast, and therefore the idea that Sinae is a separate country from Serica would be a misconception.
In their Geography, Ptolemy wrote of lands in and around the Indian Ocean. They explained that a port city called Kattigara lay beyond the Golden Chersonese (i.e. the Malay Peninsula) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant. In an 1877 publication Ferdinand von Richthofen offered the idea that Kattigara was located near modern Hanoi, within the ancient Chinese province of Jiaozhi that existed in northern Vietnam. However, archaeological finds of Roman and Mediterranean artefacts at Óc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City) in the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam hints that this was the location of the port city related by Ptolemy. Roman golden medallions dating to the reign of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius were uncovered there, seeming to suggest Roman commercial activity in Southeast Asia during at least the Antonine period (supported by other finds in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia). Chinese histories affirmed that merchants of "Daqin" (i.e. the Roman Empire) were active in Cambodia and Vietnam. The archaeological evidence seems to correspond with the Chinese claim that a Roman embassy sent by a ruler named "Andun" (安敦; either Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius) in 166 AD first arrived in Jiaozhi, the same region as other Chinese-recorded Roman embassies to follow.
Geography and economy
As Ptolemy describes it, Serica was bordered in the north by the Annibi and Auxacii Montes, identified as the Altai Mountains. The Montes Asmiraei, a Serican district, are the Da-Uri Chain while the Cassi Montes are believed to be the mountains of the Gobi Desert. Ptolemy names the principal river of the Seres as the Bautisus, identified as the Yellow River.
The Greco-Roman writers name over a dozen tribes and fifteen cities of the Seres. It is evident from their portrayals that they are not all of the same ethnicity but share a common national appellation. Their capital is named as Sera. Possible candidates include Kashgar and Yarkand. Issedon, the capital of the Serican Issedones, is thought to have been situated on the eastern slopes of the Pamirs or even the Altai Mountains, while the third notable city, Aspacara, was described as located near the source of the Yellow River.
The ancient fathers also describe the pleasant climate of Serica and its plenitude in natural resources. Among these are iron, furs and skins, and precious stones.

Carl Peter Holbøll (1795–1856) was an officer in the Danish Royal Navy, Greenland colonial officer and explorer of the Greenlandic fauna.
Holbøll served as Royal Inspector of Colonies and Whaling in North Greenland (1825–1828), then Inspector of South Greenland (1828–1856). While in this post they became interested in natural history. Their main contribution was to send large amounts of faunistic collections to the zoologists in Copenhagen. For example, professor Johannes Theodor Reinhardt described the North American form of the red-necked grebe and named it Podiceps holboellii (now Podiceps grisegena holboellii). Holbøll themselves also wrote a treatise on Greenlandic birds. In the paper, they described the hoary redpoll (Linota hornemanni, now known as Carduelis hornemanni), which they named for the botanist Jens Wilken Hornemann. Hornemann had previously received plant collections from Holbøll and named a new species Arabis holboellii (now known as Boechera holboellii).
Holbøll was also a skilled amateur botanist and entomologist.
They wrote a school book for mathematics teaching in Greenland, which was used for about a century.
After a visit to Denmark, they travelled back to Greenland on the brig Baldur, which went down on its way. All on board were lost.

Dietmar Artzinger-Bolten (born 1940) is a German Lawyer and former CDU politician.  They are known for their position as President of the 1. FC Köln soccer team from 1987 to 1991.
Life
Artzinger-Bolten originally came from Allenstein in Ostpreußen, but was relocated to Weinheim in 1945. As a teenager they were a supporter of the Stuttgarter Kickers and played on the school soccer team. They graduated in Weinheim in 1960, and also joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) that same year. Artzinger-Bolten, who was deputy federal chairperson of the Ring of Christian Democratic Students, began studying Jurisprudence at the Ruprecht-Karls-University in Heidelberg. After three semesters they left Heidelberg and continued their studies in Köln, then in Bonn. While studying in Köln, Artzinger-Bolten came into contact with the 1.FC Köln as a spectator during the home games.
Beginning in 1969, they worked as a lawyer. They were a member of the City Council of Cologne from 1975 to 1994 and chaired the Urban Development Committee between 1980 and 1994. From 1975 to 1989, they were a member of the CDU parliamentary group executive committee. From 1989, Artzinger-Bolten was a member of the Board of Directors and the Credit Committee of Stadtsparkasse Köln. Since 1986, Artzinger-Bolten has been involved in the board of the Kölner Haus- und Grundbesitzerverein of 1888.
From the start of the 1980's, Artzinger-Bolten was the lega advisor to the players of the 1. FC Köln. In the winter of 1986–87, the 1. FC Köln was in a leadership crisis after serious board quarrels and the resignation announcement of President Peter Weiand for April 1987. During this time, Dietmar Artzinger-Bolten, who had not yet been represented in FC committees, was proposed as a candidate for the presidency of the club and was elected at an extraordinary general meeting on 3 April 1987. After the election (235:197 votes), Artzinger-Bolten announced that the 1. FC Köln should "become a popular club again". Karl-Heinz Thielen, who had previously been regarded as a candidate for the presidency, had been accused by DFB official Egidius Braun of unspecified accusations, which prevented their candidacy to be put forward. The other candidate, Bernhard Worms, did not run because of political obligations, clearing the way for Artzinger-Bolten. This was therefore classified as an "emergency solution". During their four-year tenure, the soccer club was German runner-up twice, in addition, it reached the semi-final of the 1989–90 UEFA Cup and took part in the 1990–91 DFB-Pokal. During their time as president, the dismissal of coach Christoph Daum occurred during the Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1990 in Italy, and the highest transfer sum in Bundesliga history (DM 14.5 million, other sources mention 17 and 18 million respectively) for the sale of Thomas Häßler to Juventus Turin took place. After the dismissal of Christoph Daum, Artzinger-Bolten and their colleagues of the board we subject to insults, which they experienced as a burden to their family. The three-member management committee of the 1. FC Köln (Artzinger-Bolten, Jupp Söller, Hans Neukirch) announced its withdrawal on 9 September 1991, which was completed at the general meeting on 21 November 1991. Artzinger-Bolten's administration had been criticized to which they complained of unworthy treatment ("I don't know how someone can continue to volunteer if you are treated this way every day") and they also believed that their law firms' reputation was at risk. They wanted to convert the Bundesliga club into a Joint-stock company and place it into the Exchange (organized market) in 1991–92. At the time of their resignation as president in 1991, the club was heavily in debt. Their successor as president to the 1. FC Köln was Klaus Hartmann.
Dietmar Artzinger-Bolten was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany at the end of November 1985 in recognition of their social commitment (member of the Lions Clubs International and the Board of Trustees of the Kölner Philharmonie), as well as receiving the Cross of Merit 1. Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in November 2004.

Narva Oil Plant () is a commercial scale shale oil retorting facility located in Auvere near Narva, Estonia. The plant produces shale oil from oil shale by using Galoter/Eneffit technology. The facility belongs to Enefit Energiatootmine, a subsidiary of Eesti Energia.
History
The original oil shale retorting plant (UTT-3000 refinery) was built in the late 1970s next to the Eesti Power Plant to provide shale oil as a start-up fuel for the power plants. The plant which is using Galoter technology was commissioned in 1980. In 2009, Eesti Energia started construction of a new Enefit 280 shale oil plant adjacent to the existing plant. The new plant was commissioned in 2012 and first oil was produced in the new plant on 20 December 2012.
The oil plant has been operated as a part of the Narva Power Plants. In 2007, the oil plant was separated from the power plants and a separate subsidiary of Eesti Energia, Eesti Energia Narva Õlitehas AS (later: Eesti Energia Õlitööstus AS) was established. In 2016, the oil plant was re-merged with the power plants to create a consolidated generation company Enefit Energiatootmine AS.
Description
The old retorting plant consists of two modified UTT-3000 type solid heat carrier retorts, known as Enefit 140 retorts. Both retorts processing 125 tonnes of oil shale per hour resulting combined up to 240,000 tonnes of shale oil a year. The new retorting plant (Enefit 280) has processing capacity of 2.26 million tonnes of oil shale per year producing 256,000 tonnes of shale oil and 75 million cubic meters of oil shale gas per year. It has an integrated 35 MW steam-driven turbine to convert residual heat to electricity used for the plant own needs. Main products are fuel grade shale oil, raw material for bitumen and antiseptics. The designed annual capacity of the plant is 220,000 tons of shale oil and 60 million cubic meters of retort gas.

Unbreakable is a 2008 reality television series presented by explorer Benedict Allen on UK's Channel 5, where eight volunteers undergo an onslaught of physical and mental pressure in a bid to be declared unbreakable.
Filmed across four continents, Unbreakables takes eight super-fit members of the public on a punishing global trail to undergo a series of brutal challenges.
In settings ranging from the Norwegian arctic to the Sahara Desert, the volunteers learned to survive in the world's harshest environments and endured difficult military training. They were bossed and cajoled by physical trainers and survival experts as they bid to outdo and outlast each other.

The unbreakables are woken before dawn to find that Barnaby has vanished, but the unbreakables along with the South African elite forces find him, and they are told that they are broken.
After David Bain has proven themselves the strongest boxer among those remaining, they break while being buried alive, blaming it on their claustrophobia.
Against all odds, the 3 remaining, Frasier, Angus and Matt manage to reach the finish and are considered 'Unbreakable'.

A Bartholin's cyst occurs when a Bartholin's gland within the labia becomes blocked. Small cysts may result in minimal or no symptoms. Larger cysts may result in swelling on one side of the vagina, as well as pain during sex or walking. If the cyst becomes infected, an abscess can occur, which is typically red and very painful. If there are no symptoms, no treatment is needed. Bartholin's cysts affect about 2% of women at some point in their life. They most commonly occur during childbearing years.
When the cyst becomes uncomfortable or painful, drainage is recommended. The preferred method is the insertion of a Word catheter for four weeks, as recurrence following simple incision and drainage is common. A surgical procedure known as marsupialization may be used or, if the problems persist, the entire gland may be removed. Removal is sometimes recommended in those older than 40 to ensure cancer is not present. Antibiotics are not generally needed to treat a Bartholin's cyst.
The cause of a Bartholin's cyst is unknown. An abscess results from a bacterial infection, but it is not usually a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Rarely, gonorrhea may be involved. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination. In women over the age of 40, a tissue biopsy is often recommended to rule out cancer.
The cyst is named after Caspar Bartholin who accurately described the glands in 1677. The underlying mechanism of the cyst was determined in 1967 by 20th Century obstetrician Samuel Buford Word.
Signs and symptoms
Most Bartholin's cysts do not cause any symptoms, although some may cause pain during walking, sitting, or sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). They are usually between 1 and 4 cm, and are located just medial to the labia minora. Most Bartholin's cysts only affect the left or the right side (unilateral). While small cysts are usually not painful, larger cysts can cause significant pain.
Pathophysiology
A Bartholin's gland cyst develops when the duct that drains the gland becomes blocked. Blockage may be caused by an infection or a mucus plug. The secretions from the Bartholin's gland are retained, forming a cyst.
Diagnosis
Other conditions that may present similarly include hidradenoma papilliferum, lipomas, epidermoid cysts and Skene's duct cysts, among others conditions. In women who are more than 40 years, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out cancer.
Treatment
If the Bartholin's cysts is not painful or uncomfortable, treatment may not be necessary. Small, asymptomatic cysts can be observed over time to assess their development. In cases that require intervention, a catheter may be placed to drain the cyst, or the cyst may be surgically opened to create a permanent pouch (marsupialization). Intervention has a success rate of 85%, regardless of the method used, to alleviate swelling and discomfort.
Catheterization is a minor procedure that can be performed locally as an outpatient procedure. A small tube with a balloon on the end (known as a Word catheter) may be inserted into the cyst. The balloon is then inflated to keep it in place. The catheter stays in place for 2 to 4 weeks, draining the fluid and causing a normal gland opening to form, after which the catheter is removed. The catheters do not generally impede normal activity, but sexual intercourse is generally abstained from while the catheter is in place.
Cysts may also be opened permanently, a procedure called marsupialization, which involves opening the gland through an incision to ensure that the secretion channel remains open. If a cyst is infected, it may break open and start to heal on its own after 3 to 4 days. Nonprescription pain medication such as ibuprofen relieves pain, and a sitz bath may increase comfort and reduce pain. Warm compresses can also speed up healing. If a Bartholin gland abscess comes back several times, the gland and duct can be surgically removed.
Prognosis
While Bartholin cysts can be quite painful, they are not life-threatening. New cysts cannot absolutely be prevented from forming, but surgical or laser removal of a cyst makes it less likely that a new one will form at the same site. Those with a cyst are more likely than those without a cyst to get one in the future. They can recur every few years or more frequently. Many women who have marsupialization done find that the recurrences may slow, but do not actually stop.
Epidemiology
Two percent of women will have a Bartholin's gland cyst at some point in their lives. They occur at a rate of 0.55 per 1000 person-years and in women aged 35–50 years at a rate of 1.21 per 1000 person-years. The incidence of Bartholin duct cysts increases with age until menopause, and decreases thereafter. Hispanic women may be more often affected than white women and black women. The risk of developing a Bartholin's gland cyst increases with the number of childbirths.

The University of Toronto Press is a Canadian university press founded in 1901. Although it was founded in 1901, the press did not actually publish any books until 1911.
The press originally printed only examination books and the university calendar. Its first scholarly book was a work by a classics professor at University College, Toronto. The press took control of the university bookstore in 1933. It employed a novel typesetting method to print issues of the Canadian Journal of Mathematics, founded in 1949.
Sidney Earle Smith, president of the University of Toronto in the late 1940s and 1950s, instituted a new governance arrangement for the press modelled on the governing structure of the university as a whole (on the standard Canadian university governance model defined by the Flavelle commission). Henceforth, the press's business affairs and editorial decision-making would be governed by separate committees, the latter by academic faculty. A committee composed of Vincent Bladen, George Williams Brown (general editor of the press from 1951), and A. S. P. Woodhouse studied the publishing policies of American university presses to inform the structure of the press's publishing division.
Beginning in 1971, the press printed its books simultaneously on paper and microfiche.

ʻUluaki-mata, also known as Teleʻa (active c. 1580-1600 CE), was the twenty-ninth Tuʻi Tonga. They were reportedly one of the mightiest of these rulers, although their power was often characterized as spiritual rather than political. Many traditions recount that their reign was marked by great social changes.
Reign
According to some traditions, ʻUluaki-mata was of the lineage of Lo'au. This would suggest that they were the founder of a new royal line. They may have been not a native prince but a foreigner from ʻUvea or Fiji who came with 500 ʻUvean warriors to claim the throne by force.
Significant social change occurred in Tonga around the time of ʻUluaki-mata's reign, including the creation of the role of Tuʻi Tonga Fefine.
ʻUluaki-mata built the Paepae ʻo Teleʻa (or Paepae o Teleʻa, meaning "Tele'a's Mound"), the royal tomb in Lapaha where one tradition states they were buried. During the 1600s, ʻUluaki-mata also commissioned the construction of a huge kalia (double-hulled canoe) named the Lomipeau ("wavecutter"). Made in ʻUvea (Wallis), the Lomipeau could reportedly carry hundreds of people, and was used for a number of sacred and prestigious purposes.
ʻUluaki-mata reputedly had three chiefly wives (named Talafaiva, Nanasilapaha and Mataukipa) and two hundred secondary wives. According to tradition, Talafaiva was their favourite wife. However, they were seduced one night by either Lolomānaʻia or Lepuhā, when they were on holiday on ʻEuakafa in Vavaʻu. Angrily, Teleʻa ordered their servant ʻAuku (or ʻUka) to beat Talafaiva, which the servant did so thoroughly that they died. Them grave is still on the top of ʻEuakafa. ʻUluaki-mata never returned to Vavaʻu.
One tradition concerning ‘Uluakimata's death states that they were drowned at sea and their body was lost; another states that they are buried in the Paepae ʻo Teleʻa.
Descendants
ʻUluaki-mata's children included their daughter Sinaitakala-‘ilangileka (a Tuʻi Tonga Fefine, they married a chief from Fiji) and their son Fatafehi.
They were succeeded as Tu'i Tonga by Fatafehi.

John G. Walsh (born September 9, 1950) is an American economist who was the acting Comptroller of the Currency from 2010 until 2012. They had been Chief of Staff and Public Affairs at the office since October 2005 and became interim Comptroller on August 15, 2010 following John Dugan. They ceased being interim Comptroller with the April 9, 2012 swearing-in of Thomas J. Curry as the 30th Comptroller of the Currency.
Walsh was born in Baltimore in 1950. They previously served as executive director of the Group of 30, a nonprofit consultative group that studies international economic and monetary affairs. They have served on the staff of the Senate Banking Committee from 1986 to 1992 and as an International Economist for the US Treasury Department from 1984 to 1986. They have also been an International Program Analyst at the Office of Management and Budget, has worked with the Mutual Broadcasting System, and served in the U.S. Peace Corps in Ghana.
Career at the OCC
The OCC's main tasks under Walsh's leadership have been:
Continued supervision of the national banking system as the country emerges from recession
Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's new requirements, including the transfer of the Office of Thrift Supervision's functions into the OCC
Completion of the Basel III capital accord
Controversial issues
On June 21, 2011, Walsh spoke before the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation in London, warning about the dangers of excessive financial regulation. They called it a "swinging pendulum problem" and expressed their view that "we are in danger of trying to squeeze too much risk and complexity out of banking as we institute reforms to address problems and abuses stemming from the last crisis".
The following day, three senators – Jack Reed (D-RI), Carl Levin (D-MI), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) – called for a "fundamental rethink of the OCC's leadership" arguing that Walsh "is not interested in leading an agency charged with ensuring the safety and soundness of our financial institutions".
The OCC released a statement on June 23 suggesting the senators took Walsh's speech out of context and defending the Comptroller.
Current status
On September 8, 2011 a Senate panel approved the nomination of Thomas Curry, then serving as a director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., as Comptroller of the Currency.
The full Senate confirmed Curry on March 29, 2012, and Curry was sworn in on April 9, 2012, ending Walsh's tenure as acting Comptroller.

Elbert Weinberg (May 27, 1928 – December 27, 1991) was an American sculptor.
They were born in Hartford, Connecticut. Displaying an early interest in art, they enrolled at the Hartford Art School at night while attending Weaver High School. After two years they transferred to the Rhode Island School of Design. At the young age of 23, they were awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome, which allowed them to perform further art study in Italy. Upon returning to the U.S., they became a teacher at the Yale School of Design. There they produced a wood carving that caught the eye of a trustee from the Museum of Modern Art, and this sculpture was shown on the cover of Art in America.
In 1959, they were awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and they decided to return to Rome, where they remained for the next eleven years. Returning to the U.S., they taught sculpting at Dartmouth College, Boston University, Temple University (while in Rome) and Union College. They became Professor of Sculpture at Boston University in 1983.
Their early works were influenced by themes of mythology, religion and the Holocaust. They have been displayed at multiple museums, including the New York Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts and the Wadsworth Atheneum in their home town of Hartford. Among their most acclaimed works are the Joie de Danse in the Portman San Francisco hotel and the 1980 Holocaust Memorial at Freedom Plaza in Wilmington, Delaware. Their work Procession was displayed at the Jewish Museum of New York, Jacob Wrestling with the Angel was shown at Brandeis University, the Procession 2 at Beth El Temple in West Hartford, and Justice at the Boston University School of Law.
Despite being widely recognized as a talented sculptor, Elbert Weinberg never attained financial success during their lifetime, in part because they did not prefer the abstract form of sculpture that sold more readily during this period. They died of myelofibrosis and was survived by their daughter Julia and mother Rose Apter Weinberg. The Elbert Weinberg Prize was established in their memory out of a trust fund set up in their name.

Antoine Arnauld (6 February 16128 August 1694) was a French Catholic theologian, philosopher and mathematician. They were one of the leading intellectuals of the Jansenist group of Port-Royal and had a very thorough knowledge of patristics. Contemporaries called them le Grand to distinguish them from their father.
Biography
Antoine Arnauld was born in Paris to the Arnauld family. The twentieth and youngest child of the original Antoine Arnauld, they were originally intended for the bar, but decided instead to study theology at the Sorbonne. Here they were brilliantly successful, and their career was flourishing when they came under the influence of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, the spiritual director and leader of the convent of Port-Royal, and was drawn in the direction of Jansenism.
Their book, De la fréquente Communion (1643), was an important step in making the aims and ideals of this movement intelligible to the general public. It attracted controversy by being against frequent communion. Furthermore, in the frame of the controversy around Jansenius' Augustinus, during which the Jesuits attacked the Jansenists claiming they were heretics similar to Calvinists, Arnauld wrote in defense the Théologie morale des Jésuites (Moral Theology of Jesuits), which would put the base of most of the arguments later used by Pascal in their Provincial Letters denouncing the "relaxed moral" of Jesuit casuistry. Pascal was assisted in this task by Arnauld's nephew Antoine Le Maistre. The Jesuit Nicolas Caussin, former penitentiary to Louis XIII, was charged by their order of writing a defense against Arnauld's book, titled Réponse au libelle intitulé La Théologie morale des Jésuites (1644). Other libels published against Arnauld's Moral Theology of Jesuits included the one written by the Jesuit polemist François Pinthereau (1605–1664), under the pseudonym of the abbé de Boisic, titled Les Impostures et les ignorances du libelle intitulé: La Théologie Morale des Jésuites (1644), who was also the author of a critical history of Jansenism titled La Naissance du Jansénisme découverte à Monsieur le Chancelier (The Birth of Jansenism Revealed to Sir the Chancellor, Leuven, 1654).
During the formulary controversy which opposed Jesuits to Jansenists concerning the orthodoxy of Jansenius' propositions, Arnauld was forced to go into hiding. In 1655 two very outspoken Lettres à un duc et pair on Jesuit methods in the confessional brought a motion of censorship voted against them in the Sorbonne, in quite an irregular manner. This motion prompted Pascal to anonymously write the Provincial Letters. For more than twenty years Arnauld dared not appear publicly in Paris, hiding in religious retreat.
Pascal, however, failed to save their friend, and in February 1656 Arnauld was ceremonially degraded. Twelve years later the so-called "peace" of Pope Clement IX put an end to their troubles; they were graciously received by Louis XIV, and treated almost as a popular hero.
They now set to work with Pierre Nicole on a great work against the Calvinist Protestants: La perpétuité de la foi de l'Église catholique touchant l'eucharistie. Ten years later, however, persecution resumed. Arnauld was compelled to leave France for the Netherlands, finally settling down at Brussels. Here the last sixteen years of their life were spent in incessant controversy with Jesuits, Calvinists and heretics of all kinds. Arnauld gradually evolved away from the rigorous Augustinianism professed by Port-Royal and closer to Thomism, which also postulated the centrality of the "efficacious grace," under the influence of Nicole.
Their inexhaustible energy is best expressed by their famous reply to Nicole, who complained of feeling tired. "Tired!" echoed Arnauld, "when you have all eternity to rest in?" Their energy was not exhausted by purely theological questions. They were one of the first to adopt the philosophy of René Descartes, though with certain orthodox reservations relating to Meditations on First Philosophy; and between 1683 and 1685 they had a long battle with Nicolas Malebranche on the relation of theology to metaphysics. On the whole, public opinion leant to Arnauld's side. When Malebranche complained that their adversary had misunderstood him, Boileau silenced them with the question: "My dear sir, whom do you expect to understand you, if M. Arnauld does not?" Next Arnauld was engaged in an extensive correspondence with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, regarding the latter's views detailed in their "Discourse on Metaphysics" (1686). Arnauld died, aged 82, in Brussels.
Popular record for Arnauld's penetration was much increased in their L'Art de penser, commonly known as the Port-Royal Logic, which kept its place as an elementary text-book until the 20th century and is considered a paradigmatical work of term logic.
Arnauld came to be regarded as important among the mathematicians of their time; one critic described them as the Euclid of the 17th century. After their death, their reputation began to wane. Contemporaries admired them as a master of intricate reasoning; on this, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, the greatest theologian of the age, agreed with Henri François d'Aguesseau, the greatest lawyer. However, their eagerness to win every argument endeared them to no one. "In spite of myself," Arnauld once said regretfully, "my books are seldom very short." . Despite Arnauld's achievements in various fields, their name is mostly known because of Pascal's acclaimed writings, which were more fit for the general public than Arnauld's technical essays. Boileau wrote for them a famous epitaph, consecrating their memory as
“Au pied de cet autel de structure grossière
Gît sans pompe, enfermé dans une vile bière,
Le plus savant mortel qui jamais ait écrit;”
...
(“At the foot of this rough structure altar
Lies without pomp, locked in a vile casket,
The most learned mortal who ever wrote;”)
…
Antoine Arnauld's complete works (thirty-seven volumes in forty-two parts) were published in Paris, 1775–1781. There is a study of their philosophy in Francisque Bouillier, Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne (Paris, 1868); and their mathematical achievements are discussed by Franz Bopp in the 14th volume of the Abhandlung zur Geschichte der mathematischen Wissenschaften (Leipzig, 1902).

Abu'l-Fada'il Sa'id al-Dawla () was the third Hamdanid ruler of the Emirate of Aleppo. They succeeded their father Sa'd al-Dawla in 991, but throughout their reign real power rested in the hands of Sa'd al-Dawla's former chamberlain, Lu'lu', to whose daughter Sa'id was wed. Their reign was dominated by the Fatimid Caliphate's repeated attempts to conquer Aleppo, which was prevented only by the intervention of the Byzantine Empire. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's continued existence as a buffer state between the two powers. Finally, in January 1002 Sa'id al-Dawla died, possibly poisoned by Lu'lu', and Lu'lu' assumed control of Aleppo in their own name.
Life and reign
Sa'id al-Dawla's father, Sa'd al-Dawla, had only with difficulty managed to first secure a measure of control over their domains, and then to maintain a precarious autonomy by manoeuvring between the Byzantine Empire, the Fatimids of Egypt, and the Buyids in Iraq, alternating between warfare and recognizing the suzerainty of each power in turn. The once-proud emirate, which under Sa'id al-Dawla's grandfather Sayf al-Dawla included all of northern Syria and much of the Jazira, had now shrunk to the region around Aleppo. Sa'd al-Dawla's domestic position was precarious, and their state was impoverished and militarily impotent. After the Byzantine–Fatimid peace of 987/8, they came to depend once more on the Byzantines, and it was Byzantine troops that helped them defeat a Fatimid-sponsored attempt to seize Aleppo by the former Hamdanid governor Bakjur in April 991.
Following Sa'd al-Dawla's death in December 991, their young son Abu'l-Fada'il, known by the of Sa'id al-Dawla, succeeded them as emir. Sa'id al-Dawla was under the influence of their chief minister and later father-in-law, Lu'lu', who continued to support the alliance with the Byzantines. Many of their rivals, resenting their power, defected upon Sa'd al-Dawla's death to the Fatimids, who now resumed their attacks on Aleppo. As Marius Canard writes, "the history of [Sa'id al-Dawla's] reign is almost exclusively that of the attempts of Fatimid Egypt to gain the emirate of Aleppo, which were opposed by the Byzantine emperor".
Encouraged by the Hamdanid defectors, the Fatimid caliph al-Aziz launched a first attack in 992, under the governor of Damascus, the Turkish general Manjutakin. The Fatimid general invaded the emirate, defeated a Byzantine force under the of Antioch, Michael Bourtzes, in June 992, and laid siege to Aleppo. They failed to pursue the siege with vigour, however, and the city was easily able to resist. In the spring of 993, after thirteen months of campaigning, Manjutakin was forced to return to Damascus due to lack of supplies. In spring 994, Manjutakin launched another invasion, again defeated Bourtzes at the Battle of the Orontes, took Homs, Apamea and Shayzar and besieged Aleppo for eleven months. The blockade was far more effective this time and soon caused a severe lack of food. Sa'id al-Dawla suggested surrendering to Manjutakin, but the determined stance of Lu'lu' allowed the city's defenders to hold out until the sudden arrival of the Byzantine emperor, Basil II, in Syria in April 995. Basil, who had been campaigning in Bulgaria, had responded to the Hamdanids' plea for aid, and crossed Asia Minor in only sixteen days at the head of an army 13,000 strong; their sudden arrival caused panic in the Fatimid army: Manjutakin burned their camp and retreated to Damascus without battle.
Sa'id al-Dawla and Lu'lu' prostrated themselves before the emperor in person as a sign of gratitude and submission, and they in turn released the emirate from its obligation to pay an annual tribute. Basil's interest in Syria was limited, however, and after a brief campaign that saw an unsuccessful attack on Tripoli, returned to Constantinople. Al-Aziz on the other hand now prepared for all-out war with the Byzantines, but their preparations were cut short by their death in October 996. Nevertheless, the Byzantine–Fatimid contest over Syria continued, with alternating success. In 995, Lu'lu' made terms with al-Aziz and acknowledged them as Caliph, and for a few years Fatimid influence over Aleppo grew. In 998 Lu'lu' and Sa'id al-Dawla tried to seize the fortress of Apamea, but were thwarted by the new Byzantine , Damian Dalassenos. Dalassenos' defeat and death in a battle with the Fatimids shortly after caused another intervention by Basil in the next year, which stabilized the situation and strengthened Aleppo's security from Fatimid attack by placing a Byzantine garrison at Shayzar. The conflict ended with another treaty in 1001 and the conclusion of a ten-year truce.
In January 1002, Sa'id al-Dawla died. According to a tradition recorded by Ibn al-Adim, they were poisoned by one of their concubines at the behest of Lu'lu'. Along with their son Mansur, Lu'lu' now assumed direct power, at first as ostensible guardians over Sa'id al-Dawla's sons Abu'l-Hasan Ali and Abu'l-Ma'ali Sharif, until, in 1003/4, they had them exiled to Egypt. At the same time, one of Sa'id al-Dawla's brothers, Abu'l-Hayja, fled, disguised as a woman, to the Byzantine court. Lu'lu' was a capable ruler who maintained the balance between Byzantium and the Fatimids, but after their death in 1008/9 Aleppo gravitated increasingly towards the latter. A Hamdanid restoration attempt, led by Abu'l-Hayja, failed, and in 1015/6 Mansur ibn Lu'lu' was in turn deposed, ending the last vestiges of Hamdanid rule in Aleppo.

Broad Colney Lakes is an 11 hectare nature reserve previously managed by Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust in London Colney in Hertfordshire. It has recently been sold to an anonymous buyer but reports in The Herts Advertiser says "the selected buyer has stated that the site will continue to be used for fishing, with the woodland managed for the benefit of wildlife.” It has three lakes, created as a result of gravel extraction in the 1920s. Otters travel through Long Lake on their journeys along the River Colne, which flows through the lake, and great crested grebes nest at the edge. Small Lake is marshy and a breeding area for fish, while North Lake has tufted ducks, coots and mallards.
There is access from Water Lane, between Shenley Lane and Waterside, which runs along the south-eastern edge of Long Lake.

Dantrolene sodium, sold under the brand name Dantrium among others, is a postsynaptic muscle relaxant that lessens excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells. It achieves this by inhibiting Ca2+ ions release from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores by antagonizing ryanodine receptors. It is the primary drug used for the treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia, a rare, life-threatening disorder triggered by general anesthesia or drugs. It is also used in the management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, muscle spasticity (e.g. after strokes, in paraplegia, cerebral palsy, or patients with multiple sclerosis), and poisoning by 2,4-dinitrophenol or by the related compounds dinoseb and dinoterb.
The most frequently occurring side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and diarrhea.
It is marketed by Par Pharmaceuticals LLC as Dantrium (in North America) and by Norgine BV as Dantrium, Dantamacrin, or Dantrolen (in Europe). A hospital is recommended to keep a minimum stock of 36 dantrolene vials totaling 720 mg, sufficient for a 70-kg person.
Adverse effects
Central nervous system side effects are quite frequently noted and encompass speech and visual disturbances, mental depression and confusion, hallucinations, headache, insomnia and exacerbation or precipitation of seizures, and increased nervousness. Infrequent cases of respiratory depression or a feeling of suffocation have been observed. Dantrolene often causes sedation severe enough to incapacitate the patient to drive or operate machinery.
Gastrointestinal effects include bad taste, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.
Liver side effects may be seen either as asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes and/or bilirubin or, most severe, as fatal and nonfatal liver inflammation. The risk of liver inflammation is associated with the duration of treatment and the daily dose. In patients treated for hyperthermia, no liver toxicity has been observed so far. Patients on chronic dantrolene therapy should routinely have LFTs monitored.
Pleural effusion with inflammation of the fibrous sac around the heart (oral treatment only), rare cases of bone marrow damage, diffuse muscle pains, backache, dermatologic reactions, transient cardiovascular reactions, and crystals in the urine have additionally been seen. Muscle weakness may persist for several days following treatment.
Mutagenicity and carcinogenity
It is unclear whether dantrolene has carcinogenic effects.
Contraindications
Oral dantrolene cannot be used by:
people with a pre-existing liver disease
people with compromised lung function
people with severe cardiovascular impairment
people with a known hypersensitivity to dantrolene
pediatric patients under five years of age
people who need good muscular balance or strength to maintain an upright position, motoric function, or proper neuromuscular balance
If the indication is a medical emergency, such as malignant hyperthermia, the only significant contraindication is hypersensitivity.
Pregnancy and breastfeeding
If needed in pregnancy, adequate human studies are lacking, therefore the drug should be given in pregnant women only if clearly indicated. It may cause hypotonia in the newborn if given closely before delivery.
Dantrolene should not be given to breastfeeding mothers. If a treatment is necessary, breastfeeding should be terminated.
Interactions
Dantrolene may interact with the following drugs:
Calcium channel blockers of the diltiazem/verapamil type: Intravenous treatment with dantrolene and concomitant calcium channel blocker treatment may lead to severe cardiovascular collapse, abnormal heart rhythms, myocardial depressions, and high blood potassium.
Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, such as vecuronium bromide: Neuromuscular blockade is potentiated.
CNS depressants: Sedative action is potentiated. Benzodiazepines may also cause additive muscle weakness.
Combined oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy with estrogens may enhance liver toxicity of dantrolene, particularly in women over 35 years of age.
Pharmacology
Dantrolene depresses excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle by acting as a receptor antagonist to the ryanodine receptor, and decreasing free intracellular calcium concentration.
Chemistry
Chemically it is a hydantoin derivative, but does not exhibit antiepileptic activity like other hydantoin derivates such as phenytoin.
The poor water solubility of dantrolene leads to certain difficulties in its use. A more water-soluble analog of dantrolene, azumolene, is under development for similar indications. Azumolene has a bromine residue instead of the nitro group found in dantrolene, and is 30 times more water-soluble.
Synthesis
The original patent synthesis started with para-nitroaniline which undergoes diazotization followed by a copper(II) chloride catalyzed arylation with furfural (essentially a modified Meerwein arylation). This then reacts with 1-aminohydantoin to form the final product.
History
Dantrolene was first described in the scientific literature in 1967, as one of several hydantoin derivatives proposed as a new class of muscle relaxant. Dantrolene underwent extensive further development, and its action on skeletal muscle was described in detail in 1973.
Dantrolene was widely used in the management of spasticity before its efficacy in treating malignant hyperthermia was discovered by South African anesthesiologist Gaisford Harrison and reported in a landmark 1975 article published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. Harrison experimentally induced malignant hyperthermia with halothane anesthesia in genetically susceptible pigs, and obtained an 87.5% survival rate, where seven of their eight experiments survived after intravenous administration of dantrolene. The efficacy of dantrolene in humans was later confirmed in a large, multicenter study published in 1982, and confirmed epidemiologically in 1993. Before dantrolene, the only available treatment for malignant hyperthermia was procaine, which was associated with a 60% mortality rate in animal models.

"Ljubav Nije Za Nas" (Cyrillic: Љубав Није За Нас, English translation: "Love is not for us") is a popular song of the Bosnian rock band Regina. The song was released as a track of the eponymous album in 1991.
Background
The song was composed by the band's member Aleksandar Čović and the lyrics are written by Alek Aleksov. The song is sung in Serbo-Croatian language.
2006 version
In 2006, Regina re-recorded the song in duet with the Macedonian pop singer Elena Risteska. It became the second song by Elena (after their Eurovision entry Ninanajna) sang in a different language than Macedonian. The song was awarded as duet of the year on the famous Montenegrin music festival Suncane Skale.
Music video
The video is in black-white version with a lot of violinists in a hall. Elena and the lead singer of the band Davor Ebner are singing with microphones. All that represent a sad concert with dark effects.
Lyrics
This version mostly retains the lyrics of the original version, with the exception of their adaptation for a mixed duet. Elena is starting the song saying that in that night they are feared and that they will lose him, saying that now they don't know how will they write a song and confess everything. Davor the leading singer of Regina is continuing saying that they live in their dreams and there they can just kiss their lips and be them The chorus is coming in which they say just the sentence "Love is not for us". After that Davor again repeat's their part. After that both of them are saying that tomorrow two tears will delete them from their lives and like they never meet themselves, will be strangers forever. They are continuing with the chorus.

SCinet is the high-performance network built annually by volunteers in support of SC (formerly Supercomputing, the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis).
SCinet is the primary network for the yearly conference and is used by attendees and exhibitors to demonstrate and test high-performance computing and networking applications.
International Community
SCinet is also a hub for the international networking community. It provides a platform to share the latest research, technologies, and demonstrations for networks, network technology providers, and even software developers who are in charge of supporting HPC communities at their own institutions or organizations.
Volunteers
Nearly 200 volunteers from educational institutions, high performance
computing sites, equipment vendors, research and education networks, government agencies and telecommunications carriers collaborate via technology and in-person to design, build and operate SCinet.
While many of these credentialed individuals have volunteered at SCinet for years, first timers join the team each year. They include international
students and participants in the National Science Foundation-funded Women in IT Networking at SC (WINS) program. The 2017 SCinet team included women and men from high performance computing institutions in the U.S. and throughout the world.
History
Originated in 1991 as an initiative within the SC conference to provide networking to attendees, SCinet has grown to become the "World's Fastest Network" during the duration of the conference. For 29 years, SCinet has provided SC attendees and the high performance computing (HPC) community with the innovative network platform necessary to internationally interconnect, transport, and display HPC research during SC.
Historically, SCinet has been used as a platform to test networking technology and applications which have found their way into common use.
Research and development
In the past years, SCinet deployed conference wide networking technologies such as ATM, FDDI, HiPPi before they were deployed commercially.

Polish Impressionism was an art movement inspired by French Impressionism. Władysław Podkowiński is generally credited with introducing the movement to Poland after a trip to Paris in 1889, where they were profoundly influenced by French Impressionist painters including Claude Monet. Toward the end of their life, however, they turned more toward Symbolism. Olga Boznanska is possibly the most well known Polish Impressionist, recognized in London and Paris, and winning many prizes. The French Government purchased two of their works.
Overview
Impressionism began in France in the second half of the 19th century, when Paris-based artists publicly showed their art. The movement is characterized by the exposition of light in its changing stages, open composition and visualization. Artists worked mainly in the outdoor – en plein air, the most important thing being to emphasize vivid colors from everyday life. Although impressionism brought freshness and a completely new perspective of the world, it was received with skepticism at first. Contrary to expectations it received the attention of artists and soon won recognition all around the world. Within a short period of time it came also to Poland.
Notable artists
Olga Boznanska
The first Polish artist who represented impressionism was Olga Boznanska (born on 15 April 1865 in Krakow, died on 26 October 1940 in Paris), who studied painting in their childhood. As a daughter of a Polish engineer they had an opportunity to practice in Germany, Austria, and France. In 1894 they were awarded 1st prize by Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria in Vienna for their "Paul Nauen" portrait, and for their portrait of "Miss Marry Breme", they obtained recognition in London. In 1986 jury of Societe des Beaux-Arts in Paris accepted one of their works for the exhibition. After moving to Paris they joined the Polish Artistic Society "Art".
In 1900 at the exhibition in New Gallery they were awarded the golden medal. The French government bought "Bretonka" and "Miss Dygat portrait" for their national collection. They also became a member of Société Nationale des Beaux Arts. After their later successes they represented France, with Claude Monet and August Renoir, at the exhibition in Pittsburgh in 1912.
Most of their works were portraits, many self portraits, and interiors. They used oils in the grey and dark green tones, their paintings were full of nostalgia and sorrow.
The best known of their paintings are: "Woman's portrait", "Girl with chrysanthemums", "Miss Dygat Portrait", "Flowers".
Józef Pankiewicz and Władysław Podkowiński
Both were born in 1866 and at the age of 19 they went on to scholarships in Saint Petersburg.
After acquainting themselves with the works of the French impressionists, Jozef Pankiewicz started to be forerunner of impressionism in Poland. In the beginning their works faced sceptisism of Polish critics. After gaining golden medal for "Mrs. Oderfeld" portrait on the Universal Exhibition in Paris their talent started to be highly considered in their mother land. Their paintings were outdoor compositions: they created landscapes full of brightness and vivid colors.
Jozef Pankiewicz's famous works were: "Girl in the red dress", "Swans in the Saski Park", "Still life with fruits and knife", "Street in Madrid", "Terrace in Madrid", "Still life with green pitcher" and, in opinion of many critics, the most ideal painting "Fruits in the basket".
Władysław Podkowiński painted landscapes, portraits and symbolic scenes. Their best known painting is scandalous "Range".  They are also known for their "Nowy Swiat street", and for their illustrations for magazines, books and calendars.

Brussels Affair (Live 1973) is a live album by the Rolling Stones, released in 2011. It is compiled from two shows (mainly from the second show) recorded in Brussels at the Forest National Arena on Wednesday 17 October 1973, during their European Tour. At the time, the band was unable to enter France, as guitarist Keith Richards had been temporarily banned from visiting the country after being charged with drug possession by a French court. The album was released exclusively as a digital download through Google Play Music on 18 October 2011 in the US and through the Rolling Stones Archive website for the rest of the world in both lossy MP3 and lossless FLAC format. The 2011 digital edition has been bootlegged on physical CD. On 29 August 2012, an official announcement was made, stating its physical release as a high-priced boxset (from $750 to $1,500 depending on the edition). All three releases include a triple LP and double CD.
Brussels Affair (Live 1973) was officially released on a two-disc CD in Japan in 2015 as a bonus of the CD/DVD Set "Marquee Club (live 1971)" (Deluxe limited edition; Ward Records / Eagle Vision). The same 15 Brussels tracks also appear on the 2020 Super Deluxe (3 CDs + Blu-ray disc; Polydor / Rolling Stones Records 088 503-2) and Deluxe (4 LP; Polydor / Rolling Stones Records 089 398-1) box set reissue of Goats Head Soup.
The title of the release is the same as that of several famous and widely known bootleg recordings. The most famous iteration consists principally of the early show as broadcast by the King Biscuit Flower Hour (with "Starfucker" omitted due to its lyrical content) and several bonus tracks ("Gimme Shelter", "Happy", "Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)" and "Street Fighting Man") added from the Tuesday 9 September 1973 London show. The official 2011 release is mainly culled from the second Brussels show; however, "Brown Sugar", "Midnight Rambler" and a transposed guitar solo on "All Down the Line" were taken from the first show.
Concert film clips
On September 8, 2020, the concert footage of the live album was officially released for the first time, in any format, on streaming services such as YouTube. The videos are short clips that keep repeating as the live album plays.
Overview
The album was recorded during their 1973 European Tour, promoting their latest album Goats Head Soup.
In 1973, the Rolling Stones were banned from entering France due to pending drug cases against Keith Richards, Bobby Keys and Anita Pallenberg. The band decided to organise a concert in Brussels for the French audience; RTL Radio chartered a train for French fans.
Critical reception
Reviewing for Vice, Robert Christgau cited "Starfucker" and "Happy" as highlights, and wrote of the album, "The rare arena-rock recording that does justice to the subgenre's power dwarfs their 26 March 1971 Marquee Club vault-pull while making a case for the excision of 'Midnight Rambler' and 'Brown Sugar' from their A list". John Harris was more enthusiastic about the release, writing in The Guardian that it is "unimpeachably great: a beautifully recorded, often unhinged 70 minutes during which the Stones manage to sound like the Platonic ideal of a rock band: simultaneously tight, unhinged, absolutely convincing, and gloriously ludicrous."

Marius Plateau (8 July 1886, Paris – 22 January 1923, Paris) was a French engineer, WWI sergeant, and French Royalist militant. Plateau was an editor of Action Francaise and a former secretary general of the Camelots du Roi. In 1923, Plateau was assassinated by the French anarchist Germaine Berton, who was later acquitted.
Biography
Marius Plateau was born July 8, 1886, in Paris. Plateau first entered politics in 1908 when they began selling the Revue d'Action française newspaper, only a few weeks following its inception.
Plateau was involved in the second Thalamas affair, an effort to disrupt the teachings of Amédée Thalamas at the Sorbonne, following their ascension as a delegate to the Camelots du Roi. On February 10, 1909, Plateau, along with other delegates from Action Francaise proclaimed “Thank you! It will put in my heart a little more hatred for your Republic" amongst other criticisms of the professor. This resulted in them spending 2 months in prison.
In October 1909, Plateau was appointed the Secretary General of the Camelots du Roi. In 1910, he, alongside the Camelots du Roi provided flood relief to families affected by the Great Flood of Paris. In 1911, Plateau was arrested for a demonstration against President Armand Fallières. That same year, they formed the National Federation of Camelots du Roi, unifying multiple smaller sects of the Camelots du Roi. They then became secretary general of Action Francaise.
Marius Plateau served as a sergeant during WWI, receiving a commendation for "exemplary courage" stating:
Plateau left the military having sustained long term disability and was left partially deaf.
Assassination and Burial
On January 22, 1923, Germaine Berton a French Anarchist shot and killed Plateau with a revolver at Action Francaise's headquarters. Berton declared at their trial, “I considered Daudet and Maurras responsible for the occupation of the Ruhr" for their reason for the assassination. Berton had originally planned to assassinate Léon Daudet or Charles Maurras but neither were present at the time of the shooting. Plateau's assistant, Ernest Berger, attempted to assist Plateau after they were shot. Despite confessing, Berton was acquitted of the assassination on acquitted on December 24, 1923. Action Française denounced the verdict as a "crime of the jury".
Following Plateau's death, Germaine's lover Armand Gohary was found to have committed suicide and a senior police officer involved in the case, Joseph Dumas, was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Action Française claimed the assassination was part of a larger “German-Bolshevist” plot and called for the mobilization of Camelots du roi. This led to the vandalization of the printing press of the L'Œuvre newspaper on the evening of Plateau's death. According to the newspaper Le Populaire: "Violence and murder have struck the house [l'Action française] where the call to violence is daily and where political assassination is glorified" (a few days before, one person had died following a riot by the Camelots du Roi). In L'Action française, Robert Havard de La Montagne stated that “certain acts of violence are necessary and noble”. The assassination led to an increased solidarity within Action Française, with Jacques Maritain writing to Charles Maurras: "The idea of ​​the dangers you are running makes even dearer to the hearts of all those who love France and intelligence".
On the day of Plateau's burial, sculptor and future leader of Camelots du Roi, Maxime Real del Sarte commemorated the Monument to Marius Plateau in the cemetery of Vaugirard. During the burial, a crowd of tens of thousands of people rushed the Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou church; in the crowd were Maurice Barrès and Henry de Montherlant.
Tributes
In 1930, members of the Action française founded the Marius Plateau Association, an organization for former members of Action française. Guy Steinbach led to the organization until their death in 2013.

Enrique García (20 November 1912 – 23 August 1969) was an Argentine footballer. Nicknamed Chueco, or El Poeta de la Zurda ("the poet of the left leg", due to their skills for football), is regarded as the best Argentine left winger ever.
García had a long tenure in Racing Club de Avellaneda, where they played 234 matches in 9 years of career with the club, although the team did not win any title. Due to their extraordinary dribbling ability, García became an idol of Racing Club, being acclaimed even by their rivals. They also had a successful run on the Argentina national team, winning the Copa América on two occasions. Out of García's 78 goals scored in their career, only two were scored with their right leg.
Biography
García was born on 20 November 1912 in the city of Santa Fe. They started playing football at local Club Las Rosas. Their brother Salvador played in the Unión de Santa Fe reserve team and brought them to the club for a try, but they were not chosen. In 1929 García moved to Club Brown, where they debuted v Unión, scoring the only goal for a 1–0 win. In 1932, Gimnasia y Esgrima hired García (who was 19 yo) for m$n 2,500.
In Gimnasia, García won the Santa Fe regional championship, being part of a forward line nicknamed los pistoleros ("the gunmen") due to their high goal average. A journalist of El Litoral (local newspaper) nicknamed them "Chueco", which would be their most famous moniker. One year later, García was traded to Rosario Central for $5,000. The Rosarian team was still playing in regional tournaments, but García became an idol of the club and gained recognition not only in the city but in the whole country. García played near 100 matches with Rosario Central. It was said that Ernesto "Che" Guevara became a fan of Rosario Central after being impressed by García's style of play. Writer Osvaldo Bayer was also an admirer of García.
In spite of the interest from Independiente to bring García to the club, arch rival Racing was the club whichi signed García in 1936 for $39.000 and all the profits from a friendly match between both clubs. Apart from García, Racing hired Alejandro Scopelli and Enrique Guaita and goalkeeper Angel Capuano (all of them, returning from Italy). García made their debut for a porteño team in May 1936. They played 232 consecutive matches for Racing Club, being named "the poet of the left leg" by the press. Their best season was in 1938, when they scored 20 goals in 32 matches.
In September 1943 García's left received a serious meniscus injury in a match v Boca Juniors, and underwent surgery. They never recovered completely causing that two years later García left football. They had played 234 matches with 78 goals scored for Racing Club.
National team
García played 35 times for Argentina between 1935 (when they were playing for Rosario Central) and 1943, scoring 9 goals. They were part of the Copa América winning squads of 1937 (where they were one of the keyplayers of the team due to their goals and assistances) and 1941, they also played in the 1942 edition of the tournament. Unfortunately the peak of their career coincided with World War II denying them the chance to play in a FIFA World Cup.
Post-football career
When their professional career ended, García worked at their own sweet shop until 1960, when they returned to football as talent scout and trainer of the youth divisions at Racing Club. "We do not whish to form players from a day to another so footballers can't escape from the human law of evolution", said García by then.
During their last years, García was in a situation of poverty and used to go from bar to bar, saying to customers "I am Enrique García, the best left winger of all time, would you invite me to have a coffee?"
García died on August 23, 1969. They were only 56 years old.

The Infantry Training Centre (ITC) is a unit of the British Army, administered by HQ School of Infantry and responsible for the basic training and advanced training of soldiers and officers joining the infantry. The unit's headquarters are at Catterick, North Yorkshire.
History
ITC Catterick assumed overall responsibility for all infantry phase 2 training from the three Infantry Training Battalion sites at Catterick, Strensall and Ouston on 1 May 1995. As of May 2002, the ITC assumed full control of all infantry phase 1 and 2 training for the Regular Army in a single Combat Infantryman's Course (CIC). The course was subsequently renamed the Combat Infantry Course (CIC) to reflect the inclusion of female recruits.
Training regime
Whereas initial training for other army roles is delivered in two stages - Phase 1 (basic training) and Phase 2 (trade-specific training) - the Combat Infantry Course combines both into a single course for Standard Entrants aged 17.5 years and above.

The Oriente warbler (Teretistris fornsi) is a species of bird in the Cuban warbler family, Teretistridae, that is endemic to Cuba. Its natural habitats include dry forests, lowland moist forests, montane moist forests, and xeric shrublands. As its common name implies, the Oriente warbler is found in Cuba's east; it is the sister species to its fellow Cuban endemic, the yellow-headed warbler, which is found in extreme western Cuba.
This species measures long. Its upperparts are a uniformly medium-grey. The underparts are mostly yellow, with a light grey belly. A whitish eye ring and slightly decurved bill are distinctive traits.
The Oriente warbler feeds on insects, spiders and small lizards.

The Prosecutor General's Office of Kazakhstan () is a state body accountable to the President of Kazakhstan, exercising supreme supervision over the precise and uniform application of laws, decrees of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and other regulatory legal acts on the territory of the Republic, over the legality of operational-search activities, inquiry and investigation, administrative and enforcement proceedings.
History
On 13 July 1922, at the 2nd convocation of the 3rd session of the KazCEC, the State Prosecutor's Office was organized in the structure of the People's Commissariat of Justice. The People's Commissar of Justice served as the prosecutor of the republic.
In 1933, under the People's Commissariat of Justice, the Office of the Prosecutor's Office was formed, which became relatively independent. For the first time in its history, the functions of the prosecutor and the People's Commissar of Justice were separated.
In 1937, the Constitution of the Kazakh SSR was adopted. From that moment, the stage of further development and strengthening of the Prosecutor's Office began, which completely separated from the People's Commissariat of Justice in November 1937 according to the order and began to function as an independent structure of the republic's law enforcement agencies.
After Kazakhstan gained independence in 1991, the Prosecutor's Office played a huge role in the formation of the country's statehood.

A History of Ireland in 100 Objects was a joint project by The Irish Times, the National Museum of Ireland, and the Royal Irish Academy to define one hundred archaeological or cultural objects that are important in the history of Ireland. The objects are single human-made artefacts or documents, excluding buildings, ranging in date from about 5,000 BC (Mesolithic) to the early 21st century. Most of the objects are held in accessible collections in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.
Details of the hundred objects, written by Irish Times journalist Fintan O'Toole, were initially serialized in The Irish Times between February 2011 and January 2013. In February 2013 a book about the hundred objects written by O'Toole, entitled A History of Ireland in 100 Objects, was published, and it quickly became a best-seller with 35,000 free downloads.
In January 2017 An Post announced that a selection of the 100 objects would form the subjects for the 9th definitive postage stamp series for Ireland, to be issued over a period of five or six years from 2017. The first set of stamps featuring twelve of the objects were issued in January 2017, consisting of eight different SOAR (Stamps on a Roll) stamps with various values (€0.05 to €7.50), a range coil stamps, and a national (N) and an international (W) rate stamp booklet.

The Diocese of Antiphrae () was an ancient Roman Catholic diocese.
The diocese was centered on the Roman civitas (town) of Antiphrae, which has been tentatively identified with Marina El Alamein near Dresieh. The ancient bishopric was first in the Roman province of Crete and Cyrene, then in late antiquity, Libya inferior (Marmarica), suffraged by the archdiocese of Darni.
Of this ancient diocese there are only three bishops known. Serapione took part in the first Council of Nicea in 325. Menas attended the council of Alexandria convened by Patriarch Sant'Atanasio in 362. Apollo signed the letter of the bishops of Egypt to Emperor Leo (458) following the killing of the Alexandrian patriarch Proterius; and also subscribed to the decree of Genadius of Constantinople against the simons in 459.
Today Antifre survives as a bishopric holder; the seat is vacant since September 15, 1965.

Zenaida Elvira González Manfugás (February 22, 1922 - May 2, 2012) was a Cuban-born American-naturalized pianist, considered to be one of the best Cuban pianists in history.
Biography
Manfugás was born on February 22, 1922 in Guantánamo, Cuba. Them father was Judge Amando González Veranés and their mother, Andrea Manfugás Crombet, was a renowned pianist and teacher. They had two sisters: Alicia and Aida Esther. Your mother's family is descended from the renowned composer Nene Manfugás, who was a performer of Sonnets in the first half of the 20th century.
Them family settled in Baracoa. In this city their father served as municipal judge while their mother founded a music school linked with the Conservatorio Orbón. They studied in Santiago de Cuba. Manfugás and their sisters began piano lessons at age five, under their mother's tutelage. At age seven, Manfugás was able to play Mozart "Coronation Mass", and Beethoven "Concerto 5". Manfugás gave their first concert in 1949 in Havana, playing at the Anfiteatro de Avenida del Puerto and being part of the Gonzalo Roig's Municipal Band. In their concert they played the "Concerto in A Minor" by Edvard Grieg. This became a frequent venue for Manfugás.
Three years after their debut, Journalist Agustín Tamargo got that the then President of the Colegio de Belén University in Havana, Father Joseph Rubino, gave to Manfugás a scholarship to study music in Spain and Roig asked them to play at Havana's Cathedral Square.
So, in 1952, Manfugás moved to Spain and started their studies at the Real Conservatorio Superior de Música de Madrid (Royal Conservatory of Music of Madrid), where they were a student of Professor Tomas Andrade de Silva. They performed "concerts and premieres" in Spain, where they performed Dos Danzas (song composed by Harold Gramatges) in 1953. They then moved to Paris where they studied under the tutelage of Walter Gieseking.
Where they returned to Cuba in 1958, they were asked to play their music at the Auditorium Theater on December 21 that year. However, later, the organizers convinced them to delay the concert until January 9, 1959, but in this year, Cuba was "in the revolutionary ferment of the triumph" of Fidel Castro's guerrilla movement and Manfugás was not able to play their music at the Auditorium until 1960.
Since then, Manfugás was very active as a pianist in Cuba, and sometimes accompanied classical orchestras, such as the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Chamber Orchestra. In addition, they were professor at the "Alejandro García Caturla" Conservatory in Marianao and served as national advisory in the cathedra of piano at the Amadeo Roldan Conservatory, in Cuba.
Manfugás conducted diverses tours in Europe (in places like Belgium and Russia) and Asia (in countries like China and Japan), for which they were widely praised. Later, they also played in Canada.
In 1974, Manfugás went to the United States, where they performed throughout the 50 states. Two years after, the pianist emigrated to this country, where settled in Elizabeth, New Jersey for good.
In 1979, they visited Cuba for the last time.
In exile, Manfugás played their music in places like Spain, Paris, Italia, New York City and Miami. They also gave a concert as a soloist in the New World Symphony in Miami and was professor at Kean University of New Jersey, where they taught History of Music. In December 2010, the Apogee Foundation on Cultural Center Cuba Ocho of Miami held a ceremony in their honor, although they could not perform, as "she was recovering from a recent surgery".
Them final concert in Miami, where they performed frequently, took place on May 22, 2011 with the musical work "Tres pianos, Tres intérpretes" ("Three pianos, Three performers"), "a concert held at the Wertheim Center International University of Florida", where they alternated with the Jesus y Eugenia Ruspoli Armengol.
They had cancer and suffered from several health complications. Zenaida Manfugás died on May 2, 2012, at 4:30 pm ET in Elizabeth. According to different sources, they died due to a cardiac arrest or cancer. Their remains were cremated on Sunday May 13.
Personal life
They were settled in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1974. When they became a U.S. citizen, they adopted their mother's maiden name in their honor, since their mother had taught them how to play the piano. In 1955, they gave birth to a son in Spain, Andrés Montes, who was one of the most known and respected sports journalists of both the radio and television in that country and who died in 2009 at age 53.
Curiosities
The musician Gonzalo Roig regarded that Zenaida Manfugás "was the best interpreter of Cuban music, and one of the best pianists" of Cuba, and Lecuona "regarded them as the best interpreter of their music".
They were a great reader and they asked books from the library every month.
They never recorded a studio album. The recordings that exist were from live performances. Several compilation albums interpreting the works of Cuban composers were released. "Two volumes were entitled" Por siempre Lecuona (Lecuona Forever) (1999), compilations from multiple live performances. Those volumes are formed by the most popular works of Lecuona.
In 1964, Manfugás participated in the documentary Nosotros la música, directed by Rogelio París.
At the time of their death, they lived in a modest apartment for the elderly and, like many other masters of classical music, died in poverty.

Arthello Beck Jr. (July 17, 1941 – November 5, 2004) was an American artist. They often painted scenes of places they had visited, using a variety of mediums, including oils, watercolors, and charcoal.
Beck was born in Dallas, Texas, and attended Lincoln High School, where they received their only formal art training. Afterwards, they worked for the United States Postal Service, as well as various other jobs before becoming a professional artist.
 They are possibly known best for their works from the 1960s dealing with the Civil Rights Movement, although Beck commonly featured other subjects, including children, religion, and human interaction, particularly in the African-American community in the southern regions of the United States.
A longtime resident of Oak Cliff, Beck was a firm believer in grassroots movements, and established the Arthello Beck Gallery, which became a centerpiece of the Dallas area art scene in the 1970s and 80s, and was instrumental to the careers of many black artists.
Beck was a member of the National Conference of Artists and the Southwest Alliance of African American Artists, and was one of the founders of the Southwest Black Artists Guild.
Honors
Their paintings and sketches were among those selected for inclusion in a touring exhibition of athlete Grant Hill's collection of African-American artists. Hill, who began collecting art in emulation of their father, Calvin Hill, particularly cited Beck's painting Confrontation (1969) as an influence, saying, "I grew up with this painting, and just as my father is attached to it because it reflects the historic struggle of the black male, so am I."
In 2007, a local campaign was organized to rename the South Dallas Cultural Center in Beck's honor. Although a petition was signed by over 850 residents, the City Council voted unanimously to reject the proposal, choosing instead to give their name to a gallery within the center. The decision met with controversy on both sides, as proponents felt that a gallery within the building was not a sufficiently prominent honor, while others argued that the center's current name brings honor to a section of town that is often maligned and that a majority of the petition's signers lived outside the South Dallas area.

Apor was a Hungarian tribal chieftain, who, according to the Illuminated Chronicle, led a campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 959, where the legend of Botond takes place. They were the ancestor of the gens Apor.
The Apor family of Transylvanian nobility traditionally trace their origins to him. In their work Lusus Mundi, 17th-18th century historian Baron Péter Apor de Altorja claims such descent. Also, acknowledging that no surviving written sources explicitly state so, they proposed that Apor was a legitimate son of Hungary's Grand Prince Árpád.

Zombie Nightmare is a 1987 Canadian zombie film produced and directed by Jack Bravman, written by John Fasano, and starring Adam West, Tia Carrere, Jon Mikl Thor, and Shawn Levy. The film centres around a baseball player who is killed by a group of teenagers and is resurrected as a zombie by a Haitian voodoo priestess. The zombie goes on to kill the teens, whose deaths are investigated by the police. The film was shot in the suburbs of Montreal, Canada. It was originally written to star mostly black actors but, at the request of investors, the characters' names were changed to more typically white names. While Bravman was credited as director, Fasano directed the majority of the film. Problems occurred between Fasano and the production crew, who believed them to be assistant director and ignored their directions.
Originally planned for theatrical release, Zombie Nightmare was released direct-to-video by New World Pictures. It grossed C$1.5 million against a budget of $180,000. While it received negative reviews from critics, finding the plot to be predictable and derivative, it was praised for its heavy metal soundtrack featuring Motörhead, Girlschool, and Jon Mikl Thor's band Thor. Zombie Nightmare was shown in a 1994 episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.
Plot
Baseball player William Washington is fatally stabbed defending a young girl from two teenagers. Years later, William's son Tony also becomes a baseball player. After Tony disrupts a robbery at a grocery store, they are struck and killed by a car full of teenagers: Bob, Amy, Jim, Peter, and Susie. The teens flee the scene and Tony's body is carried to their home, where their mother Louise mourns over him. They contact Molly Mekembe, the girl William saved, to repay the favour of their rescue. Now revealed to be a Haitian voodoo priestess, Molly resurrects Tony as a zombie and uses their powers to guide them to the teenagers, aiding them in their revenge.
The next night, Tony tracks Peter and Susie to an academy gymnasium and fatally breaks Peter's neck, then kills Susie by crushing their skull with a baseball bat. Police detective Frank Sorrell investigates the case. Police Captain Tom Churchman tells the press that the killings were a drug-induced murder-suicide. The next night, Tony finds Jim sexually assaulting a waiter and impales Jim with their bat, killing him. Churchman tells Sorrell that they found a suspect responsible for the murders and closes the case. Believing that the case has not truly been solved, Sorrell investigates photos that place Molly at both incidents. They suggest bringing them in for but Churchman dismissed it. After sending Sorrell home to rest, Churchman calls Jim's father Fred and informs them of Molly's involvement in Jim's death. Fred goes to the police station to meet Churchman, but is killed by Tony en route.
Believing that they will be targeted next, Bob and Amy decide to leave town. They steal money from Jim's uncle's garage but Tony finds them there and kills them. Sorrell is attacked by Tony but survives. While monitoring Tony's actions, Churchman abducts Molly and forces them at gunpoint to show them where Tony is going. Sorrell follows Tony to a cemetery. Molly and Churchman soon arrive, with both telling Sorrell that the priestess resurrected Tony to not only avenge himself, but also to avenge Molly, as Churchman and Fred were the teenagers who attacked their years ago and Churchman killed Tony's father. Churchman shoots Tony, having learned that a revived zombie's power fades once it has achieved its goal. Molly tries to cast a spell, but is shot and killed by Churchman, who then turns to kill Sorrell as the only surviving witness. However, a second zombie rises out of a nearby grave and drags Churchman into the ground while Churchman pleads for Sorrell to kill him.
Cast
Production
Director Jack Bravman wanted to transition from adult films to horror, and contacted John Fasano after hearing about their work on Blood Sisters. Bravman asked Fasano to write the script and take an uncredited co-directing role. Fasano accepted and wrote the original script to have the teens be black with black-sounding names, setting the film in their hometown of Port Washington, New York, and offering local actors roles for the film. Associate Professor of the University of Lethbridge Sean Brayton described the original concept as "a retribution narrative" of a black character getting revenge on the white perpetrators of their death. The script was later changed to give the teens more white-sounding names because investors were worried that a black-centric cast would not sell in the foreign market. Having written the script on an IBM Selectric II, Fasano typed the white-sounding names onto a page, cut them out with a knife, and glued them to their appropriate places in the script. After the name changes, they received a budget of $180,000 from investors. Unions in New York did not give the production a permit to film in the state, so filming was moved to Montreal, Quebec.
Zombie Nightmare was produced by Montreal-based company Gold-Gems Productions and was the film debut of American actor Tia Carrere. Adam West played the crooked police officer Tom Churchman. West was on the set for two days and glanced at their script during their scenes; Fellow cop Frank Sorrell was played by Frank Dietz, a childhood friend of Fasano. Manuska Rigaud, who played voodoo priestess Molly Mokembe, was a professional Tina Turner impersonator. The role of Tony was originally given to bodybuilder Peewee Piemonte. Days into production, Piemonte was fired for eating all the craft services and the meals of crew members. Piemonte was replaced by Jon Mikl Thor, singer for the Canadian rock band Thor. Wrestler Superstar Billy Graham was originally cast to play Tony's father. On the day they arrived in Montreal, no one came to pick them up at the airport and Graham left after waiting ten hours. Fasano took up the role. Scenes with West and Carrere were directed by Bravman while Fasano shot the majority of the film. Problems occurred between Fasano and the Canadian crew, who believed them to be assistant director and not co-director. This resulted in their directions being ignored by the crew, including cinematographer Roger Racine.
Tony Bua and Andy Clement, college friends of Fasano, made the zombie masks and provided the makeup for the film. It took five hours to apply Jon Mikal Thor's makeup, using glue and latex. American cast and crew members were housed in an airport hotel with pornography being played on every television channel, and they noticed that Bravman's name appeared in the credits for many of the films. Zombie Nightmares editor, David Wellington, received the writing credit for the film so that it would qualify for a Canadian tax credit program.
Thor wrote much of the incidental music. This includes heavy metal riffs by their band and synthesizer music played by the band Thorkestra. Several other heavy metal bands contribute to the soundtrack. The Motörhead single "Ace of Spades" plays during the opening credits. Other bands heard on the soundtrack include Virgin Steele, Girlschool, Fist, and Death Mask, and a track by Thor's then-wife and backup singer Rusty Hamilton.
Reception and legacy
Release
The film was originally planned for a theatrical release by Filmworld Distributors but it was instead released direct-to-video by New World Pictures. It was released in the United States on VHS in October 1987. The film grossed C$1.5 million worldwide. The film was released on special edition DVD by Scorpion Releasing in 2010.
Critical reception
Steve Bissette for Deep Red Magazine criticized the story for being predictable and derivative. Bissette thought the makeup and production values to be competent and noted Rigaud's "absurd over-the-top performance". Fangoria had praise for the performances of the teen leads and recommended the movie for its heavy metal soundtrack. However, the reviewer considered the film boring, criticizing the lack of special effects and the predictable plot. Ian Jane of DVD Talk wrote that the film was horrible but so "deliciously goofy" one couldn't help but have fun with it. Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called it "painful and toilsome". Bloody Disgusting listed the film among the "cheesiest" of heavy metal horror films. Kerrang! considered the soundtrack to be better than the film itself. Jim Craddock, author of VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, summarized the film as "cheap and stupid".
Mystery Science Theater 3000
Zombie Nightmare was featured in a season six episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), a cult science fiction comedy television series in which the character Mike Nelson and their two robot friends Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo are forced to watch bad films as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. The episode was first showcased during Comedy Central's "Fresh Cheese" fall 1994 tour around college campuses in the United States. It made its television debut on Comedy Central on 24 November 1994. The episode premiered during the channel's annual Turkey Day marathon of MST3K episodes, which West hosted. In The Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, a series guide written by MST3K members, Mary Jo Pehl described the movie as "painful" and said that the members of the show "thoroughly, intensely, and unequivocally hated this movie". In 2009, Shout! Factory released the episode as part of the "Volume XV" box set, and in 2017, the episode was added to Netflix.

Thomas Mack Lauderdale (born July 14, 1970) is an American musician and pianist, largely known for their work with their Portland-based band Pink Martini.
Early life
Thomas Mack Lauderdale was born in 1970 in Oakland, California, and adopted by Kerby Roy and Linda Sue, née Mikesell. In 1972, the family moved to Indiana, where their father was pastor at "Eel River Church of the Brethren". After church services, Lauderdale usually went to the piano, and tried to replicate the hymns they heard. Their parents bought for them an upright piano at an auction and so they began their formal musical studies at age six with Patricia Garrison of North Manchester, Indiana and later, Joyanne Jones at Indiana University/Purdue University in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
In 1976, their father resigned from the ministry and the Lauderdale family opened a plant nursery near North Manchester. The family moved to Portland, Oregon in 1982, after their parents divorced and their father came out of the closet. In the 1990s, their parents went on several talk shows – including 20/20, Oprah, Jane Whitney, and Christina - to talk about what happens when a spouse comes out. Kerby returned to the ministry, and is the first openly gay pastor in their denomination. They performed the service when their former wife Linda remarried in 2000.
Education
In Portland, Oregon Lauderdale began their studies with Sylvia Killman in 1982. Killman and Lauderdale remain close friends. Lauderdale won the "Oregon Symphony's annual Corbett Competition" in 1985, marking the beginning of a long association with conductor Norman Leyden. They graduated from Portland's "Ulysses S. Grant" High School in 1988, where they were student body president and editor of The Grantonian. Lauderdale studied at Harvard University, where they graduated cum laude with a degree in History and Literature.
"Pink Martini" band
After seeing the Del Rubio Triplets on Pee-Wee Herman's Christmas Special, Lauderdale arranged for them to travel to Portland, Oregon in October 1994 to give a series of concerts at retirement homes, nursing homes, and hospitals. After a week of performances and appearances, the Del Rubio Triplets performed at a fundraising concert at Cinema 21 in Northwest Portland. Stuck for an opening act for the group, Lauderdale threw on a Betsey Johnson cocktail dress, and joined by a bass player, a bongo player, and a singer, took to the stage as Pink Martini.
Pink Martini's first concerts were often politically motivated, with performances at events for progressive causes such as the environment, affordable housing, civil rights, libraries, and public broadcasting. The band remains committed to its progressive and political roots. FundFest is a biennial four-day concert series produced by the band to raise money and visibility for four different organizations. Past recipients include Reach Community Development, Oregon Public Broadcasting, the ALS Association of Oregon and SW Washington, Children's Cancer Association, the Bicycle Transportation Alliance, Friends of Trees, and KBOO Community Radio.
Pink Martini has grown from four musicians to its current twelve. Singer China Forbes – who Lauderdale met at the college, Harvard University – joined the band in 1995. The band has performed its multi-lingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Tunisia, Australia, Canada and the United States. In 1998, the ensemble made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony under the direction of Norman Leyden. Pink Martini has since performed with over 50 symphony orchestras around the world including the Boston Pops, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the BBC Orchestra, and with the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Other appearances include two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall in 2007 & 2009; the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year's Eve 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011 & 2014; the opening party of the New York Museum of Modern Art; the Governor's Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia; two sold-out concerts at Paris' legendary Olympia theatre in 2011; and Paris' fashion house Lanvin's 10-year anniversary celebration for designer Alber Elbaz in 2012.
The band has collaborated and performed with numerous artists, such as Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Jane Powell, Henri Salvador, Chavela Vargas, New York performer Joey Arias, puppeteer Basil Twist, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, filmmaker Gus Van Sant, Courtney Taylor, Taylor of The Dandy Warhols, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Japanese legend Hiroshi Wada, Italian actor and songwriter Alba Clemente, DJ Johnny Dynell and Chi Chi Valenti, NPR White House Correspondent Ari Shapiro, the original cast of Sesame Street, March Fourth Marching Band, The von Trapps, the Bonita Vista High School Marching Band from Chula Vista, California, and the Pacific Youth Choir of Portland, Oregon.
Albums
Pink Martini has released seven studio albums and one live concert DVD on the band's own record label, Heinz Records and partnered with other labels worldwide, including Naïve Records in France, Wrasse Records in the United Kingdom and South America, Audiogram in Canada, Urtext in Mexico, Random Records in Argentina and Chile, Inertia Recordings in Australia and New Zealand, Ales in Korea, and Top 2 in Southeast Asia. The band's debut album Sympathique was released in 1997, and received nominations for "Song of the Year" and "Best New Artist" in France's Victoires de la Musique awards. Sympathique (1997), Hang on Little Tomato (2004), and Hey Eugene! (2007), Splendor In The Grass (2009) and Joy To The World (2010) have all gone gold in France, Turkey, Greece, and Canada selling over 2.5 million copies worldwide.
In Fall 2011 the band released two albums – A Retrospective, a collection of the band's most beloved songs spanning their 17-year career, which includes eight previously unreleased tracks, and 1969, an album of collaborations with legendary Japanese singer Saori Yuki. 1969 has been certified platinum in Japan, reaching #2 on the Japanese charts with the Japan Times raving "the love and respect Saori Yuki and Pink Martini have for the pop tradition shines through on every track."
Individual appearances
In addition to their work with Pink Martini, Lauderdale has collaborated with cabaret performer and singer Meow Meow, the surf band Satan's Pilgrims and writer Tom Spanbauer. In Spring 2008, they completed their first film score for Chiara Clemente's documentary Our City Dreams, a portrait of five New York City-based women artists of different generations. In 2008, they performed as the featured piano soloist in Beethoven's Choral Fantasy with the Choral Arts Ensemble of Portland under the direction of Roger Doyle, and Gershwin's Concerto in F with the Oregon Symphony under the direction of Christoph Campestrini. In 2011 Lauderdale again appeared as the featured soloist with the Oregon Symphony, this time under the direction of Carlos Kalmar.
They have appeared as soloist with numerous orchestras and ensembles, including the Oregon Symphony, the Seattle Symphony, the Portland Youth Philharmonic, Chamber Music Northwest, the Choral Arts Ensemble of Portland and Oregon Ballet Theatre (where they collaborated with choreographer James Canfield and visual artists Storm Tharp and Malia Jensen on a ballet based on the original story of Bambi, written by Felix Salten in 1923).
Political activism
Beginning in high school, Lauderdale became interested in politics. They worked in Portland City Hall, first under Mayor J.E. "Bud" Clark in the office of international relations, and later under City Commissioner Gretchen Kafoury on the city's civil rights ordinance. They were appointed by Oregon governor Neil Goldschmidt to the Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee; by Mayor Clark to the Metropolitan Youth Commission and by City Commissioner Mike Lindberg to the Public Safety in the Parks Task Force. In 1992, they were involved in the No on 9 and No on 13 Campaigns, in response to measures that would amend the Oregon constitution to declare homosexuality illegal.
In June 2009, Lauderdale organized a rally of support for Portland Mayor Sam Adams, the first openly gay mayor of a major American city. Adams had been caught up in an alleged sex scandal with intern Beau Breedlove, the times reports that the "Oregonian, the local police union and JustOut, a local gay periodical" were calling for their resignation. Portlanders at Lauderdale's rally compared Adams to Bill Clinton, saying they only lied about sex and should not resign.
In October 2011, Lauderdale and Pink Martini organized and performed at a rally in support of the Occupy movement. The rally took place in downtown Portland, OR in Pioneer Courthouse Square and included speeches and performances by Storm Large as well as Oregon members of congress Earl Blumenauer & Peter DeFazio.
Personal life
Lauderdale lives in the Harker Building, a 9,600 square foot building in the downtown commercial district in Portland, Oregon.

DeMolay International is an international fraternal organization for young men ages 12 to 21. It was founded in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1919 and named for Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. DeMolay was incorporated in the 1990s and is classified by the IRS as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization.
DeMolay is open for membership to young men between the ages of 12 and 21 who acknowledge a higher spiritual power. It has about 15,000 active members spread throughout every continent except for Antarctica. There are active chapters in Germany, Australia, Japan, Philippines, Argentina, Aruba, French Guiana, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador (affiliated to Peru jurisdiction), Italy, Romania, Greece (affiliated to Romania jurisdiction), France, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia (affiliated to Serbia jurisdiction), Bulgaria (affiliated to Italian jurisdiction) and the United States.
Although young women are not permitted to join DeMolay, chapters are permitted to elect chapter "sweethearts" and "princesses."
DeMolay is part of the "family" of Masons and associated organizations. DeMolay is the youth group for young men. (Rainbow Girls and Job's Daughters are similar Masonic-related organizations for young women.)
Founding
The Order of DeMolay was founded in 1919 with nine members, most of whom lived near each other in Kansas City.
The crown appearing in the self-adopted heraldic arms (the emblem) of the order contains 10 rubies, each representing one of the original nine members and the organization's founder, Frank S. Land. The rubies were originally portrayed as pearls; as each founding member died, the pearl representing them was changed to a ruby.
Values
DeMolay has seven Cardinal Virtues, taught as its basic ideals. They are:
Filial love (the love between a child and their parent): which is the love and the kindness we should have with our parents, the ones that gave us birth and taught us the first lessons in our lives. Through them we had the first lessons of kindness, respect and the belief in God.
Reverence for sacred things: it means to believe in God (independent on the religion) and to respect others' beliefs.
Courtesy: kindness, respect and solidarity are principles that a DeMolay tries to practice in their life. Philanthropy is only valid when it is done by heart and soul.
Comradeship: is to be a faithful friend, not only in good times, but also in hard times.
Fidelity: is to believe and follow your own values and virtues; yet keeping in secret everything which is entrusted. Fidelity is to be faithful to God, your homeland and your friends, following the Jacques DeMolay fidelity lead, who preferred to die instead of betraying their companions or break with their pledge.
Cleanness: means to be an ideal citizen, pure in soul and heart; it is to always have a clear conscience. It means to keep your mind away from everything that is against the values of a good citizen.
Patriotism: is to respect and defend our homeland, our democracy, our state and our city over all. It calls for maintenance for the respect of public heritage, such as schools, asylum, orphanage and hospitals that support people in need.
The Order of DeMolay calls for every member to live according to those Virtues considered by the Order as something that distinguish the life of a leader and a good man. DeMolay also defends three fundamental freedoms:
Religious Freedom: represented by the Holy Book (might be represented by any holy book, independent of the religion i.e Bible, Quran, Torah, etc)
Civil Freedom: represented by the National Flag
Intellectual Freedom: represented by the Scholar Books
The Order of DeMolay also has an Ethical Code which has the following statements:
A DeMolay serves God.
A DeMolay honors all womanhood.
A DeMolay loves and honors their parents.
A DeMolay is honest.
A DeMolay is loyal to ideals and friends.
A DeMolay practices honest toil.
A DeMolay's word is as good as their bond.
A DeMolay is courteous.
A DeMolay is at all times a gentleman.
A DeMolay is a patriot in peace as well as war.
A DeMolay is clean in mind and body.
A DeMolay stands unswervingly for the public schools.
A DeMolay always bears the reputation of a good and law-abiding citizen.
A DeMolay by precept and example must preserve the high standards to which they have pledged himself.
Organizational structure
A local DeMolay body is known as a Chapter and is headed by the Master Councilor. The Master Councilor is elected by members of their Chapter and is usually among the older members of the group. The Master Councilor is assisted in their duties by a Senior Councilor and a Junior Councilor. The Senior Councilor is usually considered to be next in line as Master Councilor and Junior Councilor to follow, though two people can run against each other. The remaining officers of a Chapter are appointed by the Master Councilor, except for the Scribe, who is appointed by the Chapter's Advisory Council.
Adult men mentor and supervise the Chapter and are referred to as "Dad." These men are often Masons or Senior DeMolays (former active members who have reached the age of 21) but can also be other men in the community, including the fathers of active members. The "Dad" term origiated with a founding member identifying Frank Land as a father figure, calling them "Dad Land". In recent years, women have also served as advisors [sic] for the group, and are referred to as "Mom".
In addition to the individual Chapter, DeMolay has an officer structure at the state, provincial, or other large regional level led by a State Master Councilor, Provincial Master Councilor, or Jurisdictional Master Councilor. In some countries, DeMolay may have a national level organization headed by a "National Master Councilor". There are also other state, provincial, or jurisdictional positions, based on the officers of a chapter, which vary for each jurisdiction. The lead advisor (always a Master Mason and a member of the Supreme Council) in a state, jurisdiction, or country, is called an Executive Officer. The lead advisor internationally is known as a Grand Master, who governs the International Supreme Council. There are also Active DeMolay officers at an international level; the International Master Councilor and International Congress Secretary are the heads of the International DeMolay Congress. These officers are always past Jurisdictional Master Councilors.
In some countries other than the United States, the International Supreme Council of DeMolay has ceded control to an independent Supreme Council created to govern DeMolay in that country. Such a Supreme Council has its own Grand Master and officers. (Examples are Australia, Canada, Brazil, and the Philippines.)
Female youth leaders
Some DeMolay Chapters elect young women to positions of leadership, who act to support members and their activities. These positions are not officially recognized by DeMolay International; they are approved subject to the authority of the Executive Officer in the jurisdiction.
Sweetheart
DeMolay Chapters may elect a "Chapter Sweetheart" to serve as the female representative of the Chapter, although they are not an initiated member of DeMolay. Them duties may include attending Chapter functions and acting as an ambassador of DeMolay. The "Sweetheart" must meet the age requirements of a particular jurisdiction or Chapter (often 14 to 21.) They may be a member of a neighboring Job's Daughters Bethel, Rainbow Assembly, or Triangle, but that is not a set requirement in most Jurisdictions.
Chapter Princess
A Chapter may also elect a Chapter Princess. The program generally uses the same requirements as set forth for the Sweetheart. Them duties generally include attending Chapter functions and acting as an ambassador of DeMolay while assisting the Sweetheart in their duties.
Chapter Duchess
A Chapter may also elect two Chapter Duchesses. The program generally uses the same requirements set forth for the Sweetheart. Them duties generally include attending Chapter functions and acting as an ambassador of DeMolay while assisting both the Sweetheart and Princess in their duties.
Chapter Little Sis
A Chapter may also elect other females, who may or may not be a member of Job's Daughters International or International Order of Rainbow for Girls, to be a Little Sis.  They are usually 14–16 years old. They generally assist both the Princess and the Sweetheart in their duties.
Jurisdictional officers
Each state or jurisdiction holds an annual (or biennial, in some) event known as a Conclave or Convention. At this event, the members of the state or jurisdiction may vote on the State Master Councilor (or, in some cases the Provincial Master Councilor / Jurisdictional Master Councilor) and other elected positions. Some jurisdictions may elect a Deputy State Master Councilor, Sweetheart, and / or various other positions. In same cases, these officers are appointed by the Executive Officer of jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may hold a specific event, called Congress, separate and apart from Conclave or Convention to elect their jurisdictional officers and vote on any changes to the jurisdictional by-laws, then install the new officers at their Conclave or Convention.
Jurisdictional/State Officers are the leaders of their state/jurisdiction. They plan, lead, and execute all of the events happening in their state. They also serve as a resource for the DeMolays in their state to help them with events, ceremonies, and any other DeMolay related activities.
International leadership
The International Supreme Council is the governing body of DeMolay International. It is composed of dedicated adult leaders from around the world who are responsible for the growth and success of DeMolay. The Grand Master, the Grand Senior Councilor, the Grand Junior Councilor, the Grand Secretary, and the Grand Treasurer are the elected leaders of the International Supreme Council. In certain parts of the world, such as Brazil, for example, DeMolay International has created daughter Supreme Councils and has ceded local control of DeMolay in those regions to the local Supreme Council.
Officers of DeMolay International
The DeMolay Congress is the Senate-style body where two voting delegates represent each DeMolay jurisdiction. The delegates meet once a year and elect an International Master Councilor and an International Congress Secretary, who lead and serve as the heads of the body for a time span of one year. Two Active DeMolays, usually the International Master Councilor and International Congress Secretary, are elected as voting members of the Board of Directors annually. Additionally, delegates discuss and vote on legislative issues.
International Congress Officers
Adult supervision
Each chapter must be sponsored by a local Masonic body or some other group composed exclusively of Masons. The sponsoring body is responsible for providing the chapter with adult advisors and a place to meet. Members of the sponsoring body form the chapter's initial "advisory council". The advisory council selects one of its members to be its chairperson, and they are the official liaison between the chapter and the sponsoring body. Another member of the advisory council is designated the "chapter advisor," and they are the official liaison between the advisory council and the chapter. The chapter's advisory council is responsible for supervising the chapter and its activities.
Activities
DeMolays participate in a wide range of social and sports activities that may include: camping, holding dances with members of Rainbow and Job's Daughters, playing basketball, football, baseball, soccer, tennis, paintball, or billiards, going canoeing and kayaking, and taking long distance trips. Both Chapters and individual DeMolays participate in competitions for the best performance of the various Ceremonies of the Order. Winners of local competitions, in ritual and sports, may compete for State Championships, and sometimes State winners compete at higher levels. The Chapter collectively decides what events they enjoy, plans them, and in many cases holds fund raisers to finance those events.
DeMolay International Hall of Fame
DeMolay alumni have gone on to achieve wide recognition outside of the organization. Some have been elected to the DeMolay Hall of Fame.
Not all DeMolays who have received recognition have been inducted into the Hall of Fame; some can be found on other lists.
The following is a partial list of the members of the DeMolay Hall of Fame. The full list is available on the DeMolay International Web site.

Mushtaq Ahmed Azmi (1 June 1919 – 12 July 2011), was a mass literacy expert. They were one of the first non-officials to be associated with the development of Adult Education program in India from the early 1950s, and was an early leader of the mass literacy movement. As an officer of UNESCO, they were posted in Africa and seconded to lead mass literacy programs in Nigeria and Zambia. They were offered a position in the UNESCO by the British diplomat and head of fundamental education at UNESCO John Bowers.
During their sixty-year career, they conducted a number of studies and wrote books and technical documents, which are used by experts and activists in the field of adult education.
They developed control, monitoring and evaluation systems for national literacy programs such as Total Literacy Campaigns (TLC) and Post Literacy Programs (PLP), and was an advocate of lifelong learning.
Early life and education
Mushtaq Ahmed Azmi was born in the village of Rajapur Sikror, Saraimeer Azamgarh district, Uttar Pradesh. Thus, the suffix Azmi. They later dropped the suffix citing theirs leaving the place at the tender age of seven. Their early education was in Burma under their paternal uncle. After the separation of Burma from India in 1935, they returned to India and enrolled at Jubilee College in Lucknow, UP.
They graduated first class with a bachelor of arts in history from Aligarh Muslim University in 1942 at the age of 23.
By the time they were 33 in 1952, they had received an Individual UNESCO Individual Training Fellowship. Ahmed embarked on the UNESCO Fellowship study program traveling to Jamaica (three and a half months), Haiti (two weeks), Puerto Rico (two weeks), and Nairobi (one and a half months). Throughout the program, they received further training in production programmes, techniques of writing text-books and follow-up reading materials, research and educational control necessary to produce well-graded materials according to the interest and level of comprehension of adult readers, techniques of distribution, illustration, printing, the relationship between production programmes, literacy campaigns and community development. They also trained in organizing, financing, staffing and equipping a vernacular literature bureau as well as learning of its production activities' connection to the education system and the mass education programme.
In 1954, Ahmed graduated with a Master of Communication Arts degree from Michigan State University in East Lancing, Michigan, United States.
Career
In their 20s, Ahmed was comfortably employed with the Railways and Bridges Department in the United Provinces of British India where they translated letters between English and Urdu.
However, right around the time of India's independence in 1947, Dr. Zakir Hussain - an educationist who became India's third President - exhorted the educated youth to leave colonial service and join nationalist institutions. Ahmed complied at once and joined Jamia Millia Islamia in 1948, where they wrote, compiled and edited follow-up reading materials for new literates.
This marked the beginning of an ensuing prolific career spanning six decades in which Mushtaq Ahmed founded, revived, mobilized and headed many institutions related to adult, primary and continuing education as detailed below.
By February 1951, Ahmed became the officiating director of the four Community Education Centers run by the Institute of Social Education in Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI). Within a year, they were holding the office of the Chief Editor in the Institute.
In the three years immediately following India's independence (1948–51), they had written, edited and complied over 300 booklets for new literates, 100 of which were being published on behalf of the Government of India.
Upon their return from the UNESCO Fellowship program, Mushtaq was appointed as the Secretary of the Adult Education Department, where they stayed till 1955. As a UNESCO fellow, they were called on to serve as the Assistant Director of UNESCO Group Training Scheme for international literacy experts in Mysore which they responded to in affirmative and held the position till 1957.
They moved back to New Delhi in 1958 to serve as the Director of Research, Training and Production Center within Jamia Millia Islamia until 1960.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Welthy Honsinger Fisher had founded Literacy House in Lucknow, UP, in 1956 at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi. It secured funding from World Education, NY, in 1958 Mushtaq Ahmed was one of its earliest directors serving from 1960 to 1964 in Lucknow
Over the next one decade, from 1965 till 1978, Ahmed served as a UNESCO Adviser on adult literacy to the governments of Nigeria, Zambia, among others.
Upon their return to India in 1978, they held the office of Director, Center for Development of Women and Youth in Aligarh, UP. They shifted base to New Delhi in 1982, where they worked as the Director of the State Resource Center within Jamia Millia Islamia. In 1990, they resumed their position as the Director of Literacy House in Lucknow, UP and stayed there till 1993.
They were appointed as the Chairman of the National Institute of Adult Education (NIAE) in 1995, Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD), Government of India, in New Delhi Simultanesouly, they also served as the Chairman of National Core Group, External Evaluation of Total Literacy Campaign (TLC)/Post-Literacy Programmes (PLP), an initiative of the Ministry of HRD, Government of India, New Delhi They stayed in the former position till 1999 and the latter, till 2001.
They also served as the Chairman of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) Sitapur, UP, and Jan Shiksha Sansthan (JSS), Handi, although the dates on these positions are to be confirmed.

Leopoldo Maggi (Rancio Valcuvia, near Varese, May 15, 1840 – Pavia, March 7, 1905) was an Italian physician, craniologist and naturalist.
They completed their studies in the University of Pavia. In 1863 they obtained two degrees: in Natural sciences and in Medicine and surgery and became assistant first to Paolo Panceri (1833-1877) the teacher of several other outstanding Italian zoologists of the end of the 19th century and then to Giuseppe Balsamo Crivelli. In 1864 they were appointed lecturer in Mineralogy and Geology at Pavia, where from 1874 they held the professorship of Zoology and Comparative anatomy. When zoology became a separate subject in 1875 they held the chair of Comparatve anatomy and Physiology occupying this until their death.
For years they devoted themselves to biology and especially to comparative anatomy, but also to Mineralogy, Osteology, Prehistoric archaeology, craniology and Protistology.
They were the first Italian to pay attention to Protozoa and their studies on Protozoa and Protistology are of considerable importance, although conditioned by the belief in spontaneous generation and Monera and by the adhesion to the doctrines of Ernst Haeckel. The Haeckel and Maggi theories declined at the beginning of 1900.
The studies of Leopoldo Maggi, at first eminently descriptive with the discovery of numerous taxa, had a rapid evolution in the medical field and converged in bacteriology. Also noteworthy are their research on the skull, conducted with comparative and evolutionary address. Many of their interpretations are nowadays outdated, but the descriptive part remains valid.

The West Cascades Scenic Byway is a National Scenic Byway in the U.S. state of Oregon. The route is designed to provide a tour on the west side of the Cascade Range along the east side of the Willamette Valley.
Route description
The route is roughly north–south, from Estacada southeast of Portland to Oakridge on the Willamette River southeast of Eugene. Much of the route is very sparsely populated, passing through timber regions in the Cascades.
From Estacada the route follows the valley of the Clackamas River upstream on Oregon Route 224 into the Mount Hood National Forest, then south along the Breitenbush River to Detroit on the North Santiam. It follows Oregon Route 22 along Detroit Lake to the junction of U.S. Route 20, then west a short distance on U.S. Route 20 to the junction of Oregon Route 126. It follows OR 126 south, then cuts through the mountain south to Oakridge, where it ends at an intersection with Oregon Route 58.
The route provides views of old growth fir trees and jagged volcanic peaks. The driving time is approximately 7–9 hours.

Midshipman (foaled March 26, 2006, in Kentucky) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse.
Owned by Stonerside Stable and trained by Hall of Famer Bob Baffert, as a two-year-old Midshipman won 3 of 4 starts, including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and Del Mar Futurity.
Two weeks before their run in the Breeders' Cup, Midshipman was sold to Darley Stable and as part of the sales agreement was transferred to trainer Saeed bin Suroor after the race.
The colt was a leading contender for the 2009 Triple Crown but fell off due to a 'soft tissue injury.'
Midshipman made their 3-year-old debut in an allowance optional claiming race on Sept 18 at Belmont Park, which marked their first start on traditional dirt. They won by 3 lengths over co-favorite Just Ben.
Midshipman also ran in 2009's Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile, where they finished 3rd to the longest shot in the race, The Farthest Land.

Chief mechanical engineer and locomotive superintendent are titles applied by British, Australian, and New Zealand railway companies to the person ultimately responsible to the board of the company for the building and maintaining of the locomotives and rolling stock. In Britain, the post of locomotive superintendent was introduced in the late 1830s, and chief mechanical engineer in 1886.
Emerging professional roles
In the early Victorian era, projected canal or railway schemes were prepared by groups of promoters who hired specialists such as civil engineers, surveyors, architects or contractors to survey a route; and this resulted in the issue of a prospectus setting out their proposals. Provided that adequate capital could be raised from potential investors, agreements obtained from the landowners along the proposed route and, in Britain, an Act of Parliament obtained (different terminology is used in other countries), then construction might begin either by a new company specially formed to build and run it or by an existing company.
Design, construction and day-to-day operation of the canal or railway was managed by men who might otherwise work for the promoters. Some of the pioneer railway builders were self-taught, but others had gained their engineering experience constructing canals, or in military service. In Britain, the Institution of Civil Engineers had been founded in London in 1818, with Thomas Telford as its first president and its formation pre-dated many of the railway schemes. It obtained a Royal Charter in 1828. Later, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was formed in 1847, with George Stephenson as its first president. The Corps of Royal Engineers, a British military organisation, was older than both of these civilian engineering institutions and it had extensive experience of (military) railway operations. For this reason, for almost 150 years from its foundation by the Board of Trade in 1840, Them Majesty's Railway Inspectorate recruited suitably qualified retired officers from the Corps into its "senior" arm, as railway inspecting officers. These officers retained their former military rank within the Inspectorate. It was to be 1985 before a railway inspecting officer without a previous military career was appointed: the officer transferred across from the "junior" arm: as a former railway employment inspector. Over the same period, of almost a century and a half, the Inspectorate was headed by a retired officer of the Corps of Royal Engineers as its chief inspecting officer. Other, former army officers, such as Charles Blacker Vignoles, were to gain new careers on the railways when they became under-employed after the Napoleonic War.
In Britain, the various railway companies appointed and employed an engineer or chief engineer, who was usually a civil engineer by profession. This was a permanent management role in the company in contrast to that of contractors, for instance, who were only hired to perform specific tasks such as construction of the line. The chief engineer had their own department (and budget) and was an important company official. The chief engineer was responsible for all engineering functions: civil, which included bridges, viaducts, tunnels and track; and, later, mechanical, which included rolling stock. In some early railways, such as the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR), which opened in 1830, there was indecision on whether to use fixed engines and ropes or moving locomotives. Cases had arisen of locomotives being too heavy and breaking the cast iron rails that they had to run on; and locomotive wheels breaking and/or falling off. Finally, the L&MR's board agreed the use of moving locomotives; and the rolling stock was selected from various specialist builders by competition, at the Rainhill Trials. Soon afterwards, many railway companies were to set up their own railway workshops, although railway companies continued to buy-in locomotives from specialist manufacturers, such as Robert Stephenson and Company which was founded by George and Robert Stephenson in 1828. Some railway companies operated their own ferries, boats, and ships and these would also be the responsibility of their Chief Engineer, but they would have been ordered from shipyards. Isambard Kingdom Brunel set an example, designing three great steamships: the SS Great Western, the SS Great Britain and the SS Great Eastern – the first two being built at Bristol shipyards and the third at Millwall, London. The Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland was formed in 1857 as a professional body for these trades in Scotland.
The specialism of mechanical engineering became established on the railways, with an emphasis on moving parts; and, in terms of importance, this was concerned with designing and building of reliable locomotives, carriages and waggons. Private companies designed and built these items to order and could offer standard designs to railway companies as well as "specials" to meet specific customer's requirements; otherwise railway companies could and did establish workshops to build their own locomotives and carriages. In August 1837, for example, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Engineer responsible for the Great Western Railway, appointed Daniel Gooch locomotive superintendent to the company; and it was their responsibility to provide the locomotives, the accommodation for them and the running and the repair shops. Gooch suggested a green field site, New Swindon, and this was to lead to the building of a railway works, a railway village and eventually the town of Swindon. Swindon was not the only example of railway town or community that was created in England: Crewe being another.
Locomotive superintendent
Initially, when a railway company chose to build its own rolling stock in house, the mechanical engineering aspect was regarded as a subsidiary function to that of the chief engineer and this was reflected in various job titles, such as chief of locomotive department, locomotive supervisor and locomotive superintendent.
Later, there was a desire to improve the prestige, and salary, of the locomotive superintendent and a means of achieving those aims was to seek to regrade the post as chief mechanical engineer (CME). John Aspinall of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway was the first CME to be appointed to that post in 1886. A further six British railway companies created the post of CME between 1902 and 1914.
Functions
The chief mechanical engineer was responsible for all aspects of locomotives and that included their design, testing and modification of existing designs.
The early mechanical engineer was concerned with mechanical moving parts and for many years this responsibility also included railway signalling, particularly points and semaphore signals, as these were entirely mechanically operated. With the introduction of low-power electricity to the railways, various new systems such as telegraphs, telephones and electrical signalling systems were introduced; and responsibilities of these systems were transferred to the signal and telegraph (S&T) department.

Strapačky (Slovak) or sztrapacska (Hungarian) is a dish popular in Slovakia and Hungary. It is similar to bryndzové halušky where the base compound of the dish is halušky (dumplings); however, in Slovakia, instead of bryndza, stewed sauerkraut is used. In Hungary, sztrapacska is traditionally accompanied with juhtúró, the local equivalent to bryndza. It is thus akin to gnocchi with ewes' cheese. Residents of Vanyarc, located in Hungary approximately 80 kilometers from Budapest, have held a Festival of Strapačky (Vamyarci Haluskafesztivál) every September for almost 40 years. Ethnic Slovaks from all over Hungary compete for prizes at the festival.

Robert MacGregor Dawson (1895–1958) was a Canadian political scientist who served as Professor of Political Economy at the University of Toronto.  They are best known as coauthor with Norman Ward of the 1947 textbook The Government of Canada.
Born on 1 March 1895 in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Dawson received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1915 and a master's degree in 1916 from Dalhousie University. During that time, they served locally with the 1st "Halifax" Regiment, Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery. They received a Master of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1917 and Master of Science and Doctor of Science degrees in economics from the University of London (where they studied at the London School of Economics) in 1921 and 1922 respectively.
In 1921, they started teaching at Dalhousie University before leaving to teach at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. In 1928, they returned to Canada as head of the political science department at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1937, they started teaching at the University of Toronto. They left in 1951 to write a biography of Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King. They finished the first volume before their death in Bridgewater NS, in 1958.
They were married to Sarah Ada Foster (1896–1969). They had two sons: Robert MacGregor Dawson (1927–2000; Carnegie Professor of English, University of King's College (Dalhousie University), Halifax, NS) and William Foster Dawson (1930–2011; Professor Emeritus of Political Science, University of Western Ontario, London, ON). Dawson died on 16 July 1958.
In 1975, they were named a Person of National Historic Significance.

Paraguayan nationality law is based on the principle of Jus soli. The nationality law is based on the Chapter 3 of the Paraguayan Constitution of 1992. The legal means to acquire nationality, formal membership in a nation, differ from the relationship of rights and obligations between a national and the nation, known as citizenship.
Birth in Paraguay
Any person born in Paraguay acquires Paraguayan nationality at birth. The only exception applies to children of persons in the service of a foreign government (like foreign diplomats).
Paraguayan nationality by descent
Though based for the most part on the principle of Jus soli, Paraguayan law authorizes the acquisition of Paraguayan nationality by descent (jus sanguinis) in two cases:
a person born outside Paraguay of a Paraguayan parent who is in the service of the Paraguay government is considered Paraguayan ; and
a person born outside Paraguay of a Paraguayan parent is considered Paraguayan, provided that that person is registered with a Paraguayan parent.
Naturalisation
Foreigners may apply for Paraguayan nationality if they meet the following criteria:
being older than 18 years old.
permanent resident in Paraguay for at least 3 years.
having a good behavior following the law.
Dual Nationality
Dual nationality is permitted under the constitution of Paraguay on a reciprocity basis, meaning that unless Paraguay has a bilateral agreement with another nation, that other nationality is not permitted. As of 2022, the only countries that have a reciprocity agreement in regards to dual nationality with Paraguay are Spain and Italy.
Loss of nationality
In Paraguay, there is a distinction for loss of nationality between nationals born in Paraguay and those who have been naturalised. In the latter category, naturalising in another country or being expatriated from the country for more than three years without permission, results in loss of nationality, as provided in Article 150 of the National Constitution of Paraguay, and proceedings thereunder must be instituted by an individual or an agency, for instance, the Migration department. Paraguay does not accept dual nationality of naturalised persons.

In enzymology, a copalyl diphosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
geranylgeranyl diphosphate (+)-copalyl diphosphate
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and one product, (+)-copalyl diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-copalyl-diphosphate lyase (decyclizing). This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis.

The Archive of European Integration (AEI) is an electronic repository and archive for research materials on the topic of European integration and unification. The AEI contains two types of documents:
European Community publications intended for public distribution, published by the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Atomic Energy Commission (Euratom), the European Economic Community (EEC), the European Communities (EC), and the European Union (EU) (all hereafter referred to as EC/EU documents), as well as related organizations such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Western European Union (WEU)
Research papers produced by private research organizations who agree to have their publications uploaded onto the AEI (see list of Contributing Institutions).
In January, 2016 the AEI contained over 41,800 EC/EU documents and more than 7,300 privately produced documents, making it the largest online repository of EU documents in the world except for EU websites.
Since the creation of the AEI in February 2003, the University Library System (ULS), University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States has provided the technical and material support for the AEI. The ULS department of Information Technology - under the directorship of Tim Deliyannides - hosts and maintains the AEI as part of its D-Scribe Digital Publishing program. The AEI system is powered by EPrints 3, free Open Source software developed by the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK.
History
The Archive of European Integration (AEI) was initiated in early 2003 by Dr. Phil Wilkin, then Social Sciences Bibliographer - and current Editor of the AEI - at the ULS, in collaboration with Dr. Michael Nentwich, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Technology Assessment, Vienna, Austria. Mr. Nentwich was then managing editor of the European Research Papers Archive (ERPA). ERPA was an Internet-based platform providing access to the papers of several research institutions focusing on European integration. ERPA featured only referred high quality series, featuring some form of refereeing, and the AEI was designed to complement ERPA by collecting research materials on European integration which did not necessarily meet ERPA's high quality standards. ERPA was archived on 1 March 2015.
In fall 2004, Barbara Sloan, then Head of Public Inquiries, Delegation of the European Union to the United States, Washington, DC, (then the Delegation of the European Commission to the United States) began working with the AEI on digitizing and uploading EC/EU documents onto the AEI. The Delegation's EU library collection, founded in the mid-1950s, is by far the largest collection of EC/EU documentation in North America. A comprehensive guide to this collection can be found at European Union Archival Collection at the University of Pittsburgh, pp. 31–41. The Delegation donated this collection - spanning years early 1950s to 2004 - to the ULS in 2007. The collection contains both a shelf section and a "research files" section. The latter consists of 650 linear shelf feet of mostly small working and staff documents arranged in folders by subject, and will provide thousands of hard to locate materials for digitization. There is a "finding aid" for the "research files" collection at Barbara Sloan European Union Document Collection.
The AEI immediately began using this collection as a source of documents to digitize and place onto the AEI. The goal was to complement the existing electronic collections on EU websites. The AEI Delegation collection contains two primary types of document formats: series and individual bound items in monographic form which most libraries would classify and place on shelves, and "internal working documents" which most libraries would not classify, making them more difficult to locate. At first the AEI, cognizant of the possibility that the EU itself might digitize large numbers of its older documents, took a conservative approach, digitizing mostly the internal working documents (COM docs) and staff working documents (SEC docs) and other select documents. Indeed, in 2009-2010 the EU did digitize and place on EU Bookshop over 2,000,000 pages of its bound documents.
In 2011-2012 the AEI adopted a new, long-range policy regarding digitization, for several reasons. First, the AEI learned that it was unlikely that the EU would perform more large-scale digitization. Consequently, the AEI could develop a true "archive" where the goal would be to digitize as many documents as resources allowed.
Second, the two EU websites containing the bulk of EC/EU documentation - EU Bookshop and EUR-Lex: Access to European Union Law - contained only a portion of these documents. In EU Bookshop, many of the annuals and series there are not complete runs. Either they do not contain earlier documents from the 1950-60s, and/or volumes are missing throughout the run. Eur-Lex contains a considerable number of full text COM documents published 1990-2000 and nearly all 2001-present, but very few which were published before 1990. Despite their importance for research purposes, there is no comprehensive list of COM documents for the early years. Two indexes published 1976-1986 listed all COM docs, but there is no available written record which contains the titles of previous COM docs. The AEI Delegation collection contains nearly all of these documents which are missing from the EU Bookshop and Eur-Lex, which it will digitize.
Third, navigating the EU Bookshop during large parts of the day is very slow, and much slower on older computers. In order to make documents easily available, the AEI decided to download annual and serial documents from the EU Bookshop and place them on the AEI, thereby furnishing full runs of all in one place. In most cases these runs will go from the earliest volume up through 2000. It is likely all these runs will be completed sometime in 2017. Here are some examples (NOTE: some annuals and serials have been only partially uploaded):

George Henry Fraser (c. 1880 – 9 December 1919) was a navigator and aircraft mechanic who flew with pilot Cedric Howell as one of the teams competing in the England to Australia air race in December 1919. Howell and Fraser's aircraft made a forced landing in the St George's Bay, Corfu; both men are presumed to have drowned as a result, although only Howell's body was ever recovered.
Personal life
Fraser's exact date of birth is not given in the sources available, but they are variously stated to have been either 39 or 40 years old at the time of their death. They were the child of Robert Fraser (died 27 March 1894, aged 46) and Mary Fraser (died 15 March 1937, aged 92). They were born in Macorna, Victoria, Australia and attended Macorna State School. On leaving school, Fraser became a bicycle and motor mechanic and, before enlisting in 1917, they worked for several years in their brother William Fraser's car import firm, Messrs Fraser and Willsford of Sydney, Australia, where they were residing at the time of their enlistment. Fraser was unmarried at the time they enlisted and at the date of their death.
Military service
Fraser enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force on 12 March 1917 and was assigned, as an air mechanic, 2nd class, to the Fifth Training Squadron, Australian Flying Corps. They subsequently served in England with the Fifth Training Squadron and the No 1 School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping, Royal Air Force, gaining much experience of the maintenance and operation of bomber aircraft and of aerial navigation.
Post-war
For the six months before they started with Howell on the race to Australia, Fraser had been employed by Rolls-Royce Ltd, during which time they had become familiar with engines of the type fitted in the plane in which they were to compete.
Final flight
In August 1919 the British aircraft manufacturer Martinsyde Ltd invited Australian flying ace Captain Cedric Howell to pilot their Type A Mk.I in the forthcoming England to Australia air race. As a qualified navigator and a mechanic familiar with the Rolls-Royce engine fitted to the plane, Fraser was selected to accompany Captain Howell. Having departed from Taranto on the next stage of the flight, Howell's and Fraser's aircraft made a forced landing St George's Bay, Corfu. It was initially falsely reported, in telegram received by William Fraser, that their brother had been rescued and had arrived safely in Athens. Although the circumstances of the accident are not clear, it appears that both were alive and survived in the water but that they subsequently drowned. Only Howell's body was ever recovered. It was subsequently claimed that Howell drowned while attempting to tow Fraser to shore, since the mechanic was unable to swim.
Memorials
Fraser's name is included in the Hollybrook Memorial, Southampton, England and they are commemorated on a family headstone in White Hills Cemetery, White Hills, Victoria. Their name is also included in the Australian War Memorial Roll of Honour.

Barbara West (née Schmitt) (born 1948) is an American television journalist and former news anchor for WFTV in Orlando, Florida. They and their husband have now organized a not-for-profit foundation that raises significant amounts of money for leading hospitals, animal shelters, hospices, educational institutions and other charitable organizations across the country.
Personal information
West attended the University of Vermont and obtained a Master's degree. While there, they won the 1969 Miss Vermont contest and was selected to represent their state in the national Miss America competition. Before starting their career in television news, they were an assistant professor at the university.
West's husband Wade West is a former political strategist for both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential cabinet members and the Bush and Clinton administrations.
Journalism career
West was principal assistant to Peter Jennings while they were anchored for ABC's World News Tonight in London. They helped cover such stories as the Royal Wedding of Charles and Diana and the Iranian Hostage Crisis. Since 1992 they have served as health reporter and anchor for Orlando's WFTV news at noon and 5:30. As a health reporter they traveled to Canada to report on its health care system and to Ukraine to report on the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster and its health effects. They received the 2002 Summit Award for Community service from Central Florida Women's Resource Center and an Emmy for their reporting on women fighting breast cancer. On their official biography page on WFTV.com, they list their first two specific accomplishments as covering the inauguration of President George W. Bush and covering the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.
2008 presidential race interviews
On October 23, 2008, West interviewed Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden with questions they personally wrote. West asked Biden if they were "embarrassed about Barack Obama's affiliation with ACORN" given allegations of voter registration fraud by ACORN in elections past, likened Obama's response to a question from Ohio voter "Joe the Plumber" to a quote from Karl Marx, asked how Obama is not being a Marxist given their views on "spreading the wealth", and questioned if Obama might lead the U.S. "into a socialist country much like Sweden." At one point, Biden asked West if they were joking, and later suggested they were offering "talking points" against Obama.
The Obama campaign responded saying "This station's interview with Joe Biden wasn't tough — it was just absurd." The Obama campaign cancelled a subsequent interview with the candidate's wife, Jill Biden. Obama's Florida spokesperson called West "both combative and woefully uninformed about simple facts."
WFTV's news director defended her, saying they had not been inappropriately tough: "I'd rather be known as aggressive as pulling punches. We ask questions on behalf of viewers."
While praised by "birther conspirators", reactions from mainstream commentators were negative. Them performance was criticized as a "desperate audition for a primetime job at Fox News", considered a partisan stunt after they gave a soft interview to Republican candidate John McCain and West was characterized as exhibiting conservative bias. Others said that these characterizations were unfair and that Biden had overreacted. A few noted their husband's connections with the Republican Party, questioning if that was an influencing factor. West attempted and failed to deflect criticisms by promoting their husband's relationships with the Clinton Administration State Department and the Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights Enforcement.

"Everything Your Heart Desires" is a song by the American duo Hall & Oates, released as the lead single from their thirteenth studio album, Ooh Yeah! (1988). The song peaked at number three in the United States. It was their sixteenth and last Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 song. The 45 version was later included on their greatest hits album Playlist: The Very Best of (2008) while the video mix was included on VH1 Behind the Music: The Daryl Hall and John Oates Collection (2002) and on the box set Do What You Want, Be What You Are: The Music of Daryl Hall & John Oates (2009).
In the lyrics, the singer asks their lover why they want someone else if they have "everything your heart desires." They explain that if she's happy now, they might really be the one she's looking for.
Release and reception
"Everything Your Heart Desires" entered the US Billboard Hot 100 in April 1988, reached number three in June, and spent 16 weeks on the chart, becoming their last top 10 hit.
The song became their biggest hit to date on the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at number two, a personal best for the duo that would stand until 2002, when "Do It for Love" reached number one. The single reached the top 30 in New Zealand and number 50 in the Netherlands, but it was less commercially successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 81.
Rolling Stone music critic Rob Hoerburger notes the song and album demonstrate that Hall & Oates have grown up, adding that the song is "more of a plea than an indictment – no "Maneater" misogyny here."

Alfredo Ceschiatti (September 1, 1918 – August 25, 1989) was a Brazilian sculptor.
Life and career
Ceschiatti was born in Belo Horizonte in 1918 to Italian parents. They went to Italy in 1937, benefited by the Italian government in promoting trips by the children of immigrants to the country. Back to Brazil, they settled in Rio de Janeiro where they studied at the National School of Fine Arts. They were awarded at the National Salon of Fine Arts, in 1945, for the bas-relief of the baptistery of the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, in Belo Horizonte. They met Oscar Niemeyer, who commissioned them a sculpture for the Architectural Ensemble of Pampulha, in Belo Horizonte. Ceschiatti created O Abraço, a sculpture depicting two embraced women. The citizens of Belo Horizonte considered immoral, it was kept for many years until it was finally exposed in a garden in Pampulha. The sculpture Duas Amigas was made for the Salão Nobre (upper garden) of the Itamaraty Palace with guidance from Ambassador Wladimir Murtinho, who served as chief curator in the Palace's ambience project. The artist's taste for the female figure is present in several of their works.
In 1960 they sculpted, in granite, As três forças armadas, one of the themes in the Monument to the Dead of World War II, in Rio de Janeiro. Their works are in exhibition in several Brazilian museums.
In a new partnership with Niemeyer, they became the main sculptor of the country's new capital Brasília, including:
As Iaras, in bronze, at the Palácio da Alvorada's reflecting pool;
Leda e o Cisne, bronze, at Palácio do Jaburu's courtyard;
A Justiça, in granite, in front of the Supreme Federal Court building;
Os Anjos and Os Evangelistas, in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasília;
As gêmeas, in bronze, at the Itamaraty Palace;
Anjo, in golden bronze at the Chamber of Deputies;
A Contorcionista, in the Sala Villa Lobos foyer, Cláudio Santoro National Theater
Deusa Athena, at the University of Brasília's Central Library;
They were part of the National Commission of Fine Arts and professor of sculpture and drawing at the University of Brasília. They then resigned in solidarity with colleagues persecuted for political reasons. They complained, decades later, about the way Brasília treated their works.

Larki Punjaban (Urdu: , (lit Punjabi Girl) is a 2003 Pakistani film directed by Syed Noor and starring Babar Ali, Saima, and Shamyl Khan.
Plot
A simple, love story between a Sikh girl (Saima) and a Muslim boy Shamyl Khan.
In August 1947, both Pakistan and India got their independence. Partition lines were drawn on the map of the British Raj, dividing not only the subcontinent but also provinces, in particular Punjab. The results of partition were catastrophic. All in the name of religion and nationalism, people who had lived together in harmony for centuries committed mindless acts of violence against each other resulting in over one million deaths that included Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus. An estimated 75,000 women were raped and over twelve million people were uprooted. Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India and Muslims to Pakistan.
During these troubled times, there were a select few who did not give in to the acts of barbarism.
One such person was a young Muslim man who refused to participate in the fires of hate and destruction burning around him. During the hostilities, they found a young Sikh girl who had been separated from their family. Risking the anger of the mobs, they brought their home and offered them sanctuary. As the fires of hate began to burn out, families began to come to terms with their loss of the loved ones on both sides. Those who could not be found were presumed dead. The young girl was touched by the way the boy had protected them against the ruthless mobs, risking their own life. Eventually they fell in love. They converted to Islam and they married.
Years later, this girl becomes a dying grandmother themselves and their last wish is to meet their family, back in India.
Having made some enquires, they discovered that their family had migrated to Chandigarh, India.
Knowing their family would disown her, if they discovered that they had converted to Islam,
they contact their sister, pretending to be a long lost Muslim friend and invited them and them
family to come to Lahore for a religious pilgrimage to 'Nankana Sahib' a highly revered Sikh Temple, where thousands of Sikhs travel to visit it every year.
The Sikh family comes to Lahore where the two sisters live together as friends, not knowing about their real relationship as sisters. During their stay with the Muslim family, history began to repeat itself. Preetam, daughter of the Sikh family started to get friendly with Shamil Khan, the son of the Muslim family. When the Sikh family discovers that a relationship was blossoming, they quickly return to Chandigarh, however, the young couple keep in touch on the telephone and the Internet and their love grows stronger.
Preetam's family, realizing the potential problems, send them off to Malaysia to marry their fiancé. Shamil is heart broken at suddenly losing contact with Preetam. Shamil's family, watching their despair, persuade them to travel to Malaysia to complete their education.
As fate would have it, Shamil sees Preetam in Kuala Lumpur, only a few days before they are due to marry. What can they do? Run away together and face the wrath of their families ? Or accept the decision of their elders and sacrifice their love for each other? Can their love, cultural barriers survive the pressures of culture, tradition, inbred hatred and religion of their elders? As in fables, will love to conquer all or will the harsh realities of life suffocate the young lovers into submission?

Ohakuri is a dam and hydroelectric power station on the Waikato River, central North Island, New Zealand, midway between Taupo, Rotorua and Hamilton. Its dam is about upstream of the Atiamuri Dam.
It was commissioned in 1961 and construction was organised from the 'hydro town' of Mangakino. The dam eventually created Lake Ohakuri, the largest artificial lake on the Waikato, which drowned two thirds of the Orakei Korako geothermal area as well as hot springs and wahi tapu (Māori sacred sites) at Te Ohaaki. Creation of the dam forced Ngāti Tahu to relocate their Ohaaki Marae. The submerged area also included two of the world's largest geysers (Minginui Geyser and Orakei Korako Geyser).
The construction in the face of these negative effects was considered justified at the time due to the serious electricity shortages plaguing the country after World War II, and by the fact that laws requiring public participation or consultation were not introduced until much later. While compensation to Māori landowners was paid based on the land take rules of the Public Works Act, the damage to the inhabitants of the area was to form basis of further legal actions under the Waitangi Tribunal legislation many years later.
Power station
The Ohakuri Power Station has a capacity of and is operated by Mercury Energy.

Resolution Rupes is an escarpment on Mercury approximately 190 kilometers long located in the southern hemisphere of Mercury. Discovered by the Mariner 10 spacecraft in 1974, it was formed by a thrust fault, thought to have occurred due to the shrinkage of the planet's core as it cooled over time.
Resolution Rupes has an arcuate shape with the scarp face on convex side of the arc. It has a relief of about 0.9 km and is situated between Adventure Rupes and Discovery Rupes. These three scarps lie on a large arc extending for more than 1000 km. Resolution Rupes is separated from Adventure Rupes by a high relief ridge informally called Rabelais Dorsum, which crosscuts the scarps. This means that Resolution Rupes and Adventure Rupes may be parts of one large structure similar in length to Discovery Rupes.
The scarp is named after HMS Resolution, one of James Cook's ships on their second voyage to the Pacific, 1772–1775.

[[File:Nothronychus chevrons.png|thumb|Haemal arches of Nothronychus]]
A haemal arch also known as a chevron, is a bony arch on the ventral side of a tail vertebra of a vertebrate. The canal formed by the space between the arch and the vertebral body is the haemal canal. A spinous ventral process emerging from the haemal arch is referred to as the haemal spine.
Blood vessels to and from the tail run through the arch. In reptiles, the caudofemoralis longus muscle, one of the main muscles involved in locomotion, attaches to the lateral sides of the haemal arches.
In 1956, Alfred Sherwood Romer hypothesized that the position of the first haemal arch was sexually dimorphic in crocodilians and dinosaurs. However, subsequent research established that the size and position of the first haemal arch was not sexually dimorphic in crocodilians and found no evidence of significant variation in tyrannosaurid dinosaurs, indicating that haemal arches could not be used to distinguish between sexes after all.
Haemal arches play an important role in the taxonomy of sauropod dinosaurs, as sauropods exhibit a wide range of morphologies of the haemal arches. In 1878, Othniel Marsh named the sauropod Diplodocus after the distinctive shape of its haemal arches, which were forked to have both an anterior and posterior process. Though once thought to be a specialized characteristic of Diplodocus'' and its close relatives, forked chevrons are now known to have been widespread among sauropod dinosaurs, although titanosauriform sauropods returned to the unforked condition.

Adam Sedbar or Sedbergh (c. 1502–1537) was the 23rd and last Abbot of Jervaulx Abbey in Wensleydale, Yorkshire.
Biography
Adam Sedbar had been elected abbot of the Cistercian abbey of Jervaulx in 1533 when Henry VIII introduced their plans for the Dissolution of the Monasteries. They were persuaded in 1536, somewhat reluctantly, to join in a Pilgrimage of Grace, together with other local abbots from Fountains, Bridlington and Guisborough Abbeys, in order to protest about the king's policies. The cause attracted a large number of followers, and urged on by a few fanatics, became increasingly militant. After a number of Yorkshire towns were attacked by the insurgents the King eventually decided, after some negotiation with their spokesperson, to round up the ringleaders and charge them with treason . Sedbar sought sanctuary with John Scrope, 8th Baron Scrope of Bolton at their stronghold in Bolton Castle. When the King's Commissioners followed them there, Lord Scrope fled for their own safety and Sedbar hid out for several days on Witton Fell but was captured on 12 May 1537 and taken with others to be tried in London.
They were imprisoned in the Beauchamp tower in the Tower of London, where their inscribed name on the wall "ADAM SEDBAR. ABBAS JOREVALL 1537" can still be clearly seen. They were charged that "he did conspire to deprive the King of their title of Supreme Head of the English Church, and to compel them to hold a certain Parliament and convocation of the clergy of the realm, and did commit divers insurrections..." and "tried" or examined on both 25 April and 24 May. Although they claimed that the objectives of the insurrection were non-ecclesiastical they were found guilty, as were the other abbots, several monks and various lay ringleaders. They were taken with others on 2 June 1537 to Tyburn where they were hanged, drawn and quartered. The Prior of Bridlington suffered the same fate on the same day, as had the Abbot of Fountains and Prior of Guisborough a few days earlier. Their heads were all displayed on London Bridge.

Open-mindedness is receptiveness to new ideas. Open-mindedness relates to the way in which people approach the views and knowledge of others." Jason Baehr defines an open-minded person as one who "characteristically moves beyond or temporarily sets aside their own doxastic commitments in order to give a fair and impartial hearing to the intellectual opposition". Jack Kwong's definition sees open-mindedness as the "willingness to take a novel viewpoint seriously".
According to Wayne Riggs, open-mindedness springs from an awareness of the inherent fallibility of one's beliefs; hence, open-minded individuals are more inclined to listen to, and seriously consider, alternative viewpoints.
There are various scales for the measurement of open-mindedness. Harding and Hare have argued that schools should emphasize open-mindedness more than relativism in their science instruction, because the scientific community does not embrace a relativistic way of thinking.
Among other things, the critical attitude involves an open-minded outlook with respect to one's beliefs.
Open-mindedness is generally considered an important personal attribute for effective participation in management teams and other groups. Open-mindedness is usually encouraged in group settings, within different cultures and new environments. According to David DiSalvo, closed-mindedness, or an unwillingness to consider new ideas, can result from the brain's natural dislike for ambiguity. According to this view, the brain has a "search and destroy" relationship with ambiguity and evidence contradictory to people's current beliefs tends to make them uncomfortable by introducing such ambiguity. Research confirms that belief-discrepant-closed-minded persons have less tolerance for cognitive inconsistency.
Virtues contrasting with open-mindedness include steadfastness, loyalty, and fundamentalism.

Gille (or Gilla) Aldan (Gaelic: "Servant of Saint Aldwin[e]"), of Whithorn, was a native Galwegian who was the first Bishop of the resurrected Bishopric of Whithorn or Galloway. They were the first to be consecrated by the Archbishop of York, who at that time was Thurstan. The re-creation of the Bishopric suited both the ruler of Galloway, Fergus, and the Archbishop, who had few suffragans and needed more in order to maintain their independence from Canterbury.
We have the record of a mandate by Pope Honorius II, dating to December in 1128, confirming that Gille Aldan should seek consecration from Thurstan. Richard Oram argues that the creation of the Bishopric of Whithorn probably encouraged the wrath and enmity of Bishop Wimund of the Isles, who seems to have regarded the area as their natural area of authority. William of Newburgh records that Wimund made an attack on another Bishop in order to extort tribute. If Oram is correct, and their victim was in fact Gilla Aldan, then this attack would make perfect sense, as Wimund's See was the obvious loser out of the deal done between Fergus and York.
Gilla Aldan's name is recorded for the last time in 1151, when they were told by Pope Eugene III to give homage to the new Archbishop of York, Henry Murdac. We know that Gille Aldan was dead by 1154, because in that year their successor Christian was consecrated.

Kurtz is a central fictional character in Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness. A trader of ivory in Africa and commander of a trading post, they monopolise their position as a demigod among native Africans. Kurtz meets with the novella's protagonist, Charles Marlow, who returns them to the coast via steamboat. Kurtz, whose reputation precedes him, impresses Marlow strongly, and during the return journey, Marlow is witness to Kurtz's final moments.
In the novella
Kurtz is an ivory trader, sent by a shadowy Belgian company into the heart of an unnamed place in Africa (generally regarded as the Congo Free State). With the help of their superior technology, Kurtz has turned themselves into a charismatic demigod of all the tribes surrounding their station and gathered vast quantities of ivory in this way. As a result, their name is known throughout the region. Kurtz's general manager is envious of Kurtz and plots their downfall.
Kurtz's mother was half English, their father was half French and thus "All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz." As the reader finds out at the end, Kurtz is a multitalented man—painter, musician, writer, promising politician. They start out, years before the novel begins, as an imperialist in the best tradition of the "white man's burden". The reader is introduced to a painting of Kurtz's, depicting a blindfolded woman bearing a torch against a nearly black background, and clearly symbolic of their former views. Kurtz is also the author of a pamphlet regarding the civilization of the natives.
The presence of their admirer, the Russian "Harlequin", and what they reveal about Kurtz in their adulatory descriptions of them raises questions about Kurtz's actual beliefs and the sincerity of their progressive views.
However, over the course of their stay in Africa, Kurtz becomes corrupted. They take their pamphlet and scribbles in, at the very end, the words "Exterminate all the brutes!" They induce the natives to worship him, setting up rituals and venerations worthy of a tyrant. By the time Marlow, the protagonist, sees Kurtz, they are ill with jungle fever and almost dead. Marlow seizes Kurtz and endeavors to take them back down the river in their steamboat. Kurtz dies on the boat with the last words, "The horror! The horror!" Kurtz ultimately was changed by the jungle. At first they wanted to bring civilization to the natives, as their painting shows, but by the end they want to "exterminate all the brutes!"
Basis
Kurtz's persona is generally understood to derive from the notoriously brutal history of the so-called "Congo Free State", a territory that existed as the private property of King Leopold II from 1885 to 1908 until it was taken over by Belgium and became a Belgian colony. In their history book King Leopold's Ghost, Adam Hochschild suggests that Léon Rom, an administrator in King Leopold's Congo, i.e. in the Congo Free State, was the principal inspiration for the Kurtz character, citing references as the heads on the stakes outside of the station and other similarities between the two. Hochschild and other authors have also suggested that the fate of the disastrous "rear column" of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition (1886–8) on the Congo may have also been an influence. Column leader Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, "went mad, began hitting, whipping, and killing people, and was finally murdered". Bloom notes that Kurtz's sophisticated brutality is closer to that of Barttelot's associate slave trader Tippu Tip. The expedition's overall leader, Henry Morton Stanley, the principal figure involved in preparing the Congo for Leopold's rule, may also have been an influence. Conrad's biographer Norman Sherry judged that Arthur Hodister (1847–1892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by Congolese to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis. Peter Firchow mentions the possibility that Kurtz is a composite, modelled on various figures present in the Congo Free State at the time as well as on Conrad's imagining of what they might have had in common.
A personal acquaintance of Conrad's, Georges Antoine Klein, may also have been a real-life basis for the character. Klein was an employee of the Brussels-based trading company Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo, and died shortly after being picked up on the steamboat Conrad was piloting. Further, "Klein" means "little" in German, and as Marlow muses in the novella, "Kurz" means "short" in the same language.
Conrad also expressed admiration of Robert Louis Stevenson's Pacific Ocean writings, in particular, the stories "The Beach of Falesá" and The Ebb-Tide, as well as the non-fiction account of Tembinok' of the Gilbert Islands that appeared in In the South Seas. All three texts contain megalomaniacs who manipulate their circumstances and remote settings to assert power over others. It is widely believed that Conrad drew influence from these characters, as well as Stevenson's plot lines when writing Heart of Darkness.
In other works
Film
In the 1958 loose adaptation for the CBS television anthology series Playhouse 90 Kurtz was played by Boris Karloff. This version uses the encounter between Marlow and Kurtz as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz's adopted son.
Francis Ford Coppola's acclaimed Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now (1979) centers on the protagonist's mission to find and kill the renegade Colonel Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando), based on Conrad's character, who has gone rogue far up a river, deep in the Cambodian jungle. The script acknowledges Heart of Darkness as a source of inspiration, and the last words of Colonel Kurtz, "The horror! The horror!", echo those of their namesake in the novel.
In the mostly poorly received 1994 TNT version of the story directed by Nicolas Roeg, Kurtz, who has gone insane and is now doing the most horrible and blasphemous deeds, was portrayed by John Malkovich.
The 2020 documentary African Apocalypse follows the parallels between the fictional Kurtz and the brutal Paul Voulet, who led a murderous expedition into Niger in the year that Heart of Darkness was published.
Games
The video game Fallout: New Vegas (2010) features a character in many ways similar to Kurtz, a man who refers to themselves as Caesar. Caesar was initially a diplomat who went out into the post-apocalyptic world in an attempt to both increase the knowledge of the now tribal inhabitants and learn from their cultures to facilitate understanding in the wasteland. Caesar eventually went mad with power after becoming the de facto leader of one such tribe and led them in dismantling other tribes who then assimilated into their group. Now, they are the ruler of Caesar's Legion, a vast army of tribals modeled after the Roman Empire. Like Kurtz, Caesar is an educated, charismatic figure who is worshipped as a god by their underlings; in Caesar's case, their followers believe them to be the reincarnation of Mars, the Roman god of war.
The video game Spec Ops: The Line (2012), another modernized loose adaptation of Heart of Darkness (set in a ruined Dubai), has a similar Kurtz figure named Colonel John Konrad.
Literature
Timothy Findley's novel Headhunter (1993) features Kurtz's escape from Heart of Darkness and subsequent reign of terror over the city of Toronto as the psychiatrist-in-chief at the Parkin Institute.
The poem "The Hollow Men" by T.S. Eliot starts off with the line "Mistah Kurtz – They Dead."
In Josef Škvorecký's novel The Engineer of Human Souls Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism.

Nuro is an American robotics company based in Mountain View, California and founded by Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson. Nuro develops autonomous delivery vehicles, and was the first company to receive an autonomous exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration since its vehicles are designed to carry goods instead of humans. Its second generation self-driving vehicle is called R2, and is designed with no steering wheel, side view mirrors, or pedals.
History
The company was founded by engineers of Google's self driving car project, Waymo. Zhu served as the principal software engineer and Ferguson joined in 2011 as the principal machine learning engineer. Zhu and Ferguson left Waymo in 2016 and founded Nuro that September.
Nuro brought its robotic delivery vehicles to market in January 2018 with $92 million in funding from Greylock Partners and Gaorong Capital.
In February 2019 Nuro raised $940 million from SoftBank Group, which valued the company at $2.7 billion. Nuro said it would use the funds to expand its delivery service to new areas, add new partners, expand its fleet and grow its business. In September 2019, the company was ranked No.10 on LinkedIn's Top 50 Startups List for 2019.
In November 2020, Nuro announced that they raised $500 million in their Series C funding round led by T. Rowe Price, with a post-money valuation of $5 billion.
In December 2020, Nuro acquired self-driving trucking startup Ike Robotics. Over 55 Ike employees (including its 3 founders) joined Nuro's staff after acquisition.
In August 2021, Nuro announced that it would spend $40 million on the construction of a manufacturing facility and test track for its self-driving robot vehicles, located in southern Nevada.

In marketing, a publicity stunt is a planned event designed to attract the public's attention to the event's organizers or their cause. Publicity stunts can be professionally organized, or set up by amateurs. Such events are frequently utilized by advertisers, and by celebrities who notably include athletes and politicians.
Organizations sometimes seek publicity by staging newsworthy events that attract media coverage. They can be in the form of groundbreakings, world record attempts, dedications, press conferences or organized protests. By staging and managing the event, the organization attempts to gain some control over what is reported in the media. Successful publicity stunts have news value, offer photo, video and sound bite opportunities, and are arranged primarily for media coverage.
It can be difficult for organizations to design successful publicity stunts that highlight the message instead of burying it. For example, it makes sense for a pizza company to bake the world's largest pizza, but it would not make sense for the YMCA to sponsor that same event. The importance of publicity stunts is for generating news interest and awareness for the concept, product or service being marketed.
Notable publicity stunts
JP Morgan and Ringling Brothers
In 1933, during the congressional hearings of J.P. Morgan's role in the financial crash, U.S. Senator Carter Glass remarked that the proceedings had turned into a circus. The Ringling Brothers company were in town at that time. They interpreted Glass's remarks as an invitation and asked their press agent to place a dwarf, Lya Graf, on Morgan's lap during one of the hearings. While it surprised Morgan and infuriated Glass, it got loads of publicity for Ringling Brothers.
Calendar girls
In 1999 a group of 11 women of the Women's Institute (in Yorkshire, UK) stripped for a calendar to raise money for charity. The calendar released featured the women posing nude – obscured by baked goods and flower arrangements with 800,000 copies sold worldwide. This stunt shocked people in those times and inspired the 2003 comedy film Calendar Girls.

Preston Heyman (born 5 March 1953) is a British record producer, drummer and percussionist, whose career spans five decades. Best known for their collaborations with Kate Bush, they were also a member of the Tom Robinson Band and has contributed to many hit recordings and worked with a diverse range of artists including Terence Trent D'arby, Tin Tin Out, Massive Attack, Paul McCartney, Tina Turner and a Grammy Award-winning film soundtrack with Mike Oldfield.
Acting career
Although principally known for their musical career, Heyman's first experiences of show business came as a child actor and student of Corona Theatre School in London; while studying there they appeared in the films Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Goodbye Mr Chips with Peter O'Toole, Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River (1968) with Jerry Lewis, and Salt and Pepper starring Sammy Davis Jr. and Rat Pack star Peter Lawford, as well as in an episode of Z-Cars.
Early musical career
During this period, Heyman became increasingly interested in music and, when asked by their classmate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl, both aged 16 and still at school, they formed a touring band fronted by former Unit 4+2 singer Tommy Moellar. They would play their hit "Concrete and Clay" sometimes three times a night up and down the country (1966–1967). They later said it was quite a musical education for the age of 16. In 1969, Heyman and Caryl formed the school band Sanctuary; the band's concerts often featured a friend from a rival stage school, Barbara Speake Stage School, the soon-to-be star Phil Collins. In a two-drummer setup, Heyman and Collins played the same fills, which became somewhat of a norm later in Genesis's career with Chester Thompson. The two were to work again later when Collins asked Heyman to work with their band Brand X as percussionist. Leaving school on the brink of their GCSE exams explaining to their parents that they would not need them in a music career, Heyman secured an album deal for Sanctuary with Polydor, recording an album at Rockfield Studios that still remains unreleased.
Early studio career
Heyman's first chart success came as a member of British R&B funk band Gonzalez, drumming on their worldwide disco hit "Haven't Stopped Dancing Yet" (1975). They had long been a fan and was asked by bandleader and sax player Mick Eve to join them on the eve of dates supporting Bob Marley on their Hammersmith Odeon shows. This led to many studio sessions, as the Gonzalez rhythm and brass sections were always in demand, especially with visiting U.S. artists. While in Air London Studio with Gonzalez recording tracks for their second album, Our Only Weapon Is Our Music (1975), they were watched from the door by Bryan Ferry who asked them when they finished if they would cart their drums along the corridor to the studio next door. They agreed and played on "This Island Earth" from Ferry's fifth solo album The Bride Stripped Bare (1978) alongside bass player Alan Spenner and guitarist Neil Hubbard of Kokomo, who were London contemporaries to Gonzalez. This began a long studio session career.
Kate Bush
Soon after this, a telephone call came from Kate Bush and they began working with her, rehearsing for 6 months as a member of their band before embarking on their Lionheart Tour, later to become known as The Tour of Life (1979). Heyman also appears on Live at the Hammersmith Odeon (1981), which was later re-issued in 1994 as a box set audio CD with video; and on Bush's On Stage (E.P.), a live recording of four songs performed on Kate Bush's The Tour of Life in 1979. It was released on 31 August 1979 with "Them Heavy People" as the lead track. It peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Following the tour Bush then had them in the studio to provide drums, percussion and some backing vocals on the album Never for Ever. Released in September 1980, it was Bush's first No. 1 album and was also the first ever album by a British female solo artist to top the UK album chart, as well as being the first album by any female solo artist to enter the chart at no 1. Heyman played drums with the Tour of Life band on the B.B.C. T.V. Special KATE (1979) on which a new song "December Will Be Magic Again" was aired, later to be released by the B.B.C. as a DVD. They then went into the studio with Bush and played both drums and percussion on the single "December Will Be Magic Again" (1979), then working with them on the 1982 album The Dreaming. Their pounding drums featuring on their Single "Sat in Your Lap" (1981), recorded in the stone room at The Townhouse Studio 2 London with Paddy Bush and Preston on whip (played on bamboo canes swooshing through the air rhythmically), both appear in the video as singing Bulls. This was filmed in Orchestral Studio 1 Abbey Road. Critic Simon Reynolds called it "an avant-pop stampede of pounding percussion and deranged shrieks."
During this period Heyman also played with the Tom Robinson Band on the album TRB Two, produced by Todd Rundgren (1979), and Atomic Rooster on their sixth album Atomic Rooster (1980). On recommendation from bass player and friend Phil Spalding, 1984 saw them in the studio with Mike Oldfield recording the soundtrack for the Academy Award winning film The Killing Fields, (1984) using unusual percussion instruments they had brought back from an extended trip to Indonesia after Kate Bush's tour.
Kim Wilde
In 1985, Kim Wilde asked them to join their band and they spent most of that year with them in France doing T.V. shows and concerts. They appear in the video for their top 20 single "Rage to Love" which received a remix by Dave Edmunds. They also recorded a French T.V. special on Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean. And did a tour of Roman Amphitheatres in the south of France and Spain, Summer 1985.
Terence Trent D'arby
After studio sessions (again with Phil Spalding on bass) for the 1987 album Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby produced by Heaven 17's Martyn Ware, they found themselves drumming on the U.S.A. Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit "Wishing Well" (1988) and features in the song's video. They joined Terence's band and spent the next 2 years touring the globe. In nearly every country they landed, both the album and single were No. 1 and at times they found themselves doing 5 T.V. appearances a day, once described as "The world's wildest craziest party that never ever stopped." Eventually, on the verge of another U.S. tour, Heyman decided to leave saying they had to "save my sanity before it was too late to do so." Worldwide, the album sold a million copies within the first three days of going on sale.

WLDB (93.3 MHz "B93.3 FM") is a commercial FM radio station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is owned and operated by the Milwaukee Radio Alliance, a partnership between Shamrock Communications and All Pro Broadcasting. WLDB airs an adult contemporary radio format. Its studios are located in Menomonee Falls.
WLDB has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 16,000 watts. The transmitter site is in Milwaukee's North Side off Humboldt Boulevard near Estabrook Park and the Milwaukee River. WLDB broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 digital subchannel carries sister station WZTI 1290 AM's oldies format. It also feeds FM translator W262CJ 100.3 MHz, broadcasting from the same site as WLDB's transmitter.
History
WQFM
In 1958, WQFM signed on the air. The station had various formats, including classical music, big band music, jazz and ethnic programming, before the station tried an automated Top 40 format. Starting in 1973, WQFM was Milwaukee's dominant album oriented rock station. The station competed with the eclectic free-form WZMF until 1979, and WLPX until 1983.
"93QFM" was the top rock station in town for over a decade, but faced its stiffest competition in 1987, when WBCS ended its country music format and became active rock "Lazer 103". Seeing Lazer 103 take away some listeners, WQFM shifted to a more heavy metal/hard rock direction, similar to that of Lazer.
In 1992, it switched to a more "adult rock" sound, then became heavier again. In addition, the station had a succession of morning shows over the years, including an ill-fated attempt at airing Wisconsin native Jonathon Brandmeier's show from WLUP in Chicago. That backfired when WLUP shuffled its on-air lineup, moving Brandmeier to afternoons and put Kevin Matthews in morning drive time. At one point, WQFM put together one short-lived morning show that consisted of people who had never done radio, which included Lori Minetti, the hostess of the Wisconsin Lottery's Money Game television show and later, the host of WITI's Builder's Showcase.
WJZI
After years of falling ratings, on March 1, 1996, at 10:15 a.m., WQFM ended its rock format with "Long Live Rock" by The Who, and flipped to smooth jazz as WJZI. The first song under the new format was "I Wish" by Najee. The WQFM call letters were then transferred to a sister station in Scranton, Pennsylvania, WTZR, to prevent re-use by a Milwaukee competitor.
WJZI's smooth jazz format never dominated among Milwaukee radio listeners, but remained competitive in the middle portion of the Arbitron ratings. In the winter of 2005, the station tied for 9th place with WJMR among listeners 25 to 54, but rose to 7th place in the winter of 2006.
On March 5, 2007, WJZI began a transition in its format, gearing the station towards a slightly younger female demographic. This involved adding more adult contemporary music. De-emphasizing the smooth jazz instrumental music that was a staple of the station, WJZI changed its branding to "Smooth 93.3," as it slowly began to make the transition to full-fledged soft rock.
By June 18, 2007, the transition was complete, with revamped on-air imaging, station logo and website. It called itself "The New Smooth 93.3." A new morning show was added, featuring Milwaukee radio veteran Ellen Stout and station program director Stan Atkinson. Competing station WFMR changed its format from classical music to smooth jazz on June 26, one week after WJZI's move. That station changed its call sign to WJZX.
WLDB
On July 30, 2007, WJZI adopted new positioning, changing its call letters to WLDB, with the new moniker "B93.3". This matched the imaging used by a popular station with the same format in Philadelphia, WBEB. The station uses the decimal number to avert confusion with Sheboygan's country-formatted WBFM, which likewise brands as "B93.7" and has fringe reception in the central reaches of Ozaukee County. The station's weather forecasts are prepared and delivered by WDJT-TV's weather staff.
In June 2009, WLDB tweaked its format from soft AC to mainstream AC, playing music from the 1980s, 1990s, and the 2000s. This type of format was on WKTI before it flipped to an adult hits format and changed its call sign to WLWK-FM in November 2008. WLDB was attempting to compete with Hot AC WMYX-FM, although "The Mix" plays more new music than old. As of 2011, the station played music from the 1970s through the present. The station's schedule all weekend between 5 PM on Fridays and 5 AM on Mondays consisted solely of 80s music.
Trending Radio 93.3
The station rebranded as "Trending Radio 93.3" at 6:07 p.m. on April 1, 2015, after playing You Gotta Be by Des'ree, a title playing as a pun for a skit which followed where the station's former bee mascot was swatted to cue the branding change. The first song on "Trending Radio" was Let's Get It Started by The Black Eyed Peas. The playlist was then tightened towards more current and recent hits, focusing on competing more with WMYX, along with WXSS and WRNW to a lesser extent.
On February 23, 2016, at 3 p.m., after playing "Royals" by Lorde, WLDB returned to its former adult contemporary format and "B93.3" branding, though lacking the "bee" elements and mascot. The first song after the relaunch was "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey.
Christmas music
In previous years, the station usually has only had intermittent Christmas music in the period between Thanksgiving and mid-December, then all Christmas for a couple of weeks leading to the holiday, but since 2016, has raced WRIT-FM in converting in mid-November. In 2016, the station went all-Christmas on November 17, beating WRIT-FM for the first time.

Dusky-throated antshrike, Thamnomanes ardesiacus
Cinereous antshrike, Thamnomanes caesius
Saturnine antshrike, Thamnomanes saturninus

The National Television and Radio Company of Uzbekistan (, MTRK) is the national broadcaster of Uzbekistan, operating four television networks.
Two new channels were launched by the company in early 2013: 'Madaniyat va Maʼrifat' ('Culture and Enlightenment') and 'Dunyo boʻylab' ('Around the World'). By the end of the year, four new channels were launched using frequencies of private television channels which were prohibited by the Uzbek authorities.
In January 2013, the organisation's website was hacked by someone who was going with the handle @CloneSecurity. The attack was said to have been launched for political reasons.

Maha Thiha Thura Dhammaraja (, ; born Pe Khin; 27 October 1812 – 4 April 1839), commonly known as Setkya Min ( Chakravarti) or the Prince of Nyaungyan (), was an heir apparent of Burma and son of King Bagyidaw and their consort Hsinbyume.  They are worshipped as a weizza along with Bo Bo Aung.
Life
Maung Pe Khin (မောင်ဖေခင်) was born on 27 October 1812 in Mingun, near Ava, to the Crown Prince of Sagaing (who later became King Bagyidaw) and Hsinbyume. Miraculous events were reported at their birth and their body was said to bear the signs of a future world emperor. King Bodawpaya, their great grandfather, conferred the title of Thatoe Minhla Shwetaung on him, and gave them the status of Prince of Nyaungyan. Their mother died seven days after giving birth.  They are recorded as having been very popular with the people and called by them Setkya Min. After Burma's defeat in the First Anglo-Burmese War, it was hoped that they would succeed their father on the throne, drive out the British, and usher in an era of prosperity for Burma and Buddhism.
Setkya Min married Shwetantin Princess, who gave birth to a daughter named Me Tin Gyi. Shwetantin Princess was a daughter of the Prince of Hlaing (a son of King Bodawpaya) and the Princess of Danubyu (a daughter of King Bodawpaya). Therefore, Setkya Prince and Shwetantin Princess were half-siblings.
When Bagyidaw was overthrown by their brother King Tharrawaddy, Setkya Min was executed on 15 April 1838. They were thrown into a river in a velvet sack - an execution method favored by Burmese royalty.
Veneration
Many believed Setkya Min had not been drowned. They said that they had been miraculously rescued by the powerful weizza Bo Bo Aung, who brought them to a hidden sanctuary where they learned esoteric practices and eventually became a weizza himself. Using their spiritual powers, Bo Bo Aung transported Setkya Min to the heaven where future kings are said to bide their time before returning to Earth.
Anti-colonial movement
Setkya Min is associated with the anti-colonial movement in Burma. Throughout most of the colonial era, the figure of Setkya Min represented anti-colonial resistance, and a series of rebellions were led by people claiming to be this mysterious personage. After the British had annexed all of Burma and deposed the last Burmese king in 1885, these rebellions largely sought to restore the monarchy and the king to their role as the foremost promoter and supporter of the Buddha's Sasana.

James McIlroy (25 October 1931 – 20 August 2018) was a Northern Ireland international footballer, who played for Glentoran, Burnley, Stoke City and Oldham Athletic. They were regarded as one of Burnley's greatest players, having played 497 matches and scoring 131 goals. McIlroy also managed Oldham Athletic and Bolton Wanderers.
Career
Burnley
McIlroy was born in Lambeg, County Antrim and they were introduced to football at an early age as their father, Harry played for Lisburn Distillery and their uncle, Willie played for Portadown. After leaving school McIlroy played for Glentoran before joining Burnley in March 1950 for £7,000. They soon cemented their reputation as one of the finest scheming inside forwards since World War II. They were dubbed as the 'Brain' of Burnley and was a very composed passer of the ball only releasing it when they were sure of finding a teammate. Their neat footwork made them a crowd favourite at Turf Moor and indeed for the Northern Ireland national team where they made 55 caps. They helped Burnley win the First Division in 1959–60 and reach the FA Cup Final in 1962, losing 3–1 to Tottenham Hotspur. After 497 matches for the "Clarets" scoring 131 goals, McIlory was allowed to leave for Stoke City for a cut price £25,000, which came as a shock to the Burnley fans who branded chairperson Bob Lord 'insane'.
Stoke City
McIlroy joined Tony Waddington's Stoke who at the time had a collection of experienced veterans with the likes of Stanley Matthews, Dennis Viollet, Jackie Mudie and Don Ratcliffe. They arrived at Stoke with the side top of the table but their debut for Stoke was a disaster as Stoke crashed to a 6–0 defeat at Norwich City. Regardless Stoke continued their push for promotion and with McIlroy's intelligent passing featuring heavily they claimed the Second Division title in 1962–63. They scored 12 goals in 1963–64 as Stoke established themselves in the top tier, they also played in the 1964 League Cup Final as Stoke lost 4–3 Leicester City. Their final match for the "Potters" was against Burnley on 27 December 1965 leaving to become manager of Oldham Athletic.
Later career
In January 1966 they moved into management after being recruited by new Oldham Athletic chairperson Ken Bates. With Oldham struggling at the foot of the Third Division, Oldham paid Stoke £5,000 so that they could register McIlroy as a player again. They signed several former Stoke City team-mates, including Bill Asprey, Alan Philpott, George Kinnell and Keith Bebbington. However McIlroy did not cope well with the pressure of management and resigned after losing 4–0 against Luton Town on the opening day of the 1968–69 season. They returned to Stoke City for a short while as assistant to Waddington before moving to Bolton Wanderers as coach and assistant to Nat Lofthouse. McIlroy had an 18-day spell in charge after Lofthouse's departure but resigned after just two matches on principle after being told by the board to sell players.
After football
They retired to the Burnley area and was a regular attender of Burnley home matches. They were given Freedom of the Borough Burnley in December 2008 and was given a testimonial match by Burnley in 2009.
McIlroy was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 New Years Honours List for services to football and to charity, and arranged to receive the honour at Burnley's Turf Moor ground rather than at Buckingham Palace.
In April 2015, the feature-length documentary Spirit of '58 was screened as part of the Belfast Film Festival. It featured Jimmy McIlroy prominently alongside the other surviving players (Billy Bingham, Peter McParland, Billy Simpson and Harry Gregg) as it told the story of Northern Ireland's journey throughout the 1950s under the managership of Peter Doherty, culminating in the 1958 World Cup.
McIllroy died on 20 August 2018 at the age of 86. In a statement Burnley called them "our greatest ever player."
Jimmy McIlroy Stand
Burnley's stadium, Turf Moor, has a stand named in McIlroy's honour. The stadium's eastern stand was rebuilt in the late 1990s after the Beehole End was demolished and was named the "Jimmy McIlroy Stand".

Romania's landscape is almost evenly divided among mountains (31 percent), hills (33 percent), and plains (36 percent). These varied relief forms spread rather symmetrically from the Carpathian Mountains, which reach elevations of more than 2,400 metres, to the Danube Delta, which is just a few metres above sea level.
Romanian Carpathians
The arc of the Carpathians extends over 1,000 km through the center of the country, covering an area of 70,000 square km. These mountains are of low to medium altitude and are no wider than 100 km. They are deeply fragmented by longitudinal and transverse valleys and crossed by several major rivers. These features and the fact that there are many summits passes—some at altitudes up to 2,256 metres—have made the Carpathians less of a barrier to movement than have other European ranges. Another distinguishing feature is the many eroded platforms that provide tableland at relatively high altitudes. There are permanent settlements here at above 1,200 metres.
Romania's Carpathians are differentiated into three ranges: the Eastern Carpathians, the Southern Carpathians or Transylvanian Alps, and the Western Carpathians. Each of these ranges has important distinguishing features. The Eastern Carpathians are composed of three parallel ridges that run from northwest to southeast. The westernmost ridge is an extinct volcanic range with many preserved cones and craters. The range has many large depressions, in the largest of which the city of Braşov is situated. Important mining and industrial centers as well as agricultural areas are found within these depressions. The Eastern Carpathians are covered with forests—some 32 percent of the country's woodlands are there. They also contain important ore deposits, including gold and silver, and their mineral water springs feed numerous health resorts.
The Southern Carpathians offer the highest peaks at Moldoveanu Peak (2,544 metres) and Negoiu (2,535 meters) and more than 150 glacial lakes. They have large grassland areas and some woodlands but few large depressions and subsoil resources. The region was crisscrossed by an ancient network of trans-Carpathian roads, and vestiges of the old Roman Way are still visible. Numerous passes and the valleys of the Olt, Jiu, and Danube rivers provide routes for roads and railways through the mountains.
The Western Carpathians are the lowest of the three ranges and are fragmented by many deep structural depressions. They have historically functioned as "gates," which allow easy passage but can be readily defended. The most famous of these is the Iron Gate on the Danube. The Western Carpathians are the most densely settled, and it is in the northernmost area of this range, the Apuseni Mountains, that permanent settlements can be found at the highest altitudes.
Hills, plateaus and plains
Enclosed within the great arc of the Carpathians lie the undulating plains and low hills of the Transylvanian Plateau--the the largest tableland in the country and the center of Romania. This important agricultural region also contains large deposits of methane gas and salt. To the south and east of the Carpathians, the Sub-Carpathians form a fringe of rolling terrain ranging from 396 to 1,006 metres in elevation. This terrain is matched in the west by the slightly lower Western Hills. The symmetry of Romania's relief continues with the Getic Tableland to the south of the Sub-Carpathians, the Moldavian Tableland in the east between the Sub-Carpathians and the Prut River, and the Dobrujan Tableland in the southeast between the Danube and the Black Sea. The Sub-Carpathians and the tableland areas provide good conditions for human settlement and are important areas for fruit growing, viticulture, and other agricultural activity. They also contain large deposits of brown coal and natural gas.
Beyond the Carpathian foothills and tablelands, the plains spread south and west. In the southern parts of the country, the lower Danube Plain is divided by the Olt River; east of the river lies the Romanian Plain, and to the west is the Oltenian or Western Plain. The land here is rich with chernozemic soils and forms Romania's most important farming region. Irrigation is widely used, and marshlands in the Danube's floodplain have been diked and drained to provide additional tillable land.
Romania's lowest land is found on the northern edge of the Dobruja region in the Danube Delta. The delta is a triangular swampy area of marshes, floating reed islands, and sandbanks, where the Danube ends its trek of almost 3,000 km and divides into three frayed branches before emptying into the Black Sea. The Danube Delta provides a large part of the country's fish production, and its reeds are used to manufacture cellulose. The region also serves as a nature preserve for rare species of plant and animal life including migratory birds.
After entering the country in the southwest at Bazias, the Danube travels some 1,000 km through or along Romanian territory, forming the southern frontier with Serbia and Bulgaria. Virtually all of the country's rivers are tributaries of the Danube, either directly or indirectly, and by the time the Danube's course ends in the Black Sea, they account for nearly 40 percent of the total discharge. The most important of these rivers are the Mureș, the Olt, the Prut, the Siret, the Ialomița, the Someș, and the Argeș. Romania's rivers primarily flow east, west, and south from the central crown of the Carpathians. They are fed by rainfall and melting snow, which causes considerable fluctuation in discharge and occasionally catastrophic flooding. In the east, river waters are collected by the Siret and the Prut. In the south, the rivers flow directly into the Danube, and in the west, waters are collected by the Tisza on Hungarian territory.
The Danube is by far Romania's most important river, not only for transportation, but also for the production of hydroelectric power. One of Europe's largest hydroelectric stations is located at the Iron Gates, where the Danube surges through the Carpathian gorges. The Danube is an important water route for domestic shipping, as well as international trade. It is navigable for river vessels along its entire Romanian course and for seagoing ships as far as the port of Brăila. An obvious problem with the use of the Danube for inland transportation is its remoteness from most of the major industrial centres. Moreover, marshy banks and perennial flooding impede navigation in some areas.

Kerrynne Liddle is an Australian politician and the first Indigenous federal member of parliament from South Australia.  They are an Arrente woman and member of the Liberal Party. They were elected to the Senate on the party's ticket in South Australia at the 2022 federal election, to a term beginning on 1 July 2022. They were a journalist and corporate manager before entering politics.
Early life
Liddle was born and raised in Alice Springs.  They are one of five children born to Arrernte parents Geoff and Jean Liddle; their father was a construction worker and their mother was a nurse but later worked supporting High School students. Them sister Leanne was the first Indigenous woman to become a police officer in South Australia and their aunt Lorraine Liddle was the first Indigenous person to become a barrister in the Northern Territory.
Liddle attended a public high school in Alice Springs and also studied at Katherine Rural College and later Roseworthy Agricultural College, working as a Jillaroo in their early career. As a mature-age student they completed a Bachelor of Arts in management at the University of South Australia and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Adelaide. They completed a Vincent Fairfax Foundation Ethics Fellowship and is a graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.
Career
Liddle worked as a journalist with the ABC in radio and television, and Channel 7 Adelaide. They later established their own public relations business, in Adelaide. In 2010, they served on the expert panel for the Review of Australian Government Investment in the Indigenous Broadcasting and Media Sector conducted by Neville Stevens.
In 2011, Liddle was appointed as Santos Limited's Aboriginal participation manager. They later worked for Voyages Indigenous Tourism Australia as a manager at the Ayers Rock Resort, responsible for over 1000 staff, with 400 Indigenous employees.
Liddle served on several Boards including GPEX for GP training, the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress. They also served as chair of the Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute, on the boards of the South Australian Housing Trust, Aboriginal Hostels Limited and Indigenous Business Australia, and as a member of the councils of the University of Adelaide and University of South Australia.
Politics
Liddle became a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 2006. They later stated in 2021 that they were a financial member for only one year and had only attended one meeting which was an introductory one. They then joined the Liberal Party and was preselected in sixth place on the party's Senate ticket in South Australia at the 2016 federal election. In 2019, Liddle began working as a staffer for Senator Anne Ruston. They were a candidate for the vice-presidency of the Liberal Party's state division in February 2020 but withdrew their candidacy due to illness.
In February 2021, Liddle won preselection for the third position on the Liberal Party's Senate ticket in South Australia at the 2022 election.  They are aligned with the party's moderate faction, although their preselection victory over fellow moderate Rachel Swift was largely due to support from the party's conservatives.
At the 2022 federal election, Liddle was elected to a six-year term beginning on 1 July 2022; they were the last South Australian senator to be declared elected.  They are the first Indigenous Australian elected to represent South Australia in the Senate and the first Indigenous woman to win a parliamentary seat in South Australia at either state or federal level.

The Free Morgan Foundation is a non-profit charity that advocates the release of Morgan, a female orca held at Loro Parque in Tenerife, Canary Islands. The foundation is made up of a number of independent international experts representing numerous orca research and education organisations, including Orcalab, Orca Network, Orca Research Trust, Centre for Whale Research, and Project SeaWolf Coastal Protection.
Aim
The main aim of the foundation is to allow for the release of Morgan. The proposed release would take place in stages, including releasing them into a sea-pen and eventually into the wild in Norway. Their release plan estimates that it would take approximately 16 weeks post-relocation to Norway for Morgan to be released into the wild.
Morgan
Morgan was rescued by the Dolfinarium Harderwijk under a rescue, rehabilitation and release permit in 2010 as they were severely emaciated. They were kept in the Dolfinarium for 18 months, where they were rehabilitated. Morgan was moved to Loro Parque, in Tenerife, Canary Islands, in November 2011 after a Dutch court ruled they could be relocated.  They are the only orca at Loro Parque who was not captive-born. The Foundation states that Morgan is "bullied and attacked by the other orca on a regular basis" and that Loro Parque is breaching "Morgan's CITES transport permit, which is exclusively for research purposes".

Jerome "Jeff Smith" Jefferds (April 23, 1891 – February 3, 1962) was an American professional boxer who held the Australian version of the World Middleweight Title during their career. Despite their relative anonymity, Smith faced off against some the best fighters of their era, including Harry Greb, Gene Tunney, Mike Gibbons, Georges Carpentier, Les Darcy and Tommy Loughran. Statistical boxing website BoxRec lists Smith as the 17th greatest middleweight ever, while Ring Magazine founder Nat Fleischer ranked Smith as the No. 10 Middleweight of all-time. They were inducted into the Ring Magazine hall of fame in 1969 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2013.
Early career
Smith made their pro debut in 1910 (the same year of the death of famed Middleweight Champion Stanley Ketchel), beating Ray Hatfield by newspaper decision over four rounds. On February 20, 1912, Smith beat future World Middleweight titleholder George Chip on points over fifteen rounds in what turned out to be a heated battle. Their next notable challenge was against another future Middleweight titleholder in Mike Gibbons, with whom they drew over 10 rounds as decided by newspaper reporters. On October 11, 1913, Smith faced yet another future champion in French fighter and future Light Heavyweight champ Georges Carpentier. Despite a late rally by Smith, Carpentier used their vaunted technique beat them decisively in a twenty round decision.
Australian World Middleweight Champion
Earning their nickname as the "Bayonne Globetrotter", Smith faced Eddie McGoorty in Australia, losing an extremely unpopular decision over twenty rounds. The decision was so despised that it was later rescinded, and Smith was awarded the Australian version of the World Middleweight Title. Smith would lose the title to Australian pugilist Mick King on November 28, 1914 but regained it just one month later on December 26 of the same year. On January 23, 1915 Smith faced famed Australian fighter Les Darcy, beating them by disqualification after Darcy's handlers threw in a towel in protest to what they claimed was a low blow by Smith. Smith thus maintained their status as Australian champion, but Darcy would later exact their revenge, beating Smith via disqualification for repeated low blows.
Later career
During their career, Smith had a tremendous rivalry with the legendary Harry Greb; with the two squaring of a total of seven times. Although they lost six times and drew once against the "Pittsburgh Windmill", Greb had great respect for Smith; stating "My toughest fight was with Jeff Smith. (Tommy) Gibbons gave me a hard battle, but nothing like the Smith beating." Also notable was their tetra-logy of fights with Mike Gibbons, resulting in one win and three losses. Near the end of their career, Smith faced the fabled Gene Tunney; losing a clear decision to the much larger "Fighting Marine" after being knocked down twice. Smith retired after being knocked out for the third time by Cuban Bobby Brown on November 18, 1927.

William Withering FRS (17 March 1741 – 6 October 1799) was an English botanist, geologist, chemist, physician and first systematic investigator of the bioactivity of digitalis.
Withering was born in Wellington, Shropshire, the son of a surgeon. They trained as a physician and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. They worked at Birmingham General Hospital from 1779. The story is that they noticed a person with dropsy (swelling from congestive heart failure) improve remarkably after taking a traditional herbal remedy; Withering became famous for recognising that the active ingredient in the mixture came from the foxglove plant. The active ingredient is now known as digoxin, after the plant's scientific name. In 1785, Withering published An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses, which contained reports on clinical trials and notes on digitalis's effects and toxicity.
Biography
Born in England, Withering attended Edinburgh Medical School from 1762 to 1766. In 1767 they started as a consultant at Stafford Royal Infirmary. They married Helena Cookes (an amateur botanical illustrator, and a former patient of his) in 1772; they had three children (the first, Helena was born in 1775 but died a few days later, William was born in 1776, and Charlotte in 1778). In 1775 they were appointed physician to Birmingham General Hospital (at the suggestion of Erasmus Darwin, a physician and founder member of the Lunar Society), but in 1783 they diagnosed themselves as having pulmonary tuberculosis and went twice to Portugal hoping the better winter climate would improve their health; it did not. On the way home from their second trip there, the ship they were in was chased by pirates. In 1785 they were elected a Fellow of the prestigious Royal Society and also published their Account of the Foxglove (see below). The following year they leased Edgbaston Hall, in Birmingham. They were one of the members of the Lunar Society. During the Birmingham riots of 1791 (in which Joseph Priestley's home was demolished) they prepared to flee from Edgbaston Hall, but their staff kept the rioters at bay until the military arrived. In 1799 they decided that they could not tolerate another winter in the cold and draughty Hall, so they bought "The Larches" in the nearby Sparkbrook area; their wife did not feel up to the move and remained at Edgbaston Hall. After moving to The Larches on 28 September, they died on 6 October 1799.
Botany
In 1776, they published The botanical arrangement of all the vegetables naturally growing in Great Britain, an early and influential British Flora. It was the first in English based on the then new Linnaean taxonomy — a classification of all living things — devised by the Swedish botanist and physician Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778). At the time they were criticised for having produced a bowdlerised version of Linnaeus, deliberately omitting any references to sexual reproduction, out of a desire to protect 'female modesty', notably by 'A Botanical Society, at Lichfield' - almost always incorrectly named as The Botanical Society of Lichfield or the Lichfield Botanical Society. Withering explained on the title page and their introduction that they avoided being explicit to allow their book to be used without any problems by a wider audience and in particular women. However they found support for their position, and botany was considered a subject suitable for many women during the next century. A talented illustrator herself, their wife, Helena, sketched plants they collected.
Withering wrote two more editions of this work in 1787 and 1792, in collaboration with fellow Lunar Society member Jonathan Stokes, and after their death their son (also William) published four more. It continued being published under various authors until 1877. Withering senior also carried out pioneering work into the identification of fungi and invented a folding pocket microscope for use on botanical field trips. They also introduced to the general audience the screw down plant press and the vasculum. In 1787 they were elected a Fellow of the Linnaean Society in recognition of their contribution to botany. Subsequently, the plant Witheringia solanacea was named in their honour, and they became known on the continent of Europe as "The English Linnaeus". The William Withering Chair in Medicine at the University of Birmingham Medical School is named after him, as is the medical school's annual William Withering Lecture.
Discovery of digitalis
Allegedly, Withering first learned of the use of digitalis in treating "dropsy" (œdema) from "Mother Hutton", an old woman who practised as a folk herbalist in Shropshire, who used the plant as part of a polyherbal formulation containing over 20 different ingredients to successfully treat this condition. Withering deduced that digitalis was the active ingredient in the formulation, and over the ensuing nine years they carefully tried out different preparations of various parts of the plant (collected in different seasons) documenting 156 cases where they had employed digitalis, and describing the effects and the best - and safest - way of using it. At least one of these cases was a patient for whom Erasmus Darwin had asked Withering for their second opinion. In January 1785 Darwin submitted a paper entitled "An Account of the Successful Use of Foxglove in Some Dropsies and in Pulmonary Consumption" to the College of Physicians in London; it was presented by Darwin in March of that year. A postscript at the end of the published volume of transactions containing Darwin's paper states that "Whilst the last pages of this volume were in the press, Dr Withering of Birmingham... published a numerous collection of cases in which foxglove has been given, and frequently with good success". After this, Darwin and Withering became increasingly estranged, and eventually an argument broke out apparently resulting from Robert Darwin having accused Withering of unprofessional behaviour by effectively poaching patients. This is a very early example of medical academic plagiarism. This was in reality orchestrated by Erasmus Darwin, a man whose anger and sarcasm when they felt slighted had in all likelihood contributed to the suicide of their own son and later to the estrangement of their son Robert.
In reality "Mother Hutton" was created in 1928 in an illustration by William Meade Prince as part of an advertising campaign by Parke-Davis who marketed digitalis preparations. There is no mention of a Mother Hutton in Withering's works or anyone else's and no mention of them meeting any old woman directly. In their account they state that they are merely asked to comment on a family recipe that was originally an old woman's receipt or recipe (that they had long kept secret) by a colleague. Since 1928, Mother Hutton's status has grown from being an image in an advertising poster to an acclaimed wise woman, herbalist, pharmacist and medical practitioner in Shropshire who was cheated out of their true recognition by Dr. Withering's unscrupulous methods. The story often written around this is also totally apocryphal. Withering was in fact informed of the Brasenose College, Oxford case by one of their medical colleagues Dr. Ash at Birmingham Hospital and the Dean was treated with digitalis root not leaves. The myth of Mother Hutton and how Withering chased them around Shropshire has been created by authors not going back to primary sources but instead copying and then embellishing the unreferenced work of others. See "Withering and The Foxglove; the making of a myth" by D.M. Krikler (British Heart Journal, 1985, 54: 256–257). In Withering's Account of the Foxglove printed in 1785 Withering mentions seven different occasions when foxglove was brought to their attention. Recognising that foxglove was the active ingredient in a family recipe (that was long kept secret by an old woman in Shropshire) would not have been difficult with their expert botanical knowledge. Withering had first published their Botanical Arrangement in 1776 and in it suggested foxglove deserved looking at in more detail. Erasmus Darwin tried to take the credit for foxglove and failed. Erasmus Darwin then attempted to try and discredit Withering behind the scenes with the unwitting help of their son Robert having earlier used the thesis of their dead son Charles to try and establish priority. Charles Darwin in fact had been friendly with Withering (as had Robert) and had talked in Edinburgh University about Withering's experiments with foxglove. Erasmus Darwin was probably jealous that Withering had become the most famous and sought-after doctor outside London and that Withering's English Botanical Arrangement became the standard reference source and far exceeded the botanical publications of Erasmus (all published semi-anonymously) in popularity. Withering's Botanical Arrangement, although now almost forgotten, became the standard reference for English Botany for almost the next 100 years.
Chemistry and geology
Withering was an enthusiastic chemist and geologist. They conducted a series of experiments on Terra Ponderosa, a heavy ore from Cumberland, England. They deduced that it contained a hitherto undescribed element which they were unable to characterise. It was later shown to be barium carbonate and in 1789 the German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner named the mineral Witherite in their honour. The Matthew Boulton mineral collection of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery may contain one of the earliest known specimens of witherite. A label in Boulton's handwriting records; "No.2 Terra Ponderosa Aerata, given me by Dr. Withering"
Withering also undertook analyses of the mineral content of a number of spa waters in England and abroad, notably at the medicinal spa at Caldas da Rainha in Portugal. This latter undertaking occurred during the winter of 1793–4, and they were subsequently elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Portugal.
Memorials
They were buried on 10 October 1799 in Edgbaston Old Church next to Edgbaston Hall, Birmingham, although the exact site of their grave is unknown. The memorial stone, now moved inside the church, has foxgloves and Witheringia solanaceae carved upon it to commemorate their discovery and their wider contribution to botany.  They are also remembered by one of the Lunar Society Moonstones in Birmingham and by a blue plaque at Edgbaston Hall. Birmingham University School of Medicine established a Chair of Medicine post in their honour, named after him.
In July 2011 a J D Wetherspoon public house opened in Withering's birthplace, Wellington, and has been named after him.

Hotel Ukraina (), also branded and marketed as the Radisson Collection Hotel, Moscow (), is a five-star luxury hotel in the city centre of Moscow, on a bend of the Moskva River. The hotel is one of the "Seven Sisters", and stands tall. It is the tallest hotel in Russia, the tallest hotel in Europe, and the 52nd-tallest hotel in the world. It is a Radisson Collection hotel, managed by the Rezidor Hotel Group.
History
Hotel Ukraina was commissioned by Joseph Stalin. It was designed by Arkady Mordvinov and Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky (the leading Soviet expert on steel-framed highrise construction), and is the second tallest of the neoclassical Stalin-era "seven sisters" (, with 34 stories). It was the tallest hotel in the world from the time of its construction until the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel opened in Atlanta, Georgia, United States in 1976. Construction on the low river bank meant that the builders had to dig well below the water level. This was enabled by an ingenious water retention system, using a perimeter of needle pumps driven deep into the ground.
History
Domestic architects began to actively discuss the possibility of building high-rise buildings in Moscow after the 1917 revolution. Very shortly thereafter, there were many interesting projects; for example, the skyscraper project of the Supreme Economic Council building on the Lubyanka Square, designed by Vladimir Krinsky in 1923. In the same year, the Vesnin brothers proposed a project for the Palace of Labor, whose high-rise building was a tower 132 meters high.
The government supported the desires of architects to rebuild the capital of the Soviet Union. In 1940, architect Dmitry Chechulin published a draft of a 24-story public building on the Dorogomilovsky Bend of the Moscow River - the hotel "Ukraine" subsequently appeared at this place. The sketches were published in Issues 11–14 of the magazine Construction of Moscow. All the preparatory work on this project progressed very slowly, and with the start of World War II, work was completely frozen.
High-rise project
On January 13, 1947, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU (b), Joseph Stalin, signed the resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR "On the Construction of High-Rise Buildings in Moscow". Clause 4 stated that a 26-story building with a hotel and residences was to be built on the Leningradskoye Highway near the Dynamo Stadium.
Mordvinov, as a representative of the Committee on Architectural Affairs, examined the project and submitted the construction plan to the government for approval. Construction work was transferred to the Ministry of Construction of Heavy Industry Enterprises. The design of the hotel was entrusted to architects Arkady Mordvinov, Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky and chief designer Pavel Krasilnikov.
In the future, the government decided to transfer the construction to the Dorogomilovskaya settlement, which was built up with barracks and wooden houses. This was due to the desire to create a high-rise which would dominate the intersection of the Moskva River embankment and a promising major highway, Kutuzov Avenue. The designers took into account not only the location of the roads, a pier for the river fleet was also created near the hotel.
Stalinist skyscrapers of the same time were not built in a separate area; they were distributed mainly in the historical center of the capital. New high-rises should serve as architectural dominants of the capital. Church belltowers and domes performed a similar role in pre-revolutionary Moscow. The chief architect of Moscow, Dmitry Chechulin, also took into account that future skyscrapers could “overlap” with each other.
Construction
Like all skyscrapers built in the Stalinist era, the first stone of the hotel was solemnly laid on September 7, 1947, on the day of the 800th anniversary of Moscow, but work did not actually begin until 1953. The construction of high-rise buildings in Moscow was complicated by three circumstances. The first problem was weak Moscow soil (sandy loam), for which reason it was necessary to build strong foundations. The second difficulty was that the Soviet experts, except Oltarzhevsky and a few other architects, did not have the relevant expertise. Finally, the country lacked the necessary technical base.
Considering Stalin's attention to the project, the necessary technologies and mechanisms were developed for high-rise construction from scratch or improved. Especially for Stalin's skyscrapers, an original “box foundation” was developed, which allowed the building to be erected without gigantic reinforced concrete massifs and vertical sedimentary joints. The workers received a concrete pump capable of pumping fresh mortar to a height of 40 meters, UBK tower cranes with a lifting capacity of 15 tons, capable of lifting themselves from floor to floor as the building grows. During the construction of the hotel, these cranes were used in the construction of walls and for the installation of large elements of reinforcement blocks. In addition, with the formwork of the bottom slab of the foundation, the crane pedestals were part of the reinforced concrete structure of the building and subsequently became part of the basement. In Lyubertsy and Kuchin, special factories for the production of reinforced concrete slabs were organized, and the use of a metal frame required the creation of new wall materials: “multi-hole” bricks and hollow ceramic stones. An enterprise was set up in the village of Kudinovo to produce these materials.
Since the hotel was built later than other Stalinist skyscrapers, engineers and ordinary specialists took into account previous experience in order to optimize the workflow. At the construction site, most cargo delivery operations were mechanized from the moment they arrived at the facility until transportation to the workplace.
The building was erected in close proximity to the Moskva River, therefore, additional work was needed to drain the soil around the future foundation. Engineers applied an efficient and relatively inexpensive method. A double-point needle filter installation was created around the pit: a sequence of pipes immersed in wells and connected to the suction manifold. This made it possible to work in absolutely dry soil at minimal cost.
Long before the commissioning of the building, it became known that by order of Nikita Khrushchev, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the hotel would be called “Ukraine” and not “Dorogomilovskaya” (the design name is “Hotel building in Dorogomilov”) as originally intended. The reason was the desire to make a symbolic gesture in the context of the celebration in 1954 of the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Russia and Ukraine
Opening and operation
The grand opening of the hotel on Dorogomilovskaya Embankment took place on May 25, 1957. The Soviet press widely covered this event. In early June, the newspaper “For the cultural trade” noted that in “Ukraine” – the largest hotel in Europe – there are 1,026 rooms. The Kalininsky bridge opened in the same year connected Dorogomilovo with the center of the city and shortened the way to the hotel.
"Ukraine" was considered prestigious and was focused primarily on the placement of foreigners. Immediately after the opening, guests of the VI World Festival of Youth and Students stayed in it. In 1961, the delegates of the World Youth Forum and the students settled in the hotel in the struggle for national independence and liberation.
In 1964, a 10-meter monument to the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko was erected in the square in front of the main facade of the building. Sculptors Mikhail Gritsyuk, Yu. L. Sinkevich, A. S. Fuzhenko and architects A. A. Snitsaryov, Yu. A. Chekanuk worked on the monument.
Architecture and style
In the 1930s, a new architectural style was formed in the Soviet Union, later called the Stalinist Empire style. Its characteristic features were the massiveness of buildings and the abundance of decorative elements, even on residential buildings. The decoration was eclectic: along with the use of classical orders, modern symbols were used, such as images of sickles, five-pointed stars and generalized images of Soviet workers.
According to the richness and character of the architectural composition, this is not only an image of a hotel – it is a monument of the greatness of the Stalin era architect Oltarzhevsky
According to Oltarzhevsky, even the steps that led from the embankment to the river pier were monumental. Most of the building outside is lined with ceramic blocks, the first two floors are limestone, and the basement and the main entrance are granite. Corner towers adorn wheat sheaves and flowerpots stylized as sheaves. The interiors were decorated with paintings by Soviet artists; a total of 1,200 canvases. On the ceiling in the central hall a picturesque ceiling “The Feast of Labor and Harvest in the Hospitable Ukraine” was created.
Taking into account the 73-meter spire the maximum height of the building is 206 meters. "Ukraine" is in terms of U-shaped building. The central building is occupied by the hotel itself, and in the side buildings with variable number of floors from 9 to 11 there are 255 apartments with 2–4-room apartments. In addition, there were two five-room apartments in the building. The tower of the central building has 34 floors. The hotel differed exclusively expensive decoration. Initially, there were rooms of different levels: from a single room of 12 m² to three-room suites, each of which had a living room and two bedrooms with separate bathrooms. In addition to the luxurious interiors, the hallmark of "Ukraine" has become a winter garden with a fountain, arranged on the second floor. In the building of the hotel there was a post office, telegraph, savings bank and several shops – book, flower and theater. Since the opening of the hotel, there was a closed cafe on the upper floors, around which there was an open terrace with a panoramic view of the city. The hotel employed 800 people.
The building had advanced engineering systems. In addition to the ventilation system, there was centralized air conditioning. The air from the street was filtered and moistened, its temperature reached 15 °C. The whole building was equipped with a centralized dust removal system, which was a system of brushes and hoses located in each room and in each apartment. On pipes laid along the building, the dust fell into the vacuum cleaner station installed in the basement. The collected dust was filtered and discharged into the sewage system, and the purified air from the system got into the street. The hotel was additionally equipped with hand-held vacuum cleaners. To ensure the heating of the building in the basement were boilers. Also in the hotel building was a telephone station with 10,000 numbers.
Facilities
The hotel has 505 rooms, 38 apartments, 5 restaurants, a conference centre, executive floor, banquet hall, library, spa & wellness centre with 50m indoor swimming pool, and a fleet of Moskva River yachts.
Art collection
There are also about 1,200 original paintings by the most prominent Russian artists of the first half of the 20th century, and on the first floor the diorama Moscow – Capital of the USSR in 1:75 scale shows the historical centre of Moscow and the city's surroundings from Luzjniki to Zemlyanoi Val in the year 1977, when the artwork was created.
Ownership
The hotel was acquired by billionaire property investor God Nisanov for £59 million during an auction in 2005. They co-owns it with Zarakh Iliev. It closed in 2007 for a complete renovation and restoration.
In 2009, the owners signed a contract with the Rezidor Hotel Group to manage the hotel as the Radisson Royal Hotel, Moscow. The hotel maintains its original name, however, for some purposes. The hotel reopened on April 28, 2010, after its 3-year-renovation. The façade was restored in detail, while modern technology has been added, including multi-level water cleaning systems and air circulation systems. The hotel moved to Radisson's elite Radisson Collection division in January 2019, and was renamed Radisson Collection Hotel, Moscow.

Godfrey Dewey (September 3, 1887 – October 18, 1977) was the president of the Lake Placid Organizing Committee and a winter sports facility designer. They were largely responsible for the successful candidature of Lake Placid for the 1932 Winter Olympics. In addition to their role as the U.S. ski team manager they were chosen as the flag bearer for the 1928 Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Dewey was elected to the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame in 1970.
Godfrey Dewey was the son of Melvil Dewey, the inventor of Dewey Decimal Classification, and their first wife Annie Godfrey. They went on to become the honorary chairperson of the Phonemic Spelling Council. Their work on World English Spelling may have influenced the development of SoundSpel, as they and Edward Rondthaler corresponded from 1971.

Alumni Hall at the University of Pittsburgh is a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark that was formerly known as the Masonic Temple in Pittsburgh. Constructed in 1914-1915, it was designed by renowned architect Benno Janssen of Janssen & Abbot Architects. Other buildings in Pittsburgh's Oakland Cultural District designed by Janssen include the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, Mellon Institute, and Pitt's Eberly Hall (which was known as Alumni Hall prior to 1998).
The building's design is that of a classical temple with a well-defined base, midsection and ornamental terra cotta pediment, topped with a clay tile roof. The structure is steel, clad primarily in limestone with terra cotta details. The rear elevation is brick.
Dimensions
Alumni Hall spans along Fifth Avenue on Pitt's campus and runs deep. It is nine stories high with two-story spaces throughout, has of functional space as well as an additional accommodating entrance, corridors, stairwells, and elevators. There are three main entrances on Fifth, Lytton, and Tennyson Avenues.
Restoration and Renovation
The University of Pittsburgh acquired the former Masonic Temple on December 23, 1993, for $8.5 million ($ in dollars). A two-year, $16 million ($ in dollars) renovation of the structure and its adaptation for use by the University departments began in November 1998 and was completed in February 2000. During the initial design process, a study was performed to evaluate the architectural and historic significance of each major area of the building. As a result, four main lobbies, the ballroom and three main entrances, and portions of several two-story spaces on the third and fifth floors were kept and restored. Special attention was given to restore the Masonic Temple's original historic condition. As such, approximately 95% of the existing historical light fixtures were rewired, retrofitted with energy–efficient lamps, refinished, and rehung in their original locations. Nearly all of the original wood doors, window casings and baseboards were refinished and reinstalled. Five new automatic elevators were installed and original bronze and stainless steel cabs were retrofitted to two of the new elevator platforms. Approximately 100 original bronze door hardware sets were modified to ADA compliance, refinished and reinstalled. One thousand square feet of marble flooring originally from Pennsylvania Hall (the previous home of Pitt's medical school since torn down) was utilized in vestibules, corridors, elevator lobbies and cabs. Marble from the Masonic Temple's original marble restroom stalls was also recycled for use in these areas. The building was decorated and furnished in a color scheme of primarily blues, mauves and burgundy to complement the mahogany woodwork.
Renovations included replacement of the building's electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems and the addition of air conditioning. A wheelchair-accessible entrance was added at Tennyson Avenue and the entire building was brought up to ADA guidelines. Modern emergency fire and electrical systems were added as well as conduits for wiring installations for data and power for 380 of the building's classroom seats.
Uses of Alumni Hall
Originally an event center and meeting facility for area Masons, Alumni Hall now houses Pitt's Alumni Relations offices and Alumni Center, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, the headquarters of the Pitt Pathfinders, a 270-seat Natural Science Lecture Hall, the Office of Governmental Relations, the Institute of Politics, the University Center for Teaching and Learning, and the University of Pittsburgh Katz School of Business's Mellon Financial Corporation Hall that houses the Center for Executive Education.

Synopsis
Ten years ago, 21-year-old Charles MacKenzie, Jr. ("Mack") walked out of their apartment without a word and has never been seen again. They do, however, call their mother annually on Mother's Day to assure them of their health and safety, then hangs up, leaving their frantic questions unanswered. Even their father's death in the 9/11 attacks didn't bring them home or break the pattern of their calls. Now, Carolyn MacKenzie has decided the only way to move on with their own life is to find closure and bring an end to the mystery of their brother's disappearance. This year when Mack makes their regular Mother's Day call, they declare their intention to track them down, no matter what. The following day, Monsignor Devon Mackenzie receives a scrap note reading: Uncle Devon, tell Carolyn they must not look for me. Despite the disapproval and angry reactions of loved ones, Carolyn persists in a search that plunges them into a world of unexpected danger and winding questions.

Chester Koo (; 1952–2001) was a Taiwanese business executive.
Early life and education
Born in 1952, Koo earned a master's degree in business administration at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1979.
Life and career
After their graduation and subsequent return to Taiwan, Koo managed a branch of Chinatrust Bank, and at age 35 was appointed president of the China Life Insurance Company.
Koo later led many other Koos Group (KGI) subsidiaries and was active in the media industry. They were responsible for KGI's 1997 acquisition of Chinese Television Network (CTN).
Koo eventually sold CTN in January 2000, having never turned a profit. In an attempt to increase the market share of (CNS), a cable company owned by KGI, Koo restructured CNS and sought investors to form a media conglomerate, becoming partners with Rupert Murdoch in the process. Though they were credited with helping Koos Group gain a foothold in new industries, many of Koo's investments were also regarded as risky, and multiple ventures lost money. They resigned their position at China Life in December 2001.
As a result, Koo became less involved with Koos Group business ventures, except for Hoshin Gigamedia Center Inc. which they had founded in October 1998. Under their leadership, GigaMedia reached an agreement with Microsoft and began working on a set-top box design suitable for broadband Internet via cable services. In November 1999, Microsoft bought a ten percent stake in GigaMedia. The next year, GigaMedia began work with Yahoo Inc. on building a website which offered multimedia entertainment to GigaMedia customers.
Shortly after leaving China Life, Koo died from gallbladder cancer on 24 December 2001, aged 49. Later, Leslie Koo split Koos Group holdings with cousin Jeffrey Koo. Together, the two returned KGI to profitability.
Personal life
Chester Koo's father Koo Chen-fu and younger brother Leslie Koo were also business people. Chester Koo's only son was Koo Kung-yi.

The Quad Cinema is New York City's first small four-screen multiplex theater. Located at 34 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village, it was opened by entrepreneur Maurice Kanbar, along with their younger brother Elliott S. Kanbar in October 1972. It has been described as "one of the oldest independent cinemas in the city" and "a vibrant center for art house films."
History
In the late 1960s, Maurice Kanbar, an inventor and real estate investor, purchased a six-story loft in Manhattan with plans to create an off-Broadway theater. After those plans fell through, they found themselves with a large block of unused ground floor space. Kanbar believed a movie theater with multiple small auditoriums rather than a few larger ones could be profitable even with smaller audiences at most screenings. In October 1972, they and their younger brother, Elliott S. Kanbar, opened the Quad, New York City's first four-screen movie theater, and what Kanbar has called "the East Coast's first multiplex".
From 1972 to 1988 the theater was operated by Bernard Goldberg, executive vice-president of Golden Theatre Management, operator of the Quad and six other New York City houses. The theater exhibited Hollywood films, independent films, and revivals of older films, but had difficulty obtaining the most attractive releases due to the exclusive licensing practices then followed by film distributors. Legal action led to substantial monetary settlements.
In 1988, Maurice's brother Elliott took over the theater's operations. Facing competition from new theaters opening in Lower Manhattan, the Quad adopted a strategy of exhibiting foreign and independent films. This strategy proved financially successful, although it also led to competition with other downtown art film exhibitors, notably the nonprofit Film Forum and the IFC Center. In a 2010 interview, Elliott Kanbar noted that in its earlier history the theater had benefited from a switch of its distributor relationship to City Cinemas, which had a positive relationship with Walt Disney Pictures and its Touchstone Pictures affiliate, and that it was regularly frequented by Andy Warhol, whose "fans would come in droves" and whose influence was a factor in the theater's "big homosexual audience for certain films." In March 2010, the Quad announced it would assist national and foreign filmmakers wishing to self-distribute low-budget films via "four wall distribution", the Quadflix program. In May 2012, it initiated the program Quadflix Select.
On Thursday, August 21, 2014, The New York Times reported sale of the Quad to Charles S. Cohen's Cohen Media Group as well as planned renovations. The Quad closed for a multi-million dollar alteration in May 2015. It reopened on April 14, 2017 with a Lina Wertmüller retrospective.
After Cohen acquired Landmark Theatres in December 2018, Landmark took over booking for the Quad.

Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Zainatuddin Kamalat Syah (died 1700) was the seventeenth ruler of Aceh Darussalam. They reigned from 1688 to 1699, being the fourth and last ruling queen (sultanah) in succession.
Background
When the old sultana Inayat Zakiatuddin Syah died in October 1688, Sultana Zainatuddin Kamalat Syah succeeded to the throne. There is no contemporary evidence about their relationship to the previous queens. According to a manuscript preserved at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, they were the daughter of Syekh Muhammad Fadlil Syah Teungku di Kedirian, son of Abdullah Fadlil, son of Muhyuddin Fadlil, son of Sultan Sri Alam. This would need further verification. Not all the orang kayas (grandees of the kingdom) supported the choice. Some wanted a king rather than a female ruler. Four orang kayas marched against the capital with considerable forces; however, the opposition soon receded and the queen was acknowledged.
Reign
After almost six decades of female rule there was increasing pressure for a male sultan. A Dutch visitor. Jacob de Roy, reported in 1696 that the sultana formally held unlimited powers and convened the assembly of grandees; however, they had to await the approval of the majority of the counselors. They also wrote that groups of people sometimes gathered in the capital Kutaraja and performed demonstrations in favour of a king. The syahbandar (harbour master) entertained plans to arrange a marriage between the queen and their son, a captain of the guard who stood in high regard with Zainatuddin Kamalat Syah. They asked Jacob de Roy to mediate in the affair since they realized that a marriage would evoke the envy of the orang kayas. Another Dutch writer, Francois Valentijn indicates that the marriage was eventually concluded. In 1699 a purported fatwa arrived from Mecca, issued by the qadi Malik al-Adil. Whether it was genuine or if the authority of Mecca was employed to make an impression is debatable. The fatwa deemed that the rule of a woman was contrary to the principles of Islam. Upon this the sultana was replaced by an Arab of sayyid descent, Badr ul-Alam Syarif Hasyim Jamaluddin. It is sometimes speculated that they became their husband. Zainatuddin died one year later, in 1700.

Statistical fluctuations are fluctuations in quantities derived from many identical random processes. They are fundamental and unavoidable. It can be proved that the relative fluctuations reduce as the square root of the number of identical processes.
Statistical fluctuations are responsible for many results of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, including phenomena such as shot noise in electronics.
Description
When a number of random processes occur, it can be shown that the outcomes fluctuate (vary in time) and that the fluctuations are inversely proportional to the square root of the number of processes.
Examples
As an example that will be familiar to all, if a fair coin is tossed many times and the number of heads and tails counted, the ratio of heads to tails will be very close to 1 (about as many heads as tails); but after only a few throws, outcomes with a significant excess of heads over tails or vice versa are common; if an experiment with a few throws is repeated over and over, the outcomes will fluctuate a lot.
An electric current so small that not many electrons are involved flowing through a p-n junction is susceptible to statistical fluctuations as the actual number of electrons per unit time (the current) will fluctuate; this produces detectable and unavoidable electrical noise known as shot noise.

Since 1942 the United States has maintained air bases in the United Kingdom. Major Commands of the USAF having bases in the United Kingdom were the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Strategic Air Command (SAC), and Air Mobility Command (AMC).
Origins
The origins of the United States Air Force in the UK can be traced to a series of agreements made between 27 January and 27 March 1941 which provided for American naval, ground and air support for campaigns against Nazi Germany. As a result, a special U.S. Army Observer Group was activated in London on 19 May 1941. One of the first tasks of that unit was to reconnoitre areas regarded as potential sites for United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) installations.
On 2 January 1942 the order activating the Eighth Air Force was signed and the headquarters was formed at Savannah, Georgia on 28 January. On 8 January the activation of U.S. Forces in the British Isles (USAFBI) was announced, and VIII Bomber Command (VIII BC) was established in England during February 1942. VIII BC was established at RAF Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF Daws Hill, in High Wycombe, on 22 February.
Postwar period
With the end of World War II, the United States began to demobilize most of the Air Force which it created in the United Kingdom. In Europe, the aim was to maintain a small USAAF organization, exclusively for communication and transport purposes. On 7 August 1945, the word Strategic was removed from USSAFE, and the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) was established. By the end of 1946, USAFE had only about 75,000 personnel and fewer than 2,000 aircraft.
All B-29 operations in England were placed under the command of USAFE's 3d Air Force, established at RAF Marham. At the close of World War II, most of the air bases used by the USAAF were returned to the British government and were in various states of repair by 1948. The Ministry of Defence made available Marham, RAF Scampton, RAF Waddington and RAF Lakenheath for B-29 operations. RAF Lakenheath was refurbished with an extended runway to accommodate the giant Convair B-36, however the B-36s were maintained at Carswell Air Force Base in Texas for the time being.
SAC continued rotational deployments of its strategic bomber force, keeping a strategic bomber force in Europe for almost 20 years until 1966, when the Boeing B-47 Stratojet was phased out of SAC's inventory with the UK bases being returned to the British or converted into USAFE tactical bases.
Modernization and arrivals from France
By the early 1960s, the USAF in England had a very mixed collection of aircraft. RF-101s, various versions of the B-66 and B-57, and F-84s and F-86s comprised USAFE's tactical aircraft arsenal. This large number of different aircraft was a maintenance and logistics nightmare because all the different parts for all the different aircraft had to be kept in stock. Indeed, this issue was not confined to the UK or just USAFE. There was a need for standardization and also to modernize for an aircraft which could perform many different tasks from air defense to ground support and aerial reconnaissance. The McDonnell F-4 Phantom II was that aircraft.
On 12 May 1965 the first F-4 Phantom arrived in the UK, with an RF-4C arriving at RAF Alconbury to replace the 10th TRW's RB-66s. In October, the F-101C "Voodoos" at Bentwaters/Woodbridge were also replaced by F-4Cs, as well as the F-100s at RAF Lakenheath.
The F-4 Phantoms remained in the UK for the next 20 years, being replaced by the next generation of F-15/F-16s in the mid-1980s.
On 21 February 1966, French President Charles de Gaulle announced that France would loosen its ties to NATO. They announced that French forces were no longer available to the Allies, and all foreign army and air force units, as well as NATO Headquarters must be removed from France by 1 April 1967.
Losing the French bases was a blow to USAFE. At the time it comprised eleven tactical units plus four interceptor squadrons. A large-scale relocation plan, Operation FRELOC was developed to remove all USAF aircraft and equipment, as well as 33,000 USAFE personnel and their families from France.
As a result of FRELOC, USAFE's presence in England grew considerably. Three fighter wings, the 20th TFW at RAF Wethersfield, the 48th TFW at RAF Lakenheath and the 81st TFW at RAF Bentwaters came under 3d Air Force. Between these three wings were about 225 aircraft, mainly F-100 Super Sabre and F-4 Phantom IIs. USAFE in England also included two Tactical Reconnaissance Wings, the 10th at RAF Alconbury and the 66th at RAF Upper Heyford with between them about 100 RF-101s and RF-4Cs, along with the 513th Troop Carrier Wing at RAF Mildenhall.
Also, RAF Burtonwood, which was operating as a reserve USAFE base since the opening of Châteauroux-Déols Air Base in the early 1950s was turned over to the US Army in 1966 and was renamed Burtonwood Army Depot. The Army transferred all of its stores and equipment in France to Burtonwood and operated the facility as its primary storage and logistics depot for 7th Army support in Europe until the mid-1990s.
In the 1970s, the General Dynamics F-111 arrived at Upper Heyford. In 1978 the first of about 120 A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft arrived at RAF Bentwaters/Woodbrige. Originally six squadrons were assigned to the 81st TFW, however later two squadrons were moved to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Alconbury. Close Air Support missions made the A-10 vulnerable to ground fire, so most of the underside of the aircraft is made of armoured titanium. To stay out of reach of hostile radar, many of the A-10's missions were flown at nearly ground level. The A-10s in the UK were painted in a special camouflage scheme designed for European weather conditions, made from a special type of paint that can absorb 60% of the sun's rays. Because different densities of paint were used, its colors tended to change in different light conditions.
Air Transport and Special Operations
Although most USAF bases in the UK had combat missions, in 1966, the Military Air Transport Service established a permanent facility at RAF Mildenhall after the phaseout of the SAC Reflex mission. The 313th Tactical Airlift Wing operates Lockheed C-5 Galaxy and C-141 Starlifter flights to and from the UK from bases worldwide. The group also operates Lockheed C-130 Hercules flights within USAFE from temporary duty (TDY) units on a rotational basis from the Continental United States.
In addition to the logistics mission, the 513th MAW was responsible for operations of four Boeing EC-135H Flying Command Posts of the 10th Airborne Command and Control Squadron, which would have been responsible for U.S. European Command command and control ("Operation Silk Purse") in the event of a war with the Soviet Union. In addition, for many years, variants of Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft were observed regularly at Mildenhall. Most of those aircraft came from the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Offut AFB, Nebraska. Those aircraft were used to fly ELINT and COMINT missions along the borders of Poland, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, monitoring and recording military communications.
Mildenhall also hosted Lockheed SR-71 Blackbirds from Detachment 4, 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale AFB, California. Besides photo reconnaissance flights, the SR-71s at Mildenhall were involved in ELINT missions that were carried out within the framework of the SALT I Agreement of 1972. Under this agreement, the U.S. and Soviet Union reached agreement on a partial freeze on the number of nuclear weapons and these flights were to verify that the Soviets were adhering to the agreement.
Telemetry gathering missions were also flown by the SR-71s to record data from Soviet rocket systems. Electronic gathering flights were primarily aimed at gathering signals from the Soviet missile center at Plesetsk. This information, along with information being gathered from spy satellites, enabled the Defense Intelligence Agency to assemble a good picture of Soviet activities. SR-71s at Mildenhall also played a key role in the 1986 Operation El Dorado Canyon involving American retaliatory action in Libya. The day after the attack, SR-71s made several unmolested flights over the bombed military targets around Tripoli and Benghazi.
Post Cold War drawdown
With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the need for large numbers of USAF forces in the UK no longer existed and plans were made for significant cuts.
The bases at Bentwaters, Woodbridge, Chicksands, Greenham Common, Sculthorpe, Wethersfield and Upper Heyford were closed by the end of 1993. Alconbury's flightline was closed and its base support functions were taken over by RAF Molesworth.
In January 2015 the US Department of Defense announced through their European Infrastructure Consolidation programme that they would be withdrawing from RAF Mildenhall, and activities at RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth would be moved to RAF Croughton. In 2020 it was announced that Mildenhall would remain open.
The USAF also maintains a communications station at RAF Croughton, and at RAF Menwith Hill is a National Security Agency electronic intelligence gathering installation.

Edin-Ådahl were a Swedish CCM band from 1977 to 1994, composed of brothers Bertil and Lasse Edin and Simon and Frank Ådahl. The group is best known for their 1990 hit "Som en vind" (). It won the 1990 Melodifestivalen and went on to place sixteenth at the Eurovision Song Contest. The following year, the band placed second in the Melodifestivalen. Simon Ådahl participated in 1995 together with Lasse Edin. Another song, "Revival", rose to No. 3 on Sweden's radio charts.
Their English albums had similar production quality when compared to secular albums, but also poor distribution and "lousy lyrics".
Frank Ådahl was the voice of Simba in the Swedish version of the 1994 animated film The Lion King. Two of the brothers released solo albums on Refuge in 1985. Bertil Edin released Cross the Border, and Simon Ådahl I'm In Touch. Lasse Edin formed a band called The Outsiders in 1990.

Federica Faiella (born 1 February 1981) is an Italian former competitive ice dancer. With partner Massimo Scali, they are the 2010 World bronze medalist, a two-time (2009–2010) European silver medalist, and six-time (2003–2005, 2007–2009) Italian national champion. They also won eleven Grand Prix medals.
Career
Early career
Faiella began skating at the age of ten. They competed with Luciano Milo, with whom they were the Junior Grand Prix Final champion in the 1997–1998 season. They and Scali trained at the same rink under the same coach. After Milo quit skating, they briefly partnered with a French skater.
Partnership with Scali
Faiella teamed up with Massimo Scali in 2001. Despite skating together for only a brief period of time, Faiella/Scali were able to qualify for the 2002 Winter Olympics, where they finished 18th.
In their second season of competition together, Faiella/Scali won Italian nationals for the first time, and placed in the top ten at the European Championships. A year later, they moved into the top ten at Worlds. In the years leading up to the 2006 Winter Olympics, they continued to make steady progress up the ranks. Prior to the 2005–06 Olympic season, Barbara Fusar-Poli / Maurizio Margaglio, who won bronze for Italy at the 2002 Games, returned to the eligible ranks. Faiella/Scali became the second Italian team, and finished outside the top ten at the Olympics after a fall in the original dance.
Following the season, they made a coaching change and relocated to the United States to work with Pasquale Camerlengo and Anjelika Krylova at the Detroit Skating Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. They had an up and down season in 2006–07 but enjoyed good results in 2007–08, including a fourth place at the Europeans and a fifth-place finish at Worlds.
In the 2008–09 season, Faiella/Scali finished second at the Trophee Eric Bompard and won their first Grand Prix event, the 2008 NHK Trophy. This qualified them for their first Grand Prix final, where they finished fourth. They won their first European medal, a silver, behind Russians Jana Khokhlova / Sergei Novitski. At the 2009 World Championships, a fall in the original dance ended their hopes of medal contention, and they finished eighth.
In the 2009–10 Olympic season, Faiella/Scali began their season with a bronze medal at the 2009 Cup of China. They withdrew from their next Grand Prix event due to Faiella's illness. At the 2010 Europeans, they won both the original dance and the free dance on their way to their second European silver medal. They finished fifth at the Olympics. Faiella became ill after the Olympics and returned to the ice only four days before the World Championships. The duo won their first world medal, a bronze, in Turin.
At the 2010 World Championships, Faiella/Scali announced that they would return for another season. Their assigned Grand Prix events were the Cup of China and the Cup of Russia. Visa problems delayed their training in the U.S. and Faiella had recurring back problems. They again finished third at the 2010 Cup of China after Scali tripped on Faiella's skirts in both programs. They withdrew from the 2010 Cup of Russia prior to the free dance due to Scali's back injury. At the 2011 European Championships, they placed ninth in the short dance but moved up to fifth after the free dance. This was their final competitive event.
On March 15, 2011, Scali announced on the team's website that they were retiring from competitive skating and that they would work with coach and choreographer Pasquale Camerlengo's team at the Detroit Skating Club. However, in May 2011, after it became clear that Faiella's healing process was progressing better than expected, they announced through their official website that they would in fact continue to skate competitively. The comeback attempt ended after Faiella injured them back, and in 2012 Scali confirmed that they would not return to competitive skating.
Personal life
In 2011, Faiella began working as a police officer in Italy.

"If I Die Young" is a song written by Kimberly Perry, and recorded by American country music trio the Band Perry. It was released on June 8, 2010, as the second single from the group's self-titled debut album.
Content
"If I Die Young" is a mid-tempo tune accompanied by acoustic guitar, banjo, accordion, mandolin, fiddle, electric bass, and drums. It is in the key of E Major. The song is about the sadness of dying young ("The sharp knife of a short life") as the narrator describes how they never really got to experience love and worrying about how their loved ones will miss them and deal with the loss. They recognize that once someone passes away, others seem to pay more attention to that person's life: "And maybe then you'll hear the words I have been singin' / Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'." They state that if they die young, then their family left behind should "save their tears" for a time when "they're really gonna need them." They state that they have had a well-lived life in the line "Well, I've had just enough time."
Reception
The Band Perry received at least one letter in response to the song. In its envelope, the members also found a necklace with a ring on it. The letter's author was a young girl who had recently lost their best friend to cancer. Mourning their friend's death, the girl was contemplating suicide. Driving from work one day, they heard "If I Die Young" on the radio. Hearing "so much life in the song", the girl changed their mind. In their letter to The Band Perry, they wrote about the necklace: "I'm sending this to you, because it's the most important thing I own. This song literally saved my life."
Critical
Bobby Peacock of Roughstock spoke positively of the lyrics, saying that they were "very well-developed with interesting little details." They felt that, although the topic is "a little sugarcoated", the vocal performance is a "pleasant listening experience".
Commercial
"If I Die Young" debuted at number 57 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of May 29, 2010. It also debuted at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of July 24, 2010. In October 2010, it became the group's first top 10 single on the Hot Country Songs chart as well as their first top 20 on the Hot 100 chart. The song became their first number one hit on the Hot Country Songs chart for the week of December 11, 2010.
In early 2011, the song was remixed by Matt Ward and Dean Gillard for pop radio. The remix debuted at number 36 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Songs chart and number 29 on the U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary chart for the week of June 11, 2011. With the remix impacting pop radio, the song re-entered the Hot 100 chart at number 46 for the week of June 25, 2011. It has since reached a new peak of number 14.
In May 2011, the song sold over 2 million copies, the eleventh country music song to do so, and only the fourth time that a band reached this plateau, following Lady A, Zac Brown Band and Rascal Flatts. At the time, "If I Die Young" song was the highest-selling single to miss the top ten, and as of August 24, 2015, "If I Die Young" surpassed 5 million downloads.
In July 2011, the song reached the top 15 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in its thirty-fifth chart week, making it the slowest climb into the top 15. It broke the slowest climb record that was previously held by Carrie Underwood's "Before They Cheat", and Taylor Swift's "Teardrops on My Guitar". Both songs took thirty-three weeks to reach the top 15. The song spent 53 weeks on Billboard Hot 100 chart and is their best-selling single to date. It is also the only song with 53 or more weeks that ended its chart run in 2011.
Music video
The music video, which was directed by David McClister, premiered on CMT on May 27, 2010. In the video, the band is shown setting Kimberly Perry in a canoe before pushing it off into the river. Perry is holding a book containing poems by Tennyson, including The Lady of Shalott, which the book is opened to at the end of the music video. The video echoes a scene in Anne of Green Gables in which Anne attempts to appear as the Lady of the poem. Kimberly's mother and their love interest (played by Kyle Kupecky) are shown plucking flower petals and visibly depressed that they have left them. Eventually, their canoe begins to take on water, they sit up. Once this occurs their brothers come back for them When they get back to their house, their mother and love interest embrace them The video was filmed on location at Two Rivers Mansion outside of Nashville, Tennessee. Throughout the video, the band is also shown performing with their instruments inside of the house.

Glee version
In 2013, Naya Rivera performed the song as their character Santana Lopez in tribute episode "The Quarterback", during the fifth season of the Fox comedy-drama series Glee, in honor of co-star and close friend Cory Monteith, who died on July 13, 2013. Monteith played Finn Hudson on the show, with their character also dying.
In a scene in the episode, Santana talks about Finn before beginning an acoustic cover of the song, but they break down in tears of sadness and grief over Finn before they can finish and runs away when friends try to console them Speaking about the usage before the episode was broadcast, Kimberly Perry said: "I'm so excited that song is being used that way because even though it has 'die' in the title, it was really inspired by and about celebrating life [...] I obviously haven't seen the episode that's a tribute to Cory, but I feel like they're going to focus on their life rather than their death, so I'm really excited that 'If I Die Young' is going to be part of honoring him". Jeff Jensen for Entertainment Weekly confirmed that the episode focused on life, not death, and described Rivera's performance of the song as "the number of the night" and that it "was memorable for how they broke down halfway through it, then unleashed a furious howl".
The cover was released as a single as well as being a track on the album Glee: The Quarterback. The album debuted at number 7 on the Billboard 200, selling 47,000 copies and also charted as number one on the Billboard Soundtracks. The song was the last Glee single to chart during the show's run, doing so in the UK and Ireland.
Following Rivera's disappearance and death in July 2020, which was confirmed on July 13, 2020, the 7-year anniversary of Monteith's death, the song saw a surge of views on YouTube and became a trending topic on Twitter; some fans thought this was an insensitive reaction however, and that other songs performed by Rivera would be better to promote.
Cady Groves cover
In February 2012, American pop-country singer Cady Groves uploaded a live cover of the song to SoundCloud. Prophetically, Groves would die in 2020 at the age of 30 from complications caused by alcohol abuse.
