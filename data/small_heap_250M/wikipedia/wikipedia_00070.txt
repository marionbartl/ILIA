Smacoviridae is a family of single-stranded DNA viruses. The genomes of this family are small (2.3–2.8 kilobases in length). The name Smacoviridae stands for 'small circular genome virus'. The genomes are circular single-stranded DNA and encode rolling-circle replication initiation proteins (Rep) and unique capsid proteins. As of 2021, 12 genera and 84 species are recognized in this family. The viruses in this taxon were isolated from faecal samples from insects and vertebrates by metagenomic methods. Little is known about their biology.
Taxonomy
The family Smacoviridae is the sole member of the order Cremevirales and together with other families of CRESS DNA viruses is included within the phylum Cressdnaviricota.
The family currently includes the following genera:
Babosmacovirus
Bonzesmacovirus
Bostasmacovirus
Bovismacovirus
Cosmacovirus
Dragsmacovirus
Drosmacovirus
Felismacovirus
Huchismacovirus
Inpeasmacovirus
Porprismacovirus
Simismacovirus
Biology
These viruses have single stranded genomes of 2.3–2.8 kilobases in length. The genome encodes two proteins, a Rep (replicator) and a CP (capsid) protein.

HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou were motor launches of the Royal Navy. After undergoing an unusual journey from Britain to Lake Tanganyika in the interior of Africa, the ships played an important role in the African naval struggle between Britain and Germany during World War I. The names mean Meow and Fido in Parisian slang. They had originally been named Dog and Cat by their erstwhile commander, Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, only to have the names rejected by an apparently scandalized Admiralty.
Journey to Tanganyika
The ships eventually named the Mimi and Toutou were being built at the Thornycroft Yards on the Thames at the beginning of the war. Originally commissioned for the Greek Air Force, the ships were requisitioned by the Admiralty to meet the needs of a scheme to create an African inland navy. Both Mimi and her sister ship HMS Toutou had a length of and could travel at up to by virtue of two petrol engines attached to twin screws. This would make the ships the fastest on Lake Tanganyika when they eventually arrived. The British armed them with a 3-pounder in the fore and a Maxim gun aft. Although it was discovered that the frames of the boats could not endure the 3-pounder's recoil when not fired straight ahead, it was hoped that the boat's impressive manoeuvrability would offset this limitation.
The launches underwent trials on 8 June 1915, and by the middle of the month were packed aboard a liner destined for Cape Town, South Africa. The vessels were the nucleus of an expedition whose goal was to achieve naval superiority in the strategically important Lake Tanganyika. The expedition's leader was the colourful naval officer Spicer-Simson. At the beginning of July they arrived in South Africa, where the ships were loaded onto a train bound for Elisabethville in the Belgian Congo, and finally the village of Fungurume, where the line ended. By 6 August, the ships and equipment were offloaded and the expedition prepared to drive into the bush.
It took nearly a month and a half to travel the 100 or more miles from Fungurume to Sankisia, the railhead for a narrow-gauge railway. The terrain in between was mountainous and broken, requiring the construction of 150 bridges over various streams and gorges. The movement was accomplished by the brute force of two steam tractors, dozens of oxen, and hundreds of Africans employed for the expedition. At some points, even this was not enough, and complex winching systems were developed to lever the ships over the more formidable inclines. Even after the railroad was reached, the difficulties continued, as there were still some 500 miles to go. Streams which Spicer-Simson had depended on for navigation turned out to be nearly dry: the ships had to be raised on barrel rafts to float, and even then they had to be portaged dozens of times. Finally, however, the wearied expedition arrived at Lake Tanganyika on 26 October.
Naval career
Mimi and Toutou were finally launched around the end of December, and by 26 December they experienced their first action. The German ship Kingani was sighted, and the allied "fleet" gave chase. In the lead of the formation was Mimi, commanded by Spicer-Simson. After evading the initial German fire, Mimi and Toutou opened fire at noon, eventually puncturing Kinganis hull below the waterline. With water coming in and the commander dead, the German ship struck her colours. Mimi struck her while preparing to board, and the damage caused threatened to sink her; she managed to run aground just before foundering. Kingani limped to port under escort, and once repaired, was renamed and added to the British force.
The British got their second opportunity on 9 February 1916. This time the German opponent was the warship . Fifi, now Spicer-Simson's flagship, and Mimi, commanded by a Sub-Lieutenant A E Wainwright, gave chase. Fifi and Hedwig von Wissmann were evenly matched for speed, and due to unusual optical effects on the lake, Fifis rounds kept going wide of the mark. Ignoring orders to stay behind, Wainwright took advantage of Mimis speed and zoomed ahead to harass the rear of the German ship. In order to fight back, Hedwig von Wissmann would have to turn around to bring her main guns to bear; when this happened Mimi would dodge away and Fifi could close her range. Eventually, Fifi scored a direct hit and Hedwig von Wissmann sank. For this action, Wainwright was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.
Although there were still German vessels on the lake (most notably Graf von Götzen, armed with a formidable gun from the cruiser ), Spicer-Simson retreated to a cautious strategy, constraining himself to ineffectual support of the land campaign. Mimi would not be involved in further dramatic lake battles. She was apparently taken out and scuttled in the 1920s.

Wayne County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,497, making it the sixth-least populous county in Iowa. The county seat is Corydon.
History
Wayne County was formed in 1846 but was still attached to other counties for governmental purposes. It was named after General Anthony Wayne.
Its southern border with Missouri was uncertain until the states got a decision from the US Supreme Court in 1848 which held the 1816 Sullivan line (re-marked in 1850), originally run as the northern boundary of an Osage Indian cession. This line is not a true east–west line so the county does not have an exactly rectangular shape.
There had been settlement in this county as early as 1841 by persons thinking they were in Missouri, but the first settlers intending to be in Iowa came about 1848. Its government was organized and the county seat selected in 1851.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

Capys is a genus of butterflies in the family Lycaenidae. The species of this genus are found in the Afrotropical realm.
Conservation of the name
In 1819, Jacob Hübner published the generic name Scoptes, including three species but without designating a type. The generic name was more or less forgotten afterwards. In 1966, Norman Denbigh Riley, for practical reasons, selected Papilio alphaeus Cramer, 1777, as the type species of Scoptes, by which Scoptes became an objective synonym of Capys, and started a case to suppress the name Scoptes for purposes of priority. In 1986, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name Scoptes (for the principle of priority not principle of homonymy) in order to conserve the name Capys Hewitson.

Arthur Emmanuel Bandara Kiriella (1914 -25 February 1986) was a Ceylonese politician.
Kiriella ran as one of the two United National Party candidates at the 1st parliamentary election, held between 23 August 1947 and 20 September 1947, for the Kiriella electorate. He was unsuccessful, finishing behind the Lanka Sama Samaja Party candidate, Florence Senanayake, who secured 35.5% of the total vote, and the other United National Party candidate, T. K. W. Chandrasekera, who secured 21% of the total vote, with Kiriella only receiving 16% of the total vote.
At the 2nd parliamentary election, held between 24 May 1952 and 30 May 1952, Kiriella ran as the sole United National Party candidate and won the seat, with 9,978 votes (48% of the total vote) defeating both the sitting member and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party candidate, Jayaweera Kuruppu. Kiriella was unable however to retain the seat at the 3rd parliamentary election, held between 5 April 1956 and 10 April 1956, losing to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party candidate, Kusumasiri Gunawardena, who obtained 16,272 votes (68% of the total vote) to Kiriella's 6,309 votes (26.5% of the total vote).
Kiriella re-contested the seat again at the 4th parliamentary election, held on 19 March 1960, where he won by 1,546 votes over the Lanka Sama Samaja Party candidate, P. B. Wijesundara, securing 33% of the total vote. However, as neither of the major political parties managed to obtain a sufficient majority in the election a new election was called. At the subsequent July 1960 election he was defeated by P. B. Wijesundara, who received 10,708 votes (54% of the total vote) as opposed to Kiriella's 8,230 votes (41% of the total vote).
Kiriella ran again as the United National Party candidate at the 6th parliamentary election, held on 22 March 1965, but was unsuccessful with the sitting member, Wijesundara, retaining his seat. He resigned from the United National Party and ran as an independent at the 7th parliamentary election, held on 27 May 1970, finishing a distant third, polling only 300 votes.
He was one of the first homeopathic practitioners registered under the 1970 Homeopathy Act. Kiriella died on 25 February 1986.

Parcani (; , Parkani; , Parkany; , Parkany) is a large commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, a de facto independent entity within the internationally recognized borders of Moldova. The village has a population of around 10,500, of whom 95% are ethnic Bulgarians (Bessarabian Bulgarians). The first Bulgarian colonists arrived in the village in the early 19th century. According to some sources, it is the largest Bulgarian-majority village outside the borders of Bulgaria. A monument to Bulgarian national hero Vasil Levski was unveiled in Parcani in September 2008.
The village lies between Tiraspol and Bender; it is serviced by the trolleybus line between the two cities.
Reports of an attack on a military unit of the Armed Forces of Transnistria near Parcani appeared on 25 April 2022. It was later clarified that these reports referred to an attack that had occurred on that day on the Tiraspol Airport. This incident was part of a series of attacks of unknown authorship that occurred in Transnistria in that year during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which may have been a false flag operation by Russia or Transnistria itself.

La Maigrauge Abbey or Magerau Abbey (; ) is a monastery of Cistercian nuns located in Fribourg, Switzerland, and founded in 1255. The abbey is situated on the Sarine River and lies on the border between French-speaking and German-speaking Switzerland. The community is bilingual.
History
Origins
In the mid-1250s, a small group of women came together in the region of Fribourg to follow a life of prayer under the guidance of the Rule of St. Benedict. They seem to have been neither Beguines nor aristocrats, as so many foundresses of women's monasteries were. Their names have not even been preserved. They were given permission to live as a religious community by the pastor of Taval, in a document dated 3 July 1255, which they consider their date of foundation. The community, was allowed to live at the far western end of the parish, in a location called Richenza, an isolated, inhospitable terrain, surrounded by mountains.
Four years later, the little monastic community was given the lands they occupied, now called Auge maigre (), by the local lord, Count Hartmann V of Kyburg. In 1261, the community was admitted to the Cistercian Order, only ten years after the Pope had acceded to the demands of the monks of the Order that no new foundations of Cistercians nuns were to be allowed. They were established as a dependency of the nearby men's Abbey of Hauterive, a relationship which continues into the 21st century.
The monastery was the first for nuns in Fribourg and remained the only one until the 17th century. The archives show that the nuns took in young girls for education, this, combined with gifts from incoming novices, allowed the monastery's holdings to expand slowly. Still, there were periods of poverty, when many applicants were accepted who arrived without being able to make donations to the monastery. Nonetheless, the abbey continued to thrive.
Reformation era
This growth slowed and a period of decline began for the abbey in the 15th century. The decline grew worse when the Protestant Reformation took hold in Switzerland during the 16th century. The community held on, though diminished in numbers, resisting a proposed closure, which the authorities were urging for financial reasons. Finally, in 1602, the community began to seek to re-establish a strict observance of the Benedictine Rule. This ran counter to the level of observance among monastic communities of the day. Even the Abbey of Citeaux, the motherhouse of the whole Order, had abandoned practices considered to be essential to monastic life, as envisioned in the Rule.
This new spirit led to a period of fifty years of flowering for the community under the leadership of two great abbesses. The first, Anne Techtermann (1607-1654), was a leader of the reform movement, and, at the same time, oversaw a significant renovation and expansion of the abbey buildings and walls. In 1625, she led the 25 members of the abbey in signing a document committing themselves to the practice of perpetual abstinence, which was symbolic of a strict observance. She was succeeded briefly as abbess by a woman of deep spiritual gifts, Anne Elisabeth Gottrau (1654-1657), who died of breast cancer but whose holiness is still remembered in the community.
Unfortunately, on the evening of 17 November 1660, a nun left a burning candle in her cell, while the community was in the church for Compline. The bulk of the abbey was still built of wood. As a result, the entire dormitory and most other parts of the abbey were burnt to the ground. Only the church, the infirmary and the Abbess' quarters were built of stone, and thus spared destruction. The nuns had to rebuild the majority of the abbey complex.
Revolution and Civil War
As the 18th century began, there was a slow breakdown in monastic discipline. Regular canonical visitations by other members of the Cistercian Order, as required by Church law, became infrequent or ceased all together. Once again, a lack of revenues prompted Church authorities to urge the closing of the abbey, this time for a merger with another monastery, that of the Abbaye de la Fille-Dieu, another Cistercian monastery of nuns in Romont in the same canton of Fribourg. The community was able to endure, even through the occupation of Fribourg by the French Revolutionary Army. The abbey was saved, only to face the consequences of the Swiss civil war (November 1847), which brought to an end the independence of the Swiss cantons, to be replaced by the federal system still in place. The war had been waged along religious lines, with the predominantly Catholic cantons in the South being the losers to the predominantly Protestant cantons.
The repercussions came quickly. The Abbey of Hauterive, upon which La Maigrauge depended spiritually, was suppressed in 1848. The following year, Abbess Marie-Bernardine Castella (1838-1849) was required to hand over the goods and archives of the Abbey to the cantonal officials, and had to agree to cease taking candidates to the community. Little surprise that she died the following year.
Life today
With time, the anti-Catholic measures were relaxed, and the nuns were able to start receiving candidates again. The Abbey of Hauterive was re-occupied in 1939 by Cistercian nuns from Austria. Today, the community numbers about a dozen nuns. They are currently led by Abbess Gertrude Schaller, O.Cist.
Besides running a bakery for communion wafers and a guesthouse to support themselves, the nuns also maintain a biogarden and a liqueur shop, which sells the abbey's cordial, made from the herbs grown in that same garden, and which is known as Grüneswasser or l'eau vert ("green water").

"Weihnachtsmann vom Dach" (Santa Claus from the roof) is a Christmas song by Die Toten Hosen, released as Die Roten Rosen. It's the first single and the sixth track from the Christmas album Wir warten auf's Christkind....
The song is sung from the perspective of somebody, who has Santa hiding from Christmas in his house and is depressed. On a card he has written "Merry Christmas" and that he hopes everyone's happy and apologises for the escape. For the second verse, he has hanged himself. In his diary is the same message, as there was on the card.
Music video
The music video was directed by Ralf Schmerberg.
The music video depicts a girl hanging a figurine Santa in her home, as she notices a midget in a Santa costume stealing her presents. She starts chasing him as he notices the Santa doll and is devastated. Then, a life-sized version of a similar Santa is shown hanging in a similar room as the self-made dollhouse had. He is surrounded by others like him, who then visit the girl (probably to seek revenge). The man, who tried to steal the girl's presents then saves her by somehow turning them small, like the figurine, and escaping to a tunnel on a railroad maquette as the lifesize figurine Santas search the house. The Santa-like people leave and the two hug. The next scene shows them ice-skating on the maquette with a man with a similar hat that the Santa-like people were wearing.

The Beretta PMX is a 9 x 19 mm Parabellum caliber submachine gun, designed and manufactured by the Italian company Beretta. The PMX was presented in 2017 and is intended to replace the Beretta M12 as an ordinance weapon of some law enforcement in Italy.
Development
The Beretta PMX was developed starting from the previous M12 model, already supplied to many police forces and armed forces around the world; starting from 2015–2016 there were many rumours about the release of the new submachine gun model that was then presented by Beretta during the "Milipol" exhibition in Paris in 2017.
Since 2018, Italy's Carabinieri has ordered, after experimentation in some operational departments, more than 5,000 PMXs with the future intention of modernizing the entire individual weapons arsenal.
Design details
The Beretta PMX is a closed bolt and blowback operated submachine gun made by engineering plastic and aluminum. Its total empty weight is 2.4 kg and it is 640 mm long with extended folding stock (418 mm with folded stock). It is fed with a 30-round magazine, chambered in 9 x 19 mm Parabellum NATO caliber, shooting 900 rounds/min rate of fire. It has an ambidextrous three-position manual safety with selective fire (semi-automatic and full auto), adjustable folding sights and "MIL-STD 1913" picatinny rails that allow to use various accessories as aiming devices of any type.

Holy Family is a 1595 oil on canvas painting by El Greco, painted during his time in Toledo and now in the Hospital de Tavera in that city.
The work is very similar to those painted by the same artist during his stay in Rome. The artist frequently returned to the theme of the Holy Family. Though this work has similarities to his work on the same subject now in the Museum of Santa Cruz, he has omitted the infant John the Baptist, painted the Virgin as a nursing Madonna and altered the pose of St Joseph and the position of St Anne.

The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack to the 2019 film of the same name, which is the sequel to the 2014 film The Lego Movie, the fourth instalment overall in the franchise and the last film in the franchise to be produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. and Warner Animation Group. The album featured 10 songs performed by various artists, including few tracks performed by the cast members. The songs were written by Shawn Patterson, Christopher Miller and Jon Lajoie, along with prominent songwriters.
Two songs – "Catchy Song" performed by Dillon Francis, T-Pain and Alaya High That Girl Lay Lay, and "Super Cool" by Beck, Robyn and The Lonely Island were released as singles, and the album was released on February 7, 2019. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (Original Motion Picture Score), featured original score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, who scored for the predecessor and was released on the same day, along with its soundtrack. Both the albums were distributed by WaterTower Music.
Development
After the success of "Everything Is Awesome" created for the first film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller wanted a similar song for the sequel. The duo asked songwriter Jon Lajoie (the primary artist) to write a track that would elicit mixed feelings. According to Lajoie, he described the track as "49 percent annoying and 51 percent fun to listen to” which eventually became "Catchy Song". The track principally featured as its only lyric the repeated phrase "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head", after Lajoie initially sang the phrase in his bathroom while brainstorming about the song lyrics. He initially wrote an annoying version of the track, as he wanted it as "a song that is supposed to drive insane, something that sort of feels creepy and brainwashy" but after watching the film, he changed it to a more enjoyable version of the track.
"Catchy Song" was recorded with several artists and Lajoie had wrote 20 different verses of the song, but the producers were not satisfied with the demos. Later, music producer Dillon Francis, whom Lajoie closely associated with, had agreed to perform the track. In addition, T-Pain and Alaya High, under her stage name That Girl Lay Lay, had crooned the version's choral portions. Since, the director Mike Mitchell and Lajoie, initially intended the song would attain popularity among kids, and felt that the repeated verses might irritate parents, they comically apologised to the parents' after the song release. Lajoie found that "Everything is Awesome" was "annoyingly catchy", and the only way that they could outdo that was "Dial the 'annoying' up to 11!".
Lajoie initially had planned for a track "All Is Amazing" which he had recorded earlier, but could not use it in the album. He found the track, similar to "Everything Is Awesome" except for the lyrics and melody being tweaked a bit. While, he initially found the song "funny" in parts, he felt it "as not funny" being heard in full, which prompted him to omit the track from the album. Another song he planned to write, but later omitted was "It's Hard to Follow Up a Hit Song". The Tween Dream remixed version of "Everything Is Awesome" (from the first film) was featured in the soundtrack with Eban Schletter performing the track with Garfunkel and Oates. A parodic spin-off of the track titled "Everything's Not Awesome" is performed by the film's cast and featured additional lyrics by Shawn Patterson and Lajoie.
Track listing
Reception
Critical response to the film's soundtrack was positive, with Brick Fanatics wrote "the film has an original soundtrack that is a pleasant surprise, definitely worthy of sitting alongside the best animated soundtracks that other, more established animation studios have to offer." The score, however received mixed response. Zanobard reviews gave 3/10 to the score stating that "the score is all over the place. Due to its complete and utter lack of any thematic material, it has no real cohesive narrative and so ends up being just a loose and at points bizarre mess of different musical genres. The music constantly jumps from one area to another, usually spanning several massively different areas of music just in one track. Not only does this make the score very confusing to try and follow, but it also ends up being a particularly unenjoyable album experience as well. The music frequently starts and stops and speeds up and slows down and changes instruments and shifts styles – and after a while you just don't want to listen to it anymore. It's too much like hard work."
Filmtracks.com criticised Mothersbaugh's score and stated "A few new ideas from Mothersbaugh for The Lego Movie 2 do begin to emerge in the final ten minutes, but the score by then has exhausted you with nonsensically unique personality in each of its haphazard orchestral and synthetic romps [...] The layers of post-production electronics aren't terrible, but they serve little purpose when paired with the aimless orchestral recordings. Ultimately, the loss of the themes from the first film's score and the lack of clear interpolation of this film's song melodies into the score are disqualifying alone. Add to that an indecisive and meandering new narrative in the score and you get a very disappointing score-only product on album."

Latham Park is a multi-purpose stadium in Newtown, Wales. It is currently used for football matches and is the home ground of Newtown F.C. The stadium holds 5,000 people and is named after former Wales international footballer George Latham.
Over the years the club have played at a number of sites but the officers and general committee of the late 1940s took the decision to purchase and construct a new playing headquarters at a site to be called Latham Park. This decision was a far-sighted one, and the present board officers, committee, supporters and players owe much to their counterparts of some 60 years ago.
The Control Techniques stand has 420 covered seats with dressing rooms for the club and the community use. A further stand has been constructed at the Llanidloes Road "Allotment End" side of the ground and the old "Shed" stand has been improved with new seating as well as new dug out facilities. The function room and social club has also seen a new extension built on to the club house.
During the 2004/05 season the clubhouse was extended with the building of a new function room with a 200 capacity. This coupled with upgrading of the floodlights and a new pitch drainage system resulted in a football ground with social facilities to equal any club in non-league football.
The most recent addition in October 2009 is a new media room with balcony which also acts as an exclusive sponsors lounge on club match days. In early 2004, the club was awarded the UEFA Licence, the first Welsh Premier club to receive this licence.
During the last 11 years, the club have hosted not only their own UEFA cup ties against Skonto Riga (1996) and Wisła Kraków (1998) but a host of other games including U21 Internationals, full ladies Internationals, Champions League and UEFA ties for other Welsh Premier Clubs as well as full U15 and U18 Internationals. The Welsh Cup final has been hosted on two occasions at the ground and the Welsh League Cup final eight times.
The ground is currently sponsored by Paveways and is known as Paveways Latham Park.
In 2014 Newtown became the 2nd Welsh Premier League club, after The New Saints, to change their grass turf for a 3G Artificial Turf.

Chubby Checker (born Ernest Evans; October 3, 1941) is an American rock and roll singer and dancer. He is widely known for popularizing many dance styles, including The Twist dance style, with his 1960 hit cover of Hank Ballard & The Midnighters' R&B song "The Twist", and the Pony dance style with the 1961 cover of the song "Pony Time". His biggest UK hit, "Let's Twist Again", was released one year later (in 1962); that year, he also popularized the song "Limbo Rock", originally a previous year instrumental hit by the Champs to which he added lyrics, and its trademark Limbo dance, as well as other dance styles such as The Fly. In September 2008, "The Twist" topped Billboards list of the most popular singles to have appeared in the Hot 100 since its debut in 1960, an honor it maintained for an August 2013 update of the list.
Early life
Checker was born Ernest Evans in Spring Gully, South Carolina. He was raised in the projects of South Philadelphia, where he lived with his parents, Raymond and Eartle Evans, and two brothers. By age eleven, Evans formed a street-corner harmony group. By the time he entered high school, Ernest had learned to play the piano a little at Settlement Music School. He entertained his classmates by performing vocal impressions of popular entertainers of the day, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. One of his classmates and friends at South Philadelphia High School was Fabiano Forte, who would become a popular performer of the late 1950s and early 1960s as Fabian.
After school Evans would entertain customers at his various jobs, including Fresh Farm Poultry in the Italian Market on Ninth Street and at the Produce Market, with songs and jokes. It was his boss at the Produce Market, "Tony A.", who gave Evans the nickname "Chubby". The owner of Fresh Farm Poultry, Henry Colt, was so impressed by the boy's performances for the customers that he, along with his colleague and friend Kal Mann, who worked as a songwriter for Cameo-Parkway Records, arranged for young Chubby to do a private recording for American Bandstand host Dick Clark. At this recording session Evans got his stage name from Clark's wife, who asked Evans what his name was. "Well," he replied, "my friends call me 'Chubby'." As he had just completed a Fats Domino impression, she smiled and said, "As in Checker?" That little play on words ("chubby" describing a degree of fatness and "checkers" being, like "dominoes," a tabletop game) got an instant laugh, and stuck: from then on, Evans would use the name "Chubby Checker".
Career
1950s–1960s
In December 1958, Checker privately recorded a novelty single for Clark in which the singer portrayed a school teacher with an unruly classroom of musical performers. The premise allowed Checker to imitate such acts as Fats Domino, The Coasters, Elvis Presley, Cozy Cole, and The Chipmunks, each singing "Mary Had a Little Lamb". Clark sent the song out as his Christmas greeting, and it received such good response that Cameo-Parkway signed Checker to a recording contract. Titled "The Class", the single became Checker's first release, charting at No. 38 in the spring of 1959.
Checker introduced his version of "The Twist" at the age of 18 in July 1960 in Wildwood, New Jersey at the Rainbow Club. "The Twist" went on to top the Billboard Hot 100 not just once in 1960, but yet again in a separate chart run in late 1961. The first success was attributed to teens, and the unprecedented second number-one Billboard ranking was driven by older audiences following a spirited live performance of the song by Checker on The Ed Sullivan Show, seen by over 10 million viewers. (Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" had also achieved number one twice on Billboards earlier chart.)
"The Twist" had previously peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard rhythm and blues chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, Hank Ballard, whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker's "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Top 10 American Bandstand ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought that he could only succeed with dance records typecasting him as a dance artist. Checker later lamented: "... in a way, "The Twist" really ruined my life. I was on my way to becoming a big nightclub performer, and "The Twist" just wiped it out ... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent." By 1965 alone, "The Twist" had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple gold discs by the RIAA.
Despite Checker's initial disapproval, he found follow-up success with a succession of up-tempo dance tracks, including "The Hucklebuck" (#14), "The Fly" (#7), "Dance the Mess Around" (#24), and "Pony Time", which became his second No. 1 single. Checker's follow-up "twist" single, "Let's Twist Again", won the 1962 Grammy Award for Best Rock and Roll Recording. A 1962 duet with Dee Dee Sharp, "Slow Twistin'", reached No. 3 on the national charts. Other substantial hits included "Dancin' Party", "Popeye the Hitchhiker", "Twenty Miles", "Birdland", "Loddy Lo", and a Christmas duet with Bobby Rydell, "Jingle Bell Rock". "Limbo Rock" reached No. 2 on 22–29 December 1962, becoming Checker's last Top Ten hit. Checker continued to have Top 40 singles until 1965, his last being "Let's Do the Freddie" (#40), a variation on Freddie and the Dreamers' dance tune "Do the Freddie", with new melody and lyrics. Changes in public tastes, owing mostly to the British Invasion and counterculture era, ended his hit-making career. He spent much of the rest of the 1960s touring and recording in Europe.
1970s–1990s
"The Twist" was recorded for Cameo-Parkway Records and along with the label's other material, became unavailable after the early 1970s because of the company's internal legal disputes. For decades, almost all compilations of Checker's hits consisted of re-recordings. The 1970s saw him become a staple on the oldies circuit, including a temporary stint as a disco artist. Checker continued to be a superstar in Europe with television and records. A dance-floor cover version of the Beatles' "Back in the U.S.S.R." released in 1969 on Buddah Records, his first chart entry in three years, reached No. 82. It was Checker's last chart appearance until 1982 when he hit No. 91 with "Running".
In 1971, Checker at his own insistence recorded a psychedelic album filled with music he felt was "current" that was initially only released in Europe. Originally named Chequered!, it was renamed over the years in subsequent re-releases as New Revelation, The Other Side Of Chubby Checker, and sometimes as Chubby Checker. The songs were all written by Checker and produced by former Jimi Hendrix producer Ed Chalpin, but the studio musicians' names are unknown. The album flopped.
Later in the decade, he recorded an album of ”audiophile re-creations” of his greatest hits, for producer Stan Shulman.
2000s and beyond
Checker had a single at No. 1 on Billboard's dance chart in July 2008 with "Knock Down the Walls". The single also made the top 30 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Roger Filgate of Wishbone Ash is featured on lead guitar.
In 2009, Checker recorded a public service announcement (PSA) for the Social Security Administration to help launch a new campaign to promote recent changes in Medicare law. In the PSA, Checker encourages Americans on Medicare to apply for Extra Help, "A new 'twist' in the law makes it easier than ever to save on your prescription drug plan costs."
On February 25, 2013, Checker released a new single, the ballad "Changes," via iTunes; it was posted on YouTube and amassed over 160,000 views. "Changes" was produced by the hill & hifi and reached 43 on the Mediabase Top 100 AC Chart and 41 on the Gospel Chart. Checker performed it on July 5, 2013, on NBC's Today show. In 2015, Checker joined forces with Howard Perl Entertainment and Hard Rock Rocksino to produce "Rock and Roll to The Rescue", a show designed to raise funds and adopt rescue animals in need.
Controversies
In 2002, Checker protested outside of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, over the lack of radio airplay of his hit "The Twist" and his perception that the Hall of Fame had snubbed him. Seymour Stein, president of the Rock Hall's New York chapter and member of the nomination committee, claimed "I think that Chubby is someone who will be considered. He has in certain years."
In 2013, Checker sued HP over a WebOS application using his name. The application, before being pulled in September 2012, was used to unscientifically estimate penis size from shoe size. The district court said that Checker's trademark claim survived HP's motion to dismiss, but his other claims were dismissed per Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
Film and musical depictions
Checker performed as well as appeared as a version of himself in Twist Around the Clock (1961) and Don't Knock the Twist (1962). In both films he provided advice and crucial breaks for the protagonist.
In 1988, he appeared as himself performing alongside the Purple People Eater in the film of the same name.
He later appeared as himself in the 1989 Quantum Leap episode entitled "Good Morning, Peoria" where he walks into a radio station in 1959 hoping to have his demo record played on the air. The show's main character, Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), persuades the station owner to play the song "The Twist", inadvertently teaching Checker himself how to do The Twist.
In 2001, he again guest-starred as himself singing "The Twist" in the fourth season of Ally McBeal.
Awards
In 2008, Checker's "The Twist" was named the biggest chart hit of all time by Billboard magazine. Billboard looked at all singles that made the charts between 1958 and 2008. He was also honored by Settlement Music School as part of the school's centennial celebration and named to the Settlement 100, a list of notable people connected to the school.
Checker received the prestigious Sandy Hosey Lifetime Achievement Award on November 9, 2013, from the Artists Music Guild. Checker was the host of the 2013 AMG Heritage Awards and was given the honor during the television broadcast. The award was presented to him by longtime friend and labelmate Dee Dee Sharp.
Personal life
On December 12, 1963, Checker proposed to Catharina Lodders, a 21-year-old Dutch model and Miss World 1962 from Haarlem, the Netherlands. Checker said he met Lodders in Manila the prior January. The song "Loddy Lo" is about her. They were married on April 12, 1964, at Temple Lutheran Church in Pennsauken, New Jersey. Their first child, Bianca Johanna Evans, was born in a Philadelphia hospital on December 8, 1966. Their other two children are Ilka Evans and musician Shan Egan (Evans), lead singer of Funk Church, a band in the Philadelphia area. Checker is also the father of WNBA player Mistie Bass.

Computer Game Review was a print monthly magazine covering both computer gaming and video gaming. The magazine was started in 1991. Also known as Computer Game Review and 16-Bit Entertainment, and then later as Computer Game Review and CD-Rom Entertainment. The headquarters of the magazine which was part of Sendai Publication Group was in Lombard, Illinois.
Reviews typically consisted of a short, impartial synopsis of plot and gameplay, with separate scores assigned subjectively by each of three reviewers. Games were rated out of 100, and if the game received a high enough ranking it would receive either a Platinum or Golden Triad Award.
The magazine folded in 1996, when Sendai Media Group was bought by Ziff-Davis, owner of the competing Computer Gaming World.

Acyloxyacyl hydrolase, also known as AOAH, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the AOAH gene.
Function
Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) is a lipase that selectively releases the secondary (acyloxyacyl-linked) fatty acyl chains from the hexaacyl lipid A moiety found in many bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs, also called endotoxins). The resulting tetraacyl LPS is non-stimulatory and can be a potent inhibitor of LPS sensing via the MD-2--Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4).
The enzyme's 2 disulfide-linked subunits are encoded by a single mRNA. The smaller subunit is a member of the saposin-like (SAPLIP) protein family and the larger subunit, which contains the active site serine, is a GDSL lipase. The enzyme's 3D structure and catalytic mechanism were reported by Gorelik et al.
AOAH is produced by macrophages (including Kupffer cells and microglia), dendritic cells (especially in the colon), NK cells, ILC1 cells, neutrophils and renal proximal tubule cells. Absence of the enzyme in genetically engineered mice has been associated with distinctive phenotypes. AOAH-deficient animals are unable to inactivate even small amounts of LPS in most tissues; the LPS remains bioactive and may pass from cell to cell in vivo for many weeks. The LPS-exposed mice develop strikingly high titers of polyclonal antibodies, prolonged hepatomegaly, and innate immune "tolerance" that gives them slow and inadequate responses to bacterial challenge. Absence of the enzyme renders mice more likely to develop severe lung injury and die if they are challenged with intratracheal LPS, Gram-negative bacteria, or acid (AOAH may also inactivate oxidized phospholipids). Other studies found that AOAH reduced translocation of stimulatory LPS from the gastrointestinal microbiota to the lung, where it may induce tolerance in alveolar epithelial cells, and also to the liver, where LPS can stimulate inflammation and fat storage (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Human eQTL studies have linked AOAH deficiency to both increased risk of colitis and protection from asthma. A polymorphism in the AOAH gene has been associated with chronic rhinosinusitis in 2 different ethnic groups.
AOAH has been highly conserved through evolution; the amino acid sequence of the human enzyme is almost 50% identical to that of the AOAH found in Dictyostelium discoideum, with 100% identity in the GDSL lipase consensus sequences. The enzyme has been found in many invertebrates and all vertebrates studied to date except fish. Although mice have many well-established mechanisms for inhibiting LPS, none has prevented long-term persistence of stimulatory LPS in animals that lack AOAH.

Prior to the construction in 2004 of the Woodsworth College undergraduate residence, the site at 321 Bloor Street was occupied by the Graduate Student Residence, also known as the St. George Apartments. The four-storey U-shaped residence, built in 1926, was designed by the firm of Paisley & Marani and was in the City of Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties. In 2000, a new residence was built for graduate students at the on Harbord St.
Woodsworth College Residence has a student council (Woodsworth Residence Council) composed of students who live in the residence including floor/house reps.
There are classrooms in the basement of the residence. Some of the courses are offered by the Rotman School of Management and include courses in business law, accounting and finance.

Camaligan National High School (Filipino: Pambansang Mataas na Paaralan ng Camaligan), or simply CNHS, is a public high school in Camaligan, Camarines Sur, Philippines. It serves the people of the thirteen barangays of the town, its neighboring municipalities Gainza and Canaman, and the City of Naga.
Formerly known as Sto. Tomas National High School, it was established in 1979 through the efforts of the Barangay Council of Sto. Tomas. In 2013, the school was renamed since it is the only existing high school established inside the municipality.
History
The school was conceived through the efforts of the Barangay Council of Sto. Tomas, Camaligan, Camarines Sur headed by the former Barangay Chairman Andres Servidad on 1 April 1979. A proposal was made and all of the barangay chairmen of Camaligan were informed about the plan.
On the last week of May 1979, a meeting at the municipal hall was called for the finalization the opening of the school, being attended by Henry Aguire (Human Settlement Officer), Olap Benosa (District Supervisor), Godolfredo N. Cordial (Camaligan Central School Principal), Dalmacio A. Aurellano (Municipal Mayor), Roger P. Cariño (Municipal Councilor), Ramon Caceres (Municipal Treasurer), other municipal, barangay and school officials, and the present 58 enrollees. The school officially opened on 1 July 1979 as Sto. Tomas High School.
In 2012, the school adopted the K-12 Curriculum in response to the Enhanced Basic Education Act signed by President Benigno Aquino III.
In 2013, the school has been renamed to Camaligan National High School due to it being the only existing high school in town.
School Hymn
The Camaligan National High School Hymn (originally Sto. Tomas National High School Hymn), or simply CNHS Hymn, is the official school hymn. It was written by Lilian P. Sanglay and Nancy D. Olaño, and its music was arranged by Venrich Kenosis Hermogeno.
The hymn was launched in March 2013, being performed by the school choir. It is both in English and in Bikol languages.

The Yamal–Gydan tundra ecoregion (WWF ID: PA1114 "Yamalagydanskaja tundra") is an ecoregion that covers the Yamal Peninsula and Gydan Peninsula in northern Russia. Plants and animals are sparse, although the area is an important one for migratory birds, and for coastal sea mammals. The ecoregion is in the Palearctic realm, and the tundra biome. It has an area of .
Location and description
The peninsulas lie east of the northern Ural mountains at the ocean outlet of the Ob River delta (the Gulf of the Ob), and the Yenisei River estuary. The Kara Sea is the marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean to the north, and several offshore islands are also included in the ecoregion. These islands include Bely Island. The peninsula's are flat, with extensive wetlands. The area is in the continuous permafrost zone.
Climate
The climate of the Yamal-Gydan tundra ecoregion is Humid continental climate, cool summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfc)). This climate is characterised by long cold winters (at least one month averaging below ), and short, cool summers (one to three months greater than , but no month averaging above ). Mean precipitation is about 514 mm/year. The mean temperature at the center of the ecoregion is in January, and in July.
Flora and fauna
The area's floral characteristics are formed in patchworks of hummocky lichen-moss and shrub-mass areas, separated by bare ground or wetlands. The lichen tundra and bare ground is more common in the north, and in the lichen-moss communities the grass-shrub layer is thin. Marshes are heavily influenced by the strong spring floods, and the rains in the early autumn. Mammals in the area are limited to Arctic fox, lemmings, and a few small herds of reindeer. There are estimated to be 50 species of nesting birds, and the area is an important extension of the Atlantic flyway.
Protections
There is one significant nationally protected area in this ecoregion: the Gydan Nature Reserve.

This is a list of Assembly Members (AMs; Welsh: Aelodau'r Cynulliad, ACau) elected to the fifth National Assembly for Wales at the 2016 election. In May 2020, the representatives were renamed to Members of the Senedd (MSs; Welsh: Aelodau o'r Senedd or ASau) in the fifth Senedd, they would be known as the fifth Senedd for the remainder of their term. From the 2021 election members would be elected under this new title of Senedd. There are a total of 60 members elected, 40 were elected from first past the post constituencies with a further 20 members being returned from five regions, each electing four AMs through mixed member proportional representation. In between elections, members of the legislature may not necessarily be of the same party or the same candidate elected in 2016.

Changes between elections
Government formation
The May 2016 election saw the biggest ever change in the Assembly's composition. Labour dropped from 30 to 29 seats, and Plaid Cymru moved from 11 to 12 seats. The Conservatives lost 3 seats, moving from 14 seats to 11, while the Liberal Democrats dropped from 5 to 1 seat. UKIP, who had not previously had representation, gained seven AMs.
In the initial ballot for First Minister, Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood and Labour's Carwyn Jones each gained 29 votes; a week of talks is then held. A document was produced after Plaid Cymru–Labour talks entitled "Moving Wales Forward", which detailed policy concessions in exchange for allowing Carwyn Jones to become First Minister. Labour appointed Kirsty Williams as Education Secretary, so that the minority government was a coalition between Welsh Labour and the Welsh Liberal Democrats. Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and UKIP formed opposition groups.
In 2018, Mark Drakeford was elected to the leadership of the Welsh Labour Party and became first minister, leading a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats and an independent member.
In May 2020, the representatives were renamed to Members of the Senedd in the fifth Senedd, they would be known by this title for the remainder of their term. From the 2021 election members would be elected under this new title.

"You Love the Thunder" is a song written and performed by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne from his 1977 live album, Running on Empty, recorded at a concert at Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey, on September 6, 1977. Released as the third single a full year after the album came out, it only reached #109 on Billboards Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, though it received increased Album-Oriented Rock airplay. The B-side of the U.S. single was "The Road"; however, the B-side for the British single was "Cocaine".
History
The lyrics seem to describe the relationship of a musician and a spouse or girlfriend who comes along on tour, keeping with the theme of the Running on Empty album, but they can be read more universally, as well:
You love the thunder, and you love the rain —
What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain.
And before the lightning fades and you surrender,
You've got a second to look at the dark side of the man.
You love the thunder and you love the rain —
You know your hunger like you know your name.
And I know you wonder how you ever came
To be a woman in love with a man in search of the flame...
In his 1978 review of the album, Paul Nelson wrote: "Browne forges a temporary relationship with a kindred spirit, only to realize 'You can dream/But you can never go back the way you came.'" Billboard Magazine commented on the "engagingly unpolished vocals" and "dynamic instrumental track."
Reception
Cash Box said that it has a "moderate pace, good lyrics and a strong hook," as well as "effective" slide guitar and backing vocals.

The Muzaffarid dynasty () was a Muslim dynasty which came to power in Iran following the breakup of the Ilkhanate in the 14th century. At their zenith, they ruled a kingdom comprising Iranian Azerbaijan, Central Persia, and Persian Iraq. The Muzaffarids were known for their support of Arabic literature. Shah Shoja was a poet and wrote in both Arabic and Persian and was said to be capable of memorizing eight verses of Arabic poetry after hearing them read once. While the Muzaffarid ruler of Kirman, Shah Yahya, commissioned the scholar Junyad bin Mahmud Al-Umari to compile an anthology of Arabic poetry and prose for him
Rise to power
The Muzaffarids were originally from Arabia and had settled in Khorasan from the beginning of Caliphal rule there. They have been described as an Arab, Iranian, and Persian dynasty. They stayed in Khorasan up until the Mongol invasion of that province, at which point they fled to Yazd. Serving under the Il-Khans, they gained prominence when Sharaf al-Din Muzaffar was made governor of Maibud. He was tasked with crushing the robber-bands that were roaming around the country.
Sharaf al-Din's son, Mubariz al-Din Muhammad, was brought up at the Il-Khan's court but returned to Maibud upon the death of the Il-Khan Öljeitü. In around 1319 he overthrew the atabeg of Yazd and was subsequently recognized as governor of the city by the central Il-Khan government. Following this he began fighting against the Neguderis, a Mongol tribal group. He managed to face this crisis with a minimum of loss.
In the wake of the loss of Il-Khan authority in central Iran following the death of Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty), Mubariz al-Din continued to carry out his expansionary policy. In 1339 or 1340 he invaded the province of Kirman and seized it from its Mongol governor, Qutb al-Din b. Nasir. Kutb al-Din was able to retake the province for a short time after receiving aid from the Kartid dynasty of Herat, but Mubariz al-Din permanently gained control of Kirman in late 1340. The city of Bam was besieged and conquered a few years after this.
After the conquest of Kirman, Mubariz al-Din became a rival of the neighboring Injuids, who controlled Shiraz and Isfahan. Although the Muzaffarids and Injuids had traditionally been on friendly terms with one another, the Injuid Abu Esshaq's desire to gain Kirman led him to start a drawn-out conflict with the Muzaffarids in 1347. He unsuccessfully besieged Yazd (1350–1351), after which his fortunes declined rapidly. Defeated on the field in 1353, Abu Esshaq was forced to take refuge in Shiraz and finally surrender. He managed to escape from Shiraz and fled to Isfahan, but Mubariz al-Din pursued him, took the city and executed the Injuid ruler. Fars and western Iran were now under his control.
With the destruction of Injuid authority, the Muzaffarids were the strongest power in central Iran, and Shiraz was made their capital. Mubariz al-Din's strength was such that when the khan of the Golden Horde, Jani Beg, sent an offer to make him a vassal, he was able to decline. In fact, he pushed on into Azerbaijan, which Jani Beg had conquered in 1357. He defeated the khan's governor Akhichuq and occupied Tabriz, but realized that he could not hold his position against the Jalayirid troops marching from Baghdad and soon retreated. The Jalayirids would therefore maintain a hold on Tabriz, despite further attempts by the Muzaffarids to take it.
Mubariz al-Din was known as a cruel ruler, and soon afterwards 1358, his son Shah Shoja blinded and imprisoned him. A temporary reconciliation was reached, but it failed to last and he died, again in prison, in 1363.
Reign of Shah Shoja
Shah Shoja proved to be a less of a tyrannic figure, but he was constantly fighting with his brothers, causing a long period of instability. In 1363 he marched against his first brother Shah Mahmud, who had been given control of Isfahan, although a peace was soon brokered. In the following year however, Shah Mahmud, with the support of his father-in-law Shaikh Uvais of the Jalayirids, invaded Fars and captured Shiraz. Shah Shoja would not be able to reconquer his capital until 1366. Shah Mahmud would continue to play and influential role in Iranian politics, using his marriage alliance to claim Tabriz from the Jalayirids after Shaikh Uvais died in 1374. He occupied the city but soon gave up after he was struck by illness. He died the next year, allowing Shah Shoja to occupy Isfahan.
Shah Shoja then marched on Tabriz himself, but was forced to turn back when internal conditions in Fars deteriorated. His second brother Shah Muzaffar's son, Shah Yahya, rose in revolt in Isfahan. Having to make peace with the Jalayirids, Shah Shoja offered to marry his son Zain Al-Abidin to a sister of the Jalayirid ruler Husain. The Jalayirids refused the offer and invaded, although Shah Shoja managed to prevent them from getting any further than Sultaniyya. Before dying in 1384, he named his son Zain al-Abidin his successor and his third brother 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad as governor of Kirman. Not satisfied with the arrangement, Shah Yahya advanced against Shiraz, but was expelled from Isfahan by the city's populace and was forced to flee to Yazd. On his deathbed, Shah Shoja wrote a letter to Timur, who was then campaigning in Azerbaijan, in which he gave his sons' loyalty to the conqueror.
Muzaffarid decline
When Zain Al-Abidin succeeded his father, he quickly ignored the declaration of loyalty. Timur therefore marched into the Muzaffarid lands. He came to Isfahan, where the governor gave him control of the city, but a rebellion in the city killed any goodwill Timur had, resulting in a slaughter of the populace. Zain Al-Abidin fled from Shiraz in an attempt to make it to the Jalayirids in Baghdad, who were enemies of Timur. However, he encountered Shah Yahya's brother Shah Mansur, who imprisoned him. Shiraz soon fell to Timur. Shah Mansur and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad, along with other Muzaffarid princes, went to Shiraz to declare their loyalty, whereupon Timur restored them to their positions. The conqueror soon after returned to Transoxiana; Shiraz was given to Shah Yahya.
Unfortunately, the Mozaffarids soon began to resume their local feuding. Shah Mansur began by expelling Shah Yahya from Shiraz, whereupon Shah Yahya again fled to Yazd. Shah Mansur then conquered Abarquh, but failed to take Isfahan. Meanwhile, Zain al-Abidin escaped from prison and reached Isfahan. An alliance was then formed between Zain al-Abidin, Shah Yahya and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad against Shah Mansur. The alliance proved to be unstable, however, and when they met Shah Mansur's army at Furg, Shah Yahya failed to show and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad quickly retreated. The latter met Shah Mansur again, this time at Fasa, but lost and was captured in Ray. He was blinded and imprisoned. Shah Mansur then approached Kirman, where Sultan Ahmad and Shah Yahya had gone after the events at Furg. He offered a common alliance against Timur, but was rebuffed and thereafter returned to Shiraz.
Timur, who while campaigning elsewhere took note of these events, decided in 1392 that a campaign against Shah Mansur was in order. Shah Mansur gained the Sarbadar Muluk as his ally; Muluk was sent to defend Kashan and the Mozaffarid northern front. By March 1393 Timur had advanced down to Shushtar and Dizful, installing a Sarbadar as governor there. He also freed 'Imad-Din Ahmad from imprisonment. Shah Mansur fled Shiraz, but then turned around and met Timur's forces. With an army weakened by desertions, he fought bravely but was forced to retreat. Attempting to reach Shiraz, he was captured by forces of prince Shah Rukh and was decapitated. The other Muzaffarid princes then again swore allegiance to Timur. They were received honorably by the conqueror, but on May 22 in Qumisha they were executed. Only Zain al-Abidin and Sultan Shibli (another son of Shah Shoja) survived the purge; they were sent to Samarkand.

The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 () is a bill that expanded the list of anabolic steroids regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to include about two dozen new substances and established new crimes relating to false labeling of steroids. The bill established a penalty of up to $500,000 against those found to be falsely labeling their anabolic steroid products.
Specifically, the text of the bill reads: "In the case of a violation...by an importer, exporter, manufacturer, or distributor...up to $500,000 per violation...For purposes of this subparagraph, a violation is defined as each instance of importation, exportation, manufacturing, distribution, or possession with intent to manufacture or distribute.
The bill further reads: "In the case of a distribution, dispensing, or possession with intent to distribute or dispense in violation of...this section at the retail level, up to $1000 per violation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term at the retail level refers to products sold, or held for sale, directly to the consumer for personal use. Each package, container or other separate unit containing an anabolic steroid that is distributed, dispensed, or possessed with intent to distribute or dispense at the retail level in violation...shall be considered a separate violation. "
The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The President signed the bill into law on December 18, 2014.
Background
Anabolic steroids, technically known as anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), are drugs that are structurally related to the cyclic steroid ring system and have similar effects to testosterone in the body. They increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles.
Anabolic steroids were first made in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and AIDS. The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals.
Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of anabolic steroids. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with oral steroids), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular atrophy may also be caused by anabolic steroids.
Ergogenic uses for anabolic steroids in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage is considered cheating. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by all major sporting bodies. For many years, AAS have been by far the most detected doping substances in IOC-accredited laboratories. In countries where AAS are controlled substances, there is often a black market in which smuggled, clandestinely manufactured or even counterfeit drugs are sold to users.
One estimate indicates that over 10 million Americans a year take anabolic steroids approximately four percent of whom are adolescents.
Provisions of the bill
The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 amended the Controlled Substances Act to: (1) expand the list of substances defined as "anabolic steroids"; (2) authorize the United States Attorney General to issue a temporary order adding a drug or other substance to the list of anabolic steroids; (3) impose enhanced criminal and civil penalties for possessing or trafficking in any anabolic steroid, or product containing an anabolic steroid, unless it bears a label clearly identifying the anabolic steroid by the nomenclature used by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC); and (4) authorize the Attorney General to collect data and analyze products to determine whether they contain anabolic steroids and are properly labeled.
The bill specified that a substance shall not be considered to be a drug or hormonal substance that is considered to be an anaboloic steroid if it is: (1) an herb or other botanical; (2) a concentrate, metabolite, or extract of, or a constituent isolated directly from, an herb or other botanical; (3) a combination of two or more such substances (i.e., botanical or concentrate, metabolite, or extract); or (4) a dietary ingredient for purposes of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Provides that any person claiming the benefit of an exemption or exception from being considered a drug or hormonal substance shall bear the burden of providing the appropriate evidence.
Congressional Budget Office report
This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 15, 2014. This is a public domain source.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4771 would have no significant costs to the federal government. Enacting the bill could affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that any effects would be insignificant for each year.
H.R. 4771 would expand the list of anabolic steroids regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to include about two dozen new substances and would establish new crimes relating to false labeling of steroids. As a result, the government might be able to pursue cases involving drug use that it otherwise would not be able to prosecute. CBO expects that H.R. 4771 would apply to a relatively small number of additional offenders, however, so any increase in costs for law enforcement, court proceedings, or prison operations would not be significant. Any such costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
Because those prosecuted and convicted under H.R. 4771 could be subject to civil and criminal fines, the federal government might collect additional fines if the legislation is enacted. Civil fines are recorded as revenues. Criminal fines are recorded as revenues, deposited in the Crime Victims Fund, and later spent. CBO expects that any additional revenues and direct spending would not be significant because of the small number of additional cases likely to be affected.
H.R. 4771 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.
H.R. 4771 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA, on manufacturers, sellers, importers, exporters, distributors, and consumers of products that contain certain chemical compounds that would be defined as anabolic steroids. CBO estimates that the cost of complying with those mandates would probably exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would impose private-sector mandates by adding 25 new compounds, and any compounds found to be structurally similar, to the list of anabolic steroids regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Consumers would need a prescription from a licensed practitioner in order to purchase products containing the newly listed compounds. Sellers, manufacturers, and importers of such products would be required to obtain an authorization from state and federal authorities in order to make or possess the compounds. However, based on information from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the DEA, and industry professionals, CBO expects that the majority of the affected entities would either replace the regulated compounds with new ones or discontinue the distribution of the affected products. Therefore, the cost of the mandate would be the forgone income from lost sales.
Because of the nature of the market being regulated, the scope of sales affected is difficult to determine. As products are found to contain compounds that are structurally similar to the compounds listed, industry sales could decline significantly. Some industry experts estimate that the revenues generated by the sale of products containing such compounds amount to between $2 billion and $5 billion annually. (Those figures include sales of some products that already are not in compliance or not being sold in compliance with FDA or DEA regulations.) Although identifying which items would be affected by the legislation would be difficult, given the estimated magnitude of industry profits, even a 10 percent decrease in income as a result of the bill would exceed the annual threshold for private-sector mandates.
The bill also would impose a mandate on importers, exporters, manufacturers, and distributors by requiring that any anabolic steroid or product containing an anabolic steroid be labeled as such, using the nomenclature of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The cost of the mandate would probably be small.

The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 29, 2014 by Rep. Joseph R. Pitts (R, PA-16). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health, and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. On September 15, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. The President signed the bill into law on December 18, 2014.
Debate and discussion
Rep. Pitts, who sponsored the bill, said that the bill "will protect consumers from these harmful products by giving the DEA the tools and authority to classify designer steroids as controlled substances." However, although the Act contains the phrase "designer steroid" in the title, the text omits the phrase entirely and fails to provide a legal definition.
Delegate Donna Christensen (D-VI) was also in favor of the bill, arguing that it "will go a long way to removing dangerous steroids from the market."
Supporters argued that the bill would "make it easier for the attorney general to identify legally sold commercial products that contain illicit anabolic steroids." The United Natural Products Alliance and the Council for Responsible Nutrition both supported the bill. Despite the Act granting new powers to identify those products, as of July 7, 2017, the Attorney General had failed to publicly or privately do so.
Detractors have noted the unscientific and indefinite verbiage of the Act, citing as proof that various executive agencies have maintained contradictory opinions as to what constitutes a designer steroid for enforcement purposes.

USS Jennings County (LST-846) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. Named after Jennings County, Indiana, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name.
Originally laid down as LST-846 by the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania on 27 October 1944; the ship was launched on 12 December, sponsored by Mrs. L. P. Quill; and commissioned on 9 January 1945.
Service history
World War II, 1945
After shakedown off Florida, LST-846 loaded cargo at New Orleans, then sailed for the Pacific in mid-February. Steaming via the Panama Canal and San Francisco, she reached Pearl Harbor on 27 March. For the next six weeks, the landing ship operated in the Hawaiian Islands before departing for Seattle on 12 May. Following repairs, LST-846 received oil, gasoline, and mechanized equipment for transport to the western Pacific. On 9 June she was underway, arriving Guam on 11 July. For the rest of the war she supported American forces in the Marshalls and Okinawa.
1945–1949
After the Japanese acceptance of Allied peace terms, LST-846 transported occupation forces and equipment between Japan and the Marianas. She sailed for the United States on 3 November, arriving Seattle in early December. Returning to the Far East five months later, she arrived Shanghai, China on 28 May 1946 and commenced cargo runs among Chinese ports. From 1946 to 1949, LST-846 continued these operations and in addition shuttled cargo between China and the Marianas. After the Chinese Communist Revolution, the veteran landing ship returned to the United States, arriving San Diego on 17 June 1949. LST-846 was decommissioned at Astoria, Oregon on 14 October 1949.
Korean War, 1950–1953
After the outbreak of war in Korea, the United States intervened. To aid in the movement of men and equipment, LST-846 was recommissioned on 3 November 1950 with Lieutenant Marion V. Reeder in command. After amphibious training along the West Coast she departed San Diego on 16 April 1951 for duty in the Western Pacific. Arriving Yokosuka early June, the landing ship operated out of Japan performing cargo runs and amphibious training until 6 September when she sailed for the east coast of Korea. After two cruises from Japan to Korea, LST-846 sailed on 5 November for a stateside overhaul. She was back in the Far East on 5 June 1952, then resumed cargo operations in Japan for the remainder of the year.
1953–1955
Returning San Diego on 29 March 1953, LST-846 served off the West Coast until 27 January 1954 when she sailed for another WestPac tour. During the late summer LST-846 transported French troops and vehicles along the Indochina coast, following the end of the Indochina War. She also performed station ship duties during "Operation Passage to Freedom" as naval units transported thousands of Vietnamese from North to South Vietnam after the partition of the country. Departing Yokosuka on 12 October, the veteran landing ship arriving San Diego four weeks later. Following amphibious exercises along the West Coast, she steamed to Astoria, Oregon, arriving on 9 April 1955 for overhaul. LST-846 was named USS Jennings County (LST-846) on 1 July and decommissioned at San Diego on 7 December 1955.
Vietnam, 1966–1970
After ten years with the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Jennings County recommissioned on 11 June 1966 to support U.S. forces in South Vietnam. Jennings County departed San Diego on 11 September, arriving at Chu Lai on 11 November.
Jennings County saw extensive service during the Vietnam War, operating as part of Operation Game Warden, a brown-water navy effort to keep the rivers free of Viet Cong infiltration. Four LST were recommissioned to support river patrol operations with the intent of keeping three ships on-station at any one time supporting a River Division of 10 Patrol Boats, River (PBR), a Detachment of 2 UH-1B helicopter gunships from HC-1 Det 5 later to become HAL-3 Seawolves and a SEAL Platoon. The ship not on-station was undergoing ship repairs in the Western Pacific. Jennings County reported on-station to CTF 116 on 7 November 1966 and operated as a Patrol Craft Tender (AGP) for the next 40 months on the rivers of the Mekong Delta.
For the remainder of 1966 it conducted river patrols and in 1967 continued patrols supporting Game Warden operations. In 1970, while off the coast of Son On Doc at the southern tip of South Vietnam the ship suffered a serious fire in its auxiliary engine room that rendered it unable to continue operations. As a result HAL-3 got the ice cream from the freezers before they departed station. The ship was removed from station, and later, the took its place as a patrol craft tender in support of river patrol operations.
Decommissioned on 25 September 1970, at Naval Station Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. The ship's final fate is unknown.
Awards
LST-846 earned two battle star for the Korean War, and as Jennings County was awarded two Presidential Unit Citations, two Navy Unit Commendations, nine campaign stars for Vietnam War service.

Written by Caillat and Jason Reeves and produced by Mikal Blue, the song was released as the album's lead single on May 15, 2007. "Bubbly" is Caillat's highest-charting hit and is her only single to reach the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100. Internationally, "Bubbly" reached number one in Australia, Brazil, and the Czech Republic. It also became a top-10 hit in several European countries, including Belgium, Germany, and Norway.
The song's music video, directed by Liz Friedlander, aired on MTV, VH1 and CMT. A still from the music video was used as the cover for Caillat's debut album, Coco.
Background and composition
"Bubbly" was written by Colbie Caillat and Jason Reeves. It is written in the key of A and primarily features a gentle guitar instrumentation which uses a capo of seventh fret. The guitar uses open D tuning (low to high): D–A–D–F–A–D. Caillat's vocal range spans from E3 to F4.
Caillat commented on the lyrical composition of the song in an interview with Wilson County News on February 20, 2008, following her live performance on The View, "I didn't write "Bubbly" for any [special] guy. I wrote it about the feelings you get when you have a crush on somebody, and when they give you butterflies in your stomach and they just make you smile."
Reception
Critical response
Susan Visakowitz of Billboard wrote that Caillat's "warm vocals along with a gentle acoustic arrangement effortlessly conjure the idyllic California she calls home".
Commercial performance
On the issue dated October 6, 2007, "Bubbly" rose from number 16 to number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, eventually peaking at number five for seven non-consecutive weeks.

The Sikorsky HH-52 Seaguard (company designation S-62) was an early amphibious helicopter designed and produced by the American helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft. It was the first of the company's amphibious rotorcraft to fly.
The S-62 was originally developed as a commercial venture during the late 1950s. It combined the dynamic elements of the Sikorsky S-55 with a boat hull-shaped fuselage and a single lightweight turboshaft engine. The prototype S-62 conducted its maiden flight on 22 May 1958, powered by a single General Electric T58-GE-6 turboshaft engine. It underwent evaluation at the Naval Air Test Center in Patuxent River, Maryland, at Sikorsky's own expense as part of its effort to promote the S-62 to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
The USSG would procure 99 S-62s, which it initially designated as the HU2S-1G Seaguard, and later re-designated as the HH-52A Seaguard. It was primarily operated by the USCG for air-sea rescue missions. Various other operators opted to procure the S-62 for their own purposes, from airliners to utility transporters, and foreign air services. It was widely used into the 1980s, by which point many operators elected to replace the type with newer rotorcraft. The HH-52 was withdrawn from USCG service during 1989 in favour of non-amphibious rotorcraft, such as the Eurocopter HH-65 Dolphin, which rely solely on the use of a winch from a low hover to conduct rescue operations.
Design and development
Development of the S-62 was launched by Sikorsky during the late 1950s, the initiative was initially pursued as an independent commercial venture. In concept, the project combined the dynamic elements of the earlier Sikorsky S-55 with a boat hull-shaped fuselage and a single lightweight turboshaft engine. This was a relatively ambitious design for the era, being the first of Sikorsky's amphibious helicopters.
On 22 May 1958, the prototype S-62 performed its maiden flight; in doing so, it had beat its larger Sikorsky S-61 sibling into flight by almost a year. This prototype was powered by a single General Electric T58-GE-6 turboshaft that had been derated from 1,050 hp to 670 hp, powering an identical main and tail rotor to that of the S-55.
At Sikorsky's own expense, it funded a "fly before you buy" test programme at the Naval Air Test Center in Patuxent River, Maryland; the company actively promoted the type to the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in particular. The results of this test programme was largely positive, confirming Sikorsky's performance claims and its suitability for the service. Accordingly, on 21 June 1962, Sikorsky was issued an initial production contract for the type. On 9 January 1963, the first of 99 production helicopters was delivered to the USCG. On 17 January 1969, the final example would be delivered by the company.
Perhaps the most prominent feature of the S-62 is its boat hull fuselage, which was more compact but otherwise similar to the preceding Sikorsky S-61 (adopted by the US Navy as the SH-3 Sea King). This fuselage is watertight, facilitating landings on water or snow alike, and furnished with two outriggers floats that help the rotorcraft resist both pitching and rolling motions while on the water's surface. These outrigger floats also accomidated the landing gear, which was retractable. To maintain its position while on the water, it was able to deploy an anchor.
Although the S-62 bore little visual resemblance to the Sikorsky S-55, it used many of the same components. It was powered by a single General Electric T58-GE-8B turboshaft engine, capable to generating up to ; it was a derated version of the T58-GE-10 powerplant used on the larger twin-engined SH-3. The S-62 had sufficient power to carry up to 12 passengers, or six litters, along with a crew of three.
Operational History
One prominent early use of the S-62 was with the operator San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines, one of the first helicopter airlines to operate without a federal subsidy, and the first to operate exclusively using turbine engine helicopters; the airline commenced passenger flights using a pair of two leased S-62s in June 1961, each of which being configured to carry up to ten passengers. On 21 December of that year, rival operator Los Angeles Airways performed the first scheduled service using an American turbine-powered helicopter via a leased S-62. By June 1962, three S-62s were reportedly in operation for specialised transportation purposes, such as servicing offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, with Petroleum Helicopters. Other early civil operators included Okanagan Helicopters, which used its S-62s to supply remote radar installations, and the Canadian Department of Transport, which had the type fly resupply missions to its lighthouses.
A large fleet of 99 S-62s were purchased by the US Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics on behalf of the USCG, whom operated the type primarily for search and rescue missions. It was initially designated HU2S-1G Seaguard, but was re-designated as the HH-52A Seaguard during 1962. The HH-52 was commonly dispatched aboard the USCG's larger cutters and icebreakers. The turbine-powered helicopter could carry greater payloads and fly faster than many preceding aircraft, such as the H-19 (S-55). Being designed to be amphibious, the installation of additional flotation gear was not required for over-water flights, and rescues could be conducted by simply landing on the water. Water pickups were considered to be quicker than hoisting survivors up to the helicopter.
Across its services life, the HH-52 fleet played an active role during various emergencies and other circumstances. During the aftermath of Hurricane Betsey in 1965, the type rescued 1,200 people. The HH-52 was periodically used to provide logistical support in Antarctica. One HH-52 was present for the floundering of the oil tanker Burmah Agate on 1 November 1979, facilitating in the rescue of personnel from the affected vessels.
The HH-52 fleet was active for a total of 26 years, during which it reportedly was responsible for saving in excess of 15,000 people from various forms of life-threatening situations. Having been eclipsed by newer rotorcraft, the final flight of a HH-52 took placed on 12 September 1989, after which the type was officially withdrawn from USCG service. It was primarily replaced by the Eurocopter HH-65 Dolphin, a conventional non-amphibious helicopter.

The Lions Fire was a wildfire in the Ansel Adams Wilderness in Inyo National Forest and the Sierra National Forest in California in the United States. The fire was started by a lightning strike and first reported on June 11, 2018. The fire impacted recreational activities in both national forests, and access to Devils Postpile National Monument. The Lions Fire burned a total of , before burning out on October 1.
Events
The Lions Fire was reported around noon on June 11, 2018. Started by a lightning strike, it was spotted near Lion Point in the Ansel Adams Wilderness in the Sierra National Forest. On June 22, the fire crossed into Inyo National Forest. The next day, the fire had spread due to heavy winds, growing to over and moving closer to Mammoth Lakes at approximately seven miles southwest. The Lions Fire has been burning in high elevations, approximately 6,000 to 8,000 in elevation, thriving on red fir.
Strong winds overnight expanded the fire to . A temporary flight restriction was put in place over a five-mile radius on June 25. By the next day, the fire had burned into the Stairway Creek, northwest of the middle fork of the San Joaquin River. It also reached the Butte Fire (2017) footprint, which slowed the Lions Fire's westward movement. The Lions Fires expanded to over by the morning of June 28. As of June 30, the fire had slowed its progression and was seven percent contained and had burned .
July 1 marked the fourth day of burn-out operations on the Lions Fire. By July 5, the fire had grown to and was 60 percent contained, due to lack of fire growth and crews reinforcing firelines, to mitigate concerns about dryer weather and high winds. Air quality remained poor in Mammoth Lakes and the surrounding areas.
By late August, the growth of the Lions Fire slowed, with containment gradually increasing. On October 1, 2018, InciWeb declared the Lions Fire to be inactive, as no more hotspots were detected within the fire perimeter. By then, the fire had burned at total of .
Impact
Health
Wind patterns caused the fire's smoke to impact the air quality of Mammoth Lakes and other areas east of the fire.
Recreation
The Lions fire impacted visitor access to the Ansel Adams Wilderness, during which trails, in both Inyo and Sierra National Forests, heading towards the fire zone were closed to hikers.
Environment
Due to the fire's location in a designated wilderness area, fire crews used Minimum Impact Suppression Tactics, such as air assistance and hand construction, to minimize their impact on the landscape, supporting a healthy ecosystem. This also provides for better firefighter safety and reduction of hazardous vegetation.

Lochee United Football Club are a Scottish football club based in the Lochee area of Dundee. Formed in 1892, they currently compete in the SJFA Midlands League and play their home games at Thomson Park.
History
After spending their early years as a juvenile and amateur side, United joined the Junior grade in 1959. Their Thomson Park ground was opened by former Rangers and Scotland captain George Young in the same year.
Achieving notable local success in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club flourished again after the formation of the East Region Superleague in 2002. Under the management of Eddie Wolecki Black, United were promoted as Tayside Premier champions in 2003 and two seasons later, won their first Superleague title. In the same year, they also reached the final of the Scottish Junior Cup for the first, and so far, only time, losing 2–0 to local rivals Tayport at Tannadice Park.
Wolecki departed for Montrose in December 2005 but his successor as manager, former Dundee United midfielder Ray McKinnon, maintained the clubs' run of success, culminating in a second East Superleague title in 2007–08. This led to their participation in the Scottish Cup for the first time. United reached the third round of the competition after beating fellow Junior qualifier Bathgate Thistle 3–1 in the first round and Highland League side Buckie Thistle 3–0 in the second round. In the third round, Lochee held Second Division Ayr United to a 1–1 draw at home before going down 3–1 in the replay at Somerset Park.
They are one of two Junior clubs from Lochee, the other being Lochee Harp.
The team has been managed since July 2016 by George Shields.
Lochee won their third East Superleague title in 2018–19, making them eligible to enter the 2019–20 Scottish Cup at the Preliminary round stage.
In June 2022, the club announced that it had been successful in attaining an SFA licence, allowing them access to progress through the Scottish football league system and play in the Scottish Cup every season.

Phyllostegia hirsuta is a species of flowering plant in the mint family known by the common names Molokai phyllostegia and hairy phyllostegia. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from the island of Oahu. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.
This plant is a subshrub or vine with hairy, glandular, oval-shaped leaves up to 30 centimeters long by 18 wide. The flower is white with purple tinting on its upper lip.
The plant occurs in the Waianae and Koʻolau Mountains of Oahu. There are nine populations totalling about 160 mature plants. In areas where the plant has apparently been extirpated, it may reappear in the future as plants sprout from the underground soil seed bank. Threats to the species include feral pigs and introduced species of plants. Some populations of the plant are or may soon be under the protection of the United States Army, which operates in the plant's habitat.

Imbrie Farm is an Italian Villa style home in Hillsboro, Oregon. It was built by Robert Imbrie and was a working farm for over a century. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.
Located just south of U.S. Route 26 on Cornelius Pass Road, the estate is now home to a McMenamins brewpub, the Cornelius Pass Roadhouse. Original structures on the farm include the home, a unique eight-sided barn, and a shed.
Currently
The old farmstead is a brewpub operated by Portland, Oregon based McMenamins. The property contains English chestnut and black walnut trees that have been there for more than 130 years.
History
The Imbrie family arrived in the mid-1840s as part of Oregon's first flood of white settlers. The Imbries came to Oregon from the Midwest, but the family's patriarch, James Imbrie, Jr., was born and raised in the Kingdom of Fife on the southeast coast of Scotland.
James' sons, James III and Robert, each developed farms in Washington County. James' area was in North Plains, while brother Robert took over and expanded a neighboring farm (Lenox Farm), where the current buildings are located. Robert immigrated to Oregon via ship around Cape Horn.
Robert built a granary in the mid-1850s, then a decade later built the three-story, Italian Villa-style home that still stands today. It took three years beginning in 1866 to complete construction on the home, which they named the Gables. At this point, the family included 12 children and Robert's mother. During this time the family raised Morgans as draft animals to sell to other farmers. Once Robert's son Frank (d. 1945) took over, he turned the farm into a dairy and added the unique eight sided barns around 1900.
Later generations of the family lived in the home, adding electricity and indoor plumbing in the 1930s. James Hay, Frank's son, transitioned the farm into grain and hay production, including barley that was used in Blitz-Weinhard beer in the mid-1900s.
By the 1970s the family had stopped the agrarian activities, and in 1977 Gary (James, Jr.'s great great grandson) opened the Imbrie Farmstead Restaurant at the old home.
In 1984 the property was purchased by Donald and Billie Jean Herman who continued to operate the restaurant until they leased the operations to McMenamins.
In 1986 current owner McMenamins took over operations (eventually purchasing and restoring the buildings) and turned the property into the Cornelius Pass Roadhouse, a brewpub. McMenamins's Cornelius Pass Roadhouse is located at 4045 NW Cornelius Pass Rd in Hillsboro, OR 97124. The property features a brewery, distillery, outdoor meadows and groves, the historic Octagonal Barn, Imbrie Hall, and the 1866 Italianate Roadhouse. The Roadhouse features original artwork and Victorian-era furnishings, and is often used for large special events.

Sheer Sound is a South African independent record label formed in 1994 by Damon Forbes.
History
Sheer Sound was formed in November 1994, shortly after South Africa's first democratic elections. The label was initially a home for jazz and world music and fast gained a reputation for its extensive South African and African jazz catalogue.
By the mid-1990s, a young music marketer, Damon Forbes, was getting restless with the limited vision of his industry.
"I sunk my teeth into jazz because it carried a world music message for me; it was truly culturally representative.... I just looked at the market and I saw the economics of the people of South Africa changing, due to better access to education.... [And]the workplace was going to change; a lot more black people getting into jobs that are of medium and higher income levels.... With all that, comes the aspiration to listen to better quality music. [So] the market, in the long term, is going to increase."
With what he calls "R1 500 (just over $200) and a dream", Forbes established his own label, Sheer Sound. (Ansell 2005:269)
In 2006 two imprint labels, Seed and 2Feet Music, were formed under the Sheer Sound umbrella and has since released some of the most prolific rock and singer-songwriter music, respectively, in South Africa.

The Gaiety Theatre was a gay male burlesque theater in Times Square, New York City, for almost 30 years until it closed on March 17, 2005. The name on the awning over the entrance was Gaiety Theatre, but it was also called the Gaiety Male Burlesque or the Gaiety Male Theatre in advertisements. It was located at 201 W 46th Street, New York, NY 10036, on the second floor of the building that also housed what was the last Howard Johnson's restaurant in New York City. The Gaiety opened in late 1975 and closed in 2005 and was owned by Denise Rozis, run by both her and her younger sister, Evridiki Rozis.
The building has been demolished but was owned by the Kenneth Rubinstein family (Rubenstein Klein Realty) for many years until it was sold to Jeff Sutton's Wharton Acquisitions. The Howard Johnson's restaurant closed later on July 8, 2005, at midnight, after having been open for 46 years.
This theatre was not the same Gaiety Theatre that was across 46th Street at 1547 Broadway, which did house burlesque, including Minsky's for a time during its long history (1908–82). That Gaiety is probably best remembered as the Victoria Cinema, but its final name was Embassy 5, before the building was demolished.
A New York Times article published on April 24, 2005, about the closing of the Gaiety referred to “ … the lore that set the Gaiety apart from other clubs: the mainstream attention it attracted after photos of Madonna and some of the club's dancers were included in her book Sex (1992). The cachet of visitors like John Waters, Andy Warhol, and Shirley MacLaine, and the club's unrivaled ability to survive, despite the strict zoning laws instituted during the Giuliani administration, thanks to a location just outside a restricted area.”
Blogger Andy Towle said: “The Gaiety opened its doors on a winter night in 1976 and consistently attracted an interesting mix of young hustlers, businessmen, tourists, and celebrities on the DL to its pleasantly dingy, boxy room with its small stage and sparkling curtain.”
The Gaiety survived Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's intense drive to close adult related venues in the mid-1990s. Heavy security was instituted and no sexual activities of any kind were permitted in the theatre.
The Gaiety in Art
Patrick Angus (1953–1992), a late 20th-century American painter, created a number of oil or acrylic paintings of the interior of the Gaiety and some of its dancers and customers in the 1980s. Some of those titles are: Grand Finale (1985), The Apollo Room I (1986), Remember the Promise You Made (1986), Slave to the Rhythm (1986), All The Love in the World (1987), Hanky Panky (1991)
Notable visitors and dancers at the Gaiety
Madonna's famous 1992 book Sex contained many pictures taken in the Gaiety and of the Gaiety dancers. In fact there were pictures from that photo shoot posted on the wall in the theater's Apollo lounge for years. After the book came out, the Gaiety became chic and many dancers and patrons were not entirely happy with the visitors that resulted. Her sexually themed music video Erotica (1992) was also at least partially shot there.
Joey Stefano danced at the Gaiety in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was one of the more famous Gaiety dancers (and porn stars), having been featured in Madonna's Sex book in 1992, as well as having a biography written about him by Charles Isherwood, Wonder Bread and Ecstasy, that touches on his life as an erotic dancer at the Gaiety.
Some of the porn stars and notable entertainers that have danced at the Gaiety: Will Clark, Billy Brandt, Chris Williams, Christian Fox, Gianfranco, Carlos Morales, Rod Barry, Jason Adonis, Tristan Adonis, Hunter James, Jon Ramsey, Mark Dalton, Johnny Harden, Kip Noll, Leo Ford and Adam Champ. Angelo Garcia, a former member of famed Puerto Rican boy band Menudo also briefly worked as a dancer at the Gaiety.
Other celebrities that have visited the Gaiety: RuPaul, Robin Byrd, John Rutherford, Andy Warhol, pornographer Paul Morris, John Waters, Divine, Diane Keaton and Shirley MacLaine, Cilla Black, The Lady Bunny and Paul O'Grady.

Southern Regional High School is a regional comprehensive public high school located in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township in Ocean County, New Jersey, serving students in ninth through twelfth grades and operating as part of the Southern Regional School District. The school is located on a wooded campus. The district serves the five municipalities in the Long Beach Island Consolidated School District — Barnegat Light, Harvey Cedars, Long Beach Township, Ship Bottom and Surf City — along with students from Beach Haven and Stafford Township, along with the sending district of Ocean Township (including its Waretown section).
As of the 2020–21 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,975 students and 151.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.0:1. There were 296 students (15.0% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 57 (2.9% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.
History
In May 1956, voters approved by a better than 100-1 margin the construction of a building designed to accommodate 1,500 students in a building on a site that would cost $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Prior to the opening of Southern Regional, students from Barnegat, Ocean Township, and Long Beach Island attended the former Barnegat High School, while students from Stafford, Eagleswood, Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, and Bass River attended the former Tuckerton High School, which currently houses Tuckerton's elementary school.
Southern Regional High School opened in 1957 as a junior-senior high school, housing students from Stafford Township, Barnegat Township, Ocean Township, Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, Eagleswood Township, Bass River Township, and all six municipalities of Long Beach Island.
At first, the school only had two sports; boys' baseball and boys' basketball. Football was added in 1958, and wrestling came two years later. Girls had "Sports Nights" instead of competitive teams. It would not be until the 1960s when women's sports would first appear at Southern. Due to the quick growth of the area, a new wing and expanded gymnasium were added in 1966.
In 1970, Southern Regional Middle School opened its doors to 7th and 8th graders. However, it soon became overcrowded. Starting in 1979, students from Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, Bass River, and Eagleswood, would attend the newly opened Pinelands Regional High School in Tuckerton. At the same time, an expansion was built onto the middle school, all ninth graders were moved from the high school to the middle school.
The high school went through several changes throughout the 1990s. In December 1991, maintenance crews installing a heating system sparked the fire that damaged the guidance area and several science labs, which were later remodeled. The school also caught fire two years later after an explosion occurred in the school's main electric panel. While a new wing of classrooms was added to the high school in 1996, a new two-story building was opened in 1998 adjacent to the existing high school, with the old high school building housing ninth and tenth graders known as the "9/10 building", and the new building which houses eleventh and twelfth graders being known as the "11/12 building. At the same time, the middle school went back to housing the seventh and eighth graders.
In 2004, the Barnegat High School opened, starting with only a freshman class. Each year, a new year was added to Barnegat High School. June 2007 marked Southern Regional's last graduating class with students from Barnegat. Barnegat High School became a full 9-12 high school in September 2007 and graduated its first seniors in June 2008. Prior to the termination of the sending relationship with Barnegat, the Southern district had received as much as $30 million for students attending the school.
Awards, recognition and rankings
The school was the 192nd-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", using a new ranking methodology.

The school was ranked 213th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state. Schooldigger.com ranked the school tied for 175th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (an increase of 20 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (79.4%) and language arts literacy (94.2%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).

The Mississauga Steelheads are a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League, based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The Steelheads play their games at the Paramount Fine Foods Centre in Mississauga.
History
The OHL originated in Mississauga with the Mississauga IceDogs. The IceDogs played in Mississauga from 1998 to 2007 being purchased by Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk in 2006. Following the 2006-2007 season, Melnyk sold the Icedogs who moved to St Catherines to become the Niagara IceDogs. At the same time Melynk moved the Toronto St. Michael's Majors to Mississauga to become the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors. The Majors played in Mississauga from 2007-2012, also hosting the 2011 Memorial Cup. Following the 2012 season Melnyk sold the Majors franchise to Elliott Kerr of Mississauga's Landmark Sport Group. As a part of the sale, the Majors identity was returned to St. Michael's College, allowing the team to move forward under the fan-selected "Steelheads" moniker.
The Steelheads struggled in their first season in 2012–13 finishing last in the OHL Central Division and 8th overall in the Eastern Conference before losing to the Belleville Bulls in 6 games in the first round. Before the 2013–14 the Steelheads drafted 15 year old Sean Day. Day had applied for and been granted Exceptional Player Status to be able to be drafted into the OHL at 15 years old. In the 2013–14 season the Steelheads again finished last in the OHL Central Division and 8th in the Eastern Conference, this time being swept by the number one ranked Oshawa Generals in four games in the first round of the 2014 OHL Playoffs. In 2014–15 the Steelheads finished in 4th in the Central Division ahead of the Sudbury Wolves but missed the 2015 OHL Playoffs finishing five points back. In 2015–16 thanks to strong performances by a trio of top 2016 NHL Draft picks (Alexander Nylander, Michael McLeod, Nathan Bastian) the Steelheads finished above .500 for the first time and ended the season in 7th in the Eastern Conference standings, (4th in their division). Again though the Steelheads would fall in the 1st Round losing to the Barrie Colts in 7 games.
2016–17 was the best season currently in Mississauga Steelheads history. Backed by continued strong performances by Bastian and McLeod as well as a breakout 44 goal seasons from 2017 1st Round Draft Pick Owen Tippett, the Steelheads won their first Central Division Title. Entering the 2017 OHL Playoffs in the 2nd seed in the Eastern Conference the Steelheads defeated the Ottawa 67's in 6 games in the 1st Round before defeating the Oshawa Generals in 5 games in the 2nd Round. In the Eastern Conference Finals the Steelheads swept the Peterborough Petes in 4 games to win their first Bobby Orr Trophy in franchise history. The Steelheads would fall in the J. Ross Robertson Cup Finals in 5 games to the Erie Otters.
In 2017–18 Mississauga returned to the bottom of the Eastern Conference ending the season in 7th place, (4th in the Central Division). The Barrie Colts once again defeated the Steelheads in the 1st Round of the Playoffs, this time in 6 games. In 2018–19 Mississauga was the best team of a weak bottom half of the OHL Eastern Conference finishing in 5th place but 20 points back of Sudbury in 4th. In the playoffs the Wolves easily swept Mississauga in 4 games. The 2019–20 OHL season was cancelled before completion of the regular season, the J. Ross Robertson Cup or the 2020 Memorial Cup in Kelowna. At the time of cancellation the Steelheads sat in 6th place in the OHL Eastern Conference with a record of 27-29-4-1 but 17 points up on 9th place, which would have guaranteed the Steelheads a 7th playoff appearance in 8 seasons.
Uniforms and mascot
The primary logo for the Steelheads displays a Steelhead trout below the word Mississauga with a maple leaf after it. The Steelheads colours are blue & white. The secondary logo features the Port Credit lighthouse within an M, representing the city landmark.
The Steelheads' blue and white uniforms bear a striking resemblance to those of the nearby Toronto Maple Leafs of the NHL; their home sweaters are white with blue striping and collars, while their road sweaters are blue with white striping and collars.
The team mascot is named Sauga. The name was created during a fan contest during the summer of 2012, when the organization asked its fans to create a name for the new Steelheads mascot.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate.
First stamps
Postage stamps were issued specifically for the Northern Nigeria Protectorate beginning in 1900. All stamps of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate are definitive issues of a Key Plate design, differing in the sovereign depicted, type of paper, watermarks, and choice of colored or colorless numerals for the denomination.
The first series consisted of nine stamps with values ranging from 1/2 pence to 10 shillings, depicting Queen Victoria. The second series, consisting of identical denominations, but in slightly different colors was issued on July 1, 1902, depicting King Edward VII. Unusually, a £25 stamp was issued in April 1904. This was really intended as a revenue stamp, it being nearly impossible to invent a piece of mail needing so much postage. It was used to pay for imported liquor licences. It is the great rarity of philately with copies commanding a high price. The King Edward series was reissued in 1905 in eight denominations, and again in 1910–11 in eleven denominations.
The final series of stamps for the Northern Nigeria Protectorate was a series of thirteen denominations depicting King George V.
Stamps of Northern Nigeria were replaced by those of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914.
Borgu local post
A local post briefly existed at Borgu in 1905 for which crudely made one penny stamps were produced.

Batlava Lake (; ) refers to both a lake and resort located in Kosovo.
History
The village of Batlava is inhabited by Albanians. The artificial lake was created during the communist era as a water supply source for the Pristina and Podujevo regions.
Present day
Batlava Lake is the main source of potable water for the cities of Pristina and Podujevo, but not Orllan itself, where the lake is located. As a result of the cities' population growth, withdrawal regularly exceeds inflow, especially in summer.
Batlava Lake is a popular destination for locals. Thus, tourism is a large revenue source for the local village. The lake is in the Lab region and is fed by the Batlava River from the north. The village of Koliq is also located quite near the lake.

The Ironman Germany is a triathlon race, part of the Ironman series. It is owned and organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC). In 2005, Frankfurt became the new site of the Ironman European Championship.
History
The first Ironman race in Germany was held in Roth in 1988. The race began with the swimming portion (3.8 kilometers) in the Main-Danube Canal, part of the Rhine river. Before the race, samples of the water are collected and tested to make sure it is safe to compete in. On race day, the Shipping Authority closes off the river for the day in order to keep the athletes safe from ships and pollution. After the swimming portion is finished, athletes change into their cycling attire and begin the 180 kilometer ride, 8 kilometers south of Roth. The ride goes down to Greding, where they turn and finish back at Roth. After the cycling portion is finished, athletes change into their running attire and begin the 40-kilometer run to the finish. In 2001, the WTC ended its Ironman contract with Roth. The annual triathlon still goes on but it is no longer part of the Ironman series.
European Championship
Since 2005, the Ironman European Championship is held annually in Frankfurt and more than half a million spectators gather to watch the race every year. The race starts in two different waves, the first wave consists of 100 elite level athletes and the second start consists of the remaining athletes. An average of 2500 people compete per year. The first part of the race, the 3.86 km swim event, takes place in the lake Langener Waldsee about 15 km south of Frankfurt. The subsequent 180 km bike course first goes to central Frankfurt, then through two laps through Frankfurt and the surrounding region Wetterau. Northernmost point of the route is in Bad Nauheim. The final marathon running goes four laps on a course on both sides on the River Main in Frankfurt. The finish is at the Römerberg square in the historic center of Frankfurt. In 2010 the maximum time was reduced from 16 to 15 hours, in spite of a 5 km extended cycling course.
Present Day
In 2003, the WTC decided to hold their annual race in Frankfurt creating the Opel Ironman Germany Triathlon. Stefan Holzner, from Germany, won with a time of 8:12:29.1 and Nina Kraft, also from Germany, won for the women with a time of 9:03:11.5. In its ten-year span, the record has been broken numerous times. In 2008, Chrissie Wellington, from England broke the record for the women with a time of 8:51:24.7 and in 2009 Timo Bracht, from Germany, with a time of 7:59:15. In 2005, the Ironman European Championship was brought to Frankfurt. As of 2018, the course record for men is 7:41:42, set by the Sebastian Kienle from Germany in 2017, and for women is 8:38:44, set by Daniela Ryf from Switzerland in 2018.
The championship is an annual accumulation of the best athletes from all around Europe. In order to race in the championship, one of four qualifications must be met.
Lottery
The Ironman lottery system was designed in 1983 by Ironman Cofounder John Collins. His idea was to give all athletes the chance to compete in this monumental race. The lottery system now accepts 100 athletes from all different age groups and 5 physically challenged athletes. If selected, completion of an Ironman series race is required one year prior to the championship race.
Ironman Ebay Auction
In 2002, the Ironman Auction allowed people to bid on six spots in the championship race. Each week one slot is posted with a starting bid of $10,000. Over the past 11 years, the auction has raised over $2 million. One hundred percent of the proceeds go to different charities and organizations supported by the Ironman Foundation. The charities supported by the Ironman Foundation are both national and international. Some of the charities include: American Red Cross, American Heart Association, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Club, World Bicycle Relief, Peoples Advocacy for Trails in Hawaii and The County of Hawaii Parks & Recreation Department.
Finishing position
The top finishing males and females are given a spot in the championship race. In order to accept the championship invitation the athlete must be present at the awards ceremony. Many of the top finishers believe that they already qualified or someone else is handling their invitation but that is not always the case. WTC managing director of global race operations Steve Meckfessel says "just cracking the top 10 can sometimes punch the ticket". When people are absent, the next available spot is given to the next finisher in the age group. This is known as rolldown.
The Ironman Legacy Program
The Ironman Legacy Program is another lottery system that accepts 100 athletes. A number of criteria must be met to qualify for this program. First, completion of at least twelve Ironman series races before the actual championship race is required. Second, have never participated in the Championship race. Third, must have completed an Ironman race in each of the two years prior to the Championship. And finally, be registered to compete in an Ironman race later in that year.
Controversy
The World Anti-Doping Agency conducted a study to see if athletes were doping. They surveyed 2997 athletes that have participated in triathlons in Germany, including the Ironman European Championship. The survey consisted of both physical and cognitive doping. Physical doping is taking any illegal substance to improve your race performance and cognitive doping is taking any illegal or legal substance to improve your mental health. The survey found that 13% physically doped, 15% cognitively doped, and 20% used both.

The 1989 Miami Dolphins season was the team's 24th as a member of the National Football League (NFL). The Dolphins improved upon their previous season's 6–10 W-L record, winning eight games. Despite this improvement they failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season, tying the longest such record in franchise history when the Dolphins failed to make the playoffs from 1966 to 1969. This was also the longest such record for coach Don Shula in his NFL career.
Shortly after the season ended, Miami Dolphins founder Joe Robbie died on January 7, 1990, at the age of 73.

USA-85, also known as GPS IIA-7, GPS II-16 and GPS SVN-32, was an American navigation satellite which formed part of the Global Positioning System. It was the seventh of nineteen Block IIA GPS satellites to be launched.
Background
Global Positioning System (GPS) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to provide all-weather round-the-clock navigation capabilities for military ground, sea, and air forces. Since its implementation, GPS has also become an integral asset in numerous civilian applications and industries around the globe, including recreational used (e.g., boating, aircraft, hiking), corporate vehicle fleet tracking, and surveying. GPS employs 24 spacecraft in 20,200 km circular orbits inclined at 55.0°. These vehicles are placed in 6 orbit planes with four operational satellites in each plane.
GPS Block 2 was the operational system, following the demonstration system composed of Block 1 (Navstar 1 - 11) spacecraft. These spacecraft were 3-axis stabilized, nadir pointing using reaction wheels. Dual solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power. They used S-band (SGLS) communications for control and telemetry and Ultra high frequency (UHF) cross-link between spacecraft. The payload consisted of two L-band navigation signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.60 MHz (L2). Each spacecraft carried 2 rubidium and 2 Cesium clocks and nuclear detonation detection sensors. Built by Rockwell Space Systems for the U.S. Air force, the spacecraft measured 5.3 m across with solar panels deployed and had a design life of 7.5 years.
Launch
USA-85 was launched at 23:54:00 UTC on 22 November 1992, atop a Delta II launch vehicle, flight number D216, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration. The launch took place from Launch Complex 17A (LC-17A) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and placed USA-85 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37XFP apogee motor.
Mission
On 23 December 1992, USA-85 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 717.96 minutes, and 54.8° of inclination to the equator. It was intended to broadcast signal PRN 32, but this was changed to PRN 01 on 28 January 1993 after it was discovered that receivers could not track the PRN 32 signal. The spacecraft was operated in slot 4 of plane F of the GPS constellation, and had a mass of . It had a design life of 7.5 years, and was retired from service on 17 March 2008. It is unclear whether it has been retained as a backup satellite.

Jonathan LeVine is an American art dealer, instrumental in the proliferation of lowbrow and street art on the East Coast of the United States.
About
LeVine grew up in Trenton, New Jersey. As a teenager, he encountered punk rock music and the punk scene, and began producing fanzines, promoting shows, and booking bands. He attended Montclair State University, and graduated with a degree in sculpture. Beginning in 1994, and while working at Montclair State University, LeVine became an independent curator, exhibiting punk flyers, comics, graffiti, and tattoo art at punk rock venues CBGB, Webster Hall, Max Fish and Maxwell's. Prominent artists in his early exhibitions included the contemporary artist Ron English, the visual artist and musician Daniel Johnston, and the street artist Shepard Fairey. In February 2001, LeVine opened a small gallery called Tin Man Alley in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Tin Man Alley initially sold vintage toys, novelty items, and lowbrow art. LeVine moved his gallery in 2005 to Manhattan, New York City.
Gallery
In January 2005, LeVine opened the Jonathan LeVine Gallery to the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at 529 West 20th Street. The gallery promoted graffiti art as fine art, holding a major group show in conjunction with São Paulo's Choque Cultural gallery, in 2007. Work by eight Brazilian street and graffiti artists was exhibited as Ruas De São Paulo. That June, LeVine rented a temporary space, in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, for Shepard Fairey's exhibition, entitled E Pluribus Venom, and in December LeVine had an international street art show called, entitled The Streets of Europe, which featured artists from France, England, and Italy. The show included the contemporary artist Bo130, the graffiti artist Blek le Rat, the street artist D*Face, and the urban artist Invader. In 2010, he curated a large group show for the fifth anniversary of his gallery, and some of the works were also showcased on The New York Times website, with audio commentary by LeVine.
In early 2012, Gingko Press released Delusional, a biography on LeVine and retrospective of the foundation and development of the Jonathan LeVine Gallery. In it, the author notes Levine "has nourished a much-needed alternative viewpoint within the stilted New York art market." Later that year, the gallery presented Détournement: Signs of the Times, an anticipated group exhibition by curator Carlo McCormick, which featured work by the street artist and realist painter Dan Witz, the photographer and artist Jack Pierson, and Ron English. Nicola Verlato's How The West Was Won was also shown that year. In early 2014, the gallery expanded to a second location in Chelsea, Manhattan, and that same year LeVine partnered with the art magazine Juxtapoz to present Art Truancy: Celebrating 20 Years of Juxtapoz Magazine.
In 2017, the gallery relocated to Jersey City, New Jersey, and was renamed as Jonathan LeVine Projects. It was located at the cultural center Mana Contemporary, and the opening exhibition, entitled Welcome to New Jersey, highlighted street, pop surrealism, and hyper realism art. In 2017 and 2018, LeVine held the Delusional Art Competition, which allows emerging artists the opportunity for solo exhibition in his gallery. In 2018, LeVine relocated the gallery to 150 Bay Street in Jersey City.
Other work
In the 1990s, Levine played in a band called Drywater that reformed in 2016, as Cyclone Static.
Accolades
LeVine is noted for being a standout contemporary art curator, on the forefront of cutting-edge art trends. Christopher Rodgers of The Jersey Journal asserts that LeVine has "had success helping the careers of many artists." Madonna, Marilyn Manson and Mark Parker have purchased work from LeVine.

Critical reception
A very real and authentic representation of the struggle that individuals and groups in low-income or minority based communities go through to get by on a day-to-day basis. Using local and Canadian actors, many viewers found a connection that made this film more enjoyable to watch. As mentioned in most reviews, Doomstown is a great teaching film that can be used for educational purposes in both a school/classroom setting and/or in homes.

Sheldon appeared in the Broadway revue Priorities of 1942, performing a comedy banjo act in which he did not speak, wearing an outfit resembling the costume of silent film comedian Harry Langdon and mimicking some of Langdon's distinctive gestures.
He appeared in speaking roles as the genie Ali in 20th Century Fox's 1945 films Where Do We Go From Here? and the seal trainer, Professor Winnup in The Dolly Sisters.
In the 1950s and 1960s, most of Sheldon's work was on various Walt Disney programs. An often-seen act, in the "Golden Horseshoe Revue" episode of the Walt Disney anthology television series, was as a banjo player who kept getting his fingers stuck in the strings. After several minutes he would finally get them "un-stuck" and play a vigorous riff on his banjo.
His other speaking roles were banjoist Sam Jordan in the 1951 musical Golden Girl, notorious alcoholic Puffo the Clown in Paramount's 1954 film 3 Ring Circus and in Disney's 1960 film Toby Tyler as Sam Treat, a clown and animal trainer who is one of Toby's mentors and protectors. Toby's other protector, gruff wagon driver Ben Cotter, was played by Henry Calvin, who co-starred on Zorro as Sergeant Garcia.
Sheldon starred in Disney's 1961 Christmas film Babes in Toyland as Barnaby's mute henchman, Roderigo. He was teamed with Calvin once more as a kind of ersatz Laurel and Hardy.
Zorro
Sheldon's role was Bernardo, Diego's mute (but not deaf) servant on Zorro. As established in the series' first episode, when Diego de la Vega confides to Bernardo his intention to pretend to be a helpless intellectual rather than a man of action, Bernardo decides to support him by pretending to be deaf. In this way, Bernardo is able to spy for Diego without arousing suspicion. This characterization, an innovation over the deaf-mute Bernardo of the original stories, employed Sheldon's pantomime skills while making the character more integral to the series. William Lava composed Bernardo's humorous music theme. Sheldon reprised the role in four further Zorro adventures that appeared on the Walt Disney anthology television series in 1960-1961.
Personal
Sheldon married Margaret McCann on December 11, 1944 in Las Vegas, Nevada. They had two children. He died from a heart attack. His remains were cremated.

Explosion protection is used to protect all sorts of buildings and civil engineering infrastructure against internal and external explosions or deflagrations. It was widely believed until recently that a building subject to an explosive attack had a chance to remain standing only if it possessed some extraordinary resistive capacity. This belief rested on the assumption that the specific impulse or the time integral of pressure, which is a dominant characteristic of the blast load, is fully beyond control.
Techniques
Avoidance
Avoidance makes it impossible for an explosion or deflagration to occur, for instance by means of suppressing the heat and the pressure needed for an explosion using an aluminum mesh structure such as eXess, by means of consistent displacement of the O2 necessary for an explosion or deflagration to take place, by means of padding gas (f. i. CO2 or N2), or, by means of keeping the concentration of flammable content of an atmosphere consistently below or above the explosive limit, or by means of consistent elimination of ignition sources.
Constructional
Constructional explosion protection aims at pre-defined, limited or zero damage that results from applied protective techniques in combination with reinforcement of the equipment or structures that must be expected to become subject to internal explosion pressure and flying debris or external violent impact.
Method selection
The technology of protection can range in price dramatically but where the type of device is rational to use, is typically from the least to the most expensive solution: explosion doors and vents (dependent on quantities and common denominators); inerting: explosion suppression; isolation – or combinations of same. To focus on the most cost effective, doors typically have lower release pressure capabilities; are not susceptible to fatigue failures or subject to changing release pressures with changes in temperature, as "rupture membrane" types are; capable of leak tight service; service temperatures of up to 2,000 °F; and can be more cost effective in small quantities. Rupture membrane type vents can provide a leak tight seal more readily in most cases; have a relatively broad tolerance on their release pressure and are more readily incorporated into systems with discharge ducts.
There are several fundamental considerations in the review of a system handling potentially explosive dusts, gases or a mixture of the two. Dependent upon the design basis being used, often National Fire Protection Association Guideline 68, the definition of these may vary somewhat. To facilitate providing the reader with an appreciation of the issues rather than a design primer, the following have been limited to the major ones only.
Database combustion and explosion characteristics of dusts
The database GESTIS-DUST-EX comprises important combustion and explosion characteristics of more than 7,000 dust samples from nearly all sectors of industry. It serves as a basis for the safe handling of combustible dusts and for the planning of preventive and protective measures against dust explosions in dust-generating and processing plants.
The GESTIS-DUST-EX database is produced and maintained by the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance. It was elaborated in co-operation with other institutions and companies. The database is available free of charge to be used for occupational safety and health purposes.

Planeta Bur () is a 1962 Sovcolor Soviet science fiction film scripted by Alexander Kazantsev from his novel, and co-scripted and directed by Pavel Klushantsev.
In English, the film is often informally referred to as Planet of the Storms, Planet of Storms, Planet of Tempests, Planeta Burg, and Storm Planet. It was never theatrically released in the U.S. in its original form before appearing on home video in the 1990s. The film is better known to American audiences via the two similar American direct-to-television features Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet and Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women. Both U.S. video features reused the film's special effects and most of its primary footage.
Plot
Three Soviet spaceships, Sirius, Vega, and Capella, are on their way from Lunar Station 7 for the first human landing on Venus and the first exploration of the planet. Capella is suddenly struck by a large meteor and is completely destroyed, killing all aboard. After mourning the loss of their friends, the remaining two ships, Sirius and Vega, soon continue on, even though the planned mission required three spaceships. A replacement, Arcturus, will be sent from Earth, but will not arrive for two months.
The cosmonauts aboard Sirius (Ilya, Roman, and Alyosha) and aboard Vega (Ivan and Allan, and the woman, Masha) all agree that proceeding with the landing and exploration is better than waiting two months. So Ivan and Allan, with their large robot assistant "John" (now partly disassembled for flight), descend toward Venus in Vegas glider spacecraft, leaving Masha in orbit to monitor communications between the ships and ground crews. All contact is lost with her after they land in a misty swamp. The gigantic Sirius gently lands vertically on its four shock-absorbing wing struts, but at a different, volcanic-terrain location. Because the atmosphere is poisonous, the men exit Sirius in their spacesuits and helmets. While wandering around some boulders, Aloysha is suddenly attacked and dragged off toward the mouth of a large carnivorous plant, but he is quickly rescued by Ilya and Roman. After photographing the lifeform and sharing jokes about the incident, they proceed to search for Ivan and Allan in their hovercar.
During their journey, they hear what sounds like a distant eerie voice of a woman, and then soon encounter a gigantic, sedate brontosaur-like creature, from which one of the men quickly takes a blood sample from its tail. Meanwhile, after completely assembling robot John, Ivan and Allan are suddenly attacked in the swamp by several human-size tyrannosaur-like beasts, some of which they kill with handguns. They later come across a large, deep ravine and attach strong cords to one of the gigantic trees near the edge of the ravine and to an anchoring boulder. John is able to fell the tree over the ravine, and they walk across it, while listening to recorded music. Allan is later weakened by a wound from the attack at the swamp, so robot John finds a cave for their protection from the wet environment. Both men, however, develop a fever and are soon too weak to stand.
While over an ocean near a beach, the three cosmonauts submerge their hovercar to escape an attack from a large flying pterosaur-like creature. While Underwater, they discover a head sculpture, with ruby gemstone eyes, of one of the flying creatures, apparently made by an intelligent species. After emerging onto the beach, Alyosha discovers a strange triangular rock, which he keeps.
After they radio-contact robot John and learn of the two fevers, they instruct John to immediately administer life-saving medicine. Ivan and Allan soon recover, just as flows of molten hot mud surround them. Desperately, Ivan has robot John carry them safely across the steaming mud, but the robot over-heats and slows down from their added weight. Robot John attempts to forcibly remove them with its claw and injures Allan in the process. The hovercar suddenly arrives just in time to rescue the two men and quickly leave the area. Robot John, now non-functional from the intense heat, slowly descends into the now deep molten flow. During their trip back to Sirius, they again see another gigantic brontosaur-like creature, and new fin-backed dinosaur-like animals.
After safely returning to Sirius, they discover a recorded, desperate message from Masha saying that she is going to defy her orders from Lunar Station 7 and land on Venus to search for them. This causes much anguish over her not surviving on this hostile world. Unstable ground and a rain flood are now threatening Sirius, so they must take off immediately. During this, Alyosha discovers that his strange rock has crumbled apart to reveal a small sculpture of a beautiful woman's face, proving there is human life on Venus. He starts shouting to the others about what he has found, as they hurriedly pull him inside Sirius. They quickly launch just before the ground begins to break apart. Rising into space, they suddenly regain radio-contact from Masha, who tells them she finally decided to remain in orbit for them, as she had been ordered. Sirius then proceeds to safely return to Lunar Station 7.

American adaptations
In 1965, American film producer Roger Corman gained access to the Soviet film footage and hired film student Curtis Harrington to prepare it for an American release. Harrington added several American-made scenes starring Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue, which replaced scenes of two of the Russian cast, and dubbed the dialogue to English. The resulting film, re-titled Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet, went directly to television from American International Pictures. In the cast and credits, the Russian actors' names were replaced with fake non-Russian names; for example, the Russian actor Georgiy Zhzhonov was credited as "Kurt Boden".
In 1968, American film director Peter Bogdanovich (under the name Derek Thomas) was hired by Corman to create a second, different American film version, re-titled Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women, to which was added new scenes with American actress Mamie Van Doren and several other attractive women playing Venusians (wearing seashell brassieres). Also included were some minor scenes from another Russian SF film, Mikhail Karyukov's Nebo Zovyot. This second Americanized version is essentially the same as Corman's first, but retold with a parallel viewpoint of the telepathic Venusian women, whose god (a large pterosaur-like flying creature) is killed by the Earth men, and includes an ending with an ironic twist: The Venusian women find a new god to worship, the now eroded and non-functional robot John. Corman's 2nd version may have had some limited theatrical releases in the American South on the drive-in circuit, but primarily became a "TV movie" released through American International Television.
Reception
In a retrospective on Soviet science fiction film, British director Alex Cox remarked that "in its final minutes, Planet of Storms takes an extraordinary turn. ... I shall not spoil the secret, but it's worth the wait".
The character of the female cosmonaut Masha, portrayed as emotional and arguably mentally unstable, was criticized by Soviet government and press as misogynist, and damaged Klushantsev's career.

(1517 – February 24, 1566) was a Japanese daimyō of the Sengoku period. The son of Mimura Munechika, he was the lord of Matsuyama Castle, in Bitchū Province. As the influence of the Hosokawa was decreasing in the province, he joined with the Shō family in expanding his local power and influence within Bitchū. He was the father of Ueno Tsuruhime.
However, issues began to arise with the Shō family, and so Iechika turned to Mōri Motonari for support. The Mōri clan came to Iechika's aid, and assisted in largely subduing the province under the Mimura. At the same time, Iechika moved his headquarters from Tsurukubi Castle to Matsuyama Castle, entrusting the former fortification to his senior vassal Mimura Chikanari.
In 1566, while holding a council with his senior retainers at Kōzenji Temple, Iechika was shot to death by Endō Matajirō and Yoshijirō, two brothers who had received orders from Ukita Naoie. It was an uncommon killing, as gun assassinations were still rare at the time.

The Huckleberry Creek Patrol Cabin is located in the northern portion of Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, United States. It was built around 1934 to house rangers on patrol within the park. The log cabin's design resembles the "Standard Plan for Patrol Cabins" prepared by the Western Division of the National Park Service, with the addition of a full-width front porch. Civilian Conservation Corps labor may have been used in the construction of the cabin.
The cabin was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 1991. It is part of the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District, which encompasses the entire park and which recognizes the park's inventory of Park Service-designed rustic architecture.

The Peruvian Rugby Federation () organizes rugby union in Peru, and is a member of World Rugby and Sudamérica Rugby.
History
The Universidad de Lima, the Pontificia Universidad Catolica, the Club de Rugby San Isidro and the Old Markhamians Rugby Club decided to create the Unión Peruana de Rugby on February 11, 1997 to organize all rugby activities and start the promotion and teaching of rugby union in Peru. The Unión Peruana de Rugby (UPR) started with Néstor Corbetto as President and Diego Zúñiga as Secretary-Treasurer who were elected amongst representatives of the four clubs: Old Markhamians Rugby Club, Universidad de Lima, Pontificia Universidad Católica and the Club de Rugby de San Isidro. Since then, two other clubs have joined the Union: the Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC) and the Newton College Old Boys. A crest depicting a Tumi, superimposed over the Peruvian flag of 1820 is the official UPR emblem
The government's Instituto Peruano del Deporte (Peruvian Institute for Sports) resolved in November 1997 to accept the formation of the Comisión Deportiva Nacional de Rugby — an officially recognized rugby commission — which is the first step to becoming a recognized federation.
A year after this meeting in October 1997, the Union Peruana de Rugby was formally accepted as a member of the Confederación Sudamericana de Rugby (CONSUR) at the meeting held in Mendoza, Argentina. Hereafter Peru has attended all meetings. In the January meeting in Mar del Plata the same year, Mr. Carlos Tozzi of the IRB was contacted. It is worth mentioning that at this meeting, Peru's intervention allows the presence of Colombia in the meeting.
At the Montevideo meeting, as previously agreed, Peru presented Mr. Tozzi and CONSUR members a letter requesting incorporation in the IRB. The letter was faxed to the IRB on April 13, 2000. Also in 2002, the Comision Deportiva Nacional de Rugby, was recognized as Federacion Peruana de Rugby by the Instituto Peruano del Deporte .

José García Guerrero (October 29, 1914 December 23, 1991), better known as José Guerrero, was a Spanish artist, notable for his abstract expressionist paintings, who spent much of his working life in U.S.A.
Biography
Guerrero was born in Granada, where, from 1930 to 1934, he attended art classes at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios. In 1940, on the advice of his friend Federico García Lorca, he moved to Madrid, where he continued his studies until 1945 at the Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. The same year, he received a grant from the French government to study fresco painting for one year at the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris. During his time in Paris, he saw works by artists such as Juan Gris, Paul Klee, Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, and especially Henri Matisse, whose influence can be seen in the landscapes and rural scenes Guerrero painted after returning to Spain.
From 1946, Guerrero spent several years traveling across Europe, staying in Bern, Brussels, London, Paris, and Rome. In Rome, he became friends with the artist brothers Afro and Mirko Basaldella. He also met Roxanne Whittier Pollock, an American journalist. The couple married in 1949, and moved to the United States, staying first in Philadelphia and settling a year later in New York.
Guerrero now became acquainted with many prominent members of the American avant-garde, including the artists Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko, and Theodoros Stamos, and with James Johnson Sweeney, art critic and director of the Guggenheim Museum. Guerrero painted his last figurative work (a self-portrait) in 1950, and thereafter devoted himself to abstract expressionism. In 1954, his paintings were exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, and in Sweeney's exhibition Younger American Painters: A Selection. He used his skills in fresco to collaborate with architects on postwar reconstruction projects, winning a fellowship from the Graham Foundation of Chicago for such work. In 1965, he returned to Spain, and from then on divided his time between there and U.S.A. He produced portfolios of graphic works to accompany the poems of Jorge Guillen, Stanley Kunitz and others. He died in Barcelona in 1991, survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.
Assessment
According to an assessment on the Guggenheim Foundation's website, in Guerrero's early abstract style "simplified, biomorphic forms float in a quasi-monochromatic background". By the mid-1950s it "had become more gestural, expressing a deeper sense of urgency, as he loosened his brushstroke and introduced a controlled dripping technique". After his first return to Spain, he "reintegrat[ed] purer colors in his works, distant from the anxiety-ridden, predominantly black paintings of the late 1950s". His style continued to evolve through the 1970s and 1980s, "as he created orderly and rhythmic vertical compositions, followed by increasingly dynamic works in which brilliant hues took the lead". According to art critic Grace Glueck, he was "[k]nown for big, vibrantly colored paintings whose abstract imagery suggested landscape, primitive architecture and atmospheric events". She quotes him as saying that the structure of his paintings was based on "vertical thrusts or horizontal tensions and diagonal crisscrossings".
Exhibitions and collections
His work is held by several prominent collections, including those of the Guggenheim, Whitney and Brooklyn Museums in New York, and from 2000 in the Centro José Guerrero, Granada. His solo exhibitions include: 1952Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; 1954 and 1958Betty Parsons Gallery; 1964Galería Juana Mordó, Madrid (es); 1981Escuela de Artes y Oficios; 1990Museo de Arte Contemporáneo, Seville (es). In 1994, there was a major retrospective of his work at Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid. In 2014, an exhibition organized by Yolanda Romero (director from 2000 of Centro José Guerrero) entitled José Guerrero: The Presence of Black, 1950-1966 was toured in Granada, Madrid and Barcelona.

Prof. Alfred Gessow (October 13, 1922 – May 2, 2002) was an American pioneer in the field of helicopter aerodynamics and aerospace engineering.
He was a co-author of the early rotorcraft engineering text, Aerodynamics of the Helicopter,
which, although published in 1952, has been in print for more than 50 years. Gessow was chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, and was ultimately promoted to Professor Emeritus.
Researcher
While Gessow is best known for his book Aerodynamics of the Helicopter, his earliest published technical papers and reports helped bring a new level of clarity to the development of the helicopter, which prior to then had relatively primitive standards for flying qualities. For example, Gessow authored one of the earliest efforts to standardize mathematical symbology in helicopter aeromechanics to enable aerospace engineers to more easily communicate advances in the field.
One of Gessow's earliest theoretical papers was on the subject of blade twist and plan-form effects, and how it affected the fundamental performance of a hovering helicopter. While it is now established that numerical techniques became the basis of methods in early use by the helicopter industry, the digital computers in 1956 were very primitive by modern standards. His approach lays down the well-known "blade element method" incorporating two-dimensional, non-linear sectional airfoil data from tables, a fundamental engineering approach that even today remains the basis for most helicopter rotor design analyses.
In 1967, Gessow published an article in Scientific American on "The Changing Helicopter."
Educator
Gessow devoted much of his government and teaching career to expand the knowledge of helicopter aerodynamics, developing new theoretical approaches, and conducting flight experiments.
University of Virginia (1945-1956)
Gessow began his formal career as an educator while assigned to the NASA Langley Research Center, where he also served as Chairman of the Committee on Graduate Studies and as Chairman of the Faculty at University of Virginia's Hampton Roads Graduate Extension Center. During this period, he developed an advanced degree program administered by the University of Virginia for the benefit of personnel working at the Langley Research Center. He organized and taught undergraduate and graduate courses on helicopter and fixed-wing aerodynamics, and also served as a thesis advisor.
A Lecturer in Helicopter Theory
Gessow taught Helicopter Theory in New York University's summer program in the Aerospace Sciences (1966), and subsequently taught graduate courses as an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace Engineering (1968-1969). He also taught Helicopter Theory at the Catholic University of America (1970-1971), and also served as an invited professor at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science (1979-1980). Gessow lectured widely on helicopter technology, and delivered lectures at several universities in the United States including Princeton University, Cornell University, Penn State University, Georgia Tech, Colorado State University, Brooklyn Polytechnic, Virginia Polytechnic, and the Catholic University. He also lectured at international universities including the University of Aachen (Germany), the Technion (Israel), and the Korean Advanced Institute of Sciences (South Korea).
University of Maryland (1980-2002)
Gessow joined the University of Maryland in 1980 as the Chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering. He served in this capacity from 1980 through 1988. During his tenure as chair, his leadership was instrumental in expanding the department's research and educational programs into a wide range of fields in aeronautical and astronautical engineering including: rotorcraft; space systems; flight dynamics and control; flight structures; and hypersonic vehicles. In 1981, Gessow founded the Center for Rotorcraft Education and Research, and continued as its Director until 1992, when he became Professor Emeritus. In 1997, the center that Gessow founded was renamed the Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center to honor his extensive contributions to both the field of rotorcraft and to the University of Maryland. Today, the Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center is internationally recognized for its continuing mission of fostering both research and education in the field of vertical flight.
Honors
Gessow was the recipient of numerous major awards in the field of aerospace engineering.
Gessow was recognized with the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1974,
the citation for which read "for significant contributions to helicopter development, and for effective and innovative planning and management of aerodynamic research activities that have contributed significantly to NASA's stature in aeronautics."
Gessow was awarded Honorary Fellow of the American Helicopter Society in 1978,
and the citation stated that Gessow was recognized "For outstanding rotary-wing contributions including inspirational teaching and writing, applying computer technology to rotor blade aerodynamics, and leadership in helicopter airfoil development."
Gessow was awarded the Fifth AHS Alexander A. Nikolsky Honorary Lectureship in 1985.
This honorary lectureship is bestowed on an individual who has had "a highly distinguished career in vertical flight aircraft research and development, and is skilled at communicating their technical knowledge and experience, for whom a summary of their original work represents a valuable reference publication."
Gessow's lecture was entitled "Understanding and Predicting Helicopter Behavior — Then and Now."
Gessow was the recipient of the AHS Alexander Klemin Award (1996).
The Alexander Klemin Award is the highest and most prestigious honor bestowed by AHS International on an individual for lifetime achievement in the field of vertical take-off and landing aircraft.
Gessow was awarded Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1982.
Legacy
Gessow was the founding editor of the Journal of the American Helicopter Society, published by AHS International, and served as editor for one year as was the custom of the time. The journal was established in 1956 to provide a forum in which original technical papers dealing with the theory and practice of vertical flight could be peer-reviewed and archived. The journal fosters the exchange of information about innovation and practical information of various aspects of helicopters and V/STOL aircraft. The Journal of the American Helicopter Society celebrated its 50th year of publication in 2006, and reprinted its first issue to commemorate the occasion, and has continued publication to this day.
Every year, the American Helicopter Society International, the world's only international technical society for engineers, scientists and others working on vertical flight technology, awards its Alfred Gessow Award for Best Paper in honor of Gessow, at their annual forum in recognition of the best technical paper presented that year. According to AHS, the award recognizes the author(s) who prepared and presented the most significant forum technical paper as judged and selected by peers.
The University of Maryland Department of Aerospace Engineering has a professorship named in Gessow's honor: The Alfred Gessow Professor. Distinguished University Professor Inderjit Chopra is the inaugural and current Alfred Gessow Professor.

Douglas Clayland Turnbull, Jr. (July 23, 1904 – April 12,1996) was an American lacrosse player. He was the first player, and remains one of only six, to have been named to the USILA All-America first team all four years of his college career. Turnbull played college lacrosse and football at Johns Hopkins University. In 1923, he led the nation in placekicking. He was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1962.
Early life
Turnbull was born on July 23, 1904 in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, from which he graduated in 1921. While there, he played football, basketball, and lacrosse, and as a senior he captained the lacrosse team. During his time at Poly, his lacrosse teams defeated cross-town rival Baltimore City College three out of four times and also beat collegiate teams of Maryland and Penn.
College career
Doug Turnbull attended college at Johns Hopkins University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in 1924. During the following year he continued postgraduate studies in engineering, mathematics, and thermodynamics. Turnbull was a two-time president of the Omicron Delta Kappa leadership honor society in 1924 and 1925.
As an undergraduate, Turnbull became the first college lacrosse player named to the USILA All-America first team all four years of his collegiate career, a feat that has been matched only five times since (by Everett Smith, Frank Urso, Del Dressell, Jason Coffman, and Mikey Powell). He played every lacrosse position with the exception of goalkeeper. He played on the Hopkins football team as a left halfback, and in 1923, led the nation in placekicking. That season, he made six field goals and fifteen extra points. Head football coach Ray Van Orman named Turnbull to his All-Time Hopkins Football Team, and lacrosse coach Bill Schmeisser named him to his Honor Roll of Hopkins Lacrosse Tradition. Turnbull was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1962. He was inducted into the charter class of the Johns Hopkins Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994.
Professional career
Turnbull worked for the Baltimore Gas & Electric Company from 1925 to 1943. He became a member of the company's Executive Department on September 1, 1943. In 1962, he was working as the chairman of the Locomotive Development Committee, a member of the National Coal Policy Conference, a trustee of the Maryland Academy of Sciences, a member of the Physical Fitness Commission, and the Off-Street Parking Commission.
Turnbull continued playing lacrosse after college with the prestigious Mount Washington Lacrosse Club from 1926 to 1938, including as team captain in 1930. Turnbull managed the club's ice hockey team in 1932 and 1933. He served as an assistant lacrosse coach for the club in 1939 and 1940. In 1934, he coached lacrosse at the Gilman School. Turnbull occasionally worked as a scout for Johns Hopkins, Mount Washington, and Army.
Personal life
Jack Turnbull, another Johns Hopkins lacrosse star, was Doug's younger brother. He is the namesake of the Jack Turnbull Award for college lacrosse's top attackman. In 1927, Turnbull married Virginia née Steuart, with whom he had five children, four sons and one daughter.
Turnbull died in his sleep at the age of 91 on April 12, 1996, at Fairhaven Retirement Center in Sykesville, Maryland.

Ludwigsburg porcelain is porcelain made at the Ludwigsburg Porcelain Manufactory founded by Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg, on 5 April 1758 by decree as the Herzoglich-ächte Porcelaine-Fabrique. It operated from the grounds of the Baroque Ludwigsburg Palace. After a first two decades that were artistically, but not financially, successful, the factory went into a slow decline and was closed in 1824. Much later a series of other companies used the Ludwigsburg name, but the last production was in 2010.
A similar range of wares was made to other German factories. Tableware was most often painted with European flowers, and Ludwigsburg made little in chinoiserie styles, already somewhat past their most fashionable. Figures were a relatively large proportion of production compared to other German factories, and included series of court ballet dancers, peasants, and musicians. There were some (more than usually) miniature groups on bases, with figures some three inches high, including ones showing the annual "Venetian fair" held at the court, and some groups satirizing court fashions. Beyer produced more monumental figures in an early Neoclassical style, including a set of musicians.
The original manufactory became famous for its figurines, which are interesting because they very likely were modelled directly on the costumes used in the court ballet, another enthusiasm of Duke Charles Eugene. Between 1760 and 1766 he had managed to entice to Stuttgart the innovative choreographer and ballet master Jean-Georges Noverre, then out of favour in Paris. One of Noverre's innovations was using lighter costumes allowing the dancer to move freely, shown in some of the figure groups, as the one illustrated here, but not all.
The 18th-century factory mark was two "C"s interlocked in blue, with one reversed, with or without a ducal coronet above.
History
Until the 18th century, porcelain had to be imported into Europe from East Asia and was thus rare on the continent. The first European hard-paste porcelain factory was that making Meissen porcelain from 1710, followed by Vienna porcelain in 1718, the in 1746, Fürstenberg and Nymphenburg in 1747, Berlin in 1751, and then the Frankenthal factory in 1755. France and England at the same time saw the foundations of the workshops at Chantilly in 1725, the Sèvres factory in 1738, and London's Chelsea porcelain factory in 1743.
Attempts at producing porcelain in Ludwigsburg had been made since 1724 under Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg. Ludwigsburg was a poor site for a porcelain manufactory, as it was not located near abundant woodland or clay deposits. Transportation of materials was difficult and therefore expensive. From 1751 on, Charles Eugene also attempted to make porcelain at Ludwigsburg but was unsuccessful. Then in January 1759, he hired , who had worked at Vienna, Höchst, Strasbourg, Frankenthal, and Nymphenburg, to direct Ludwigsburg's porcelain factory. Within months, Ringler was in charge of 35 employees. Among them was , a modeller who had worked at Meissen, Frankenthal, and Höchst, and Johann Wilhelm Beyer, better known for his later work as a sculptor in Vienna.
Although the porcelain manufactory was not profitable and relied on Charles Eugene's patronage, by the early 1760s it produced a large variety of high quality porcelain wares based on the duke's tastes. Most of the dancer figurines were modelled by Joseph Nees, from 1760 to 1763, and are notable for their capturing the movement of a dance. Its most successful period was between about 1764 and 1775, having its best success in Holland. By the 1790s the factory was seriously in decline. After the dukes became Kings of Württemberg on the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805, the official name of the factory changed to Herzoglich-Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Ludwigsburg ("Ducal/Royal porcelain factory Ludwigsburg"). It had never been profitable, and later dukes lost interest and resented the expense until it was closed in 1824, after attempts to find a buyer had failed. The moulds, recipes, and books were archived when the manufactory closed. The period was a difficult one financially for many German factories.
Porcelain
The Ludwigsburg body was much "greyer and smokier in tone" than other German factories. The Encyclopédie Méthodique describes Ludwigsburg porcelain as resisting sudden change in temperature and fire, but that the glazing and desired white color of the product was inferior to Frankenthal porcelain.
The first marking stamped onto Ludwigsburg porcelain consisted of two intersecting Cs topped with a crown, possibly inspiring the nickname "Kronenburg", though sometimes the crown did not appear above the letters. From 1758 to 1770, Ludwigsburg porcelain was marked with a crown and the letters "T.R.", though the arms of the Duchy of Württemberg also appeared rarely. Every piece of Ludwigsburg porcelain made from 1948 to 2009 has a "Decorator Signature" in addition to standard manufactory markings.
The largest and best collection is in the palace where it was made, in the Keramikmuseum, a branch of the Landesmuseum Württemberg, which has 2,000 pieces.
Later companies
In 1904, the Württembergische Porzellanmanufaktur Bauer & Pfeiffer, though located in Schorndorf, became the first successor to the palace manufactory under the mark of a crown and the words "Alt-Ludwigsburg". The government of the Kingdom of Württemberg allowed the company's operations, despite the questionable legality of its marks, and by 1913 it had 200 employees. In 1917, the company went public and filed for permission to use the royal manufactory's marks. This was granted in 1918 on the condition that the Württembergische Porzellanmanufaktur would add its initials (WPM) to avoid passing off. However, the company's chief decorator wanted to use the royal manufactory's markings with no alteration, and left the company over the issue. In February 1919, he formed the Porzellan-Manufaktur Alt-Ludwigsburg GmbH in Ludwigsburg itself. Alt-Ludwigsburg was sued by the Württembergische Porzellanmanufaktur in the Ludwigsburg district courts on 13 June 1919. In the final ruling, on 12 December 1919, Alt-Ludwigsburg was forced to adopt new markings and became a court-managed company that, in 1921, was entrusted with producing Notgeld. Alt-Ludwigsburg then ran into financial troubles and was dissolved in 1927, while the WPM was successful for a time before also being dissolved in 1934.
In 1926, Otto Wanner-Brandt desired to recreate the successes of the original porcelain manufactory. He purchased the manufactory's trademark rights for 50 years, but was unable to found the Porzellan-Manufaktur Ludwigsburg GmbH until 1948, in Ludwigsburg. The venture was an immediate success, as Wanner-Brandt's use of the original moulds and glaze compositions allowed patrons to order exact recreations of Ludwigsburg porcelains. The manufactory moved to Ludwigsburg Palace in 1967, and in 1994 was recognized by the Württembergische Hypothekenbank for preserving the tradition of porcelain-making in the city. The establishment of an advisory and quality control board in the next year reaffirmed that commitment for reproductions and new wares. Like other porcelain factories, the manufactory was a subsidizing company whose losses were borne by its shareholders. In 2002, those shareholders subsidized €2 million. However, it ran into financial trouble, and in 2004 was taken over by EganaGoldpfeil. When EganaGoldpfeil went bankrupt, the manufactory also filed for bankruptcy in the Ludwigsburg district courts on 29 August 2008.
After months of searching, a buyer for the manufactory was found in Lucas A.G., a Swiss holding firm with Russian investors. Now called Schlossmanufaktur Ludwigsburg GmbH, the manufacturing of contemporary porcelain at Ludwigsburg Palace resumed and the lease on space in the palace was extended to 31 December 2015. However, the business was not a success, and the last production was in 2010, when an expensive problem with the kiln developed. CEO Maxim Gennel confirmed that the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2014, but was then confident that the company would survive. A lawyer in Stuttgart, Stephan Rüdlin, became the insolvency administrator. The closure of the manufactory was announced in October 2015.

Iraia () is a former municipality in Arcadia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it became a municipal unit of the municipality of Gortynia. The municipal unit has an area of 144.002 km2. It consists of 27 villages. Population 1,552 (2011). The seat of the municipality was in Paloumpa. The municipality is named after the ancient Arcadian city of Heraia. The region was known in recent times for the construction workers (mastori) who came from the villages of Servos and Lyssarea. Pausanias describes the ancient cities of Heraia and Melaineai and their buildings. An excavation near Lyssarea uncovered buildings, mosaics, as well as gold and silver coins.
Notable people
The village of Loutra Iraias is the birthplace of the film-maker Constantinos Gavras (Costa-Gavras).

The Angerhof is a building in Munich that serves as a residential building, office building, hotel with restaurant, service location and parking garage.
Location
The location of the property is the street Oberanger near the Marienplatz and the Viktualienmarkt, between Munich's oldest monastery St. Anna and the new Jewish center on St-Jakobs-Platz. The nearest stops of the U-/S-Bahn are the Munich Marienplatz station and the subway station Sendlinger Tor.
Architecture
The Angerhof combines, in its horizontal construction, the classic uses of traditional European townhouses for living, working and going out. On the ground floor there are retail stores and restaurants, in the floors above it are offices and in the fifth and sixth levels, on a total of 4,000 square meters, condominiums were created – with three-meter-high ceilings and roof terraces of up to 100 square meters. The interior architecture is reflected in its technically elaborate facade. Behind the sand-colored terracotta façade, light artist Ingo Maurer installed digitally programmed "façade glow" made up of energy-optimized LED lights. The Angerhof created a 1,000-square-meter inner courtyard for the public that opens directly onto the newly created pedestrian zone on the lower Anger.
Construction and dates
Construction began in 2005 according to the plans of architects Otto Steidle and Johann Spengler. The topping out ceremony took place in 2007 and the completion of the approx. 38,000 square meter floor spaced property was in 2009. The total construction costs amounted to approx. 150 million Euros.
The place where the Angerhof stands today, was known for a long time in the post-war period as an "urban lumber pile". A post-war car park made of raw concrete with a gas station blocked the development plans of city construction advocate Christiane Thalgott for a long time. Lord Mayor Christian Ude (SPD) had not expected an urban construction before 2037, since that was how long the leasehold guaranteed of the parking garage existed. A solution was found when the Wöhr + Bauer GmbH managing director Wolfgang Roeck made the suggestion at the turn of the millennium to place the parking garage at the same place in an underground car park. Following the architectural competition for the Angerhof, the planning for the "Boulangerie Oberanger" followed from July to December 2003 - together by the construction department, planning department, district committee (BA) and the builder of the Angerhof, Wöhr + Bauer. On 17 February 2004, the BA, headed by Wolfgang Püschel, decided on the design from "real green" landscape architects. In May 2005, the city council approved the overall concept.
Particularities
Shortly after the start of construction, in 2006, Linde plc, as a tenant, secured almost all the office space for its new corporate headquarters.
The new building received constant positive responses from the press. Above all, critics welcomed the urban upgrading of the area. For a while, one of the penthouse apartments was considered the "most expensive apartment in Germany" and aroused great media interest.
In the high garage of the future penthouse apartments, Wöhr + Bauer GmbH put on a multimedia show about the Angers quarter on a 32hektar exhibit for Munich's 850th city birthday.
Inside the courtyard is a large molecular sculpture by Christopher Klein made out of stainless steel. The production was carried out by the company Sandmeir in Rain am Lech. The largest element of the sculpture has a diameter of over six meters.
The newly created alley between the Jewish Center and Angerhof is illuminated by two rotating light sculptures from New York artist Keith Sonnier in the colors red and blue.
The artist Andrea Schmeing-Häusler immersed in the cobblestones at the Angerhof sound stones that allow real church bells to ring through digital technology.
Architecture Prize
Angerhof Munich was nominated for the "MIPIM-Award" 2009 in the category "Business Center" on 12 March 2009, at the international real estate fair MIPIM in Cannes as one of only three buildings.

Cima Tosa is a mountain in the Brenta group (It.: Dolomiti di Brenta), a subgroup of the Rhaetian Alps in the Italian Region of Trentino-Alto Adige, with a reported height of . it is the second highest peak of the Brenta group in the southern limestone Alps after the Cima Brenta.
The height of the summit marked on the IGM maps is 3173 m, which would make it the highest peak in the Brenta Dolomites. An electronic measurement campaign in 2015 determined the new height. The change could be linked to the partial melting of the ice cap that covers it. Being the second highest peak of the Brenta group also changed Cima Tosa's prominence making its prominence 589 m above the Bocca di Brenta.
The mountain rises above Val Rendena with its 800-metre (2,600 ft) vertical north face with a steep couloir called Canalone della Tosa dividing it from its ante-peak, Crozzon di Brenta. The summit is topped by a snow cupola above the rock face, almost like a shaven head, hence the name Cima Tosa (Iocal dialect: Shaven Summit). The south-eastern side descends in a series of snowy terraces and vertical rock pillars.
Climbing history
The first men to undertake the ascent were Giuseppe Loss, a botanist and alpinism pioneer from Primiero, together with six companions. On July 18, 1865 they departed from San Lorenzo in Banale, advanced through Val d'Ambiez and having passed over the Forcolotta di Noghera approached the mountain over the vedretta d'Ambiez through the south-east slope along the trajectory that constitutes what is now known as the 'Via Normale'. Cima Tosa turned out to be accessible only by climbing through a 25-metre drop vertical rock face. They decided to climb through a wet chimney, 'il camino della Tosa' (UIAA: II), though one of the companions thought it better to stay behind. Finally they reached the top, and by doing so, they preceded an undertaking of the founder of the Alpine Club (UK), John Ball, by just four days. John Ball's account of his ascent in the 'Alpine Journal' brought the mountain into the alpinists' limelight. Loss' and Ball's itinerary would remain the only way for a number of years, while several attempts were made to reach the three consecutive summits of Crozzon di Brenta passing over the ridge between the two mountains.
A new itinerary to the summit of Cima Tosa from the south was found in 1886 by A. Migotti (Via Migotti, I/II). The local guides, notably the Nicolussi brothers from Molveno and Antonio Dallagiacomo from Madonna di Campiglio, accompanied most of the early explorers and daring wealthy tourists to the summit of this mountain and beyond to the summits of Crozzon. The guide Enrico Giordano from Molveno accompanied the Italian novelist and poet Antonio Fogazzaro to the summit of Cima Tosa in 1890. Fogazzaro expressed his impressions on the mountain in the poem "Il Pianto della Tosa". Carlo Garbari and Nino Pooli traced a new route through the eastern rock face in 1890 (200m: II).
In 1911, Giovanni Battista 'Tita' Piaz (il diavolo delle Dolomiti) and Michelson climbed through the majestic north-east face for the first time. Daredevil Piaz initially considered his 'Via Piaz' (IV+/V) itinerary too risky to be attempted again. But it would be repeated by Virgilio Neri, the same man that solo-climbed in 1929 the 'Canalone della Tosa', the glaciered couloir that descends almost vertical from the top of Cima Tosa through the north face (the classic ice-climb of the Dolomites). Neri repeated the Via Piaz in 1930 together with Mario Agostini.
During the next decades another number of classical climbing routes was opened:
Via Diretta (E wall) - 750m - IV/V (1933, Bruno Detassis, Ettore Castiglione),
Via Barbier (NE wall) - 750 m - IV+ (1965),
Via Flli. Detassis (NE wall) - 700 m - V (1962),
Via Città di Brescia - (SW wall) - 350m - V/VI- (1962, Armando Aste, Franco Solina)
Via Maestri(E wall) - 350m - IV (1975).
Many other interesting climbing itineraries and variants are available on all sides of this mountain. The classic routes of Crozzon di Brenta, essentially a pre-summit of Cima Tosa, are available at very short distance.
Views
Lake Garda is brightly visible on a clear day. Towards the north the summits and pinnacles of the central Brenta Group are all looked upon from above. Westwards a complete view of the Adamello and Presanella, while right under the snow field disappears into the Canalone della Tosa. This couloir was descended on skis the first time in 1970 by Heini Holzer and A. Tscholl and has become a classic for those engaged in extreme skiing.

Robert H. Perry is a U.S. yacht designer based in Seattle, Washington. Among his designs are some of the most successful cruising yachts in modern cruising such as the Tatoosh 42, Tayana 37 and Valiant 40.
Through his career he has designed boats for many well recognized names in the yachting industry, such as Tayana, Cheoy Lee,
Valiant, Baba, Ta Shing, Islander, Passport and Saga.
Perry has taught yacht design at Evergreen State College.
Early life
In 1957 when Robert H. Perry was twelve, he and his family moved from Sydney, Australia to Vancouver, British Columbia.
He writes that the trip made a lasting impression on him and spurred his interest in yacht design. At the beginning of his
ninth-grade year, his family moved to Mercer Island, Washington, an area renowned for its school system. Here, his
interest in sailboats really clicked. He met famous designer William Garden, joined the local yacht club, and
excelled at mechanical drawing. Perry graduated with a 1.69 GPA from Mercer Island High School in 1964. The only local college
that would accept him (and on a probationary status) was Seattle University.
He enrolled as a mechanical engineering student, but dropped out after four years.
Although the Vietnam War was growing and called him for enlistment,
his childhood history of petit mal seizures made him ineligible.
Career
In 1970, Jay Benford gave Perry his first job as a yacht designer. Benford was promoting ferro-cement boats in Seattle. Soon, Perry had his first published design, a 47-foot ketch in National Fisherman. Boatbuilder John Edwards who would found Hans Christian Yachts sent a letter to Perry in response to the 47-foot ketch. Eventually, this relationship would lead to Perry's first design, the CT 54, a clipper-bowed ketch. Ted Brewer consulted and helped Perry with the design. Ta Chaio Brothers, a Taiwanese yard built the CT 54 and the larger CT 65.
Simultaneously, Perry was working on what would be his landmark design, the Valiant 40. Along with Nathan Rothman and Sylvia and Stanley Dabney, he would design the first "performance cruiser." They all met at Benford's ferro-cement studio, but even as Perry moved to work for Dick Carter they continued to strategize about building a bluewater cruising boat like the Westsail 32 that would have better performance.
Rothman contacted Uniflite, a Bellingham, Washington boat builder, and by 1974 the first Valiant rolled off their line. The design combined the classic canoe stern cruiser shape with a fin keel and skeg hung rudder instead of the traditional full keel.
These two starts led to more design commissions for Islander Yachts and Tayana Yachts. Perry became a popular designer for Taiwan-built boats.
Recent
Perry designed the latest (and largest) yacht for Pacific Seacraft, the SouthSea 61, beginning work in 2007.
Perry also designed a unique long narrow 62 foot double ended daysailer built at the Northwest School of Wooden Boatbuilding in Port Hadlock, Washington, and launched in March, 2014. This design was inspired by a number of famous classic vessels including vessels designed by L. Francis Herreshoff, Bruce King and Bill Garden. Perry was selected to create the design due to his past very successful double ended designs and the recent success of a number of his designs on the race course.

Donald Duck talk, formally called buccal speech, is an alaryngeal form of vocalization which uses the inner cheek to produce sound rather than the larynx. The speech is most closely associated with the Disney cartoon character, Donald Duck, whose voice was created by Clarence Nash, who performed it from 1934 to 1984.
Nash discovered buccal speech while trying to mimic his pet goat Mary. In his days before Disney, Nash performed in vaudeville shows where he often spoke in his "nervous baby goat" voice. Later when he auditioned at Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney interpreted Nash's voice as that of a duck, at which point the idea for Donald Duck came about. Buccal speech was also used by voice actor Red Coffey for the character Quacker in MGM cartoons, and by Jimmy Weldon for the character Yakky Doodle in Hanna-Barbera cartoons.
Production
Buccal speech is created with one of the buccal or cheek sides of the vocal tract. Both the air chamber and the replacement glottis are formed between the cheek and upper jaw. Buccal speech is produced when a person creates an airbubble between the cheek and the jaw on one side and then uses muscular action to drive the air through a small gap between or behind the teeth into the mouth. The sound so produced makes a high rough sound. This then is articulated to make speech. The speech sounds made in this way are difficult to hear and have a raised pitch. The technique can also be used to sing, and is usually acquired as a taught or self-learned skill and used for entertainment.
Other cases
Donald Duck-like speech is described to occur after pseudobulbar dysarthria in which speech gains a high-pitched "strangulated" quality.
Donald Duck speech effect is described (usually as an undesired phenomenon) in audio engineering when speech is time compressed, rate controlled, or accelerated.
The term is sometimes also used to refer to the frequency-shifted speech from an improperly tuned single-sideband modulation (SSB) radiotelephone receiver, or the (nearly unintelligible) sound of a SSB signal on a conventional amplitude modulation (AM) receiver.
A high pitched nasal voice resembling Donald Duck is sometimes noted in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome.

Pig is a simple, collecting card game of 20th century American origin suitable for three to thirteen players that is played with a 52-card French-suited pack. It has two very similar and well known variants – Donkey and Spoons. It is often classed as a children's game. It may be descended from an old game called Vive l'Amour.
History
Pig is first recorded in 1947 by Frey who describes the name as a "bowdlerism" of "Vive l'Amour". The latter was an old, four-player game in which the aim was to be first to collect all 13 cards of one suit and Pig was thus a "modern simplification".{{efn|Frey does not say where he gets this information, but a mid-19th century source records that when the Patriarch of Venice, Jacques Monico was playing cards, he called "Vive Marie!" whenever the rules required him to shout "Vive l'Amour!"<ref>The North British Review (1854), p. 40.</ref>}} Although intended for children, the game was also apparently played by adults with special cards in those parts of the US where standard playing cards are taboo.
In 1957, a variant, Donkey, is mentioned by Culbertson. The rules are identical; the main exception being that, whereas in Pig players touch their noses when they acquire a quartet, in Donkey, a number of objects – one fewer than the number of players – is placed in the middle and the first player with a quartet calls "Donkey!" and takes one. The subtle distinction between the two games is missed by some later authors. Gibson (1974) states that the games are "practically identical", while Maguire describes Pig but calls it Donkey. Maguire introduces the rule that 'donkeys' receive the letters of the word D-O-N-K-E-Y and the first to spell the whole word is the overall loser. He also records the game of Spoons for the first time, describing it as a variant in which, however, the player who stays to the end without spelling S-P-O-O-N-S is the overall winner. Arnold equates Pig and Donkey, while Spadaccini and Bicycle Cards faithfully describe the original Pig.Bicycle Cards (2001), p. 292. Katz conflates Pig with Spoons and uses the whole pack instead of the selecting and shuffling 4 quartets per player, but adds some interesting variations. A good summary of the rules and variations for Pig and Spoons is at pagat.com.
Rules
Pig
The rules have changed little over time. The earliest and most basic rules are as follows:
Pig is suitable for six to ten-year olds. Three to thirteen may play, but four to seven is best. The aim is to be first to collect a quartet, i.e. four cards of the same rank, known as a book. The game requires as many quartets as there are players e.g. if five play, five quartets are used from a 52-card pack and the rest laid aside. Players are dealt four cards each which they pick up and view. Then all the players simultaneously discard one card face down to their left and, after doing so, they all pick up the card from the player to their right. A player who collects a book immediately touches the nose with a finger. As soon as they spot this, the other players do likewise. The last player to touch the nose is the Pig and loses the deal.
According to Culbertson, the game is best for more than three players – "the more the merrier" – and is often played by adults at parties as an ice-breaker.
Variations:
Go! or Start!: The dealer calls "Go" or "Start" to initiate the passing each time. Once all players have passed their cards to the left, if no-one has a quartet, play continues until any player has a quartet._ (2014), p. 197.
P-I-G: Each player has three lives scored as P-I-G. The first player to be assigned P-I-G is the overall loser and, optionally, has to oink like a pig. Alternatively, whoever is assigned P-I-G is eliminated from the game so that the last player standing is the overall winner.
Pointing: Players point to their noses instead of touching them.
Twin Pack: For more than 13 players, two packs may be used.
Two Winners: The loser drops out after each deal, and the last two left in are joint winners.
Donkey
Having probably emerged by 1945, the rules of a variant called Donkey are described in the 1957 Culbertson's Hoyle. They are the same as in the early version of Pig above, except that "a number of chips, matches, or other tokens" are used; always one fewer than the number of active players. These objects are placed in the middle. A player who collects four of a kind, calls "Donkey" and takes a chip, etc. The others now also pick up a chip if they can and the player left without a chip is the Donkey and loses the game.
Maguire (1990) adds the requirement for a scorekeeper and introduces the rule that, each time a player becomes the Donkey, that player is assigned a letter from that word. The first player to be assigned all the letters, i.e. D-O-N-K-E-Y, is the loser.
Variations:
Swap!: The dealer calls "Swap" each time to initiate the exchanging of cards.
Prizes: For a party game, prizes are used as the objects.
Spoons
The name Spoons first appears in 1990. It is essentially Donkey using spoons as the objects to be picked up. The player left without a spoon in each deal is assigned a letter from the word 'spoons'. The player who gets S-P-O-O-N-S is eliminated from the game, and the game continues. The last player standing is the winner.
Variations:
Stockpile: A whole 52-card pack is used, and so there is a stockpile from which the dealer draws each time and a discard pile to which the player on his or her right passes a card each time.
Five Cards: Players are dealt five cards each, but still only need a four-of-a-kind to pick up a spoon.
Extreme Spoons/Hidden Spoons: Instead of the middle of the play area as usual, the spoons are placed in some inconvenient location nearby.BRI (2012).
Series: As its name implies, it is a series of games with one player eliminated each time, and the last player standing is the overall winner.
Two Winners: Similar to Series, but the last two players left in are joint winners.
Tongue
In the game of Tongue, players quietly stick out their tongue when they have a quartet.
Tactics
Tactics may include:Bluffing: Bluffing is allowed. Spoons may be reached at any time as long as they are not touched. This may distract the others or even cause players to grab a spoon prematurely which may result in their elimination.Eyes on the spoons: Players keep an eye on the number of spoons in case one has been taken without anyone noticing.
Continuing to play. After sticking out a tongue or collecting a spoon, a player may continue to pass and pick up to confuse other players, but must keep the quartet intact. This is not possible with Pig as one hand is needed to touch the nose.

Sebesi (also Sebeezee, or 'Bleezie') is an Indonesian island in the Sunda Strait, between Java and Sumatra, and part of the province of Lampung. It rises to a height of and lies about north of the Krakatoa Archipelago; it is the closest large island to Krakatoa, about the same area and height as the remnant of Rakata. Like Krakatoa, it too is volcanic, although there are no dated eruptions known. (A single report of an eruption in 1680 seems to be a confusion with the Krakatoa eruption reported from that year.) Unlike the Krakatoa Archipelago, Sebesi has permanent streams and is inhabited. habitation is concentrated most heavily on the northern and eastern coasts of the island.
Sebesi was devastated during the 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa. Official records give approximately 3,000 people killed, with 1,000 of these being 'non-residents'.
By 1890, Sebesi was being re-cleared. It is believed that since it lies closer to Sumatra, it has served as a 'stepping stone' for much of the flora and fauna which was re-established at Krakatoa. By the 1920s, settlers had returned, and today Sebesi is virtually completely cultivated, with only a small area at the peak and some mangrove swamps still natural.
In December 2018, an eruption of Mount Anak Krakatau triggered a tsunami that hit the costal areas of the island, as well as several smaller islands nearby.

The Bohemian Girl is a 1922 British romance film directed by Harley Knoles and starring Gladys Cooper, Ivor Novello, and C. Aubrey Smith. It was inspired by the opera The Bohemian Girl by Michael William Balfe and Alfred Bunn, which was in turn based on a novel La Gitanilla by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally released at 70 minutes, the surviving print is missing the first two reels and small portion of the last, timing at 46 minutes.
Synopsis
Arline is the little daughter of Count Arnheim, governor of an Austrian province who lives in feudal splendor near a forest where a Gypsy Queen and her tribe encamp, with her lieutenant, Devilshoof. He comes by chance upon Thaddeus, a young Polish refugee pursued by Austrian soldiers. Devilshoof protects the youth and offers him the concealment of gypsy garb. Arline escapes from the castle and is saved from a bear by Thaddeus, who with Devilshoof returns her to her father. It is in the midst of a banquet, that Thaddeus, a Pole, refuses to drink a toast to the Austrian emperor. Thaddeus is ejected in disgrace and Devilshoof vows to be revenged. He returns and, when the chance comes, carries Arline away. Twelve years of wandering finds Thaddeus part of the gypsy caravan and Arline grown to beautiful womanhood. Their love is discovered by the Gypsy Queen and because of her desire to wed Thaddeus she swears to accomplish the downfall of Arline. Count Florestein, a friend of Arline's father, is robbed of a medallion by the gypsies, who yield it to their Queen. This jewel the Queen gives to Arline when the girl sets out for a fair where she tells fortunes. Among her patrons is Florestein, who recognizes his medallion and orders the arrest of Arline. She is taken to the castle for trial, where, her own father is her judge. Count Arnheim is moved to gentleness he cannot understand and when the gypsy girl tells him her name he tremblingly summons the old nurse, who instantly recognizes her lost darling.

José Alfonso Pizarro, Marquis del Villar (sometimes given as José Alonso Pizarro) (1689 in Murcia – 1762 in Madrid) was a Spanish naval officer and colonial administrator. From November 6, 1749 to November 24, 1753 he was viceroy of the Spanish Viceroyalty of New Granada.
Biography
As a youth Pizarro entered the naval service of the Knights of Malta. He was a knight of the Order and gentleman of the bedchamber of the king. Later he served in the Spanish navy, rising to the rank of rear admiral.
When the Spanish government heard of the expedition of British Admiral George Anson to the Pacific, a fleet of two ships of the line and four frigates was despatched with a regiment of infantry for Chile. The fleet, under Pizarro's command, left in October 1740, and arrived on January 5, 1741 in the Río de la Plata. Hearing that Anson was refitting in Santa Catharina for entering the Pacific by the Strait of Le Maire (off the southeast tip of Tierra del Fuego), Pizarro sailed at once to intercept him.
His squadron consisting of the ships Asia (64 guns), Guipúzcoa (74), Hermione (54) and Esperanza (50) and the frigate San Estéban (40). However, he lost one ship and one frigate in a storm and was obliged to put back for repairs. On the second attempt, with two vessels, he was again dismasted and returned to Montevideo. From there, he despatched the frigate Esperanza to the Pacific, and crossed the Andes to Peru, where for some time he exercised the functions of naval commander-in-chief.
After the peace with England, Pizarro left the frigate on the Pacific station and returned overland to Montevideo, where he found his flagship, the Asia, refitted. He sailed in the Asia for Europe in November 1745. Part of the crew consisted of Indians from the pampas, who is a one night rose against the Spaniards, killing the watch on deck. They had gained possession of the vessel when Pizarro succeeded in killing the ringleader, and in the confusion drove the mutineers into the sea.
On his arrival at Cádiz in January 1746, Pizarro was promoted to vice-admiral. In 1749, he was appointed viceroy and captain general of New Granada. He arrived in Cartagena de Indias in the frigate Uaricochea in early November 1749, and was sworn in by his predecessor, Sebastián de Eslava.
Pizarro formed a monopoly of aguardiente, which provoked riots. He reorganized the mint. He improved communications with Bogotá. He began the construction of the mortar and stone bridge of San Antonio, over the junction of the Río San Agustín and the Río San Francisco in Bogotá. This latter work was completed by his successor, José Solís Folch de Cardona.
Pizarro served until 1753, when he turned over the government to his successor and returned to Spain.

Reception
"Ponies" won the 2010 Nebula Award for Best Short Story, (tied with "How Interesting: A Tiny Man" by Harlan Ellison), and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story and the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story.
Strange Horizons called the story a "grotesque".Lois Tilton considered the story to be "Highly Unsubtle." Chad Orzel described the story as "just dreadful", based on a central idea that was "preposterously contrived" and "a gigantic and unsubtle literalized metaphor", and with "essentially no plot."

St Quivox is a small Scottish village north of Ayr and east of Prestwick. It lies on the B7035 east of the A77.
History
The uniquely named village is said to be a corruption either of St Kevoca, St Kevoch or St Kennocha. It is thought to have been a Christian settlement since the 8th century. It was previously known as Sanchar (Sanquhar) in Kyle, and was renamed after its church (and its saint) in the Middle Ages.
Auchincruive House and church lie within the parish boundary. Auchincruive church was described as a "rectory" in 1208 and from 1221 to 1238 was linked to a Gilbertine Priory at Dalmilling or Dalmulin, the only Gilbertine Priory in Scotland, but from 1238 to 1560 was under the control of Paisley Abbey before becoming a parish church.
After the Reformation the church came under the patronage of Alan, 4th Lord Cathcart who then owned Auchincruive House and he instructed a repair and remodelling of the church to Protestant standards in 1595. The church was substantially rebuilt in the 18th century.
The Scottish Agricultural College was built in the parish in 1927.

The 2016 Pure Michigan 400 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race held on August 28, 2016 at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Michigan. Contested over 200 laps on the D-shaped oval, it was the 24th race of the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season.
Kyle Larson won his first career Cup Series race, the race had thirteen lead changes among different drivers and four cautions for
17 laps.
Report
Background
Michigan International Speedway (MIS) is a moderate-banked D-shaped speedway located off U.S. Highway 12 on more than approximately south of the village of Brooklyn, in the scenic Irish Hills area of southeastern Michigan. The track is used primarily for NASCAR events. It is sometimes known as a "sister track" to Texas World Speedway, and was used as the basis of Auto Club Speedway. The track is owned by International Speedway Corporation (ISC). Michigan International Speedway is recognized as one of motorsports' premier facilities because of its wide racing surface and high banking (by open-wheel standards; the 18-degree banking is modest by stock car standards). Michigan is the fastest track in NASCAR due to its wide, sweeping corners and long straightaways; typical qualifying speeds are in excess of and corner entry speeds are anywhere from after the 2012 repaving of the track.
Aero package
NASCAR announced in late July that the modified aerodynamic package used at Michigan in June and Kentucky in July was used one more time this past weekend at Michigan. In addition to the aero changes used in the 2016 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, there was a reduction in spoiler size from , a reduction of the splitter and resizing the deck fin.
Entry list
The preliminary entry list for the race included 40 cars and was released on August 22, 2016 at 3:36 p.m. Eastern time. Alex Bowman drove in place of Dale Earnhardt Jr. this weekend as he recovers from a concussion.
First practice
Martin Truex Jr. was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 35.724 and a speed of .
Qualifying
Joey Logano scored the pole for the race with a time of 35.697 and a speed of . Logano said afterwards that he was "excited (about the pole). I thought our car was really good in race trim earlier. … In qualifying trim, I didn't think we would make it happen today, but on the last run, Todd Gordon (crew chief) made some good adjustments and gave me a pep talk, and game on. I was ready to go. I was going to drive the heck out of it and hope for the best. Once you get into the last round (of qualifying) and you are eighth on the board, what is the difference between eighth and 12th? You might as well hammer down.” He also added that Michigan "is very unique. For one, you're going 220 mph. That's freaking insane. But it's a lot of fun."
"It was just an awesome day for this Lowe's race car and this Lowe's race team," Jimmie Johnson said after qualifying second. "We keep stacking pennies and making this car better and better. My hat's off to everyone at Hendrick Motorsports and all the hard work they're putting into things. Great practice and great qualifying. We need some more practice sessions (Saturday) and roll them into a good race."

Race
First half
Under mostly cloudy Michigan skies, Joey Logano led the field to the green flag at 2:18 p.m. The field started to string out after five laps as is typical at a track like Michigan. Chris Buescher reported engine issues early on that turned out to be a broken spark plug. He said after the race that he knew "it isn't fun opening a hood of a race car that is as hot as it is and trying to work on it. Kudos to my guys for keeping their heads down and working at it and getting it fixed. Usually when you have engine trouble you are along for the ride. It ended up being something a little more simple than I guess we originally figured. We got back up and running and made some laps, and made a really terrible day into just an okay day. We will have to get it back at the shop and tear it down and take a look at it — and diagnose from there to see if it was a freak accident or something we need to look at going forward.” The first caution of the race flew on lap 21. It was a scheduled competition caution for overnight rain. Regan Smith opted not to pit and assumed the race lead. He pitted the next lap and handed the lead back to Logano. Brian Scott was tagged for his crew being over the wall too soon and restarted the race from the tail end of the field.
The race restarted on lap 25. Kevin Harvick took the lead from Logano going into turn 1. The second caution of the race flew the same lap for a single-car spin. Exiting turn 4, Kyle Busch got loose and spun out.
The race restarted on lap 30. By lap 39, Alex Bowman – who was subbing for Dale Earnhardt Jr. – fell from sixth to out of the top-10 in what was later determined to be an ignition issue. Denny Hamlin radioed in electrical issues, but these subsided after a while. Martin Truex Jr. powered by Harvick on the frontstretch to take the lead on lap 59. Ryan Blaney hit pit road on lap 63 and triggered a rush of green flag pit stops. Truex pitted from the lead a lap later and handed the lead to Harvick. Truex lost time on pit road after his car fell off the jack. Harvick pitted from the lead on lap 67 and handed the lead to Brad Keselowski. He pitted on lap 71 and the lead cycled to Jimmie Johnson.
The routine of strung-out racing was the norm for the next 36 laps until Blaney kicked off the next round of green flag stops on lap 107. Johnson pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Chase Elliott. He pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Keselowski. He would stay out for another eight laps before pitting on lap 117 and the lead cycled to Elliott before debris brought out the third caution of the race on lap 118.
Second half
The race restarted on lap 126. Kyle Larson beat Elliott going into turn 1 to take the lead. After that, the field settled into place until Logano kicked off the final round of green flag stops with 47 laps to go. Larson pitted from the lead, along with Elliott, with 44 laps to go and handed the lead to Keselowski. Elliott beat Larson off pit road, which allowed him to take the lead when the pit stop cycle concluded. Keselowski pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Matt Kenseth. He pitted with 35 laps to go and handed the lead to Ryan Newman. He pitted with 33 laps to go and handed the lead to Greg Biffle. He pitted with 32 laps to go and the lead cycled to Elliott. During the pit cycle, Aric Almirola was black-flagged for an uncontrolled tire and was forced to serve a pass through penalty.
A tire carcass that came off the No. 46 of Michael Annett brought out the fourth caution of the race with 13 laps to go.
The race restarted with nine laps to go. Larson was pushed to the lead by Keselowski and drove on to score the victory.
Post-race
Driver comments
Larson said in victory lane that his team has "worked hard to get a win, and we just haven't done it Finally, all the hard work by everybody, the hundreds of people at our race shop, people who have gotten me to the Cup Series all paid off. I couldn't quite catch my breath there after I got out of the car because I spent two minutes screaming. I was so pumped up. It was pretty special, and I will remember it forever. I have been close a few times in my career and to get it before my 100th career start next week is pretty awesome." He also took time to dedicate the victory to his friend, the late Bryan Clauson, saying "This one is for the Clauson family. We really miss Bryan. We love you guys. We're going to miss him. We parked it for him, so that's really cool."
Following a runner-up finish, Elliott said he "made another mistake. Had two opportunities to get out front there and kind of control the race and let Kyle get a better start on me. I spun the tires and didn't do my job right. It's about as simple as that. When your tires are spinning, you aren't going forward. It's definitely unfortunate. I hate to let my guys down like that. They bailed me out a few times today, and I gave it right back.''
All in all, a lot to be proud of,” Keselowski said of his third-place finish. “Seems like every time we come here, we want to win so bad, we run third or fourth every time, which is really good in the Sprint Cup Series, but it is certainly not the win we've been looking for. I think this package is pretty strong. I like it a lot, personally. It's not perfect, that's for sure. There's a lot of stuff to still work on. I think it's a smaller improvement in showcasing driver talent to win races.”
Penalties
On the Wednesday following the race, the No. 2 team was issued a P2 penalty for failing post-race technical inspection. As a result, Keselowski and Paul Wolfe were fined $15,000, and Keselowski was docked 10 points.

Dorman Long & Co was a UK steel producer, later diversifying into bridge building. It was once listed on the London Stock Exchange.
History
The company was founded by Arthur Dorman and Albert de Lande Long when they acquired West Marsh Iron Works in 1875. In the 1920s Dorman Long took over the concerns of Bell Brothers and Bolckow and Vaughan and diversified into the construction of bridges. In 1938 Ellis Hunter took over as Managing Director and he continued to lead the business until 1961.
In 1967 Dorman Long was nationalised, along with 13 other British steel-making firms, becoming subsumed into the government-owned British Steel Corporation. In 1982 Redpath Dorman Long, the engineering part of the business, was acquired by Trafalgar House who in 1990 merged it into Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company in Darlington.
Iron and steel
Iron-making has been known in Cleveland since the Romans found iron slags in North Yorkshire, with small-scale iron-making known to have taken place at Rievaulx and Whitby Abbeys and at Gisborough Priory in the 17th century.
Some of the key events connected with iron-making in Cleveland:
1837: The first Cleveland ironstone mine opens, at Grosmont, for the Losh, Wilson and Bell ironworks.
1841: Bolckow and Vaughan open the first ironworks in Middlesbrough.
1850: 8 June – The Discovery of the Cleveland Main Seam of Ironstone at Eston by Ironmaster John Vaughan and mining engineer John Marley both of Bolckow & Vaughan. The Cleveland iron rush begins.
1865: 30 blast furnaces operate within six miles (10 km) of Middlesbrough and one million tonnes per annum (TPA) of iron are produced to make the area one of the world's major centres of iron production.
1879: Sidney Gilchrist Thomas arrives in Cleveland and introduces the first commercial steel.
1903: Partial amalgamation of Bell companies with Dorman Long.
1917: The Redcar steel plant is opened, making steel in the open hearth process.
1928-9: Dorman Long takes over residues of Bell and Bolckow Vaughan.
1946: Dorman Long purchases of land between the Redcar and Cleveland Works to build the Lackenby development.
1955: The Dorman Long tower, a combined coal silo, firefighting water tower, and control room, was built on the Teesside steelworks site.
1967: Dorman Long, South Durham Steel Iron Co, and Stewarts and Lloyds come together to create British Steel and Tube Ltd.
1967: The steel industry is nationalised and the British Steel Corporation is born.
1989: Company is privatised becoming British Steel plc.
1990: Merged with The Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company, Darlington.
1999: British Steel plc merges with the Dutch steel and aluminium company Koninklijke Hoogovens to become Corus Group.
2015: Former Dorman Long Steel plant on Teesside ceased production after SSI mothballed the Redcar works following a global downturn in the price of steel and later announced its UK arm had gone into liquidation.
2021: Cleveland Bridge goes into administration.
2021: The Dorman Long tower is demolished, despite its Grade II listed status.
Bridge building
The most famous bridge ever constructed by a Teesside company was Dorman Long's Sydney Harbour Bridge of 1932, of similar construction to but, contrary to popular belief, not modelled on the 1928 Tyne Bridge, a construction regarded as the symbol of Tyneside's Geordie pride, but also a product of Dorman Long's Teesside workmanship. The greatest example of Dorman Long's work in Teesside itself is the single-span Newport Lifting Bridge (a Grade II Listed Building). Opened by the Duke of York in February 1934 it was England's first vertical lift bridge.
List of bridges constructed
The following is a list of some of the bridges built by the Dorman Long: it is not fully comprehensive.
Dorman Museum
In 1904 Sir Arthur Dorman of Dorman Long gave the Dorman Museum to Middlesbrough in honour of his youngest son, George Lockwood Dorman, an avid collector who died in the Boer War. Amongst the museum's exhibits is a collection of ceramics from the local Linthorpe Pottery, which was known for its iridescent glazes which, at the time, were not produced anywhere else in Europe.
Dorman Long Tower
The Dorman Long tower was built from 1955–56 as a coking plant for steel production. The tower was an early example of brutalist architecture. It was scheduled to be demolished in 2021 due its poor state of repair and granted Grade II listed status, in an emergency listing by Historic England on 10 September 2021. The emergency listing cited its significance as a "recognised and celebrated example of early Brutalist architecture", a "nationally unique surviving structure from the twentieth-century coal, iron and steel industries" as well as "for its association with, and an advert for, Dorman Long which dominated the steel and heavy engineering industry of Teesside".
In one of her first acts as Culture Secretary, Nadine Dorries revoked the listingamidst accusations of "cultural vandalism"enabling demolition of the building to be scheduled. The tower was demolished between 00:00 and 00:20 on 19 September 2021 in a series of controlled explosions.

The Arriflex 235 is a lightweight 35mm MOS movie camera released in 2003 by ARRI.
Function
The number reflects its position as a smaller and lighter companion camera to the Arriflex 435 and the fact that it is designed for 35 mm film.
In contrast to the Arriflex 35 IIC, it has an adjustable reflex shutter from 11.2° to 180°. This shutter can be adjusted manually with a tool through the open mount (in the same year that Arri released the Arriflex 435 Xtreme which adjusted the shutter electronically). The camera uses a 54 mm PL mount. In contrast to the Arriflex 435 it uses a single registration pin. The ground glass is identical to the 435.
The motor power ranges from 20-35V and is usually powered by an onboard battery on the AC side of the camera. The Arri 235 has an SDI video output and several power outputs for camera accessories, such as RCU, WRC, ICU or ESU.
The camera can shoot between 1 and 60 fps. The motor also has a reverse mode which runs at 25 fps.
The camera body with finder weighs 7.7 lbs (3,5 kg), which makes it one of the most lightweight 35mm movie cameras.
Therefore, it is commonly used for handheld or steadycam shots.
There are two types of magazines, a “dolphin” shoulder magazine (as seen in the picture), which was made in both 200 and 400-foot capacities, as well as a 400-foot vertical steadicam mag. It is also backwards compatible with Arriflex 2C, Arriflex 3, and Arriflex 435 mags as long as each is 400 foot size or less.

Matthew 5:13 is the thirteenth verse of the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. It is part of the Sermon on the Mount, the first of a series of metaphors immediately following the Beatitudes.
Content
The text in Koine Greek is:
There is a variant reading in the Textus Receptus, which reads:
The translation of the King James Bible reads:
The World English Bible translates the passage as:
Parallels
The verse is paralleled in Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34–35 also has a version of this text similar to the one in Mark.
There are a wide number of references to salt in the Old Testament. Leviticus 2:13, Numbers 18:19, and 2 Chronicles 13:5 all present salt as a sign of God's covenant. Exodus 30:35, Ezekiel 16:4 and 43:24, and 2 Kings 2:21 all present salt as a purifying agent.
Salt as a metaphor
The exact meaning of the expression is disputed, in part because salt had a wide number of uses in the ancient world.
Salt was extremely important in the time period when Matthew was written, and ancient communities knew that salt was a requirement of life. It was most used as a preservative; this use was important enough that salt was sometimes even used as currency, from which the word salary originates. The most common interpretation of this verse is a reference to salt as a preservative, and to thus see the duty of the disciples as preserving the purity of the world.
Many fertilizers use salts in appropriate quantities. Robert H. Gundry and others note that salt was a minor but essential ingredient in fertilizer, and Gundry suggests that earth () should be translated as soil, and the disciples are thus to help the world grow and prosper. Many scholars disagree with Gundry's translation of earth as soil: most see it as referring to the world and in Eduard Schweizer's words "the totality of mankind," even though the more common word used for this purpose is and that is used extensively as "land" or as physical earth. George Shillington feels that the Greek word for salt here refers to the chemical agent used in ancient times to fertilize fields rather than the edible salt used to preserve meat or flavor foods, indicating that the disciples are to bring new life to the world. Alan Kreider expounds upon this idea and notes various sources which led him to share this interpretation. Willard Swartley states that by obeying the Golden Rule one becomes the fertilizing salt of the earth. Phil Schmidt also believes that the disciples are meant to stimulate growth and positively affect the world.
Schweizer notes that a common Jewish expression at the time was to call the Laws the "salt and the light" of the world, which may mean this section is an introduction to the discussion of Mosaic law that will soon commence. In the Rabbinic literature of the period salt was a metaphor for wisdom.
Salt also played role in ritual purity and all sacrifices had to contain salt. John Nolland argues that the many different uses of salt show its importance in the life of the period, and it is this importance of the disciples that is being referenced.
Ancient peoples sometimes put salt on the wicks of lamps to increase their brightness.
Losing saltiness
The issue of salt losing its flavour is somewhat problematic. Salt itself, sodium chloride (), is extremely stable and cannot lose its flavour. France notes that Jesus was giving a lesson in moral philosophy and "not teaching chemistry"; to him, whether or not the proverbial image is factually accurate is of little relevance to the actual message of this verse. Nolland considers the impossibility of what is described as deliberate, it is counter to nature that salt lose its flavour, just as it is counter to God's will that the disciples lose faith.
The most common explanation for this is that what would have been called salt in that era was quite impure, containing a wide array of other compounds. Of the substances in this mix the was the most soluble in water and if exposed to moisture they would disappear leaving a white powder looking just like salt, but not having its flavour or its preservative abilities. The salt used in the area mostly came from mines around the Dead Sea and material extracted from that area demonstrates these same properties today. Gundry notes that some other explanations have been advanced. Salt was extremely valuable and unscrupulous merchants may have replaced the salt with other substances. For some purposes gypsum was added to salt, but this would erase its flavour and make it unfit for consumption.
Albert Barnes, in his Notes on the Bible (1834) says:
In eastern countries, however, the salt used was impure, or mingled with vegetable or earthy substances, so that it might lose the whole of its saltiness, and a considerable quantity of earthy matter remain. This was good for nothing, except that it was used to place in paths, or walks, as we use gravel. This kind of salt is common still in that country. It is found in the earth in veins or layers, and when exposed to the sun and rain, loses its saltiness entirely. Maundrell says, "I broke a piece of it, of which that part that was exposed to the rain, sun, and air, though it had the sparks and particles of salt, yet it had perfectly lost its savour. The inner part, which was connected to the rock, retained its savour, as I found by proof."
Additionally, William McClure Thomson in the nineteenth century says:
However, Anglican Bishop Charles Ellicott referred to Henry Maundrell's observation from the latter's travels, around 1690, and noted that Maundrell said he "found lumps of rock-salt there which had become flavourless", adding that he was "not aware that this has been confirmed by recent travelers".
Schweizer notes that some early versions have this verse read "earth lose its salt" rather than "salt lose its flavour" and is thus an illustration of how important the disciples are to the world. Hill notes that there is an entirely different understanding, which is that Jesus was well aware that salt cannot lose its flavour and the message is that if the disciples remain true to their Christianity they will never lose their influence and importance.
Foolishness
The literal translation of the Greek , "loses its savour", is "becomes foolish". In Aramaic the same term is used for losing savour and becoming foolish. Some have speculated that "became foolish" is thus a mistranslation by someone who did not realize the dual meaning of the Aramaic. Gundry feels that the idea of foolish salt is such "utter nonsense" that no translator would ever make such a mistake; he feels it is more likely that the Semitic expression had been assimilated into Greek and that became foolish was an expression for losing savour. English language translators universally accept that the verse is talking about flavour rather than intelligence. Some scholars do feel that this may be wordplay related to the Rabbinic use of salt as a metaphor for intelligence.
Trodden under foot
Gundry notes that at the time garbage would have been disposed of by throwing it out into the street. This explains why once the salt is cast out it will be trodden under foot of men.
In culture
Matthew 5:13 is a very well-known verse; "salt of the earth" has become a common English expression. Clarke notes that the phrase first appeared in the Tyndale New Testament of 1525. The modern usage of the phrase is somewhat separate from its scriptural origins. Today it refers to someone who is humble and lacking pretension. Due to its fame it has occurred a number of times in art and popular culture, but as Siebald notes usually these are based on the secular understanding of the term. It has been the title of an important 1954 film, a John Godber play, a song on The Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet, and a non-fiction work by Uys Krige. Both Algernon Swinburne and D.H. Lawrence wrote poems by this name. In Middle English literature the expression had a different meaning somewhat closer to the scripture, mostly being used to refer to the clergy. This usage is found both in Chaucer's "The Summoner's Tale" and Piers Plowman.
Along with Matthew 5:14, this verse became the theme of World Youth Day 2002: "You are the salt of the earth [...] you are the light of the world".

History of salt
The Varadaraja Perumal Temple in Shoolagiri, Tamil Nadu India is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
Temple
The Varadaraja Perumal Temple is located in Shoolagiri in Krishnagiri District, Tamil Nadu. This temple is an ancient and reputed Vishnu temple. This temple has been constructed by many kings over a period of time. Arjuna consecrated this temple during the exile period in Mahabharata time. The garbhagraha of this temple was built by Chola kings. The front hall (mantapam) was constructed by Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagara empire. Later, Hoysala kings, Palayakarars and Vijayanagara empire's small kings expanded this temple gradually and worshiped.
Legend
In Dvapara Yuga, when Pancha Pandavas lost in the gambling to Duryodhana, they were condemned to exile in the forest, as per the terms of the gambling. During the exile period, pancha pandavas went to many places and came to Shoolagiri as well. In Shoolagiri, Arjuna consecrated Varadaraja Perumal and worshipped Him. As a mark of the arrival of Pancha Pandavas to this place, there are 5 big rocks together in the Shoolagiri hill. As the Shoolagiri hill resembles trident (Shoolam in Tamil), this place got the name as 'Shoolagiri' over the period of time.
Speciality
Varadaraja Perumal faces west in this temple. Mother Perundevi Mahalakshmi faces east in a separate sanctum. Every year during the Utharanyana period (mid January to mid July), the sun rays will fall on the feet of Lord Varadaraja Perumal during sun set.
Festival
Every year on 21 May, Varadaraja Perumal jayanthi will be celebrated with special poojas, homams and kalaynotsavam to Varadaraj Perumal and Thayaar Perundevi Mahalakshmi Devi.
Garuda Seva will happen during Vaikunta Ekadasi and also in Margazhi Tamil month (mid December – mid January). This temple has the biggest Garuda vahanam, compared to all the temples in the nearby areas.

Kurt Gustav Adolf Max Leibbrand (1914-1985) was a German civil engineer, professor, and consultant transport engineer. In July 1961, he was arrested and charged with murder for the deaths of 26 unarmed Italian volunteers who were shot during the German retreat from France in August 1944, allegedly on the regimental orders he issued. Although the court only found him culpable for manslaughter, he was not sentenced because the manslaughter verdict was time-barred. His arrest lead to his resignation as a professor of railway and transport engineering at the Technical University of Zurich and the end of his academic career in the German-speaking world.
Professional life
From 1937 to 1950 he was with German Railways, later Councillor.
From 1950 to 1963 he was Professor at the ETH Zurich.
From 1963 to 1977 he worked in infrastructure consulting engineering in Frankfurt.
From 1977 to 1979 he was Professor at the Institute of technology, Instituto Militar de Engenharia, Rio de Janeiro.
From 1979 to 1980 he was Consultant to the Press of the Empresa Brasileira de Transportes Urbanos (Ministry of Transport (Brazil)).
From 1980 to 1985 he was an infrastructure consulting engineer Stuttgart.
He undertook planning and consulting work in 22 countries in Europe, Turkey, Venezuela, Chile, Spain, Portugal.
Leibbrand has been considered one of the most influential post-war German transport engineers.
Arrest for war crimes
On July 24, 1961 Leibbrand was arrested on behalf of the Stuttgart District Court at Frankfurt airport, because of a command he issued as a lieutenant in August 1944 during World War II, in Orange, Vaucluse near Avignon, which led to 28 Italian volunteers of the 6th Company of the Pioneer Regiment of the 19th Army being shot down with machine guns after having mutinied when the company withdrew. A company officer ordered the unsuspecting "Hiwis" in the middle of the night to enter a small forest meadow, where they were shot. Six of them were able to escape in the dark. According to Der Spiegel, 26 were killed and five seriously injured.
Citing a lack of evidence, the Stuttgart jury released Leibbrand on 2 October 1962 from the charge of murder. Then he returned to Zurich, but not to the chair from which he was on leave. The Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe overturned the verdict and dismissed the case for reassessment to the Stuttgart court. On January 10, 1966 Leibbrand stood for the second time in Stuttgart in court. Despite the charge of murder, his deed was counted as manslaughter and set the procedure for prescription.

Relaxed sequential in computer science is an execution model describing the ability for a parallel program to run sequentially. If a parallel program has a valid sequential execution it is said to follow a relaxed sequential execution model. It does not need to be efficient.
The word relaxed refers to the notion that serial programs are actually overly constrained by implicit serial dependencies (such as the program counter) and that one can introduce as much parallelism as possible without removing the ability to run sequentially. You can think of this model as being as relaxed as possible and still being able to run correctly in a single thread. That is the goal.
Most parallel programs can run sequentially but will benefit from parallelism when it is present. It is possible to design programs that require parallelism for correct behavior. Algorithms such as producer-consumer that are implemented so as to require two or more threads are one example of requiring concurrency to work properly. For instance, consider a bounded container with a capacity for only three items and a program which has one thread doing “PUT PUT,” and another thread doing “GET GET,” each doing their actions only four at a time. Such a program requires interleaving (concurrency). A program that requires concurrency is more difficult to debug. It is easier to debug a program that has a valid sequential execution.
Programs designed to require concurrency are more difficult to debug. Programs designed to require concurrency will have performance issues when the number of required threads exceeds the number of hardware threads because time slicing artifacts can hit hard.

Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, 1st Baronet (18 February 1810 – 10 May 1869), was an English art patron, horticulturalist and Whig politician. He is best remembered as one of the chief promoters of the Great Exhibition of 1851.
Background and education
Dilke was born in London, the son of Charles Wentworth Dilke, proprietor and editor of the Athenaeum, by his wife Maria Dove Walker. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He helped pass the parliamentary Reform Act of 1832, enacted under the Whig administration of Lord Grey. He studied law, and in 1834 took his degree of LL.B., but did not practise.
Public life
Dilke assisted his father in his literary work, and was for some years chairman of the council of the Society of Arts, besides taking a prominent part in the affairs of the Royal Horticultural Society and other bodies. In 1841 he co-founded The Gardeners' Chronicle alongside Joseph Paxton, John Lindley and William Bradbury. He was one of the most zealous promoters of the Great Exhibition of 1851 (of which Paxton was again an integral part), and a member of the executive committee. At the close of the exhibition, he was honoured by foreign sovereigns, and the queen offered him knighthood, which, however, he did not accept. He also declined a large remuneration offered by the royal commission. In 1853 Dilke was one of the English commissioners at the New York Industrial Exhibition, and prepared a report on it. He again declined to receive any monetary reward for his services.
Dilke was appointed one of the five royal commissioners for the Great Exhibition of 1862. Soon after the death of the prince consort he was created a baronet, of Sloane Street in the County of Middlesex. In 1865 he entered parliament as member for Wallingford, a seat he held until 1868. In 1869 he was sent to Russia as a representative of England at the horticultural exhibition held at St Petersburg. His health, however, had been for some time failing, and he died suddenly in that city, on 10 May 1869. A selection from his writings, Papers of a Critic (2 vols., 1875), contains a biographical sketch by his eldest son Charles.
Family
Dilke married Mary Chatfield, daughter of William Chatfield, in 1840. She died in September 1853. Dilke was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Charles, whose promising political career was destroyed by a well-publicised divorce case in the 1880s. Dilke's younger son Ashton Wentworth Dilke was also a politician.
Honours
In 1871, English botanist Maxwell T. Masters published a genus of plants from tropical South America called Dilkea after Wentworth Dilke.

Eta Elizabeth Banda (born 1949) is a former Malawian politician who was the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2009 to 2011. Prior to entering politics, she worked as a health professional and university administrator.
Early life
Banda studied at Malawi's college of nursing and then worked in that profession for some time. She subsequently pursued further study, initially in South Africa and then in the United States, where she graduated with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in community health nursing from Boston University. She later went on to complete a doctorate at the University of Maryland, in the fields of nursing administration, education, and policy. On her return to Malawi, Banda became a member of the faculty of the Kamuzu College of Nursing in Lilongwe, which is part of the University of Malawi. Her research focused on health policy planning in Malawi and the wider Southern Africa region, and she served on the editorial board of the African Journal of Midwifery. She was eventually appointed dean of the college, and later served as vice-principal and principal.
Politics
Banda was elected to the National Assembly of Malawi at the 2009 general election, standing for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the Nkhata Bay South constituency. When President Bingu wa Mutharika formed his new cabinet in June 2009, she was made Minister of Foreign Affairs. She became the third woman to hold the position, after Lilian Patel and Joyce Banda. In April 2011, Banda had Fergus Cochrane-Dyet, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Malawi, expelled from the country, after a diplomatic telegram was leaked in which he criticised President wa Mutharika. Her decision to do so was made with the president's knowledge, but he gave her his retrospective approval when she made remarks to the effect that she would rather resign as foreign minister than see her president insulted with impunity. In August 2011, however, President wa Mutharika decided to sack his entire cabinet. When it was reconstituted the following month on 7 September 2011, Banda was omitted. Since December 2012 Banda has lived overseas in the UK where she holds a senior role with an educational charity.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Nicolás de los Arroyos is based in the city of San Nicolás de los Arroyos, which is usually shortened to San Nicolás, and is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Rosario, Argentina.
History
On 3 March 1947, Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of San Nicolás de los Arroyos from territory taken from the Diocese of La Plata and the Diocese of Mercedes. It lost territory to the Diocese of San Isidro when it was created in 1957 and the Diocese of Zárate-Campana in 1976.
Apparations approved
The diocesan seat, the Cathedral of St Nicholas of Myra, was home to a neglected statue of Our Lady of the Rosary that had been blessed by Pope Leo XIII. The statue was rediscovered after an image of Our Lady appeared in a vision to a local lay woman mother-of-two Gladys Motta, leading to a renewed devotion under the title Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolás and the erection of a new Sanctuary with hostel for pilgrims and a center for promoting popular piety. In a decree signed on May 22, 2016 and made public a few days later, Héctor Cardelli, Bishop of the Diocese of San Nicolás, declared that the apparitions that occurred over a number of years beginning in the 1980s were supernatural in origin. The devotion is thus approved "worthy of belief" at the Diocesan level within the Catholic Church.

The Illinois Birth Control League (IBCL) was an organization created by the Chicago Citizens' Committee and the Chicago Woman's Club, to provide information and education about birth control. Later, the organization helped create the first birth control clinic in Chicago. The early birth control clinics run by IBCL often had staff members on hand who were fluent in several languages, in order to better serve immigrant communities. The IBCL also sponsored discussions about issues relating to family planning and birth control.
History
In 1916, Margaret Sanger visited Chicago to give a speech against Comstock laws and in support of birth control clinics. The speech drew around 1,200 people and "inspired the creation of the Illinois Birth Control League." By 1919, the league had been set up and was advertised in the Birth Control Review. In 1923, the IBCL opened its first birth control clinic, which was directed by Rachelle Yarros. This clinic was the second of its kind in the United States. The clinics enabled women who could not afford a private physician to receive practical family planning advice. Originally, the clinics were meant to be free clinics, but the city would not grant them the necessary license from the health commissioner. Because of this, the IBCL charged a "nominal fee" to give out oral information about birth control. In 1924, the IBCL was again denied a permit for the clinic to operate as a public clinic where information could be given out for free. IBCL opened a second birth control office in 1925. By 1937, over 20,000 women had been seen by the several clinics run by IBCL.
The IBCL and other women continued to fight against laws preventing the dissemination of information about birth control in Illinois during the late 1920s. In 1934, the IBCL, along with the Chicago Woman's Club, the Birth Control League and the Social Hygiene League of Chicago created a resolution, backed by three hundred women, to allow social workers to discuss family planning and to refer clients to birth control clinics.
IBCL incorporated in April 1924 with the name, "Illinois Birth Control League" with the mission of philanthropic and educational work relating to family planning. The IBCL became the Planned Parenthood League of Illinois in 1946, and then later, the Planned Parenthood Association, Chicago Area in 1947. Peggy Carr was the last president of the IBCL and oversaw the transition to Planned Parenthood.

Devil in the Flesh (original title: Il diavolo in corpo) is an Italian film released in 1986 and directed by Marco Bellocchio.
An adaptation of Raymond Radiguet's novel Le Diable au corps, the film stars Federico Pitzalis as a high school student who falls in love with an older woman (played by Maruschka Detmers).
Storyline
An Italian high school student named Andrea becomes infatuated with Giulia, an older woman he sees outside his classroom window. Giulia's fiancé, a leftist radical, has been jailed and is currently on trial for political crimes. Andrea and Giulia meet and begin a sexual relationship, rendezvousing in her apartment. The situation becomes complicated when her fiancé's mother finds out about this and confronts Andrea's father. a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who has treated Giulia in the past. The psychiatrist finds himself the target of Giulia's sexual advances, which he attributes to madness. As a passionate affair unfolds between Giulia and Andrea, the viewer is left wondering exactly how mentally unbalanced Giulia really is, and whether she had an affair with the boy's father as well. Intensity of passion between Giulia and Andrea builds towards a climax. Andrea's father confronts him about the affair, but Andrea does not back down. Giulia's husband is released from jail. The final ten minutes present a fitting conclusion to all the confusion and passion built up craftily in the film.
Production
One of the more notable aspects of the film is an extended (though darkly lit) scene in which the character played by Maruschka Detmers performs unsimulated (i.e., actual) fellatio on the character played by Federico Pitzalis.
The oral sex scene between Maruschka Detmers and Federico Pitzalis wasn't part of the script. It was Massimo Fagioli, a Marco Bellocchio's collaborator, who suggested it."

Abraham Falcón García (1924-2016) was a Peruvian luthier who made classical guitars. He was born on 16 March 1924 in Coracora, Ayacucho. From a young age, his life was focused on agricultural activities to help his family.
In 1946, Falcón made the first "Falcón's guitar", an instrument made of guarango (a piece of beautiful wood he had found near Palpa's river).
His company, Guitarras Falcón, is now located in Lima, Peru. During his 70-year guitar-making career, he achieved several awards including placing third in the World Classical Guitar Luthier Competition in Paris, France in 1987 (XV Rencontres Internacionales de la Guitare) He is considered the most accomplished Peruvian luthier of the 20th century. Falcón's guitars have been used by many renowned Classical guitarists throughout the world as well as Andean and Criollo artists in Peru.
Falcón's trademark is in the design of the guitar skeleton which has a unique fan bracing system. This design was registered in National Patent Registry as Structural Innovation for the Peruvian Classical of Concert Guitar in 2009.
All of his concert guitar bodies are made of Indian palisandro; the tops are mostly made of European spruce, and the fretboards are made of African ebony.
Falcón died in December 2016.

The 1918 Celebes Sea earthquake occurred on 15 August at 12:18 UTC near the Moro Gulf coast of Mindanao. It had a magnitude of 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale.
This event in the southern Philippines triggered a large tsunami, with a maximum run-up of 7.2 m, which affected the coasts of the Celebes Sea, causing widespread damage. The combined effects of the earthquake and the tsunami caused 52 casualties.
The earthquake has been associated with the Cotabato Trench, the surface expression of an active east-dipping subduction zone beneath Mindanao.

Accidents and incidents
On July 20, 1996, Northern Air Cargo Flight 33, a Douglas DC-6 (registration N313RS) was flying from (Emmonak to Aniak) when it crashed as it attempted an emergency landing at Russian Mission. The emergency landing was due to the #3 engine catching fire. As the plane made its approach and when it was turning to final, its right wing was seen folded up. The plane rolled to the right, nose down and slammed into the ground. All 4 on board were killed, including a jump seat passenger, Robert West, a Bush Pilot employed by Grant Aviation. The cause of the crash was determined to be the fatigue on the engine and improper procedures, (failure to feather #3 Prop) during an emergency by the pilots on board.
On September 25, 2001, the left wing broke off of a Northern Air Cargo Douglas DC-6BF, registration N867TA, while landing on Alpine Airstrip, AK, on a cargo flight from Deadhorse Airport. Subsequently, the aircraft veered off the left side of the runway and was destroyed in a post-crash fire. All 3 crewmembers on board survived. The aircraft was written off.

Prof. Mary Stuart CBE (born c.1957) is a South African born academic and the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lincoln.
Life
Stuart was born in South Africa and she attended a dance school there. She later moved to what was then Rhodesia before relocating with her husband to the United Kingdom. For a while, they and their children lived in a homeless hostel until the council supplied accommodation.
She attended the University of Cape Town and later obtained a doctorate in Social Policy from the Open University in 1998.
She was appointed to be Vice Chancellor at the University of Lincoln in 2009 following on from David Chiddick. Her research interests are life histories, social mobility, students and community development. Stuart notes that a university in Lincoln was only created as a trial. She entered into an unusual collaboration with Siemens who was a local employer. The company assists in choosing the head of the university's Engineering department. Stuart is aware this is unusual, but she remembers South Africa where large companies were a more positive influence than the government. Stuart is supported by five Deputy Vice-Chancellors.
In 2018, she was awarded a CBE.

Giovanni Manzuoli (Giovanni Manzoli) (1720–1782) was an Italian castrato who sang as a soprano at the beginning of his career, and later as a contralto.
History
Born in Florence, Italy, Manzuoli began singing there in 1731. After performing in Verona in 1735, he relocated and performed in Naples until 1748, including at the recently built (1737) Teatro di San Carlo. He is documented as also singing and acting in the following locales for the years indicated:
1749–1752 Madrid
1754 Parma
1755 Lisbon and Madrid
1755–1764 various locales throughout Italy
1760 Vienna
1764–1765 London (King's Theatre)
1768–1771 Milan
During Manzuoli's sojourn to London, he became friends with the Mozart family, later creating the role of Ascanio in Mozart's Ascanio in Alba, which premiered in 1771. While in Milan, he was appointed Chamber Singer to the Duke of Tuscany. His final appearance was in Milano in 1771. He died eleven years later.
Description of performance
Charles Burney, a contemporary music historian, described the Florentine castrato thus: "Manzoli's voice was the most powerful and voluminous soprano that had ever been heard on our stage since the time of Farinelli; and his manner of singing was grand and full of dignity. The applause he received was a universal thunder of acclimation."

The Bras Saint-Nicolas (in English: Saint-Nicolas Arm) is a tributary of the south-eastern bank of the rivière du Sud (Montmagny), which flows north-east to the south bank of the St. Lawrence River.
The Bras Saint-Nicolas flows in the municipalities of Sainte-Apolline-de-Patton, Cap-Saint-Ignace, aint-Cyrille-de-Lessard, Saint-Eugène, Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours and Montmagny, in the Montmagny Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Chaudière-Appalaches, in Quebec, in Canada.
Geography
The main neighboring watersheds of Bras Saint-Nicolas are:
north side: St. Lawrence River, Tortue River (L'Islet);
east side: rivière des Perdrix, brook Guimont, Bras du Nord-Est, Trois Saumons River;
south side: Paul brook, Le Grand Ruisseau, Cloutier River, Morigeau River, rivière des Poitras, rivière du Sud (Montmagny), rivière des Perdrix;
west side: rivière du Sud (Montmagny).
The Bras Saint-Nicolas has its source at the confluence of the Méchant Pouce River and Fortin stream, in the municipality of Sainte-Apolline-de-Patton. This spring is located on the west side of the hamlet "L'Espérance", on the north slope of the Notre Dame Mountains.
From its source, the Bras Saint-Nicolas flows over , divided into the following segments:
Upper course of the river
northwesterly in Sainte-Apolline-de-Patton, to the bridge at the municipal boundary of Cap-Saint-Ignace;
northward in Cap-Saint-Ignace, collecting water from the Cloutier River, to a forest road;
towards the north-west in Cap-Saint-Ignace, collecting the discharge of Isidore lake (coming from the east), up to the municipal limit of Saint-Cyrille-de-Lessard;
north in Saint-Cyrille-de-Lessard, collecting water from the Guimont stream and Bras d'Apic, crossing a series of waterfalls and rapids, up to the municipal limit of Saint-Eugène;
north-west, collecting water from Bras de Riche, until you reach a road;
Lower course of the river
west, to a road;
southwesterly in Saint-Eugène, to the municipal limit of Cap-Saint-Ignace;
southwesterly in Cap-Saint-Ignace, to the highway 20 bridge;
west, up to the bridge;
towards the southwest, passing south of the village of Cap-Saint-Ignace, to the road;
southwesterly, along highway 20, to a road bridge;
southwesterly in Cap-Saint-Ignace, to the municipal limit of Montmagny;
towards the south-west, collecting the waters of the rivière des Perdrix (coming from the south-east), then towards the northwest to its confluence.
The Bras Saint-Nicolas empties onto the south-eastern bank of the rivière du Sud (Montmagny). This confluence is located upstream from the route 132 bridge, downstream from the route 283 bridge, in the heart of the village of Montmagny.
Toponymy
In a lower segment, parallel to the St. Lawrence River, the Bras Saint-Nicolas meanders at an altitude of about fifteen meters, crossing a stronghold granted in 1672 to Nicolas Gamache by the intendant Jean Talon. A first hypothesis associates the origin of the toponym "Bras Saint-Nicolas" with this pioneer. Another hypothesis is rather referred to other to Nicolas Després, father of Geneviève Després whose husband, Louis Couillard de Lespinay, had bought the seigneury of Rivière-du-Sud in 1654 and 1655.
In 1802, the toponym “R. St. Nicholas' appears on a map by surveyor Samuel Holland. In 1803, the toponym appeared on a map of Vondenvelden with the generic Bras. In 1815, Joseph Bouchette also identified it by the same generic, a term used to designate a tributary or a subdivision of a watercourse.
The toponym "Bras Saint-Nicolas" was made official on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Snelshall Priory was a Benedictine priory in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom, built around 1200.
The priory was founded after Sybil d'Aungerville granted land at Tattenhoe to Lavendon Abbey, a Premonstratensian monastery of 'White canons' who most likely started a cell at Snelshall. This did not thrive and was abandoned about 1207. About 1219, the founder's son brought in Benedictine monks, increased the endowment and the new monastery began again. However Snelshall Priory paid 1 mark a year to Lavendon until 1232, at which point the Bishop of Lincoln decided that Snelshall owned its own lands and chapel. The priory accumulated various land through gifts, but even with all these grants, in 1321 when Henry Burghersh visited, it was so poor that "the monks scarcely had the necessities of life and had to beg even for these".
Yet the priory remained until the mid-sixteenth century. In 1529, Bishop Longford found "irregularities" among the two or three monks that remained, and as a result all women, married and unmarried, were barred from the precinct of the priory. Only two women, both over 48 years old and of "unexceptional character", were retained as servants. In 1535, there remained three monks, two priests (of which one was a novice), the prior's parents with "all their goods" and eight servants. The house was in ruin, and later that year the priory was suppressed and turned over to The Crown.
The house was possibly rebuilt around 1540, possibly by Sir John Fortescue. Much of the priory's land went to the Longueville family. It is not known when the house was demolished.
The stones were recycled to build the nearby St Giles's Church, Tattenhoe.

Isabella of Ibelin (1252–1282) was lady of Beirut from 1264 until her death in 1282, and also held the title of Queen of Cyprus. She was the daughter of John II of Beirut, lord of Beirut, and of Alice de la Roche sur Ognon.
Life
As a great-granddaughter of the powerful Crusader noble John of Ibelin, she was a member of the influential Ibelin family. Upon her father's death, she inherited the Ibelin family palace in Beirut and the leadership of the fief. It was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem but had an independent treaty from 1261 with Baibars, leader of the Muslim Mamluks.
In 1265, the young Isabella was betrothed to the young Hugh II, king of Cyprus (1252–1267), but he died before the marriage was consummated. She then ruled independently, and as Lady of Beirut had friendly relations with the Mamluks, negotiating her own new 10-year truce with Baibars on May 9, 1269. She had an affair with the impetuous Julian of Sidon (d. 1275), and her "notorious lack of chastity" (possibly) prompted the official letter Audi filia et from Pope Clement IV, urging her to marry. In 1272, at the age of 20, she married Haymo Létrange (the Foreigner), a wealthy lord from the Welsh Marches who may have been a companion of the future English king Edward I. The marriage was short though, as Haymo died in 1273. While on his deathbed, he put Isabella and Beirut under the unusual protection of Baibars, the Muslim sultan. King Hugh III of Cyprus wanted to use Isabella's status as a wealthy heiress to choose a new husband for her, to attract another distinguished knight to the fight in the Holy Land. Hugh forcibly took Isabella to Cyprus to arrange a new marriage, leaving her mother Alice de la Roche as regent of Beirut. Isabella resisted and received the support of both Baibars and the Knights Templar. The matter was brought to the Jerusalem High Court and became a political dispute during the Crusades as to who had lordship over the lady of Beirut, the Crusader king or the Muslim sultan. The High Court ruled in favor of Baibars, and Mamluk guards were assigned to Isabella's protection. After Baibars' death in 1277, Isabella married twice more, to Nicolas l'Alleman, lord of Caesarea, and then to William Barlais (d. 1304).
Isabella never had any children, and upon her death in 1282 at the age of 30, the lordship of Beirut passed to her younger sister Eschiva (1253–1312).

Ashby (always known as "Mike") was born in London, the son of Arthur Brian Ashby, a barrister and company chairman, and Dame Margery Corbett-Ashby. He was educated at Ashdown House Preparatory School and at Oundle School. He studied medicine at New College, Oxford, and at the London Hospital. Whilst at Oxford he rowed in the boat that won the Boat Race in 1936 and 1937. At London Hospital he was United Hospitals light-heavyweight boxing champion for two successive years.
Career
After qualifying, he was a house physician before joining the RAMC, where he served from 1943 until 1947, becoming a medical specialist in 1945.
On discharge from the Army in 1947 he worked at the National Hospital before returning to London Hospital as senior registrar to Russell Brain and Ronald Henson. In 1949 he was appointed consultant neurologist to the Whittington Hospital in north London, where he remained until his retirement in 1975. He succeeded Macdonald Critchley as consultant neurologist to the Royal Masonic Hospital in 1965, also retiring from there in 1975.
He also had a private Harley Street practice which involved much medico-legal work. He gave evidence in the Guenther Podola and John Bodkin Adams murder trials. His evidence in the latter in 1957 has been criticised for being too indecisive. While fellow witness Dr Arthur Douthwaite was adamant Adams had killed the victim, Edith Alice Morrell, Ashby was more hesitant. In summing up, the judge called Ashby "the key witness", one "coming between the extremes", whose "border-line evidence" made it unsafe to convict. Adams was acquitted of the Morrell charge but was due to be tried for the murder of Gertrude Hullett straight after. The prosecutor, Reginald Manningham-Buller, withdrew the charge however by entering a nolle prosequi - partly because - in his words - the case would again be "based on the evidence of Dr Ashby".
Adams was thought by Home Office pathologist Francis Camps to have killed 163 patients.
Family
In 1944 Ashby married Pamela Mary Roffey. They had two sons and two daughters. Their elder daughter, Charlotte, died in a car crash in 1966, the day before her 21st birthday.
Personal interests
Ashby was a freemason and director of ceremonies at the London Hospital Lodge.

Thomas Angell (29 December 1692 – 19 September 1767) was a Norwegian merchant, estate owner, mine owner and philanthropist.
Biography
Thomas Angell was born in Trondheim, the son of merchant Albert Lorenzen Angell. He was educated in theology in Copenhagen. Angell inherited a large fortune from his parents, who belonged to a wealthy trading family with roots in Southern Schleswig. Together with his brother Lorentz Angell (1690–1751), Thomas Angell managed the estate of the Angell family. The business activities eventually included saw mills, shipping companies and the export of various commodities. In addition the Angell brothers owned and managed their interests in the Røros Copper Works.
Thomas Angell donated his fortune to a charity trust fund through his will. The trust fund is administered by the Thomas Angell Foundations (Thomas Angells Stiftelser). Thomas Angell House, a large building complex in Trondheim with apartments for the elderly, was built by the Thomas Angell Foundation between the years 1770 and 1772. The building also provides offices for administration of the Thomas Angell Foundation.

Baxter International Inc. is an American multinational healthcare company with headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois.
The company primarily focuses on products to treat kidney disease, and other chronic and acute medical conditions. The company had 2017 sales of $10.6 billion, across two businesses: BioScience and Medical Products. Baxter's BioScience business produces recombinant and blood plasma proteins to treat hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune deficiencies and other chronic and acute blood-related conditions; products for regenerative medicine, and vaccines. Baxter's Medical Products business produces intravenous products and other products used in the delivery of fluids and drugs to patients; inhalational anaesthetics; contract manufacturing services; and products to treat end-stage kidney disease, or irreversible kidney failure, including products for peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis.
History
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions. Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933. Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia. Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988 while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989. In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.
On July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies". This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service" In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International. Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV. Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011. In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global healthcare companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with the sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza. In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer. In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.
In December 2019, the company announced it would acquire Seprafilm from Sanofi for $350 million.
In September 2021, Baxter announced it would acquire Hill-rom for $12.4 billion. The acquisition was completed in December 2021 for $12.5 billion.
Former employees
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.
Environmental activities
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites. The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money. In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.
Structure
The company had 2014 sales of $16.7 billion, across two businesses: BioScience (2013 sales - $6.6 billion) and Medical Products ($8.7 billion). Sales in 2013 were 42% in the United States, 30% in Europe, 16% in Asia Pacific, 12% in Latin America and Canada. In 2011, Baxter had approximately 61,500 employees. The breakdown of regional employees in 2013 was 36% in the United States; 34% in Europe; 16% in Asia Pacific; 14% in Latin America and Canada. In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development. As of December 31, 2016, the company had approximately 48,000 employees.
Corporate governance
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders. When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,
Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.
H1N1 vaccine
In July 2009, Baxter International announced completion of the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza. The company has been one of several workings with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.
Philanthropy
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education. In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.
Criticisms and controversies
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.
1983 prison plasma collection
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.
2001 Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of kidney failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 81 deaths and 785 severe allergic reactions in the United States according to the FDA. Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
The investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by one of Baxter's subcontractors Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.
Upon investigation of these adverse events by the FDA, academic institutions, and the involved pharmaceutical companies, the contaminant was identified as an "over-sulfated" derivative of chondroitin sulfate, a closely related substance obtained from mammal or fish cartilage and often used as a treatment for arthritis. Since over-sulfated chondroitin is not a naturally occurring molecule, it costs a fraction of true heparin precursor chemical, and mimics the in-vitro properties of heparin, the counterfeit was almost certainly intentional as opposed to an accidental lapse in manufacturing. The raw heparin batches were found to have been cut from 2–60% with the counterfeit substance, and motivation for the adulteration was attributed to a combination of cost effectiveness and a shortage of suitable pigs in Mainland China. In mid-January 2008 Baxter voluntarily recalled some lots of multi-dose vials of Heparin in February in consultation with the FDA Baxter recalled the rest of their Heparin products.
2009 Avian flu contamination
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1). Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic, Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.
2009 drug cost inflation
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.
2010 hepatitis C infections
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times. Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.
2010 infusion pump recall
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.
2008–2010 tax avoidance
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.

The Third Battle of Artois (25 September – 4 November 1915, also the Loos–Artois Offensive), was fought by the French Tenth Army against the German 6th Army on the Western Front of the First World War. The battle included the Battle of Loos by the British First Army. The offensive, meant to complement the Second Battle of Champagne, was the last attempt of 1915 by Joseph Joffre, the French commander-in-chief, to exploit an Allied numerical advantage over Germany. Simultaneous attacks were planned in Champagne-Ardenne to capture the railway at Attigny and in Artois to take the line through Douai to force a German withdrawal from the Noyon salient.
Background
Joffre's plan was a series of attacks along the Western Front, supported by Italian attacks across the Isonzo River and a British Expeditionary Force (BEF) attack near Loos-en-Gohelle. At first, Field Marshal John French and General Sir Douglas Haig opposed the attack, because of the lay of the land, a lack of heavy artillery, ammunition and reserves. The generals were over-ruled by the British minister of war, Lord Kitchener, who ordered French and Haig to conduct the offensive.
Prelude
The Tenth Army massed seventeen infantry and two cavalry divisions for the offensive, backed by guns and artillery pieces. The 6th Army had about thirteen divisions and from the French field artillery fired rounds of ammunition and the heavy artillery at the German defences. Obsolete 90 mm guns were used to fire another
Battle
An artillery bombardment began on 21 September, and on 25 September the Tenth Army attacked at to be sure that the morning mist had dispersed. XXI Corps attacked the rest of Souchez village and La Folie farm, XXXIII Corps made some progress but the III and XII corps to the south was repulsed. On the XXI Corps front, the 13th Division, attacking near Souchez with had casualties of in the first few days. During the afternoon it began to rain, impeding artillery observation and attack times were altered to even later in the day, which made co-ordination with the British First Army on the northern flank much more difficult. By 26 September, the XXXIII and XXI corps had taken Souchez but the III and XII corps had made little progress south-east of Neuville-St Vaast.
The French failed to breach the German second line of defence and a breakthrough could not be achieved. Joffre sent the French IX Corps to assist the British attacks at Loos but this action also yielded little of strategic value. Foch was also ordered by Joffre to conserve infantry and ammunition to reinforce the simultaneous offensive in Champagne; ammunition expenditure in Artois had been so vast that the offensive was to be reduced but without giving the British the impression that they were being left in the lurch. In very wet weather, the Tenth Army captured Vimy Ridge, except for the highest point, where German counter-attacks retook the ground from XXXIII Corps. Foch took over ground on the British right flank but it became impossible to co-ordinate attacks for the same day. The Battle continued until 13 October but ended amidst the autumn rains, mutual exhaustion and inter-Allied recriminations.
Aftermath
Analysis
The two French 1915 offensives in Artois had advanced the front line by on a front. After advancing in their previous offensive in May, the French advanced an additional by the end of their September offensive. Fayolle reported that the Third Battle of Artois had been a failure, because of uncut wire and the firepower of German machine-guns and artillery. The success of infantry attacks was dependent on the ability of the artillery to cut the wire, destroy German field fortifications and prevent the German artillery bombarding French infantry by using counter-battery fire; the simultaneous Second Battle of Champagne continued into October.
Casualties
The official historians of the recorded casualties to the end of October. In 2008, Jack Sheldon used figures taken from the French Official History to record fewer than half of the French casualties suffered in the spring offensive from April to June. James Edmonds, the British official historian, recorded and casualties at the Battle of Loos. Elizabeth Greenhalgh wrote that of the casualties, had been killed or listed as missing, against the capture of and many trench mortars and items of equipment.

Canapium was a Roman–Berber town in the province of Africa Proconsolare. Its stone ruins are located near Henchir-El-Casbath, in the region of Mornag, Tunisia.
The city was also the seat of an ancient Latin Catholic bishopric under the leadership of the Bishop of Carthage. The Bishopric was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the arian Vandal and Orthodox Byzantine empires, only ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb.
The diocese survives today as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, and the current bishop is José Luiz Gomes de Vasconcelos.

Frédéric Desmons (1832 in Brignon, Gard – 1910) was a French Calvinist priest and freemason who persuaded the Grand Orient de France in a vote to remove the term of the Great Architect of the Universe from their Constitution. This precipitated a split with the United Grand Lodge of England and the birth of liberal or Latin Freemasonry.
He studied in Nîmes and then went on to study theology in Geneva, the stronghold of Calvinism.
At death Frédéric Desmons, was buried the Cimetière à Saint-Genies-de-Malgoires, Saint-Genies-de-Malgoires, Departement du Gard, Languedoc-Roussillon, France.

Bassawak reservoir is an ancient reservoir located in Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. It was constructed in 380 BC. The dam of the reservoir is 10 m high. The water of the reservoir is also accumulated in the Giritale and Kantalai. Currently, the reservoir is about 255 acres. The embankment of the reservoir is about 5910 feet long and 22 feet high above the sill level of the sluice.
History
King Paduwasdeva of Sri Lanka, when married Subaddhakacanna from North India, her seven brothers also came to Sri Lanka and established their own villages. One of the brother, Anuradha established Anuradhapura where he constructed the first reservoir. The reservoir was expanded by king Pandukabhaya. The reservoir was called Abaya Vapi at that time, in the memory of one of King's uncles. The reservoir was used to feed the irrigation system.

Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) is the integrated pay and personnel system for active duty and reserve Marines, and the authoritative source of data for all Marine Corps (MC) pay and personnel information consisting of over 550,000 records. MCTFS has been successfully fielded and is currently in the post-deployment system support phase of its lifecycle. MCTFS supports centralized business-critical pay functions for the Marine Corps Enterprise on time and accurately, including computation and payment of net pay to individual Marines, while accommodating all necessary system change requests to meet current legislative, regulatory, mission essential, force reset, and contingency change requirements. MCTFS is maintained in an audit compliant state to ensure accurate financial transactions and reporting. MCTFS includes a comprehensive history of pay entitlements, deductions, and payments for each active duty and reserve Marine. The principal advocate within the Marine Corps is the Deputy Commandant, Manpower and Reserve Affairs.
Mission
The mission of the MCTFS is to provide integrated personnel and pay functionality for all active and reserve Marines within a single system and personnel management for retirees, by using a single, logical database which incorporates the records of all active, reserve and retired Marines. Additionally, the MCTFS will provide limited functionality for training and security management matters that pertain to personnel and pay management.
Purpose
The system provides for recording, processing, and maintaining of military personnel and pay data on a continuing basis within the Marine Corps. It provides information for pay, personnel administration, and manpower management. It uses an integrated, single logical data base to process transactions, at one central location at the Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) in Mechanicsburg. This supports all operating forces and supporting establishment organizations, which total over 800 reporting units (RU's). Use of this information facilitates:
Planning and execution of manpower personnel functions, including:
Personnel Management/Accountability/Security
Military pay
Training
Distribution
Assignment/Mobilization
Promotion
Classification
Separation
Preparation of budgets
Development of improved manpower management techniques
Recruiting
Recording historical data of the United States Marine Corps
Reporting purposes
The data collection of the MCTFS is based on the principle of singular reporting. Whenever practical, an event is reported when and where it occurs to ensure accuracy and timeliness of reporting. An item of information is entered into the system only once; thereafter, only changes, deletions, or corrections to this information are reported. MCTFS uses a centralized strategy and management style with decentralized execution at the lowest reporting level. The information maintained within the MCTFS is used for the functions described above. Additionally, the purposes for which information is maintained within the MCTFS are adequately described per the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and manpower Life Cycle Management (LCM) documentation maintained by the Deputy Commandant Manpower and Reserve Affairs (Code MI) and Deputy Commandant Programs & Resources (Code RFF). Data maintained in MCTFS on Marines is categorized as the Official Electronic Military File (OEMF) for that individual. As such, the OEMF is subordinate in precedence to the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) maintained by the Commandant of the Marine Corps (Code MMSB). The data contained in the OEMF must be carefully safeguarded under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. Commanders who fail to do so may be held personally accountable.
Reporting feedback
Prompt and complete feedback is essential in the MCTFS. Reporting Units (RU) are provided access to several files holding cyclic data retrievable by the unit as desired. This feedback results in the reentry of corrected data if required. Usage of the information contained in the data files depicted in the MCTFS Input/Output Model Figure 1-1 of the MCTFS PRIUM is encouraged by all levels of command and management. Feedback to these levels of command and management via reports and to the RU's via online files is critical to the quality control of information within the MCTFS.
MCTFS database
The MCTFS central database is maintained by TSO - Indianapolis, IN (though it is physically resident at the Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC), Mechanicsburg) and contains all data elements resident in the MCTFS. Information concerning the overall security parameters of the MCTFS is contained in the MCTFS Decision Paper IV as well as within other chapters of the MCTFSPRIUM. Records containing specified data elements for all military personnel (Active and Reserve components, to include retirees) comprise the Central Master File (CMF). The central database contains all data elements resident in the MCTFS.

Jason Shulman is a British sculptor and photographer who lives and works in London.
Early life
His father, the drama critic Milton Shulman, and mother, journalist Drusilla Beyfus, were married in 1956. They had three children: Alexandra, Nicola, and Jason. While Jason was growing up, the Shulman family lived in Belgravia. He returned to Haggerston and attended school.
Career
Shulman worked as a graphic designer for The Sunday Telegraph and an art director for Harpers & Queen and Harvey Nichols' magazines.
Two years after quitting his job as an Art Director, Shulman had his first gallery show in 2006 at the Madder Rose gallery near London's Old Street. Ten of the pieces concerned the painkiller Solpadeine, and one piece in particular was made using his father's ashes in stratified, magnetised, colour-coded layers. Regarding the pills, Shulman remarked, "They're the ones that just about give you the strength to get out of the bath in the morning. I wanted to say thank you." In 2009, he participated in the Third Moscow Biennale of contemporary art. During the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Shulman focused a camera on his television and took long exposure photos of the athletes in motion. Since most of what he recorded was short, he imagined what might happen if he shot longer stretches of action. In 2015, the artist presented himself (along with dogs, drinks, and vintage porn) at Soho's Door Gallery in a "secretive" installation.
In 2016 at the Cob Gallery, Shulman exhibited his Photographs of Films, a series of photographs which capture the entire duration of a movie (minus titles and credits) in a single exposure. Shulman spoke of the photographs: "There are roughly 130,000 frames in a 90 minute film and every frame of each film is recorded in these photographs. You could take all these frames and shuffle them like a deck of cards, and no matter the shuffle, you would end up with the same image I have arrived at. Essentially each of these photographs show the genetic code of the film."
Personal life
He is married to writer Susan Irvine.

Motorcycling advocacy is activism for motorcyclists seeking to establish and protect their rights, and to influence issues of interest to the motorcycling community. This includes lobbying organizations that work to influence laws, and groups or individuals who influence public attitudes.
The British Motorcycle Action Group was founded in 1973 specifically in response to helmet compulsion, which generated debate in the UK House of Commons at the time. In addition, the British Motorcyclists Federation (BMF), founded in 1960 as a reaction to the public perception of motorcyclists as leather-jacketed hooligans, has itself moved into political lobbying. The American ABATE similarly works to improve motorcycle safety, as well as runs charity fund-raising events, and rallies, often for motorcycle-related political interests.
In the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, part of the Department of Transportation) has been the main federal government agency active in the debate over motorcycle rights for such things as off-road riding, vehicle requirements and helmets.
Helmet laws
Motorcycle helmets greatly reduce injuries and fatalities in motorcycle accidents, thus many countries have laws requiring acceptable helmets to be worn by motorcycle riders. These laws vary considerably, sometimes exempting mopeds and other small-displacement bikes, with the UK exempting followers of the Sikh religion wearing a turban. Worldwide, many countries have defined their own sets of standards that are used to judge the effectiveness of a motorcycle helmet in an accident, and define the minimal acceptable standard thereof. In some countries, most notably the United States and India, there is some opposition to compulsory helmet use (see Helmet Law Defense League); not all U.S. states have a compulsory helmet law.

Afroholic... The Even Better Times is a double-disc hip hop album released by Afroman. Despite Afroman's six-album deal with Universal Records, Afroman recorded one album for Universal, The Good Times, and would release all future albums independently, beginning with this one. There are two versions of this album. The original version featured numerous parody songs. The reissue contained, among others, the song "Whack Rappers", which is a diss to many hip hop and R&B artists, including 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Kelis, Nas and P. Diddy. The album peaked at number 99 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 36 on the Independent Albums chart.
Promotion
Afroman began promoting this album on his website afromanmusic.com in late March of 2004 with the main page saying "Welcome to Afroholics Anonymous, the official support group for Afroholics. Group Therapy is now in Session", as well as an image of the album cover. Around early April 2004, he began promoting that the album would be releasing on the 20th of that month.

William Pagan (1744 – March 12, 1819) was a Scottish-born merchant and political figure in New Brunswick. He represented Saint John County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1786 to 1816.
He was born in Glasgow, the son of William Pagan, a dealer in sugar, and Margaret Maxwell. By 1766, he was master of his own ship, involved in the sugar trade between the West Indies and North America. Pagan established a business in New York City and later joined his brothers Robert and Thomas, who were based in Massachusetts, in the business of trading timber for goods from Scotland and the West Indies. Later, the brothers settled east of the Penobscot River in what is now part of Maine, expecting that this area would become part of a loyalist colony. In 1783, when it became clear where the border would be established, Pagan settled in Saint John, New Brunswick. He established a firm involved in trading goods with Britain and was also involved in shipbuilding. He also served on the town council for Saint John. During the War of 1812, Pagan was a partner in operating privateer ships. He helped found St. Andrew's Church in Saint John and served as the first president of the local Saint Andrew's Society. He was a member of the New Brunswick Legislative Council from 1817 until his death in Saint John two years later; as a member of the Church of Scotland, Pagan was the first council member who did not belong to the Church of England.

Heidi N. Becker is an American planetary scientist who studies Jupiter as radiation monitoring investigation lead for NASA Juno space mission. She works at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Becker came to science late; she was a dance and theater student at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, and graduated from NYU with a bachelor of fine arts in 1990. After working in theater in New York, she became interested in science through hospital volunteer work, and returned to college in her mid-20s, initially in New York and then transferring to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. She joined the Jet Propulsion Lab while still working towards a second bachelor's degree in physics at Cal Poly Pomona. She completed her degree in 2001, and became a full-time researcher at JPL.
Becker's research on Jupiter has involved taking close-up images of Jupiter's moon Ganymede, discovering lightning unexpectedly high in Jupiter's atmosphere, finding a possible explanation for the lightning through antifreeze-like interactions between water and ammonia, and studying ammonia-water hailstorms as a mechanism for ammonia depletion from the upper atmosphere.

Wilhelm I Count of Montfort (died 11 October 1301) was prince-abbot of Saint Gall from 1281 until 1301.
Political situation at the end of the 13th century
By the end of the abbacy of Berchtold von Falkenstein (died 10 June 1272), Count Rudolf of Habsburg began to restrict the influence the abbey had on the region of Thurgau. An election for the successor of Berchtold ended in conflicting results, giving Rudolf the opportunity to seize more influence and become more involved in matters of the abbey (he was crowned king in 1273). Rudolf sided with Ulrich von Güttingen, who was elected abbot by the citizens of the city of St. Gallen. The convent, however, had chosen Heinrich von Wartenberg, whom the citizenry rejected on the grounds of being from the same family as Berchtold. The Gotteshausleute (inhabitants of the area of influence of the Abbey), especially the city of St. Gallen, which at the time had not yet gained independence from the Abbey, accepted Rudolf as protector, which was confirmed to them in a Handfeste. However, Rudolf appointed Ulrich von Ramschwag as advocatus over the princely abbey. Additionally, Ulrich was a bad economist who amassed a large amount of debt for the city, in large parts due to his warring efforts against Heinrich von Wartenberg. Ulrich also fought against Heinrich's successor, Rumo von Ramstein. When Ulrich died, everybody recognised Rumo as the only legitimate abbot. The Abbey's economic standing did not improve, however, as Rumo had to sell many treasures to pay the amassed debt and was generally seen as inept. He abdicated in 1281 when he could not handle the situation any longer.
Tenure
Wilhelm's election signalled a systemic change for Saint Gall. he was elected abbot from the dynasty of the counts of Montfort, which was hostile towards the abbey during Berchtold's abbacy and sided with Ulrich during the time of double rule. While the spreading influence of the Montforts from the Rheintal to the Argengau had been a point of contention between the house and the convent, the electorate now sought to use the name of the counts for their own benefit. Wilhelm had influential secular brothers who boosted his election, among which were Rudolf I von Montfort, Ulrich I von Montfort as well as the later bishop of Chur, Friedrich von Montfort. After the election, Wilhelm endeavoured to restore the Abbey's former glory. Those ambitions were stopped by king Rudolf who, after dealing with his strong will, grew more hostile towards Wilhelm. Wilhelm was forced to interrupt his first visit at the royal court in Augsburg abruptly in December 1282 to avoid further impositions from the king. Inhabitants of the abbey were so unhappy with Wilhelm's savings policies and his orders that every monk should be ordained priest, that they lodged a complaint at the royal court. Their accusations were backed by the court and in 1287, Rudolf constricted Saint Gall's access to secular goods and used his influence on a papal legate to impose an anathema on Wilhelm.
The king had built the castle Schwarzenbach as a stronghold against the city of Wil, an important trading centre of the Gotteshaus (area under rule of the Abbey). A fierce fight erupted there in August and September 1287. An agreement of atonement was settled outside of Wil on the 6 September 1287. However, when Wilhelm visited the king to finalise the peace, the agreement fell through and Rudolf forced Wilhelm to make further concessions towards the king's sons Albert I and Rudolf II. Spurred by this, Wilhelm continued the fight, assisted by his brother, Bishop Friedrich. The king placed more interest into Ulrich von Ramschwag. When the ruling that Wilhelm was to be excommunicated was finalised, the king, followed by his sons Albert and Rudolf, appointed the abbot of Kempten, Konrad von Gundelfingen to be anti-abbot. Supporters of Wilhelm were threatened to receive the imperial ban if they continued their support.
Count Rudolf II stayed behind to fight Wilhelm, who now had to endure a time of defeat and persecution. His castles, among which was castle Alt-Toggenburg, fell into enemy hands. One after the other, his refuges were lost or became unusable. Bishop Friedrich was captured in a battle and died in 1290 when he attempted to escape from Werdenberg castle, which was controlled by Hugo von Montfort, who was on the king's side. When King Rudolf died on 15 July 1291, Wilhelm immediately sought negotiations with the citizens of the city of St. Gall, promising to restore their old rights. They promptly reinstated him as the only legitimate abbot on 25 July of the same year. He thanked the citizenry by formalising their rights on the 31 July 1291 in a comprehensive treaty.
Konrad von Gundelfingen had to leave his post. He tried to re-establish himself as abbot through martial means, but relented when Wilhelm paid him 100 Mark. Wilhelm, along with other enemies of the late king, joined an alliance against count Albert which was being assembled by bishop Rudolf von Konstanz. Subsequently, war erupted again in the Gotteshaus. Albert was largely victorious, but Ulrich von Ramschwag's sons – Ulrich himself had been driven out of the city when Wilhelm returned – suffered a major defeat outside the city of St. Gall on the 15 February 1292. Following these events, the conflict was seemingly de-escalating, but never ceased entirely. In 1296, Wilhelm travelled to Austria to negotiate a peace treaty but had to leave without satisfying the wishes and hopes of everybody in St. Gall.
When a feud broke out between Albert and King Adolf of Germany, who was Rudolf I's successor, Wilhelm joined forces with the new king, as he had shown himself to be beneficial towards St. Gall. After being granted assurances in the treaty of Schletstatt of 1 September 1297, the abbot consulted with King Adolf for the first time in the vicinity of Frankfurt to support him in his campaign against Albert I. In the summer of 1298, Wilhelm was the only clerical ruler ("Pfaffenfürst") in Adolf's camp. On the 2 July at the battle of Göllheim, Wilhelm was one of the fugitives from the battlefield. Defeated and faced with economic difficulties due to the military expenditures and losses, he returned to the abbey. Moreover, the old enemy, Albert I, was now king. Only in 1301 could the questions raised about Schwarzenbach since 1292 be reconciled with the new king. According to the contents of the contract, the implementation of which would be delayed and never completely finalised, the castle and the city of Schwarzenbach should have been broken up and the city of Wil would have been completely restored. However, Wilhelm had already fallen ill when Bishop Heinrich von Konstanz could report about a settlement. He died on 11 October, five days before the completion of the peace treaty.

The politics of Vatican City take place in a framework of a theocratic absolute elective monarchy, in which the Pope, religiously speaking, the leader of the Catholic Church and Bishop of Rome, exercises ex officio supreme legislative, executive, and judicial power over the Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), a rare case of non-hereditary monarchy.
The pope is elected in the Conclave, composed of all the cardinal electors which are bishops and archbishops appointed by the pope (now limited to all the cardinals below the age of 80), after the death or resignation of the previous Pope. The Conclave is held in the Sistine Chapel, where all the electors are locked in (Latin: cum clave) until the election for which a two-thirds majority is required. The faithful can follow the results of the polls (usually two in the morning and two in the evening, until election) by a chimney-top, visible from St. Peter's Square: in a stove attached to the chimney are burnt the voting papers, and additives make the resulting smoke black (fumata nera) in case of no election, white (fumata bianca) when the new pope is finally elected. The Dean of the Sacred College (Cardinale Decano) will then ask the freshly elected pope to choose his pastoral name, and as soon as the pope is dressed with the white cassock, the Senior Cardinal-Deacon (Cardinale Protodiacono) appears on the major balcony of St. Peter's façade to introduce the new pope with the famous Latin sentence
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: habemus papam (I announce to you a great joy: We have a Pope). The term "Holy See" refers to the composite of the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisers to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. It is therefore quite distinct from the Vatican City state, which was created in 1929, through the Lateran treaties between the Holy See and Italy. As the "central government" of the Catholic Church, the Holy See has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic representatives. It has formal diplomatic relations with 179 nations. The State of Vatican City, for its part, is recognized under international law as a sovereign territory. Unlike the Holy See, it does not receive or send diplomatic representatives, and the Holy See acts on its behalf in international affairs.
Administration of Vatican City
As with almost all monarchies, the executive, legislative and judicial power of government reside in the crown, in this case in the office of the Bishop of Rome (the pope). However, as with many monarchies, the pope exercises this power through other organs which act on his behalf and in his name.
The pope commonly delegates the internal administration of Vatican City to various bodies and officials. However, according to the Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, "The Supreme Pontiff, sovereign of Vatican City State, has the fullness of legislative, executive, and judicial powers" for Vatican City.
The pope delegates legislative authority for the state to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. This commission was established in 1939 by Pope Pius XII. It consists of seven Cardinals appointed by the pope for five-year terms. Laws passed by the Commission must be approved by the pope through the Secretariat of State prior to being published and taking effect.
The President of the Pontifical Commission is also the President of the Governorate of Vatican City, to whom the pope delegates executive authority for the state. The president is assisted by a Secretary General and a Vice Secretary General. Each of these officers is appointed by the pope for a five-year term. Actions of the President must be approved by the Commission. Various departments and offices report to the Governorate, handling such issues as communications, internal security, fire protection, and the Vatican Museums. The Corpo della Gendarmeria is the state's security and police force, not the Pontifical Swiss Guard, which is an organ of the Holy See, not of Vatican City.

The Pope is ex officio sovereign and head of state of the Vatican City State since the eighth century. He delegates executive authority to the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who is ex officio President of the Governorate and head of government of Vatican. The president is appointed by the Pope for a five-year term, but may be removed at any time by the pope. The president reports all important matters to the Secretariat of State, the Pope's chief everyday advisory body, which is consulted on all matters, even if they belong to the specific competence of the Commission for Vatican City State or, for instance, that of the Congregation for Catholic Education. The Secretariat of State is not thereby considered to hold responsibility for such matters, and the Cardinal Secretary of State is not seen as heading the Vatican City State or the various departments of the Roman Curia, other than the Secretariat of State itself.
Vatican City is a member of CEPT, Eutelsat, International Grains Council, Intelsat, ITU and UPU.
Vatican City does not have direct diplomatic relations with other states. Its foreign relations are managed by the Holy See. See Holy See – Relationship with the Vatican City and other territories.
Legislative
A unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, appointed by the Pope, operates as legislative branch, proposing law and policy to the Pope. Prior to taking effect, laws and policies passed by the commission must be approved by the Supreme Pontiff, through the Secretariat of State, and be published in the Italian-language supplement of the Acta Apostolicae Sedis that deals with Vatican City State matters.
The "Councillors of the State" give their consultation in the drafting of legislation. They may be consulted either alone or collegially.
Judiciary
Vatican City has a legal system distinct from that of Italy. The pope's judicial authority is exercised through the Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, as he by law serves also as the President of the Cassation Court of Vatican City (i.e. the highest court of appeal).
The population of the state is a few hundred. Each day outsiders come there to work. 18 million people visit there each year.
In one year its courts tried 640 civil cases and 226 penal cases.
The penal cases are usually for minor crimes such as pickpocketing. If such crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.
Under the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty, Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognized as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that under the treaty enjoy immunity.
Vatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention. People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.
On 16 March 2020, it was announced that Pope Francis signed a new motu proprio into law on March 13, 2020 which reforms the Vatican's judicial system. The motu proprio, titled Law CCCLI, updates the laws governing the Vatican's judiciary system and also replaced the previous judicial system which was founded in 1987. The new law provides for greater independence of judicial bodies and magistrates dependent on the Pope. It also specifies the requirements for the appointment of judges and it simplifies the judicial system while increasing the staff of the court. Furthermore, it provides a head for the Office of the Promoter of Justice (prosecutor's office), and sets out a standardized procedure for possible disciplinary action against certified advocates.
2013 "gay lobby" comment
In 2013 Pope Francis criticized the Vatican for having a "gay lobby" in remarks during a meeting held in private with some of the Catholic religious from Latin America, and he was said to have promised to see what could be done to address the issue. In July 2013, he responded directly to journalists' questions. He notably drew a distinction between the problem of lobbying and the sexual orientation of people: "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?" "The problem", he said, "is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem."

Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga (12 October 1899 – 28 April 1976) was a Mexican Catholic priest and theologian. Jesuit from 1916 to 1952 he was later a harsh critic of the Second Vatican Council decisions and of the post-conciliar Pope Paul VI. In 1972, he was declared excommunicated by the Roman Catholic bishops' conference of Mexico. He is considered to be one of the first promoters of sedevacantism.
Biography
Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga was born on 12 October 1899 in Mexico.
As a young man, he was brought up in the spirit of the Cristero movement, Miguel Pro, and other Catholics who fought against the government of Mexico in the 1920s. Sáenz placed great emphasis on the Catholic doctrine of the Kingship of Christ.
Traditionalism and sedevacantism
When the reforms of the Second Vatican Council began to be implemented in Mexico and North America, it was Sáenz who led the fight against them. His uncompromising traditionalism led to a rejection of the new Conciliar Church, and he was among the first to propound the theological conclusion of sedevacantism, which maintains that, since the death of Pope Pius XII, there has been a state of sede vacante in Rome because the following so-called popes espoused the heretical teachings of the sham Second Vatican Council.
He later incorporated these ideas in his books La nueva iglesia montiniana (The new Montinian Church) (1971), and Sede Vacante: Paulo VI no es Papa legítimo (Sede Vacante: Paul VI is not a legitimate Pope) (1973). In these books, he stated that Paul VI had forfeited his papal authority through public, pertinacious and manifest heresy, a position which he had reportedly held for some time. He was a catalyzing influence on lay and clerical Catholic traditionalists who opposed the Second Vatican Council in Mexico and North America, persuading them to defend and maintain the "True Faith", and setting up independent chapels and churches.
Excommunication
In reaction to his activities, the Mexican Cardinal Miguel Darío Miranda y Gómez officially declared that Sáenz had incurred excommunication.
In response, Father Moisés Carmona, Sáenz' associate and disciple wrote:
Unión Católica Trento
In the 1970s, Sáenz, together with Carmona and Father Adolfo Zamora, founded the Unión Católica Trento (Tridentine Catholic Union), during which time he also advised American Catholic traditionalists to form their own organizations, which resulted in Father Francis E. Fenton's founding of the Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement, the American parallel of the Unión Católica Trento.
Death
In his last testament, written on 25 April 1976, Sáenz wrote:
and he added:
He died of prostate cancer, three days after, on 28 April 1976.

The swIPe IP Security Protocol (swIPe) is an experimental Internet Protocol (IP) security protocol that was specified in 1993. It operates at the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite.
Purpose
swIPe provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of network traffic, and can be used to provide both end-to-end and intermediate-hop security. swIPe is concerned only with security mechanisms. The protocol does not handle policy and key management, which are handled outside the protocol. It works by augmenting each packet with a cryptographically-strong authenticator and/or encrypting the data to be sent.
Protocol description
swIPe encapsulates each IP datagram to be secured inside a swIPe packet. A swIPe packet is an IP packet of protocol type 53. A swIPe packet starts with a header, which contains identifying data and authentication information; the header is followed by the original IP datagram, which in turn is followed by any padding required by the security processing. Depending on the negotiated policy, the sensitive part of the swIPe packet (the authentication information and the original IP datagram) may be encrypted.
Cisco routers and switches running IOS have been found vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks which may result from processing packets with IP Protocol 53.

Intelsat 33e, also known as IS-33e, is a high throughput (HTS) geostationary communications satellite operated by Intelsat and designed and manufactured by Boeing Space Systems on the BSS 702MP satellite bus. It is the second satellite of the EpicNG service, and covers Europe, Africa and most of Asia from the 60° East longitude, where it replaced Intelsat 904. It has a mixed C-band, Ku-band and Ka-band payload with all bands featuring wide and C- and Ku- also featuring spot beams.
Satellite description
Intelsat 33e was designed and manufactured by Boeing on the Boeing 702MP satellite bus. It has a launch mass of and a design life of more than 15 years. When stowed for launch, the satellite measures .
It is powered by two solar panels, with four panels each, of triple-junction GaAs solar cells. The 702MP platform was designed to generate between 6 kW and 12 kW, but Intelsat 33e is designed to generate 13 kW at the end of its design life.
Its payload is the second high throughput EpicNG deployment. The EpicNG is characterized by the implementation of frequency reuse due to a mix of frequency and polarization in small spot beams. Not only applied to the classical High-throughput satellite (HTS) Ka-band, but also applying the same technique in Ku-band and C-band. The EpicNG series also keep the use of wide beams to offer high throughput and broadcast capabilities in the same satellite.
In the case of Intelsat 33e, the C-band side has 20 transponders with a total downlink bandwidth of 2,670 MHz. The spot beams offer high bandwidth for Europe, Central Africa, Middle East, Asia and Australia, and a wide beam covers sub-Saharan Africa. The Ku-band has 249 transponder equivalent for a total downlink bandwidth of 9,194 MHz. The Ku-band spot beams cover Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, while a wide beam can broadcast to Europe, Middle East and Asia. The Ka-band payload has 450 MHz of bandwidth on a global beam centered at its position.
History
In July 2009, Intelsat became the first customer of the Boeing 702MP satellite bus, when it placed an order for four spacecraft, Intelsat 21, Intelsat 22, Intelsat 27 and the first EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e. In May 2013, Intelsat made a second order for an additional four EpicNG satellites, the first of which would be Intelsat 33e.
On 15 July 2016, Senior Space Program Managers Richard Laurie and Brian Sing blogged that they had been on the Boeing factory overseeing the transport preparations for Intelsat 33e to French Guiana. There it would join another Intelsat satellite, Intelsat 36, for integration on the Ariane 5 ECA launcher, which was expected to launch on 24 August 2016. On 22 July 2016, Intelsat announced that Intelsat 33e had arrived to the Guiana Space Center for launch preparations. It also announced not only communication but aeronautical and maritime mobility clients that were expecting the satellite service. On 27 July 2016, it was explained that the satellite had traveled by truck from the factory to an airport in California, where it was loaded in an Antonov 124. It flew to Florida for a refuelling stop and then flew straight to Kourou airport. At the French launch site, even though Intelsat is the owner of the two passengers of the Ariane 5 ECA VA 232 flight, they have separate launch teams. Each satellite is built by a different manufacturer, and it has a different supervisor team within Intelsat.
On 24 August 2016, at 22:16:01 UTC, after a slight delay due to a rocket issue, the Ariane 5 ECA VA-232 flight launched from Guiana Space Center ELA-3, with Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36. At 22:44 UTC, Intelsat 33e separated from the rocket's upper stage. After 41 minutes of flight, both satellites had separated successfully. Intelsat confirmed that it had received the satellites signals as expected after separation. Arianespace estimated the insertion orbit as 248.7 km × 35,858 km × 5.98°, very close to the target of 249.0 km × 35,879 km × 6.00°.
On 9 September 2016, Intelsat announced that due to a malfunction in the LEROS-1c primary thruster, it would require more time for orbit rising and thus the service date had been moved from the last quarter of 2016 to the first of 2017. On 22 September 2016, insurance officials estimated that the main propulsion failure would not reduce the on orbit life of the spacecraft more than 18 months. This could translate to an insurance claim by Intelsat of around 10% (1.5 years) of the satellite service life, which could have a value close to US$40 million. Intelsat 33e entered service on 29 January 2017, three months later than planned.
In August 2017, another propulsion issue appeared, leading to larger-than-expected propellant usage to control the satellite attitude during the north/south station keeping maneuvers. This issue reduced the orbital life-time by about 3.5 years.

The Draco Normannicus is a chronicle written circa 1167-1169 by Stephen of Rouen (Étienne de Rouen), a Norman Benedictine monk from Bec-Hellouin. Considered Stephen's principal work, it survives in the Vatican Library.The manuscript was initially anonymous, however it has been accepted for over one hundred years that Stephen is the undisputed author. It is a chronicle of the Normans' history, from their arrival in the former kingdom of Neustria and the founding of Normandy up to the events which occurred during Stephen's life. There is an emphasis on the territorial conflicts which occurred between Henry II and Louis VII.
Content and name
The Draco (considered an epic by some critics, such as Irene Harris and Elizabeth Kuhl) was based largely on the work of Robert of Torigni and William of Jumièges Gesta Normannorum Ducum. The poem itself is unfinished, and also adapts parts of the Roman de Brut by Wace. The poem runs to nearly 4,400 lines, though it has lost at least two passages, estimated at around one hundred verses each.
The conventional modern form of the title, Draco Normannicus, was chosen by Richard Howlett in his edition published in 1885. In the manuscript it occurs only in a different word order, as Normannicus Draco. Howlett also translated the title as "the Norman Standard", rather than literally as "Norman Dragon", as the Draco is named for the dragon shaped banners which the Normans followed into battle.
Historical characters mentioned
Matilda of England, daughter to King Henry I of England, later to become the Empress Matilda after her marriage to Henry V, becomes a central point during the narrative, as well as Stephen's vision of the dynasty and historical identity of the Norman people. The work gives a detailed account on the funeral rites of Matilda, carried out by the archbishop of Rouen, Rotrou.
In the poem, Stephen names Morgan Le Fay definitively as the sister of Arthur, and ruler of the isle of Avalon. He also makes mention that Morgan is immortal, and has the ability to grant immortality to Arthur with the aid of the herbs found on the isle. In previous epics Morgan had not been named as sister to Arthur. Only in Chrétien de Troyes poem Erec and Enide was Morgan transformed from sorceress to sister, and this innovation was followed by Stephen in the Draco.
Analysis
According to Martin Aurell, Stephen is the only author of the Arthurian legends known to have had a direct relationship with Henry II. Aurell believes that Stephen, growing up at a time when the Normans were committed to gaining independence from France, was completely devoted to the cause of Henry II and that this ideology is clearly visible in the Draco. Aurell states the poem has "the character of a piece of propaganda totally committed to the cause of Henry II" and that it includes a "violent diatribe against Thomas Becket", which Stephen wrote shortly before Becket was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral. There are extensive passages devoted to the funeral rites of Matilda, who lived out her last twenty years at the priory Notre Dame du Pré, on the outskirts of Rouen.
Elizabeth Kuhl believes that as there are only one extant copy of the work remaining, it shows that the poem received little interest at the time it was written. However she states that assumptions on the meanings of how writing on historical matters should be presented led to the Draco being evaluated negatively, but in more recent times it is now accepted that "all historical writing arranges and makes sense out of its past and present in ways that are not inherent to events themselves". Initially, the Draco received no attention from scholars since, under the assumptions of how history ought to be written, it was deemed a failure, but when viewed from the latter perspective it is, according to Kuhl, an excellent example. Kuhl also states that another copy, which has since been lost was known to have been made.

Barbara Mittler (born 15 February 1968 in Hagen, West Germany) is a German sinologist. She is Co-director of the Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context".
Early life and education
Barbara Mittler was born 15 February 1968, in Hagen, West Germany. She is the daughter of flautist Uta Mittler and librarian Elmar Mittler. Mittler received her B.A. and M.A. from Oxford and her Ph.D. from Heidelberg University. She also studied Chinese at the Mandarin Training Center in Taiwan.
Career and research
After her dissertation in 1994, Mittler worked as an assistant professor at Heidelberg University, where she was habilitated in 1998. She continued as an associate professor. In 2004, she became full professor at the Institute of Chinese Studies, which she managed as director until autumn 2012. At the Cluster of Excellence “Asia and Europe in a Global Context”, Mittler became speaker of the research area “Public Spheres” in 2007. Since November 2012, she is the Cluster's Co-Director. Barbara Mittler is a member of the German Academy of Sciences LEOPOLDINA.
In 2000, Mittler was awarded the Heinz-Maier-Leibnitz-Prize of the German Research Foundation and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research for her outstanding research. Between 2002 and 2004, she held the Heisenberg Fellowship awarded by the German Research Foundation. In 2009, Mittler received the Henry Allen Moe Prize of the American Philosophical Society for her paper Popular Propaganda? Art and Culture in Revolutionary China. In this paper, Mittler addresses the question why the items of propaganda of Mao Zedong's time, a tragic period of suffering, are now popular in China, and why Mao has become a mythical figure.
Mittler's former desire to become a practicing musician (she plays the piano and the violin) led her to explore Chinese avant-garde music and fueled her passion for Chinese culture. Her research focuses on a wide range of topics such as Chinese music, Taiwanese literary and cultural history, encyclopedias and comics, Chinese women's magazines, visuality and historiography, satire and national heroes.
Personal life
She is married to the classical philologist Thomas A. Schmitz.

Folke Ivar Valter Fridell (1 October 1904 – 12 August 1985) was a Swedish writer of the proletarian school and syndicalist.
Biography
Fridell was born the youngest of a large family (6 siblings, and 6 more half siblings by his father) living in a stream-side home in a woods in Lagan, Kronoberg County, Småland, in Götaland, Sweden. That part of Sweden consists of forested lakes and bogs, out of which arable patches had been carved. In the late 18th through early 19th centuries, the region had hemorrhaged emigrants to Minnesota. Fridell's mother was a public school teacher and seamstress and his father was a soldier, tailor, and postal carrier. The family was locally known for their intense reading culture, and Fridell's education mostly came through that family culture, the local library, and a book collection he found in a deserted house while he was shepherding. At age 13, he started working in a textile factory, and after a youthful spell of learning the masculine arts of card-playing, drinking, fighting, and generally being a roughneck, at age 19 he was shocked straight by his older brother's drowning. Thereafter he returned to reading, and in addition took up writing after factory work hours. Fridell married Hanna "Stina" Wahlberg (9 years his junior) in 1934, and together they raised two boys, born 17 years apart. He would remain at the factory until 1946, when he was able to quit and support himself on his writing.
Despite his brief hard-living stint, at a young age, Fridell joined the IOGT, the Temperance movement. In 1921, the year of his brother's death, he participated in the formation of and was made secretary of a local branch of the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden (Sveriges arbetares centralorganisation, SAC). In meetings, he was at first shy about the organization material he wrote. When the Syndicalist Workers' Federation (Syndikalistiska arbetarefederationen, SAF) broke from SAC in 1929, Fridell followed, as he admired the more radical politics of the founder, a Swede who had spent some years working and living in the U.S. Fridell became a member of SAC once again when SAF merged back into SAC in 1938.
In the 1930s, Fridell started writing for Arbetare-Kuriren, the newspaper of SAF. After the reunion of SAC and SAF in 1938, he contributed frequently to Arbetaren, SAC's newspaper. Fridell is recognized as a theorist of syndicalism. He was also active as a lecturer and a delegate at several SAC congresses; from 1942 until 1946, he was a deputy in the organisation's central committee. Swedish Syndicalist archives include posters prominently advertising Fridell as the featured speaker at May Day demonstrations inviting "All peace- and freedom-loving people together."
Fridell debuted as a fiction writer with the novel Tack för mig – grottekvarn ("Thanks from me, treadmill") in 1945, and his breakthrough came with his second novel, the strongly autobiographical Död mans hand (1946). He was hooked and wrote a book nearly every year thereafter, winning labor and national awards for his writing every decade of his life after 1950. Although they were savagely denounced and dismissed by conservatives, his novels were widely read, in part thanks to their distribution by book ombudsmen in the factories.
Fridell explained the reason behind his art: "As long as there are proletarians, there is a proletarian literature. And I would like to go a little further and say that as long as people are insulted in their work for so long, there must be voices that speak their language and take their case."
By his influential criticism of monotonous and soul-killing factory work in Sweden's modernizing era of Taylorist automation, Fridell become a renewer of the workplace as well as a champion of the right of the worker to defend his dignity and capacity for cooperative decision-making. Other frequent themes of Fridell's writing were juvenile delinquency, rural flight and dystopian views of the future.
Fridell's work has been regarded as easy to read, conveying an ironic sense of humor. A prolific writer and editorialist, he often wrote in the voice of an alter ego. His play "One Man's Bread" was translated into English; the working class characters' dialogue was represented in British cockney accents. Fridell's novel Rikedom ("Wealth," 1956) was made into a television film in 1978. In 2005 Swedish singer-songwriter (and orienteering expert) released a mellow song he composed and named after Fridell.
The following excerpt from his novel Tack för mig – grottekvarn demonstrates Fridell's anarchist, but also very Swedish critique of the suffocating, crushing experience of intimate betrayal, excessively imposed upon workers as unfreedom cascades like a net from the controlling interest of the capitalist (concentrated wealth accumulation):
"Imagine if I went to the employer tomorrow and said, 'I do not want to work today. I will snatch pike from the brook and laze me in the grassland, for I am a free person.' What do you think he would say? He would say I was mad, that I should be investigated or detained at a forced labor agency.
I judge his judgment because he is a party to the matter and he loses financially if I celebrate but one day. But that's not the worst.
Worse it is that everyone else becomes his avatar. My companions would say, 'Now Oskarsson has gone crazy again.' And in the barracks all the fools would huddle in the stairwells and pitch pointed words at my old lady, and the kids would ask my kids how it was with crazy Oskarsson! And the end of the whole thing would be my own wife crying, begging me to relent and, for her and the children's sake, to get back to work posthaste."
The dialogue suggests the character is struggling with the pain of betrayal, as he partially feminizes that traitorous net of inegalitarian social control. That associative feminization could work as a distraction from the inegalitarian distribution of sovereign agency that, Fridell also recognizes, directs that refracted, enveloping, and penetrating coercive power. Yet Fridell's analysis, expressed in his creative work, does not point to human social interdependence—or even non-sovereign, delegated agency—as the root of unfreedom. Rather, the cause of unfreedom is the inegalitarian institution of ownership and control–as it dominates, enslaves, and turns against us our own human social interdependence.
In capitalism, we are compelled to betray one another, and our own needs, usually for nothing other than the thoughtless maximization of elites' relentless accumulation of wealth and rivalry with each other. In this way, our torturous social- and self-dissolution, our unmaking, is automated. That is one devastating price of absolute private property right and absolute elite liberty.
Conversely within this framework, heroism, which is not automated, consists in collectively devising and implementing interventions–deprioritizing capitalist and other rentier interests in control, exploitation, and appropriation–by which working people can regularly allow each other and themselves reasonable freedoms. Apart from fleeting, idiosyncratic moments of grace, heroic interventions cannot be uncontested, painless, or bloodless. But they restore to us our captured social network and ourselves. They restore to us our social human capacity to relieve our mortal, sentient suffering.
Fridell died in 1985 at the age of 80 and is buried in the cemetery of Berga church in Lagan. Outside the library in Ljungby, a bronze bust of Folke Fridell commemorates his contributions to the development of literature, theory, working conditions, and human liberty in Sweden.

Cambuslang West is one of the twenty wards used to elect members of the South Lanarkshire Council. Created in 2007, it elects three councillors.
The ward's territory includes the town centre of Cambuslang and neighbourhoods to its south and west including Eastfield, Greenlees, Kirkhill, Silverbank and Whitlawburn. The northern border is the River Clyde. A 2017 national review removed several of the streets in the west of the ward (those off East Kilbride Road, Brownside Road and Dukes Road) but added some in the east (between Greenlees Road and the Cathcart Circle Line railway tracks over Hamilton Road). The population in 2018 was 14,307.
The ward was formed from roughly the boundaries of three wards under the previous single-member system used from the creation of South Lanarkshire local authority in 1995 until 2007: Cambuslang Central, Eastfield and Kirkhill/Whitlawburn. Prior to this, the town was within the Glasgow District under Strathclyde Regional Council - one of its single-member wards from 1984 was named Cambuslang, and this included much the same area as the current Cambuslang West.

The Stapferhaus in Lenzburg, Switzerland, was founded in 1960 as a place for encounters and intellectual debate.
Founders and founding site
The Stapferhaus was founded by the representatives of Pro Helvetia, Pro Argovia, the Canton Aargau and the City of Lenzburg. It was named for Philipp Albert Stapfer (1766-1840), who is considered the founder of the Canton of Aargau. Today Sybille Lichtensteiger is the director of the Stapferhaus. She is responsible for the strategy, setting the themes and the programme. Sybille Lichtensteiger studied History and German studies in Zurich and Berlin and started working at the Stapferhaus 20 years ago.
In 1960 the Stapferhaus was opened in Lenzburg castle and hosted conferences and debates there for about 30 years. In 1994, its first exhibition was Anne Frank and us, done under the direction of Hans Ulrich Garner.
From 2002-2018 the Stapferhaus showed its exhibitions at the Zeughaus in Lenzburg, while its offices were still located in Lenzburg castle.
In 2018 the Stapferhaus took up its first permanent home close to Lenzburg railway station, which is now used for both exhibition spaces and offices. The first exhibition in the new building, from 2018 until 2020, was FAKE. And the Office for the Whole Truth. The flexible building is designed to be constantly remodelled, which makes the architecture special. Stairs and walls in the building can be shifted, the floors can be opened, and the façade and forecourt can be changed and re-designed.
Foundation
The Stapferhaus Foundation has operated the Stapferhaus, one of Canton Aargau's eleven cultural flagships, since 2007.
Financing
The Stapferhaus is financed on a project basis, with financial requirements dependent on the rhythm and size of the respective project. As an institution of national significance, the Stapferhaus is financed by public funds and its own operating income. It also relies on the support of foundations, private partners and sponsors.

The West Virginia Governor's Stakes is a Grade III American thoroughbred horse race for horses aged three years old and older over a distance of one and one-sixteenth miles on the dirt held annually in August at Mountaineer Race Track in Chester, West Virginia. The event currently carries a purse of $150,000.
History
The inaugural running of the event was on 8 September 1995 as the first race on a nine race program on the West Virginia Breeders Classic Stakes Day. The event was run as the West Virginia Governor's Cup Handicap over a five furlong distance.
The event was not held in 1996. In 1997 the event was run as the West Virginia Governor's Handicap over a distance of miles and was the main event of the day's racing card.
In 2005 the conditions of the event were changed from handicap to stakes allowance and the name of the event was modified to the West Virginia Governor's Stakes.
In 2007 the event was won by the eight-year-old M B Sea for the second time. Both of the victories by M B Sea were by seven lengths which stood as the margin record until Shadowbdancing won by eight lengths in 2009.
Joan & Ron Winchell, who race as Winchell Thoroughbreds, won this race in 2012 with Tapizar and went on to win the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile in the fall.
In 2015, the race saw a major upset when longshot Looks To Spare won under jockey Deshawn Parker. A perennial Mountaineer Racetrack champion and its all-time winningest jockey, when Parker rides it is near automatic that the fans will heavily back him. However, Looks To Spare was considered such an unlikely winner that he was allowed to go off at odds of 74-1. He paid $150.60 to win on a $2 ticket.
The race has grown in stature over the years and in 2018 the race was upgraded by the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association to Grade 3 status.
In 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Mountaineer Park canceled the event.

Ramiro L. Colón (1904–1983), was the general manager of the Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico. He reorganized the company during its time of crisis and is credited with having saved the coffee industry in Puerto Rico.
Early years
Colón (birth name: Ramiro L. Colón Colón), was born in and raised in the countryside of Ponce, Puerto Rico. There he received his primary and secondary education. Being raised in the country, he developed an intense love for the island's agriculture. He went to work for the "Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico" (Cooperative of Coffee Growers of Puerto Rico) in 1925, the same year it was founded, at the age of 21.
"Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico"
The cooperative was the first one of its kind in Puerto Rico. It was founded to protect the coffee industry, which was one of the island's most important export products, from outside imitators. The situation was the following: many merchants were importing coffee from other countries, of poor quality and freshness, and passing them off as locally produced. When tourists and local consumers tasted the coffee, they complained about how bad it was, and as a result sales declined drastically and the coffee industry suffered greatly. In 1928, hurricane San Felipe destroyed most of the coffee plantations on the island, and the Great Depression also affected the economy.
Colón becomes general manager
In 1932, Colón was named general manager of the cooperative and undertook the reorganization of the company during its time of crisis. The cooperative was almost bankrupt, and the first thing Colón did was to obtain a loan from the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. With the money, he bought new equipment to replace the old and outdated equipment in the company. Colón was able to convince the Puerto Rican legislature to pass a law against the then-rampant adulteration and contraband of coffee.
"Cafe Rico"
Colón was credited with convincing the government to impose import tariffs on coffee, thereby ensuring the island would not be invaded by cheap coffee of poor quality, which often was advertised as locally produced. The cooperative purchased and installed a new torrefaction plant in which the local coffee was processed. Colon set out to gain access to the United States coffee market, helped the local coffee growers obtain lines of credit from local bankers, and got financial help from the federal and local government for the export of the cooperative's coffee. This coffee was named "Cafe Rico" and was well received locally and internationally, soon reestablishing the good fame of Puerto Rico's coffee worldwide. The cooperative became the first coffee manufacturer to sell its coffee in sealed cans. The quality of Cafe Rico has received numerous medals and recognition in contests celebrated all over the world. Colón established the only coffee tasting laboratory in Puerto Rico. One of Cafe Rico's byproducts, "San Carlos Selection", is the official coffee of Vatican City.
Cooperative expansion
Under Colon's leadership, the cooperative was able to expand and diversify. The company sells food and agricultural equipment with sales of over $5 million. It also owns and operates an egg processing company which calls its product "Huevos Rico" (Rico Eggs). The cooperative owns an insurance company, its own credit corporation that grants loans to farmers, and its own printing plant that prints and distributes an agricultural magazine worldwide. Recently, the cooperative has started to operate gasoline stations in San Juan, Mayaguez and Ponce.
When Colón took over the company in 1932 as a general manager the cooperative had only $284,000 in annual sales. By 1963 the cooperative had over $35,000,000 in sales. The cooperative has offices and warehouses in Ponce (main offices), San Juan, Mayagüez, Arecibo, Yauco, San Sebastian, Utuado, Adjuntas, Jayuya and Ciales.
Legacy
Colón served as a senator, representing the district of Ponce in the Puerto Rican Senate and was named Administrator of the cooperative, a position he held until his retirement in 1965. In 1952 the Constitution of Puerto Rico was adopted, creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Colón was a member of the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico. He was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Puerto Rico in the years 1948, 1952 and 1956. Ramiro L. Colón was candidate for governor in 1968 for the Republican Statehood Party.
Ramiro L. Colón died in the city of Ponce, which honored his memory by naming an elementary school after him. He is remembered as the man who saved the Puerto Rican coffee industry.

Veliefendi Race Course () is a horse racing track located at Veliefendi neighborhood in Bakırköy district of Istanbul, Turkey.
It is the country's oldest and biggest race course founded on a former grassland that was historically a farm belonging to Şeyhülislam Veliyüddin Efendi, an 18th-century superior authority of Islam in the Ottoman Empire. The race course was constructed in the years 1912/13 by German specialists upon the initiative of Enver Pasha.
The race course hosts also music events. In 2006, Turkish pop singer Nez held a concert.
Physical attributes
The race course covers an area of consisting of facilities for racing, training and barns. The race course has three interleaved tracks as:
a long and wide turf oval,
a long and wide synthetic track for all-weather racing and
a long and wide sand oval for training.
The track's seating capacity is 7,600. The complex comprises offices, a museum, an exhibition hall, a racehorse hospital, an apprentice training center as well as social and recreational facilities.
Major races
Gazi Race (Gazi Koşusu), is the most prestigious Turkish Oaks, and is held since 1927 in memory of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who was awarded the honorific title "Gazi" (Ghazi). Initially run in Ankara, the event was later transferred to Veliefendi Race Course. The award is about TL 1.4 million (approx. US$850,000 as of June 2011), and since 1970 is accompanied with a silver equestrian statue of Atatürk.
Prime Minister's Race (Başbaşkanlık Koşusu) is a Turkish Oaks held since 1951. The winner is awarded TL 300,000 (approx. US$180,000 as of July 2011) and a trophy bestowed by the Turkish prime minister.
Incidents
During a race on July 31, 1949, four race horses, including two favourite horses, did not leave the starting gate upon the referee's start sign, and were disqualified. The bettors protested about a possible swindle by the referees and the racehorse owners, and demanded a rerun. As the referee commission rejected the demand, the crowd set the referee tower, the bleachers, the administration and box offices on fire.
In July 1953, bettors throw horsemen with stones and beat a jockey named Muhacir Ahmet (literally: Ahmet The Immigrant) they believed he had swindled. Two years later local newspapers published about swindles at Veliefendi Race Course, and during a race on July 13, 1955, the bettors stoned the administration building, and Muhacir Ahmet was beaten once again.
In 2008, the track held its first-ever farewell ceremony for a racehorse, honoring Ribella, a popular mare.

The Ruth Bancroft Garden is a public dry garden established by Ruth Bancroft. It contains more than 2,000 cactus, succulents, trees, and shrubs native to California, Mexico, Chile, South Africa, and Australia. It is located at 1552 Bancroft Road in Walnut Creek, California, USA.
History
The Garden began in the early 1950s as Ruth Bancroft's private collection of potted plants within Bancroft Farm, a property bought by publisher Hubert Howe Bancroft (grandfather of Ruth's husband Philip) in the 1880s as an orchard for pears and walnuts. In the 1950s, Bancroft brought home a single succulent, an Aeonium grown by plant breeder Glenn Davidson. By 1972, the collection was moved to its current site, when the orchard was cut down and the land was rezoned.
In 1989, it became the first garden in the United States to be preserved by The Garden Conservancy, and has been open to the public since 1992. Today the Garden is an outstanding landscape of xerophytes (dry-growing plants). It is open to the public for an admission fee of $810.

Garden collections include the following plants:
Aeoniums
Aloes
Agavoideae
Brachychiton trees including Brachychiton rupestris

Knight Online is an MMORPG developed by .
Knight Online is officially free-to-play (although to connect to the most of the servers during prime time, paid premium is required), but there are some features that must be paid for. In addition, there is an in-game Powerup Shop or Store which contains various items that one can purchase such as premium packages (freemium model). Paid services include exclusive items and Premiums which are a limited-time subscription providing many benefits.
Gameplay
The player controls a virtual character. After connecting to a server for the first time, players must take sides, choosing either El Morad or Karus. The two nations are equivalent but have different appearance. Once the nation is decided, it's a difficult and expensive process to switch nations. To create a character, the player must choose (depending on the nation) a race, from Barbarian, male/female El Moradian, and the four ork races that inhabit the world. Following that, a class must be selected for the character along with a few appearance options. Finally the character is named and given its first 10 Stat Points.
To advance in the game, the player must collect experience points to gain levels and items that boost the stats of the character. The monsters that inhabit the game world can be attacked using melee attacks or skills. Once a monster is killed, the killing player gains experience points and the monster leaves behind a loot box which may contain Noahs (in-game currency) and other items. The drop box is only accessible to the player or party that did the most damage to the monster. However, in case of kill stealing, the experience is divided according to the amount of damage done.
Most items can be traded between players. The game's merchant feature allows the player to set up a kiosk to sell or buy items for Noahs. If a player has enough Noahs or the item sought for, he can enter the kiosk and perform the exchange. The transaction is done automatically, so the merchant doesn't have to be at the computer when the item is sold or bought. Bartering is also permissible using the trading option.
Each character belongs to one of the two nations of the game: Humans and orks. Knight Online has five character classes available for both nations, with the class Kurian introduced later to the game. Each class has a basic skill set, three main skill sets, and one master skill set (after 2nd job change).
Knight Online enables players to group together and complete objectives. Parties in Knight Online range between having two to eight players. The characters must be in a certain level range of the party leader in order to be in the same party. Party-members gain experience in accordance to their level. Knight Online encourages parties, since parties can collectively complete monster-killing quests.
The game is hosted on a couple of servers in each version. Servers are grouped into worlds. No characters or items may be transferred across worlds, but a character created in a world is available on all servers of the world. A player may create up to 4 characters per world on the same account. These characters have a common "bank" which can be used for storing items and Noahs.
Knight Online allows players to fight against each other in various zones. Some of these provide no rewards or risks, while in others players gain National Points and Leader Points (also called Ladder Points) for killing enemies, but the defeated player loses some of these points.

The Westerwaldkreis ("District of Westerwald") is a district (Kreis) in the north-east of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighbouring districts are (from north clockwise) Altenkirchen, Lahn-Dill, Limburg-Weilburg, Rhein-Lahn, the district-free city Koblenz, Mayen-Koblenz and Neuwied.
History
When the area became part of Prussia in 1866 two districts covering the area were created. The northern part was covered by the Oberwesterwaldkreis with capital in Marienberg, the Unterwesterwaldkreis with capital in Montabaur covering the southern part. 1886 a third district was added with the Westerburg district with area from both of the other two districts. In 1932 the districts structure was reformed again, the Oberwesterwaldkreis and the Westerburg district were merged to a new Oberwesterwaldkreis with capital in Westerburg. In 1974 in another reform the districts Oberwesterwaldkreis and Unterwesterwaldkreis were merged to form the Westerwaldkreis.
Together with the neighboring Rhein-Lahn district a partnership with the English county Northamptonshire was started in 1981. As part of the partnership of Rhineland-Palatinate with Rwanda the district had a partnership with the municipality Mugesera since 1983. As in 2001 this municipality was included in the district Mirenge the partner changed.
Geography
The district is located in the Westerwald mountains. Its highest elevation is the Fuchskaute, at 657 m, the lowest is near Diez in the valley of the Gelbach, at 150 m.
Coat of arms
The bottom part of the coat of arms shows basalt pillars, as the Westerwald is of volcanic origin. There are seven pillars representing the seven Verbandsgemeinden of the district which have basalt or quartzite in their area. The green band in the middle represents the forests, the jug in the upper part the traditional pottery industry in the district.

RapidEye AG was a German geospatial information provider focused on assisting in management decision-making through services based on their own Earth-observation imagery. The company operated a five-satellite constellation producing 5-meter resolution imagery that was designed and implemented by MacDonald Dettwiler (now MDA) of Richmond, Canada.
Today, RapidEye refers to the constellation of 5 Earth-observation satellites owned by Planet Labs. The RapidEye constellation was retired by Planet Labs in 2020.
History
1996: The RapidEye business concept was designed by Kayser-Threde GmbH, based on a call for ideas from the DLR (German Aerospace Agency), on how to commercialize remote sensing in Germany.
1998: RapidEye was established as an independent company in Munich with seed financing from a few private investors and Vereinigte Hagelversicherung, a German agricultural insurance provider.
2004: In 2004, funding was secured for the RapidEye satellite constellation and ground segment with the help of the European Union, the State of Brandenburg (Germany), a banking consortium consisting of Commerzbank, EDC (Export Development Canada) and KfW Banking Group.
Through a contract with the CCC (Canadian Commercial Corporation) MDA was awarded the contract as the prime contractor to build RapidEye's satellite system.
Originally located in Munich, the company relocated 60 km southwest of Berlin to Brandenburg an der Havel in 2004.
2008: RapidEye earned ISO 9001:2000 certification in April from TÜV Nord. On 29 August 2008, a Dnepr rocket (a refurbished ICBM), was successfully launched from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, carrying RapidEye's constellation of five Earth-observation satellites designed and implemented by MacDonald Dettwiler (now MDA) of Richmond, Canada.
2009: After the satellites completed their MPAR phase (consisting of testing and calibration) they became commercially operational in February 2009.
2011: RapidEye files for bankruptcy protection on 30 May.
2011: RapidEye Blackbridge Ltd. of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada acquired RapidEye AG on 29 August.
2012: On 18 December 2012 the company announced that it has successfully relocated the company headquarters to Berlin, Germany.
2013: On 6 November 2013 RapidEye officially changed its name to BlackBridge.
2014: Blackbridge Ltd. announced a new constellation called RapidEye+. The constellation was never developed.
2015: Planet Labs acquired RapidEye.
2020: In April 2020, Planet Labs retired the RapidEye constellation.
Satellites
The constellation consisted of the following satellites: RapidEye 1 (codename Tachys, COSPAR 2008-040C), RapidEye 2 (codename Mati, COSPAR 2008-040A), RapidEye 3 (codename Choma, COSPAR 2008-040D), RapidEye 4 (codename Choros, COSPAR 2008-040E), and RapidEye 5 (codename Trochia, COSPAR 2008-040B). All five satellites were launched simultaneously on a Dnepr rocket on 28 August 2008. All of the satellites share a common orbit; they are separated in orbit by 19-minute intervals.
Five identical satellites are built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) of Guildford, subcontracted by MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA). Each satellite was based on an evolution of the flight-proven SSTL-100 bus, measured less than one cubic meter, and weighed 150 kg (bus + payload).
Each of RapidEye's five satellites contained identical sensors, were equally calibrated, and traveled on the same orbital plane (at an altitude of 630 km). Together, the five satellites were capable of collecting over 4 million km2 of 5 m resolution, 5-band color imagery every day.
The Jena-Optronik multi-spectral imager, the Jena Spaceborne Scanner JSS 56, was a pushbroom sensor carried on each satellite. Each sensor was capable of collecting image data in five distinct bands of the electromagnetic spectrum: blue (440–510 nm), green (520–590 nm), red (630–690 nm), red-edge (690–730 nm) and near-infrared (760–880 nm). The nominal resolution on the ground was 6.5 meters, corresponding to NIIRS 2.
RapidEye's satellites were the first commercial satellites to include the red-edge band, which is sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content. Studies show that this band can assist in monitoring vegetation health, improve species separation, and help in measuring protein and nitrogen content in biomass.

Applications
Imagery from the RapidEye constellation provided geospatial information to the following industries:
Agriculture – The RapidEye constellation was capable of field based, regional or global scale agricultural monitoring on a frequent revisit cycle. The information derived from the imagery could assist farmers in precision farming operations, agricultural insurers in damage assessment and risk management, or governments in food security and environmental compliance monitoring.
Forestry – Satellite-based information is increasingly being used by governments and commercial operators to assess forest status, evaluate management strategies, measure the environmental and economical sustainability of forest operations, and monitor illegal logging and deforestation.
Security and emergency – Fast turnaround of imagery showing current ground conditions following a natural or man-made disaster is essential for crisis management authorities in assessing the situation and better coordinating rescue teams.
Environment – Satellite imagery can provide valuable information to governmental agencies or industries that monitor the environmental impact of human activities.
Spatial solutions – RapidEye satellite imagery was used as background imagery for a variety of purposes including mapping, navigation, flight simulation, gaming and as an integral component in geospecific 3D modeling.
Energy and infrastructure – The RapidEye constellation was used to monitor pipeline and transmission corridors and identify problems on the ground such as vegetation encroachment, nearby buildings, development of roads, and leaks. It provided land cover and land use classification data to telecommunication firms to assist in planning their antenna network.

Bonus track listing
"In Love Forever", "I'm Not Crying Over You" and "One More Mile to Go" were three new songs written for this album.
"Girl" is missing on compact cassette.
"This is the album I've always wanted to make; a live studio recording of personal favourites, old classics and new songs, with full orchestra and choir. It was recorded in London over a period of eight days (instead of the usual three-four months) in July '95, and to sing each track surrounded by an orchestra, without the benefit of the safety-net of modern technology, was immensely exciting - everything in one take, the way it used to be!"

St Gerard's School is a lay Catholic co-educational independent day school in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. A fee-charging school, it is administered by a Board of Governors as a charitable trust. As of 2019, the student population was about 760 including its Senior School, Junior School, and the Montessori.
In 2019, St. Gerard's School was named top school in County Wicklow, and 29th in Ireland.
History
John James founded the school in 1918. After completing his university degree in 1904 he converted to the Roman Catholic faith. His vision of education emphasized "the dignity of each individual and the development of the whole person". The school is named after Gerard Majella, patron saint of the school.
Beacon Hospital Vaccination Scandal
In March 2021 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, twenty teachers from the St. Gerard's Primary and Secondary School received vaccinations from the Beacon Hospital. At that time, less than 20% of the Irish population had been vaccinated, with many vulnerable and elderly people waiting to be vaccinated.
The head of the Irish Health Service and the Minister for Justice expressed "frustration" at the actions of the Beacon Hospital which violated policies regarding the use of surplus vaccines. Micheál Martin, Ireland's Taoiseach, labelled the school and hospital's actions "repugnant". The Irish Times noted that the children of the chief executive of the Beacon Hospital attend St. Gerard's.

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is the second studio album by American country artist, Miranda Lambert. The album was released May 1, 2007 on Columbia Nashville Records and was produced by Frank Liddell and Mike Wrucke.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was Lambert's first studio album released under the Columbia Nashville label, as 2005's Kerosene was issued on Epic Nashville Records. The album received high critical acclaim, with critics commenting on Lambert's revengeful material. The album went to number one on the United States' Top Country Albums chart and also reached number 6 on the overall American chart. Out of the album's four singles, three were major hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart between 2007 and 2009. "Gunpowder & Lead," the third single released from the album, became her first Top 10 hit on the country chart in 2008. Other singles spawned from the album were, "Famous in a Small Town," and "More Like Her."
In late Spring 2008, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend won the Album of the Year award at the Academy of Country Music Awards.
Background
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was recorded at three separate studios in Nashville, Tennessee and consisted of eleven tracks. Eight of the album's tracks were entirely written or co-written by Lambert herself. Three additional tracks are cover versions. "Getting Ready" was written by Patty Griffin, and it appears on her 2007 release, Children Running Through. "Easy from Now On" (written by Carlene Carter and Susanna Clark) was originally a Top 15 Billboard country hit for Emmylou Harris and appeared on her 1978 album, Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town. "Dry Town" was written by Gillian Welch and David Rawlings but would not appear on any of their albums until 2017's Boots No 1: The Official Revival Bootleg. Most of the album's tracks speak of planning revenge on ex lovers. Lambert said she drew inspiration for writing such music because both her parents were private investigators and she was frequently exposed to crime scenes. Frank Liddell and Mike Wrucke were both chosen as producers of the album, since both previously produced her 2005 release, Kerosene.
Most of the album's tracks describe women who seek revenge on their ex lovers. The first track, "Gunpowder & Lead," discusses a woman who plans revenge on an abusive boyfriend by killing him with her shotgun. The album's title track explains how an ex-girlfriend will not let her former lover date other women. The woman walks into the bar where her lover is and creates a scene by committing acts of violence. Other songs have more mellow themes behind them. The third track, "Famous in a Small Town" is drawn from real life experiences and situations when Lambert was younger.
In an interview with Young Money Magazine, Lambert described Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and how it compared with her previous release. Lambert clarified that although most listeners view her as a "badass" singer, other songs on the album also show a more mellow-sounding side of her musical artistry.
"I definitely put more of myself out there on this one. People hear songs like “Kerosene” and even “Gunpowder & Lead” from “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and think I'm always that badass, but if you listen to the record and hear songs like “Desperation” and “More Like Her,” the softer side comes through. And at first I was like, “Crap, I just said a whole lot about myself and now there's no going back!” but fans and critics have responded so well I guess it was a good thing to do!"
Critical reception
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 85, based on 15 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic hailed it as one of 2007's best albums, demonstrating Lambert's skills as a singer and a songwriter because of her "wry wit and clear eye for little details, mining the unexpected from such familiar subjects as love and loss and jealously and rage." In Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau said it would likely be the year's best country record and said while Lambert also impressed with her introspective songs, "the violent moments define a little lady who also cites the Rolling Stones' 'Under My Thumb' [on 'Guilty in Here'] and rocks a Patty Griffin cover. Smoking." Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine credited her with defying country music's "historically and presently conservative gender politics" on an album that was "brash, insightful, wry, and, above all else, smart". Stylus Magazine critic Josh Love deemed it a coming-of-age record for Lambert, who was self-possessed enough to craft "a persona whose power relies not on values, beliefs, or experiences, but on feints, distance, and masterful command ... Lambert is at a very rarified place right now, turning her songs into vehicles for a persona that transcends background narrative and personal history".
At the end of 2007, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was ranked the 4th best album of the year by Time. It was voted the 15th best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice. Robert Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it seventh on his own year-end list. Rolling Stone placed it at number 26 on the magazine's top-albums list for 2007, while ranking the title track at number 28 on its best-songs list. The album also won the Academy of Country Music's "Album of the Year" award in 2008, becoming Lambert's second award from the award association. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked the album number 10 on its "Country's Best Albums of the Decade" list. Newsweek ranked it number 4 on its "Best Albums of the Decade" list.
Commercial performance
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was officially released May 3, 2007, debuting at number 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums and number 6 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 53,000 copies within its first week. It became Lambert's second album to debut at number 1 on Billboard Top Country Albums chart, as Kerosene had also debuted at number 1 in 2005. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on June 2, 2008 for shipment of over 500,000 copies in the United States. On January 21, 2011, nearly four years after the album's release, Crazy Ex Girlfriend was certified Platinum. As of April 2017, the album has sold 1,573,300 copies in the United States.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'''s title track was first released as the album's lead single on December 26, 2006. The song debuted at number 55 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart a week prior to its official release at radio. The song did not become a major hit, only peaking at number 50. In April, the album's third track, "Famous in a Small Town" was released as the second single, debuting at number 54 on the Billboard country chart. The song became the first major hit from the album reaching a peak of number 14 in late 2007. "Gunpowder & Lead" was released as the third single in January 2008. The song became Lambert's first Top 10 hit single on the Billboard country chart, reaching a peak of number 7, while also reaching number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100. "More Like Her" became the album's fourth and final single, peaking at number 17 on the country chart in early 2009. For the week issued December 8, 2012, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 56, almost five years after its release date.

Burasa () (also burasa', burasak or buras) is an Indonesian rice dumpling, cooked with coconut milk packed inside a banana leaf pouch. It is similar to lontong, but with a richer flavour acquired from the coconut milk. It is a delicacy of the Bugis and Makassar people of South Sulawesi. It is also a dish associated with the Bugis diaspora, notably in the Malaysian states of Johor, Selangor, Sabah, and Sarawak where there are large established communities. It is often consumed as a staple to replace steamed rice or ketupat, and a popular accompaniment to a rich dish of chicken braised with galangal (ayam masak lengkuas in Malay, likku or lekku in Buginese).
Burasa is made by steaming the rice until half-cooked, then cooking further in coconut milk mixed with daun salam (Indonesian bay leaf) and salt until all of the coconut milk is absorbed into the rice. Then the half-cooked coconut milk rice is wrapped inside banana leaves in cylindrical or pillow shapes, secured with strings, most commonly from banana leaf fibers. Two cylinders of burasa are usually tied together as one. The rice packages are then steamed further until completely cooked.
In Indonesia, burasa can be consumed as a snack with serundeng (spiced desiccated coconut), hard-boiled egg, or sambal kacang (spicy peanut sauce). Bugis and Makassar people often consumed burasa as a replacement to steamed rice or ketupat, usually accompanied with coto Makassar, konro, pallubasa, or lekku. They also often took burasa as food provisions or rations during sailing or travelling.

Ukrainian Americans have been present in New York City as early as the 17th century when the city was called New Amsterdam. However, the first Ukrainian mass immigration wave to New York City occurred during 1870–1899, coinciding with other mass European influxes into the city.
Little Ukraine
The traditional Ukrainian area in New York City is called Little Ukraine or the Ukrainian East Village, and is located within the East Village in Manhattan. Ukrainian population of Little Ukraine topped around 60,000 residents after World War II, which dwindled subsequently. Today about a third of approximately 80,000 Ukrainian Americans living in New York City are residing in Little Ukraine, which is bounded by Houston Street and 14th Street, and Third Avenue and Avenue A.
The Annual Ukrainian Festival takes place on the weekend closest to May 17 on 7th Street between Second and Third Avenues. The festival also borders Taras Shevchenko Place, a small street connecting East 6th and East 7th Streets, named after Taras Shevchenko, a renowned Ukrainian poet, artist and humanist. In the wake of the war between Russia and Ukraine, supporters of a Ukraine free of Russian intervention built a shrine on Second Avenue and 9th street, which incorporated photographs of victims, flowers and candles.
History
Religious practices played an important role for early Ukrainian immigrants in New York City, first Ukrainian rite liturgy took place on October 10, 1890 and 15 years later St. George's Ukrainian Catholic Church was established.
Ukrainian National Women's League of America was established in New York City in 1925, promoting specifically arts and culture, among other activities. The UNWLA organized folk art exhibitions in New York City and elsewhere in the United States. In 1976 their activities culminated with the founding of The Ukrainian Museum that included permanent exhibitions. The museum was hailed as one of the finest achievements of the Ukrainian American community.
Shevchenko Scientific Society established its branch and United States headquarters in 1947 in New York City. It is a respectable institution dedicated to scholarly research and public service. Its international membership body included such renowned former members as Albert Einstein and Max Planck. The society is located at 63 Fourth Avenue.
In 1948 a prominent Ukrainian immigrant New-Yorker, William Dzus, self-made millionaire, inventor and owner of Dzus Fastener Company, founded the Ukrainian Institute of America. William Dzus came to America with $25 in his pockets and worked his way up from the very bottom, epitomizing the American success story for the Ukrainian community. Dzus charitable contributions to his community culminated with the purchase of the famous Harry F. Sinclair House for the use of the institute, which became central to Ukrainian American educational, scientific, cultural and humanitarian life in New York City.
Community further expanded its scientific and cultural contribution to the city life in 1950 by establishing The Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences, which essentially became an Academy of Sciences-in-exile, following occupation of Ukraine by the Soviet Union. It houses the most extensive archives on Ukrainian history outside Ukraine. The academy is closely linked with Columbia University where part of its archives are stored in the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts. The academy is located at 206 West 100th Street in a designated landmark building.

John Jones, (1854–1913) known as Coch Bach y Bala was a notorious Welsh criminal. His nickname, Coch Bach y Bala, literally translates as 'Little Redhead of Bala'. He is also known as the Welsh Houdini for having escaped on more than one occasion from Ruthin Gaol.
A habitual criminal, Jones spent over half his life in prison from which he made repeated attempts (some successful) to escape.
His first successful escape was in 1879 when he escaped from Ruthin Gaol while on remand for stealing some watches. By some method he opened the door of his cell and walked out of the front door of the gaol while the staff were having their evening meal. He was recaptured three months later near Colwyn Bay.
In 1900 he attempted to escape from Caernarfon Gaol while awaiting transfer to Dartmoor prison. Barricading himself in his cell he began to tunnel out but was unsuccessful.
Following two lengthy sentences in Dartmoor for burglary, Jones returned to North Wales and within months on his release was convicted of yet another burglary. Held in Ruthin Gaol while awaiting transfer, this time to Stafford Gaol, he tunnelled through the cell wall and climbed over the prison walls using a rope made from bedclothes. Six days later while being tracked on land near Llanelidan he was shot in the leg by Reginald Jones-Bateman and bled to death from the wound.
He was buried in the graveyard of St Elidan's Church in Llanelidan, Denbighshire.
Because of his exploits in escaping he was held in some regard by the local population and his funeral was well attended. His escapades were well reported in the press; describing his last escape the local paper wrote:

Miniatur Wunderland (German for 'miniature wonderland') is a model railway and miniature airport attraction in Hamburg, Germany, the largest of its kind in the world. The railway is located in the historic Speicherstadt neighbourhood of the city.
In December 2021 the railway consisted of of track in H0 scale, divided into nine sections: Harz mountains, the fictitious town of Knuffingen, the Alps and Austria, Hamburg, America, Scandinavia, Switzerland, a replica of Hamburg Airport, Italy and South America. Of the of floorspace, the model occupies .
The exhibit includes 1,300 trains made up of over 10,000 carriages, over 100,000 vehicles, approx. 500,000 lights, 130,000 trees, and 400,000 human figurines. Planning is also in progress for the construction of sections for Central America and the Caribbean, Asia, England, Africa and The Netherlands.
Prehistory
In the summer of 2000, Frederik Braun, one of the two founders of Miniatur Wunderland, was on vacation in Zurich. In a local model train store he came up with the idea for the world's largest model railway. Back in Hamburg he searched for email addresses online and started a survey on the popularity of real and fictional sights of the city. In the process, the Miniatur Wunderland, which did not yet exist, was ranked 3 by male respondents.
According to the twin brothers Gerrit and Frederik Braun, the idea for Miniatur Wunderland, including the business plan, fitted on just two pages. The financial backer was Hamburger Sparkasse.
Construction and expansion
After construction began in December 2000, the first three sections (Knuffingen, Central Germany and Austria) opened on August 16, 2001. Since then, new sections have been added. With the completion of the Hamburg, German Coast section in November 2002, Wunderland became the largest model railroad in Europe. Expansions in December 2003 with the USA and with Scandinavia in July 2005 followed. On September 10, 2015, Gerrit and Frederik Braun added the missing piece of track between the Switzerland section and a new Italy section. In doing so, they extended the track length from 13,000 to 15,400 meters. This was recorded by a Guinness judge, who then presented the certificate for the newly established world record. The 190 sq m Bella Italia section was opened on 28 September 2016 after four years under construction, involving 180,000 man hours and costing around four million euros. Work on the Monaco / Provence section started in August 2019 and, when completed, will mean the addition of another 315 meters. The total length of currently 15,715 meters therefore corresponds to 1,367.21 km in real length, so this is now also the largest model railway layout in the world across all scales.
Sections
The next stage under construction is Monaco (with the Formula 1 circuit). After its completion, work on South America will be started. The new section is to be built by the end of 2021 in a neighbouring building. A bridge built on July 15, 2020, will lead to it.
Other projects include Central America/Caribbean and Asia.
System
Visitors walk back and forth between different rooms in a long corridor. Trains run along the walls of the rooms and on peninsula-like protrusions. The layout consists (as of September 2016) of nine completed sections of 60 to 300 m2 Model area:
The first three sections were created simultaneously. They show central and southern Germany with the Harz mountains, it also has a long ICE-high speed train track.
The fictional town of Knuffingen was given a road system with moving cars as a special feature.
The Austria section involved the implementation of the Alps theme, including a multi-level helix from which trains from the other sections change corridor sides above the heads of visitors.
The next stage of expansion includes the section with the theme Hamburg, German Coast.
The USA section includes Las Vegas, Miami, some Wild West, again a system with moving cars and a spaceport.
The Scandinavia section has a real water area: in the future, computer-controlled ships will operate in the 30,000 liters "North Sea" sea tub. At present, they are still controlled manually. Tides are also simulated here.
The Swiss Alps, extending over two floors, are modeled on the landscapes of the cantons of Ticino, Grisons and Wallis and were completed in November 2007. Through a hole in the ceiling on a total area of 100 m2 the mountains reach almost six meters in height. Visitors reach this new level via stairs, while trains negotiate the height differences in concealed switchbacks and in a locomotive lift.
The Knuffingen Airport section was opened in May 2011 after around six years in construction and development and an investment of 3.5 million euros. On display is a 150 m2 airport with a globally unique airport control system.
A small section forms the Hamburg HafenCity with the Elbphilharmonie concert hall. Planning began in May 2012 and construction began in August of the same year. A total of nine square meters (m2) were available, and 10 selected houses were built on this area. The opening was on November 13, 2013.
In 2014, a trip was made to Italy to gain lots of impressions of the country. These were brought into the 9th construction section Italy. In this section, some sights of Rome as well as landscapes like Tuscany or the lava-spewing Vesuvius can be seen. The construction section was presented in a specially created blog and opened in September 2016.
In February 2018, the Venice section was opened at only 9 m2 in size. Involving around 35,000 man hours, it is the most elaborate section – in relation to its size.
Special features
Special features include a simulated daily routine where twilight, night and day repeat every 15 minutes. This includes an automatic lighting control system that activates more than 300,000 lights to match the time of day.
The 120-square-meter fantasy town of Knuffingen, with a population of about 6,000, is equipped with more than 100 moving model cars, including numerous fire engines, which are used to simulate a firefighting operation in Knuffingen every 15 minutes on average. Traffic simulation is made possible by a modified car system that is also used in the USA, Scandinavia and Knuffingen Airport sections. In the America section, even an Interstate Highway is equipped with a dynamic Traffic Control System, which controls traffic through four different speed limits as well as permanent light signs and a variable text display.
The layout is considered to be rich in detail, examples include a changing scoreboard in the Volkspark Stadium or a crashed cheese wheel truck. There is also a Jet gas station there, displaying the real current gasoline prices of its prototype in Hamburg's Amsinck street.
Visitors can control operations on the system through ca. 200 pushbuttons. These buttons are highlights for many visitors. For example, a mine train starts, wind turbines turn, the next goal falls in the football stadium, a Space Shuttle takes off, a helicopter takes off or Pinocchio's nose begins to grow. A push button even allows visitors to watch the simulated production of a small bar of chocolate in a factory and taste the real product for themselves.
Certain tours also include a behind-the-scenes look at detailed figures that cannot be seen from the normal public area.
Knuffingen Airport
After six years in planning and under construction, Knuffingen airport was officially opened to visitors on May 4, 2011, as a special section of the facility. Its buildings resemble Hamburg Airport. As in the fictional main town of Knuffingen, there is also a simulation of a fire department with a large fleet of vehicles, including four airfield fire engines. On the 14 meter long runway, aircraft models can be accelerated to scale realistically on an invisible sled, and by means of two guide rods can also seemingly lift off the ground and disappear into a (cloud) wall. Depending on the launch phase, the guide rods allow a horizontal tilt of the aircraft that approximates reality.
There is also a wide variety of standard commercial aircraft including Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 in the liveries of many airlines around the world. Even models of the still relatively new Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 "Dreamliner" aircraft take off and land at Knuffingen. There is also a Concorde in British Airways livery, a Space Shuttle, a bee and the "Millennium Falcon" spaceship known from Star Wars.
The movement of the aircraft on the ground is realized with the help of technology based on the car system. The vehicles in the airport tell their own little stories with coordinated refueling, loading and unloading before and after landing starting from the aircraft parking positions.
Unlike the other landscapes, the railroad at the airport is hardly visible. There is only an airport station underground.
According to the operators, the 150-square-meter space has cost around 3.5 million euros, in addition to 150,000 man hours. The area is equipped not only with many rolling aircraft models, but also with hundreds of cars, passenger boarding bridges, parking garages, airport hotels, a subway and individual figures.
Visitors
On December 5, 2012, the ten millionth visitor came to Miniatur Wunderland, on December 2, 2016, the fifteen millionth. Around three quarters of visitors come from Germany, the remaining quarter from abroad, mainly from Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, England, the US and China.
Awards
In 2010, company founders Frederik and Gerrit Braun and Stephan Hertz were awarded the Cross of Merit on Ribbon of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for their social commitment. The Miniatur Wunderland also holds the Guinness World Record for "Longest melody played by a model train."
Presence in the media
Several times following completion of the various expansion stages, the Hamburg section was visited by a team of reporters from Eisenbahn-Romantik from SWR. They were also given a look behind the scenes. Numerous television stations, magazines and newspapers have already reported on Miniatur Wunderland.
In May 2009, rapper Samy Deluxe filmed the video clip for his socially critical song Stumm in Miniatur Wunderland. Within just one night, about 100 sequences were recorded in which a miniature figure "runs" (stop-motion) through the layout.
On December 5, 2009, the outdoor betting section of the German television show Wetten, dass..? took place at Miniatur Wunderland.
The plot of several episodes of the Hamburg crime series Großstadtrevier took place at Miniatur Wunderland.
In 2015, together with singer Helene Fischer, a campaign for Ein Herz für Kinder was launched, in which over 450,000 euros (as of 01/2016) were collected. The campaign was presented, among others, in the Ein Herz für Kinder Gala.
In January 2016, Miniatur Wunderland partnered with Google MiniView – a miniature version of Google Street View.

The term elite media refers to newspapers, radio stations, TV channels, and other media that are deemed to serve a political or economic elite and influence the political agenda of other mass media. According to Noam Chomsky's Propaganda Model, "[t]he elite media set a framework within which others operate”.
The term can have different meanings depending on political ideology e.g.The New York Times is used as an example of elite media in the context of a criticism of class society and corporate hierarchy by Chomsky, an anarchist intellectual, while conservative Bill O'Reilly, uses the term to identify liberals with elites while associating the right, including wealthy businessmen, with the interests of common people.
Conservatives often use "Elite media" or "Media elite" in a pejorative context, alleging that the reporting is biased and untrustworthy—-associating liberalism with elites who, unlike conservatives, have disdain for working-class needs and values.

Skipe is a border village on the side of India in the Indo-Myanmar international border. The village is located south of Ukhrul in Ukhrul district, Manipur state, India. Skipe falls under Kamjong sub division. The village is partially connected by Ukhrul-Kamjong state highway. Skipe is flanked by Chindwin river in the east, Konkan Thana in the north, Kangpat in the west and Namlee in the south. Locally, the inhabitants speak Skipe dialect that belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family. Some researchers are of the view that the dialect spoken by the inhabitants has some affinity to that of the Koireng tribe.
Total population
According to 2011 census, Skipe has 24 households with the total of 123 people of which 59 are male and 64 are female. Of the total population, 24 were in the age group of 0–6 years. The average sex ratio of the village is 1085 female to 1000 male which is higher than the state average 985. The literacy rate of the village stands at 61.72% which is lower than the state average 76.94%. Male literacy rate stands at 63.23% while female literacy rate was 57.24%.
People and occupation
The village is home to people of Tangkhul Naga tribe. Majority of the inhabitants are Christians. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the inhabitants. Being a remote area, the village is often in the news for the poor transport system due to bad road condition and the inhabitants suffer most during the rainy season because of frequent landslides. The village is often used as transit route by militants for which there are frequent encounters between the Indian arm force and militant groups. There had been many incidents of incursion of land by the Myanmar army and Skipe is one of the villages that has lost some of its original land due to illegal encroachment by the neighboring country. Moreover, there has been reports of border pillar disappearance.

The is a 17.8 km railway line in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, operated by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central). It connects Tajimi Station in the city of Tajimi via Kani to Mino-Ōta Station in Minokamo. The name of the line includes a kanji from each of the terminal stations.
Operations
During the day, service operates at approximately 30 minute intervals. In addition to trains running between Tajimi and Mino-Ōta Stations, there are also trains that enter the Takayama Main Line and run through to Gifu Station. During weekday morning and evening rush hours and on Saturday mornings, a train serves commuters by going to Nagoya Station.
Stations
History
The line traces its origin to the Tōnō (Eastern Mino) line, an 11.9 km, gauge railway that opened in 1918. The section from Shin-Tajimi to Hiromi Station was nationalized in 1926, named the Taita Line, and regauged to , and extended to Mino-Ōta in 1928.
Passenger trains were replaced by DMUs in 1934, and steam locomotives ceased operating on the line in 1969. From 1 April 1987, with the privatization and division of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) into regional companies, the Taita Line became part of JR Central.
CTC signalling was commissioned in 1993.

William Harrison (c.1553–1621) was an English Roman Catholic priest. He was the third and last archpriest of England.
Life
Born in Derbyshire circa 1553, he entered the English College, Douai in 1575. Ordained a deacon, he afterwards went to Rome. The records of the English College, Rome contains an entry to the effect that "Pater Gulielmus Harrison", then aged 25 years, and a priest studying Theology in the College, took the mission oath on 23 April 1578. He left the College for England on 26 March 1581, having previously, as usual on such occasions, had an audience with the Pope. From 1581 to 1587, he served the English mission, and in the last named year, went to Paris and became Licentiate in civil and canon law.
In 1590, he was entrusted by Father Robert Persons with the government of a small school for English in Eu, Normandy, and remained there until it was broken up by civil war, in 1593. Harrison then became the Procurator of the English College at Reims, took his degree of Doctor in Theology in 1597. Having returned to Douai when the college was restored there, he took his doctorate in divinity, in 1597, in that university, and was professor of theology at the English College until 1603.
He then went to Rome for five years, where he gained wide experience in ecclesiastical affairs. Harrison returned to Douai on 29 October 1608, and left it on 19 June 1609, when he set out on his way back to the mission in England.
Following the death of George Birkhead in 1614, Harrison was appointed archpriest of England by Pope Paul V on 23 February 1615. His brief was dated 11 July 1615. Besides the usual faculties, Pope Paul V granted to Harrison "Facultates pro archipresbytero Angliæ, in regnis Angliæ, Scotiæ, Hiberniæ, Monæ, et aliis locis dominii regis Magnæ Britanniæ, ac pro personis eorundum regnorum et dominiorum tantum" on 23 July 1615.
On 9 March 1617, Harrison issued a prohibition wherein secular priests under his jurisdiction were forbidden to attend plays by common players upon common stages, under penalty of losing their ecclesiastical faculties. In 1621 he sanctioned a protest sent to Rome by ten representatives of the secular regarding the institute established by Mary Ward as being opposed to the decrees of the Council of Trent.
His general policy was to restore peace between the secular clergy and the Jesuits while endeavouring to secure the independence of the former. To this end he aided Dr Matthew Kellison, president of the English College, Douai, in lessening the influence of the Jesuits there. He also aimed at restoring episcopal government in England. His influence ultimately secured this, though he himself died on 11 May 1621, just as his envoy was setting out for Rome.

"Getaway" is a single by R&B/funk band Earth, Wind & Fire released in 1976 on Columbia Records. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. "Getaway" also peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Dance Singles charts.
Overview
Getaway was produced by Maurice White and Charles Stepney and composed by Beloyd Taylor and Peter Cor Belenky.
An instrumental version of Getaway was the single's b-side. Getaway also came upon EWF's 1976 studio album Spirit.
Critical reception
Joe McEwen of Rolling Stone said "Getaway, a current pop smash, is EWF at its best. The theme is in line with urban escapist classics like 'Up on the Roof' and 'World of Fantasy', with pyramid mumbo-jumbo temporarily laid aside. A propulsive funk track laced with dizzying changes makes the song one of the most sophisticated pop hits in recent memory".
Ed Hogan of Allmusic described Getaway as a "fantastically frantic jam". He also noted that "listen to the opening horn blasts which could be termed assaultive if this wasn't such a cut as well as the earth-shaking energy that's released on the track, it's easily one of the band's most sensational sides." Music Week declared that the song "opens proceedings in fine style, with Philip Bailey's falsetto sweetening its funky rhythms".

Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly (often simply Black, Manafort) was a lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C. and formed in 1980 by Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Charles Black.
History
As Black, Manafort & Stone, the firm was one of the first political consulting groups to work for Ronald Reagan's presidential candidacy in 1980, and would later also have extensive connections to the presidential administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Donald Trump was this firm's first client.
In 1984 it was renamed to Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly (BMSK) & associates, after Peter G. Kelly was recruited.
The firm has represented, and lobbied the US Congress on behalf of, numerous foreign governments and heads of state from both representative democracies and unelected dictatorships including Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia, dictator Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and Jonas Savimbi of Angola. According to "The Torturer's Lobby", a report published by The Center for Public Integrity, the firm received $3.3 million in the early 1990s for their work with dictators.
During the 1988 presidential campaign in the United States, it was disclosed that Black, Manafort retained the island nation of the Bahamas as a client at a time its leadership was being attacked for alleged ties to drug traffickers. BMSK officials insisted that they intended only to help the Bahamas obtain more United States aid for efforts to curb drug smugglers.
On January 1, 1991, BMSK was acquired by Burson-Marsteller who between 1989 and 1994 had acquired Gold & Liebengood which was founded by Martin B. Gold and Howard Scholer Liebengood in 1984. BMSK merged with Gold & Liebengood to form BKSH & Associates in 1996.
According to Mustafa Nayyem in 2007, the Saint Petersburg office of BMSK was headed by Leonid Avrashov () who, according to Serhiy Leshchenko in 2017, also had a credit card with Rinat Akhmetov's First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB) ().
Domestically the firm represented Bethlehem Steel and Tobacco Institute, helped elect Senators Phil Gramm, Jesse Helms, Charles McCurdy Mathias Jr., Arlen Specter, Paula Hawkins and David F. Durenberger—and worked on legislation that benefitted the firm's clients.
Both Paul Manafort and Roger Stone worked on and held important positions in the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Stone was convicted of seven felony charges due to his work on the Trump campaign.

Königsmünster Abbey is a Benedictine abbey (belonging to the Benedictine Congregation of Saint Ottilien) in Meschede, Germany.
History
The abbey was founded in 1928, from three abbeys in Bavaria. The contract between the city of Meschede and the Benedictine congregation stipulated that the monks would take over the local Rektoratsschule, and would in return receive financial support for the construction of the abbey. A competition for the design of the abbey was won by Franz Schneider, who drew up a symmetrical building centered around a church facade. The name Königsmünster means "monastery of the King” (that is, Christ).
The monks followed the tradition of Grafschaft Abbey in the Sauerland (it had been dissolved in 1804). From the weapon of that abbey, Königsmünster took the antlers, and its monks compiled a necrology of the Grafschaft monks.
The abbey became an independent priory in 1932, with Linus Leberle (1880–1956) as its first prior. Alban Buckel was prior from 1937 to 1956. From 1941 to 1945 the abbey was shut down.
, 48 monks lived in the abbey.
Elementary school (Gymnasium)
The “Gymnasium der Benediktiner”, also called Gymn Benedictine, is a still in-tact gymnasium that belongs to the Königsmünster Abbey. Some monks of the abbey teach religion or even other subjects in this school.

The G8 Climate Change Roundtable was formed in January 2005 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Its purpose was to address the global climate change issue facing governments, business and civil society. The first meeting was held in Gleneagles, Scotland, from 6–8 July 2005, to coincide with the 31st G8 summit.
The roundtable was established by twenty-three leading international businesses with the assistance of G8 President and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair, to co-operatively engage in a global plan of action. The aim of the group was to ensure that a long-term policy framework was set up to enable consistent and transparent market-based solutions in mitigating climate change, while also addressing issues linked to climate change; such as economic growth, poverty, and adequate energy supplies. Carbon trading is one of the most popular pricing mechanisms used to to reduce greenhouse emissions worldwide.
The group devised a Framework for Action which called for technology incentive programs, the establishment of common metrics, for example in energy efficiency, and the expansion of emissions trading schemes.
Some of the companies participating include Ford, British Airways, HSBC, EdF and BP. Now, the Climate Change Roundtable has a membership of 150 businesses spread across the globe.
Environmentalists raised concerns that the body's statement does not call for targets or include timetables. Friends of the Earth noted that the roundtable represented a major shift by the business community towards efforts to mitigate climate change.
Key principles
The G8 Climate Change Roundtable stated 5 key points to be addressed:
Companies must recognize their responsibility in addressing climate change.
The issue of climate change requires further international attention and support.
Market forces must be considered in the crafting of a solution, consumer support is needed to solve the problem.
Specific policies for the mitigation of climate change.
Specific policies which should be adopted by G8 members.
For business
The G8 Climate Change Roundtable developed 5 key principles for businesses to consider when crafting a climate change mitigation strategy. These principles are:
Strategies should be based on scientific and economic facts.
Businesses should adopt market based policy frameworks which are transparent and offer consistent price signals in the long-term.
Solutions should be adopted globally in order to achieve long-term success.
Climate change solutions must not be viewed in isolation from other global challenges, such as ensuring access to energy, expanding availability of clean water, alleviating poverty, and achieving economic growth in emerging markets.
Businesses should seek a system wide solution, identifying opportunities for mitigation throughout the supply chain.
For governments
The G8 Climate Change Roundtable developed 3 key principles for governments to consider when addressing climate change. Governments should:
Focus their resources on measuring the effects of climate change on human, economic and environmental health.
Increase their understanding of current and future changes taking place within the global environment. (e.g. sea level rise, sea/ice cover).
Quickly and effectively adopt climate stabilization policies with the goal of mitigating future environmental harm.
Policy framework
The G8 Climate Change Roundtable aimed to create a long-term policy framework which was both transparent and consistent. Through market based solutions such as carbon trading, the Roundtable established a policy framework which now encompasses 150 businesses across the globe.
By creating long term value, these members established a market based framework extending to 2030 and indicative signals extending to 2050. This policy framework they hoped would take on a global scale, with consistent policies throughout the various states. The framework was meant to not only mitigate climate change but also promote sustainable development by addressing issues of poverty, energy and economic growth in emerging markets.
The Roundtable recommended encouraging technological innovation through performance based incentives. By quickly commercializing low carbon technologies they aimed to mitigate climate change quickly. They noted that by ensuring that climate change mitigation goals aligned with societal goals, governments would be able to optimize greenhouse gas reductions.
By ensuring that emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico, invest in low carbon economic growth, new technologies can be applied globally while streamlining emerging markets. New investments should align with societal goals, creating partnerships between G8 nations as well as emerging nations. Through such a partnership, members can effectively collaborate on specific projects within countries or rapid dissemination of specific technologies.
Members of the new policy framework should establish common metrics. By streamlining greenhouse emissions reporting processes and systems, countries can achieve this goal.
Business and G8 governments should use supply chain drivers and the power of procurement to integrate climate change solutions into their global supply chain requirements. By committing to the use of the Roundtable's policy framework throughout the supply chain, optimal greenhouse gas mitigation can be achieved.

Abu Ali al-Husayn ibn Ahmad al-Madhara'i, also known as Abu Zunbur ("the hornets' man"), was a member of the bureaucratic al-Madhara'i dynasty of fiscal officials, and served as director of finances of Egypt and Syria for the Abbasid Caliphate in the first decades of the 10th century.
Life
Al-Husayn was a son of Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara'i, who in 879 founded the family's fortunes when he was named controller of finances by the autonomous ruler of Egypt and Syria, Ahmad ibn Tulun. Abu Bakr held the post until his death in 884, and eventually named al-Husayn as his representative in Syria, while another son, Ali, fulfilled the same role in Egypt. Ali succeeded his father until his own death in 897, and was in turn succeeded by his son Ahmad.
Al-Husayn remained in charge of the finances of Syria throughout the Tulunid regime, but as it began to weaken, he took up contacts with the Abbasid court in Baghdad. Consequently, when the Tulunid domains were brought once more under direct Abbasid control in 904–5, and many of the family were deported to Baghdad, he replaced his nephew Ahmad as director of finances of Egypt. From this post he became involved in the factional struggles between the leading bureaucratic factions in Baghdad, the Banu'l-Furat clan and their opponents, the al-Madhara'i steadfastly siding with the latter. During the second vizierate of Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah (913–917), al-Husayn was once more appointed to Syria, while another nephew, Muhammad, took over in Egypt. When Ali ibn Isa fell and was replaced by his arch-rival Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat, the al-Madhara'i were dismissed and imprisoned.
Al-Husayn was recalled to Baghdad, where he remained until May 919, when he was once more assigned to the post of financial director of Egypt. He kept the post until 922, when he was dismissed by Ali ibn Isa. Recalled to Baghdad in 923, he was forced to pay a huge fine of five million dirhams. Nevertheless, in 926 he was again sent to Egypt with his remit extended to Syria as well. He died in office at Fustat in 929.

Terri Rogers (4 May 1937 – 30 May 1999) was a transsexual English ventriloquist and magician.
Rogers was born in Ipswich and was a somewhat isolated youth but determined to build a career in variety. Rogers developed a technically highly proficient ventriloquism act with her ventriloquist figure Shorty Harris, first appearing as a supporting act in music hall in the 1950s. She underwent gender reassignment surgery on the National Health Service in the early 1960s. This brought her some short-lived notoriety but did not hamper her career. Rogers won acclaim for her appearance in the 1968 review Boys Will be Girls at the Theatre Royal Stratford East and went on to become a highly regarded performer on the UK cabaret circuit. She was the only variety act ever to appear at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. From 1974 onwards she was a regular guest on TV on The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. She also appeared on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety show, The Good Old Days. Her cabaret career eventually extended internationally including appearances at Las Vegas and The Magic Castle in Hollywood, and on United States TV.
Her work as a magician was always something of a sideline but she was an ingenious developer of magic tricks including illusions for David Copperfield and Paul Daniels. She was an expert on "topology", the art of creating illusions with shapes, and wrote three standard texts on the subject. She was particularly known for illusions with Borromean Rings.
Rogers died in London after a series of strokes. She was survived by her life partner Val Andrews, also a magician.
Publications
Rogers published a number of magic effects and books, predominantly through specialist magic publisher Martin Breese. These include:
The Little Book of Ventriloquism (c.1948)
Terri Rogers' Star Gate (1985)
Boromian Link (1986)
Wipe Out (1986)
Word of Mind (1986)
Secrets (1986)
More Secrets (1988)
Top Secrets (1998)
In addition to these books, Rogers sold several manufactured tricks, including The Key and BlockBuster.

Adonal David Foyle (born March 9, 1975) is a Vincentian-American former professional basketball center. He was selected by the Golden State Warriors with the eighth overall selection of the 1997 NBA draft. Foyle played ten seasons with the Warriors until the team bought out his contract on August 13, 2007. At the time, he had been Golden State's longest-tenured player. He then played two seasons with the Orlando Magic and part of the season with the Memphis Grizzlies, sat out the next season due to knee surgery, and retired. , Foyle does Warriors post-game commentary for ABC 7 in San Francisco.
Early life and college career
Foyle was born in Canouan, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. At the age of 15, Foyle was adopted by Joan and Jay Mandle, professors at Colgate University. He first attended high school at Cardinal O'Hara Catholic High in Springfield, Pennsylvania. He transferred after sophomore year and attended high school at Hamilton Central School (Hamilton, New York), where he helped the HCS Emerald Knights gain their first two state championships. , his 47 points and 25 rebounds in the NYSPHSAA Class D semifinals in 1994 are tied for the most in either statistical category in a state tournament game.
In his official biography, Foyle explained that he enrolled at Colgate University because "he wanted the opportunity to learn the principles of the game in a slower-paced setting, where the coach would be able to give him the attention he desired." With the Colgate Raiders, he was the school's all-time-leading rebounder and 2nd-all-time-leading scorer. He led the Raiders to their first two NCAA tournament appearances in school history. He left as the NCAA's all-time leader in blocked shots with 492, despite playing only three college seasons (his record was broken by Wojciech Myrda in 2002). He now ranks third all-time, behind Myrda and Jarvis Varnado.
In 1999, Foyle graduated from Colgate magna cum laude with a history degree. Politically motivated, he founded the organization Democracy Matters, which tries to curb the effects of money on politics.
NBA career
In his NBA career, Foyle averaged 4.1 points and 1.6 blocks per game. He was among the top 10 in blocks per game three times during his career.
In July 2004, during the offseason, the Golden State Warriors re-signed Foyle to a six-year, $42 million contract. Foyle played sparingly during the 2006–07 season under head coach Don Nelson, and was waived by the Warriors on August 13, 2007, with three years and $29.2 million remaining on his contract.
On August 23, 2007, Foyle signed with the Orlando Magic for the veteran's minimum of $1.3 million. On August 2, 2008, he re-signed with the Magic for another year, also at the veteran's minimum.
He was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies on February 19, 2009.
On March 1, 2009 the Grizzlies waived Foyle. He signed with the Orlando Magic on March 23, 2009 for the rest of the season. Later that year, in August, Foyle re-signed with the Magic. However, he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery before the season began, and did not play that season. On August 17, 2010, Foyle announced his retirement. On September 7, 2010, the Magic named Foyle the team's director of player development, which he held until 2012.
Off the court
In his spare time, Foyle writes poems and is a political activist. He has reviewed books for Hoop magazine.
In 2001, he founded Democracy Matters, a non-partisan student organization, as an effort to counteract political apathy on college campuses. The organization's signature issue is campaign finance reform, particularly Clean Elections. Active on over 50 college campuses, Democracy Matters involves hundreds of students and faculty nationwide through teach-ins, letter writing and petition campaigns, educational seminars, and voter registration drives.
In 2005, Foyle founded the Kerosene Lamp Foundation, which serves children in St. Vincent & the Grenadines.
He played a cameo role of "detective" in the 2006 movie The Darwin Awards.
Foyle became an American citizen on March 13, 2007, after being in the U.S. for almost 18 years. He also became a member of the National Basketball Players Association executive committee.
He was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board in 2008.
On September 24, 2009, Foyle was inducted into the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame. Only eight other NBA players have been inducted into the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame (Nate "Tiny" Archibald, Vlade Divac, Julius Erving, AC Green, Kevin Johnson, Dikembe Mutombo, David Robinson and Steve Smith).
In 2013, Foyle released his first children's book, called Too Tall Foyle Finds His Game.
In January 2014, Foyle traveled to Spain and Morocco as a Sports Diplomacy Sports Envoy for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, he worked with Ruth Riley to conduct basketball clinics for more than 600 youth from under-served areas. In so doing, Foyle helped contribute to Sports Diplomacy's mission to promote conflict resolution, leadership, greater understanding and inclusion through sport.
The Golden State Warriors appointed Foyle as the team's community ambassador in 2014.

Duncan McIntyre (23 December 1834 – 13 June 1894) was a Scots-Quebecer businessman from Callander noted for his participation in the Canadian Pacific Railway syndicate of 1880 and as a founder of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada.
The Canada Central Railway was owned by McIntyre who amalgamated it with the CPR and became one of the handful of officers of the newly formed CPR. The CCR started in Brockville and extended to Pembroke. It then followed a westward route along the Ottawa River passing through places like Cobden, Deux Rivieres and eventually to Mattawa at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers. It then proceeded cross-country towards its final destination, Callander.
McIntyre and his contractor James Worthington led the CCR expansion. Worthington remained with the CPR for about a year until he left the company. McIntyre's nephew, John Ferguson, staked out the future North Bay, Ontario after getting assurance from his uncle and Worthington that it would be the divisional point and a location of some importance.
The CPR started its westward expansion from Bonfield, Ontario (previously called Callander Station) where the first spike was driven into a sunken railway tie. Bonfield, Ontario was inducted into Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 as the CPR First Spike location. That was the point where the Canada Central Railway extension ended.

Mary Fisher McIntyre. She married her first cousin, Archibald Arthur Hodgson (1869-1960), one of the five well-known sons of Jonathan Hodgson (1827-1914) and Margaret Cassils. Their son, Duncan, married Hylda, daughter of J. K. L. Ross, of Montreal.
Margaret McIntyre, married R. Archibald Snowball, of Chatham, New Brunswick. He was a younger son of The Hon. Jabez Bunting Snowball, Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. Their only child, Robbie, died unmarried at Montreal.
Jane McIntyre, married Lewis Reford, son of Robert Wilson Reford (1831-1913).
Residence
In the 1880s, McIntyre commissioned architect William Thomas to design a residence for him on a ten-acre plot within the Golden Square Mile. Known as Craguie, the mansion was demolished in 1930. In 1947, his family donated the land McGill University, for an area known as McIntyre Park. In 1965, the university completed construction of the McIntyre Medical Sciences Building, named in his honour. The McIntyre site is also home to the Stewart Biological Sciences Building.

"Bombshells" is the fifteenth episode of the seventh season of the American medical drama series House. It aired on March 7, 2011.
Plot
A teenager is admitted to the hospital after spitting up blood. Taub also discovers that the boy has been depressed and appears to have been cutting himself. More concern arises when the team breaks into the boy's house and finds his school yearbook with his classmates' faces crossed out and threatening words written about the school, and when Taub checks the contents of the boy's flash drive, he finds disturbing videos of him blowing up homemade pipe bombs and appearing to show misanthropic and sociopathic tendencies.
It is discovered that a piece of one of the bombs ended up lodged in his system, and the foreign material is what has caused his various medical maladies. Taub, however, is torn between sending the videos to the authorities throughout the case, but in the end, decides to mail the flash drive to the police.
Meanwhile, Cuddy finds blood in her urine and undergoes tests for possible kidney cancer, while House grapples with emotionally supporting her, avoiding her, and denying that she is actually sick. Cuddy goes through several dreams while hospitalized before her kidney problems were found to be a benign tumor.
After speaking with her sister, Cuddy realizes that when House came to see her during her illness, he was under the influence of Vicodin. Realizing that he is unable to open up completely and share the pain that she considers to be part of any meaningful relationship, she ends their relationship.
The episode is concluded with a scene that echoes the last scene of the previous season's finale ("Help Me"): House is sitting on his bathroom floor with a bottle of Vicodin in his hand. He expectantly looks at the doorway. Resigned, and with no Cuddy to save him, he takes the pills.
Critical response
Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B+ rating, praising "Bombshells" despite the campy dream sequences.

Avenue Henri-Martin is an avenue in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, named after the French historian Henri Martin (1810–1883), onetime mayor of the 16th arrondissement.
The Avenue Henri-Martin in the 16th arrondissement of Paris is 663 metres long and 40 metres wide. It starts at Rue de la Pompe and ends at the Place de Colombie, where Boulevard Suchet changes into Boulevard Lannes. Both streets lead to the outskirts of the urban forest Bois de Boulogne.
It also passes through two “Quartiers” (a “Quartier” is a part of town): Muette, which lies in the eastern part, Porte Dauphine in the western part. At the eastern end of the street there is a metro station (Rue de la Pompe), which is a stop on line nine. At the western end the station Gare de l'avenue Henri Martin, which is connected with the RER lines, is operated from the lines C1 and C3.
History
The Avenue Henri-Martin continues in the western part of Rue de la Pompe as the Avenue Georges-Mandel; this section also belonged to the Avenue Henri-Martin earlier, but was changed in 1945 in honour of the French historian and politician Louis Georges Rothschild alias Georges Mandel (1885-1944), who was murdered in World War II. The house numbers show that all of this was a single street at an earlier point in time. The Avenue Georges-Mandel ends with the numbers 58 or rather 69, whereas the local street starts with the numbers 58 or rather 71. In the building at number 71, the administrative headquarters of the 16th Arrondissement can be found.
The Avenue Henri-Martin was named after Henri Martin, a French historian and politician (1810-1883), who was elected mayor of the 16th arrondissement in 1870.
He wrote a book with the title Histoire de France, which consisted of 17 volumes.
Well-known residents
The building with the house numbers 107 through 113 was once the home of the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine (1790-1869). Geo-engineer Paul Louis Weiss, born in Straßburg in 1867, has also lived there in a spacious flat from the time of his arrival in Paris in 1899 until his death on Christmas in 1945. Moreover, the main entrance to Winnaretta Singer's house (1865-1943), built in 1904, can be found in this street, too. She was one of the daughters and heiresses of Isaac Merritt Singer (1811-1875), who made his fortune in the sewing machine branch. Grand Duke Cyril of Russia and his wife Grand Duchess Victoria had an apartment at no. 32 (now Ave. Georges Mandel) from 1906 until the 1920's.

An overwhelming majority of fiction is set on or features the Earth. This also holds true of science fiction, despite perceptions to the contrary. Counterfactual depictions of the shape of the Earth, be it flat or hollow, occasionally are featured. A personified, living Earth appears in a handful of works. In works set in the far future, Earth can be a center of space-faring human civilization, or just one of many inhabited planets of a galactic empire, and sometimes destroyed by ecological disaster or nuclear war or otherwise forgotten or lost.
Related vocabulary
In a number of works of science fiction, Earth's English name has become less popular, and the planet is instead known as Terra or Tellus, Latin words for Earth. Inhabitants of Earth can be referred to as Earthlings, Earthers, Earthborn, Earthfolk, Earthians, Earthies (this term being often seen as derogatory), Earthmen (and Earthwomen), Earthpersons, Earthsiders, Solarians, Tellurians, Terrestrials, Terrestrians, or Terrans.
In addition, science fiction vocabulary includes terms like Earthfall for landing of a spaceship on planet Earth; or Earth-type, Earthlike, Earthnorm(al) and terrestrial for the concept of "resembling planet Earth or conditions on it".
The concept of modifying planets to be more Earth-like is known as terraforming. The concept of terraforming developed from both science fiction and actual science. In science, Carl Sagan, an astronomer, proposed the terraforming of Venus in 1961, which is considered one of the first accounts of the concept. The term itself, however, was coined by Jack Williamson in a science-fiction short story ("Collision Orbit") published in 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction, although the concept of terraforming in popular culture predates this work; for example, the idea of turning the Moon into a habitable environment with atmosphere was already present in La Journée d'un Parisien au XXIe siècle ("A Day of a Parisian in the 21st Century", 1910) by .
Themes
In general, the vast majority of fiction, including science fiction, takes place on Earth. To the extent that Earth is more than the obvious but forgettable background where the action of the story takes place, a number of themes have been identified.
Earth
Many works of science fiction focus on the outer space, but many others still take place on Earth; this distinction has been subject to debates among the science fiction authors, visible for example in J. G. Ballard's 1962 essay Which Way to Inner Space?. Some critics of the "outer space adventures" have pointed to the importance of "earthly" concepts and imagery closer to contemporary readers' everyday experience. While it has been argued that a planet can be considered "too large, and its lifetime too long, to be comfortably accommodated within fiction as a topic in its own right," this has not prevented some writers from engaging with said topic.
Some works that focus on Earth as an entity have been influenced by holistic, "big picture" concepts such as the Gaia hypothesis, noosphere and the Omega Point, and the popularizing of the photography of Earth from space. Others works have addressed the concept of Earth as a Goddess Gaia (from Greek mythology; another prominent goddess of Earth whose name influenced science fiction was the Roman Terra or Tellus). Bridging these ideas, and treating Earth as a semi-biological or even sentient entity, are classic works like Arthur Conan Doyle's When the World Screamed (1928) and Jack Williamson's Born of the Sun (1934).
Shape
Depictions of the Earth as being flat are uncommon in modern works, the sphericity of the planet having been proved around 200 B.C. by Archimedes and Eratosthenes. Exceptions to this include Terry Pratchett's satirical Discworld series—which was inspired by Hindu cosmology—and deliberately provocative works like S. Fowler Wright's novel Beyond the Rim from 1932. There have also been fictional accounts of a hollow Earth, such as Edgar Allan Poe's 1838 novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket inspired by John Cleves Symmes Jr.'s model featuring openings at the north and south poles whereby the interior can be accessed. A few writers have likewise engaged with another old fringe theory, that of Counter-Earth – a hypothetical body of the Solar System that orbits on the other side of the solar system from Earth.
Planetary engineering
Large scale planetary engineering includes ideas such as adjusting the Earth's axial tilt, or moving the Earth from its orbit. Some works deal with geoengineering, a term usually referred to large-scale projects attempting to deal with the problem of climate change; a theme common in many works of climate fiction. In the extreme case, Earth can be consumed in its entirety, all of its mass repurposed in construction of megastructures such as a Dyson sphere.
The end of Earth
Various versions of the future of Earth have been imagined. Some works focus on the end of the planet; those have been written in all forms – some focused on "ostentatious mourning"; others more of a slapstick comedy; yet others take this opportunity to explore themes of astronomy or sociology. The genre of climate fiction can often mix the themes of near and far future consequences of the climate change, whether anthropogenic or accidental. In other works, often found in the apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction and the Dying Earth genres, Earth has been destroyed or at least ruined for generations to come; many such works are therefore set in the background of Earth changed into a wasteland. Some of the works in these genres overlap with the climate change genre, as climate change and resulting ecological disasters are a commonly used plot device for events that trigger the fall of human civilization (other plots involve the destruction of Earth from human warfare, alien invasions, or from various sorts of man-made incidents or accidental disasters). Many such works, set either during the disaster, or in its aftermath, are metaphors for environmental concerns or otherwise warnings about issues the writers think humanity needs to be concerned about.
One planet among many
For many works set in the far future, Earth is just one of many inhabited planets of a galactic empire, federation or larger civilization, and many similar planets have been found or created (common themes in space opera), all of which challenges the idea of Earth's uniqueness. In some works, Earth is still a center of the known universe, or at least a significant player on the galactic scene. In others, Earth has become of so little importance that it is a mostly forgotten backwards world. In Clifford D. Simak's Cemetery World (1973) Earth is a planet-size cemetery and in Gordon R. Dickson's Call Him Lord (1966), a museum. At its extreme, in some settings, knowledge of Earth has been simply lost, making it a mythological place, whose existence is questioned by the few who even know the legends about it. In some of these works, a major plotline can involve future civilizations or intrepid explorers seeking the "lost cradle" or Earth. Finally, some stories told from the perspective of aliens focus on their discovery of Earth.
A different history
Some works look backwards – or perhaps sideways, not to the future of Earth, but to its past; here, works of science fiction can overlap with historic fiction as well as prehistoric fiction. This can happen particularly through the genres of alternate history as well as time travel (where as Gary Westfahl observed, most time travellers travel through time much more than space, visiting the past or future versions of Earth).

The contrabassophone is a woodwind instrument, invented about 1847 by German bassoon maker Heinrich Joseph Haseneier. It was intended as a substitute for the contrabassoon, which at that time was an unsatisfactory instrument, with a muffled sound due to tone holes that were too small and too close together. Haseneier's design made use of some of the same principles that went into the Boehm system flute, in which keywork was developed based on tone holes with acoustically optimum sizes and positions. Another change in the Haseneier design of the contrabassophone was increasing the size of the bore to be substantially larger (by about a third) than that of the contrabassoon. This resulted in an instrument with a powerful tone. Haseneier applied for a patent for his design but was rejected. The contrabassophone was regarded as too loud for orchestral use, though it was suitable for outdoor use in military bands.
Dr W.H. Stone brought a Haseneier instrument to England playing it in performances of the Handel Festival of 1871. Alfred Morton, the best English bassoon maker of the time made 3 or 4 copies of this instrument some of which included improvements in the keywork. In 1881, Morton's eldest son played one of these instrument with the Halle Orchestra. He also played it at the Crystal Palace, at Richter's concerts and at the opera. Morton made one of a higher pitch (in F) for Sir Arthur Sullivan for use in the Savoy Theatre. Following Sullivan's death, this instrument disappeared. Many other European makers produced copies of the contrabassophone, including a lightweight version made of papier-mâché.
Adolphe Fontaine-Besson patented a similar instrument in 1890 but allowed the patent to lapse in 1898. By this time the contrabassophone had been largely superseded by improved versions of the contrabassoon for orchestral use, and by the tuba in wind bands.
An instrument like those that Morton made has a range of three octaves and one tone from a low C to a high D. The fingerings are like a recorder to some degree, with a number of chromatic notes played with forked fingerings, making it quite difficult to play in keys with three or more accidentals. This could have been one of the reasons that the instrument was not played in English orchestras by the late part of the nineteenth century, instead being played in military bands such as the Coldstream, the Grenadier and the Scots Guards.

Coal combustion products (CCPs), also called coal combustion wastes (CCWs) or coal combustion residuals (CCRs), are categorized in four groups, each based on physical and chemical forms derived from coal combustion methods and emission controls:
Fly ash is captured after coal combustion by filters (bag houses), electrostatic precipitators and other air pollution control devices. It comprises 60 percent of all coal combustion waste (labeled here as coal combustion products).It is most commonly used as a high-performance substitute for Portland cement or as clinker for Portland cement production. Cements blended with fly ash are becoming more common. Building material applications range from grouts and masonry products to cellular concrete and roofing tiles. Many asphaltic concrete pavements contain fly ash. Geotechnical applications include soil stabilization, road base, structural fill, embankments and mine reclamation. Fly ash also serves as filler in wood and plastic products, paints and metal castings.
Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) materials are produced by chemical “scrubber” emission control systems that remove sulfur and oxides from power plant flue gas streams. FGD comprises 24 percent of all coal combustion waste. Residues vary, but the most common are FGD gypsum (or “synthetic” gypsum) and spray dryer absorbents. FGD gypsum is used in almost thirty percent of the gypsum panel products manufactured in the U.S. It is also used in agricultural applications to treat undesirable soil conditions and to improve crop performance. Other FGD materials are used in mining and land reclamation activities.
Bottom ash and boiler slag can be used as a raw feed for manufacturing portland cement clinker, as well as for skid control on icy roads. The two materials comprise 12 and 4 percent of coal combustion waste respectively. These materials are also suitable for geotechnical applications such as structural fills and land reclamation. The physical characteristics of bottom ash and boiler slag lend themselves as replacements for aggregate in flowable fill and in concrete masonry products. Boiler slag is also used for roofing granules and as blasting grit.
Environmental impacts
The majority of CCPs are landfilled, placed in mine shafts or stored in ash ponds at coal-fired power plants. Groundwater pollution from unlined ash ponds has been a continuing environmental problem in the United States. Additionally some of these ponds have had structural failures, causing massive ash spills into rivers, such as the 2014 Dan River coal ash spill. Federal design standards for ash ponds were strengthened in 2015. Following litigation challenges to various provisions of the 2015 regulations, EPA issued two final rules in 2020, labeled as the "CCR Part A" and ""CCR Part B" rules. The rules require some facilities to retrofit their impoundments with liners, while other facilities may propose alternative designs and request additional time to achieve compliance. In August 2021 EPA announced that it plans to publish a proposed rule in fall 2022 that would strengthen wastewater limits for discharges to surface waters.
Recycling
About 52 percent of CCPs in the U.S. were recycled for "beneficial uses" in 2019, according to the American Coal Ash Association. In Australia about 47% of coal ash was recycled in 2020. The chief benefit of recycling is to stabilize the environmental harmful components of the CCPs such as arsenic, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, chromium VI, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, strontium, thallium, and vanadium, along with dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Jian Zihao (), better known by his in-game name Uzi, is a Chinese professional League of Legends player for Bilibili Gaming. Widely regarded as the greatest AD carry of all time, he is renowned for his mechanical prowess on champions such as Vayne, Kai'Sa, Ezreal and Kog'Maw. He was well known as the franchise player for Royal Never Give Up and its predecessors, although he also played briefly for OMG and Newbee.
Uzi has played in the World Championship grand finals twice, both times with Royal Club. He won his first international title at the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational with his team Royal Never Give Up, after defeating the LCK champions Kingzone DragonX.
Uzi officially announced his retirement from professional play on Weibo on 3 June 2020. Uzi ended his career due to personal health issues.
Career
Uzi began his professional career on the Chinese team Royal Club. Widely considered as one of the best AD carries during seasons three and four, Uzi demonstrated his great mechanic prowess and carried his team to two consecutive second-place finishes at the League of Legends World Championship in both 2013 and 2014. Despite their success at Season 3 Worlds, the departure of Tabe prompted Uzi to switch to the mid lane at the start of Season 4 before returning to the ADC role during the summer. Renamed to Star Horn Royal Club, Uzi with Korean imports inSec and Zero rose to the challenge and finished second at worlds with a 1:3 series against one of the best teams ever, Samsung White. And he left the Royal club for the communication problem with Korean imports.
Season 5 however, proved to be a slump in Uzi's career after moving to OMG. Despite being touted as one of the biggest talent transfers of the offseason, OMG incurred difficulties in integrating Uzi to the team. Coupled with the decline of Gogoing and Lovelin, Season 5 was a disappointing one for Uzi. Uzi was picked up by Qiao Gu Reapers and was their sub for Peco. QG was invited to IEM Katowice in March 2016 where they beat Fnatic in their first best of one but were then subsequently eliminated in the group stages following a loss to SK Telecom T1 and then losing to Fnatic 1 - 2.
In May 2016, Qiao Gu Reapers was acquired by Newbee. However, five days later Uzi's contract was bought out by Royal Never Give Up.
On 3 June 2020, Uzi announced his retirement from professional gaming, citing health concerns. In a statement he said, "As a result of staying up late for years, a fatty diet and being under insurmountable stress, last year I found out that I was type-2 diabetic." He added that his mental state was "not as good as it was before". In an effort to recover, he took medication and made changes to his work schedule and exercise habits, but his situation did not change. His doctor told him there could be "serious complications" if he continued playing competitively.
On 15 Dec 2021, Uzi announced he will return to the game and join BLG (Bilibili Gaming) as AD player. At the same time, Crisp Breath and Doggo join the BLG too. Uzi himself also responded to this situation. In the past two years, exercise and fitness have become indispensable things in his daily life, so he is still relatively confident in his body. But in the 2021 Spring LPL (League of Legends Pro League), Uzi has not participated any official game yet. On 1 Jan 2021, RNG (Royal Never Give up) 2:1 BLG (Bilibili Gaming). Uzi did not participate the game.

USS J. C. Kuhn was a capacious bark acquired by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was used by the Union Navy as a stores ship in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.
Service history
J. C. Kuhn was a wooden bark of two decks and three masts built at Portland, Connecticut by S. Gildersleeve & Sons, in 1859. She was purchased by the Navy at New York City from J. H. Brower & Co. on 6 July 1861; and commissioned at New York Navy Yard on 23 August, Acting Master Robert G. Lee in command. The supply and coal vessel reported to the Gulf Blockading Squadron at Key West, Florida, 11 September bringing a cargo of coal, lumber, and whaleboats. Six days later she delivered coal and provisions to Union vessels off Fort Pickens, Florida, to begin her record of dependable service carrying fuel, food, lumber, and water to Union ships in the Gulf of Mexico and the lower Mississippi River. She arrived below Vicksburg, Mississippi, on 27 June 1862 loaded with coal for Flag Officer David Farragut's ships the day before they daringly steamed under the Southern batteries there to join forces with Flag Officer Davis's Mississippi Flotilla, which had been fighting its way south along the river. She remained below Vicksburg supporting Comdr. David Dixon Porter's Mortar Flotilla while Farragut operated above the Confederate stronghold until his ships had again run the gauntlet to rejoin Porter on 15 July.
She then sailed down river with Farragut and resumed her duty of transporting supplies from Pensacola, Florida, to ships stationed along the U.S. Gulf Coast. In the spring of 1864, J. C. Kuhn was ordered to Pensacola for service as ordnance and store ship, and she continued this duty until sailing for New York on 20 January 1866. After arriving at New York City on 14 February and discharging her stores, the veteran bark received badly needed repairs. Restored and refurbished, J. C. Kuhn stood down to the Battery on 7 April, and 3 days later was renamed Purveyor. As Purveyor, she supplied the European and South Atlantic Squadrons and served as a store ship before being sold at New York to P. H. Fay on 7 July 1869.

Provoleta is an Argentine variant of provolone cheese described as "Argentine pulled-curd Provolone cheese". It is eaten grilled in Argentina and Uruguay. It can be made on a grill, or indoors in a cast-iron pan. The cheese should be firm and able to hold its shape when grilled.
It was introduced in Argentina by Natalio Alba, a native of the Calabria region in Italy, who created this cheese inspired by typical cheeses of his region such as provola silana and caciocavallo, combining it with the tradition of Argentine asado.
Small discs of locally produced provolone cheese of in diameter and in height are often eaten at the start of an asado, before the grilled meat. The provolone, often topped with chilli and oregano, is placed directly on the grill, on small stones or inside a foil plate, and cooked until part-melted. The provoleta may be seasoned with chimichurri, a mixture of oils and spices, and is usually eaten communally with bread.
Stuffed provoleta () is provoleta stuffed with assorted fillings that could include ham, barbecue sausage or morcilla blood sausage, cheese, vegetables, peppers and onions.

Ukrainian John Peel Sessions () is a compilation album by The Wedding Present, originally gathering their first three Ukrainian language John Peel radio sessions. It was scheduled to be released in late 1988 by their own record company, Reception Records, but was ultimately released in February 1989 by their new record label RCA.
About the album
Origins
The Wedding Present guitarist Peter Solowka, whose father is Ukrainian, used to play a Ukrainian folk tune called "Hopak" to entertain his friends. When he did so during a radio session the band was recording for the BBC Radio 1 John Peel show, they decided to record the song for the session. The song was received well and, fired by Solowka's enthusiasm, the band decided to dedicate another Peel session to Ukrainian folk songs. Because none of them could sing Ukrainian to any acceptable degree, they decided to invite fellow Leeds musician "The Legendary" Len Liggins of The Sinister Cleaners, who had read Russian at University, to sing and play various instruments.
The resulting Peel session's broadcast provoked a reaction of Hang the Dance! member Roman Remeynes, himself fluent in Ukrainian, who jokingly accused the band of bastardising the music. This led to him being invited to join as well for a second Ukrainian-themed Peel session. By this time, original Wedding Present drummer Shaun Charman had been replaced with Simon Smith, coincidentally an ex-Sinister Cleaner himself.
Aborted Reception Records release
The band intended to release a compilation of the first and second Peel sessions as Українські Виступи в Івана Піла on their independent record label Reception Records, whose distribution was handled by Red Rhino, a York-based division of the independent UK distribution network, The Cartel. Red Rhino issued a radio promo of "Davni Chasy" and pressed a batch of the LP for release in late 1988, but went into receivership before it could actually release the album. Prompted by the demise of their backers, The Wedding Present decided to fold their own record label and sign with a regular record company. Of the original pressing (catalogue number REC010), a small number of copies managed to leave the warehouse; these are nowadays sought after.
RCA release
The company The Wedding Present signed with was RCA, which immediately bought up the Red Rhino batch of the album and pressed a new batch themselves. Українські Виступи в Івана Піла was released in February 1989, backed with a new pressing of the "Davni Chasy" promo. RCA pleaded with the band to have a regular release of the song, better known as "Those Were the Days My Friend", which they were sure would provide them with a Top Ten hit. The band, however, refused. Українські Виступи в Івана Піла reached #22 in the UK albums charts.
After the album's release, the band went on a short British tour that was well received. Bolstered by the success, they recorded a third Ukrainian Peel session. After that, the Ukrainian phase in The Wedding Present's career was over, but Liggins, Remeynes and Solowka decided to continue playing together as The Ukrainians. Their 1991 eponymous debut album features contributions by all Wedding Present band members.
Re-release
In 2000, independent record label Fresh Ear Records re-released Українські Виступи в Івана Піла, changing its Latin-alphabet subtitle to Ukrainian John Peel Sessions. The re-release also includes the third Peel session and "Hopak", the song with which it all began, and so compiles all Ukrainian-themed songs recorded by The Wedding Present.
Peter Solowka went on to play these and other songs in his new group, The Ukrainians.

Chimnyu of Baekje (died 385) (r. 384–385) was the fifteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
Background
He was the eldest son of the 14th king, Geungusu and Lady Ai of the Jin clan. He became king upon Geungusu's death in 384 which was the 10th year of his reign.
Reign
Samguk Sagi:
384 AD, autumn, seventh month. Messengers were dispatched to the Jin court with tribute. Ninth month. The western monk Malananda came from Jin. The king received him, and kept him in the palace. All cordialities were extended to him. This was the first transmission of the Buddhist dharma to Baekje.
385 AD, spring, second month. They built a Buddhist temple at Mt. Hansan, and 10 people became monks. Winter, eleventh month. The king died.
Legacy
He was the first Baekje king to officially recognize Buddhism. According to the Samguk sagi and Samguk yusa, the two oldest extant histories of Korea, Buddhism was officially introduced to Korea during the 4th century during the Three Kingdoms period. In 384, the Indian Buddhist monk Marananta came to Baekje from Eastern Jin. King Chimnyu welcomed him into the palace, and shortly thereafter adopted Buddhism. Archaeological discoveries have corroborated these assertions of the early introduction of Buddhism into Korea with the discovery of Goguryeo tomb murals with Buddhist motifs and the excavation of lotus shaped roof tiles dated to the 4th century. In 385, the king ordered that a Buddhist temple be built at the Baekje capital of Hansan (suggested, but not certain, to be at Bukhansanseong), and ten people became monks. After his death his brother Jinsa was crowned but after his death Chimnyu's eldest son became the next king, Asin of Baekje. After Asin's death in 405 his three other sons fought for the crown ending in all of their deaths and the crowning of Asin's son.

Vladimir Maček (20 June 1879 – 15 May 1964) was a politician in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. As a leader of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) following the 1928 assassination of Stjepan Radić, Maček had been a leading Croatian political figure until the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. As a leader of the HSS, Maček played a key role in establishment of the Banovina of Croatia, an autonomous banovina in Yugoslavia in 1939.
Early life
Maček was born in Kupinec near Jastrebarsko, southwest of Zagreb. His father Ivan was a Slovene, originally from Lesično, and his mother Ida was of mixed Croatian, on her father's side, and Polish descent on her mother's. At the age of six, Maček started attending elementary school in Kupinec, but continued his education in Zagreb, as his father, a public employee, was transferred there. In Zagreb, Maček enrolled at a gymnasium, which he finished when he was 18 and enrolled at the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb. He earned a law degree at University of Zagreb. After clerking at various Croatian courts he opened a private law practice in 1908 in Sv. Ivan Zelina. He joined the Croatian Peasant Party at its founding.
World War I
At the outbreak of the World War I, Maček was a reserve officer. As such, he was mobilised into 25th People's Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army as a commander of the 3rd company on 27 July 1914. Maček participated in the Serbian Campaign and was wounded in the Battle of Kolubara while crossing the river Kolubara in November. After returning from hospital in Novi Sad to Zagreb before the Christmas, he was decorated for bravery and promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Due to his astigmatism, he was declared unfit to serve on the battlefield, and was appointed a commander of an engineer company, composed of Poles and Ukrainians. His company prepared defenses of Budapest, and later Austrian-Hungarian port in Pula, where he served until autumn 1916. From 15 October 1916 until 15 March 1917 he served in occupying forces in Albania.
After World War I
After World War I, during which he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, he became a close associate of Stjepan Radić. In 1925, after Radić's visit to Moscow and the Croatian Peasant Party joining the Peasants International, Maček was arrested by the Royal Yugoslav authorities. While in jail, he was elected to the National Assembly. In July 1925, after HSS had joined the government, Maček was released.
HSS leadership and Banovina of Croatia
Maček became the leader of the party on 13 August 1928 following Radić's assassination. He quickly became a main opponent of King Alexander and was arrested in April 1933 and sentenced to three years in jail for treason.
Maček was released following Alexander's assassination in 1934. His stated aim during that period was to transform Yugoslavia from a unitary state, dominated by ethnic Serbs, into a new form of state organization in which Croatian statehood would be restored. His ideas appealed to a majority of Croats, and the Croatian Peasant Party gradually gained popularity. He nurtured close relations with other opposition parties in Yugoslavia and, although his coalition lost elections in 1938, it remained a force for reckoning. His persistence and political skills finally paid off in August 1939 with Dragiša Cvetković in the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and the creation of the Banovina of Croatia (Banovina), a semi-autonomous entity which contained Croatia and large sections of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. HSS became part of the coalition government while Maček himself became deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia.
World War II
This triumph proved to be short-lived as Banovina collapsed along with Yugoslavia when it was invaded by the Axis invasion in April 1941. Seen by Nazi Germany as an ideal leader of a new Axis puppet state—the Independent State of Croatia—Maček was offered the opportunity to become prime minister, but refused the offer twice. He called on the supporters of HSS to respect and co-operate with the new regime of Ante Pavelić, while at the same time delegating Juraj Krnjević to represent the Croatian people in the Yugoslav government-in-exile.
Maček's strategy proved to be detrimental both for his party and himself. In October 1941 he was arrested and interned in Jasenovac concentration camp where he was put under the watch of Ljubo Miloš for some time. Five months later, on 16 March 1942, he was placed under house arrest together with his family at his home in Kupinec. His family shared his internment first in Kupinec, then two months of 1943 (9 January to 9 March) in Luburić's Zagreb apartment (which they shared with Luburić's aged mother and his two sisters), and finally from 9 December 1943 until the collapse of Pavelić's Ustaša regime in May 1945 in his Prilaz 9 house in Zagreb. In the meantime, HSS began to fracture along ideological lines—some of its members joined the Ustaše, while others joined Tito's Partisans. Bitterly opposed to both, in 1945 Maček emigrated he first to France, then to the U.S.
Later life
On 12 June 1945 Maček was received by French foreign minister Georges Bidault who offered him the right of domicile in France. He visited the United States for the first time in 1946 after receiving a visa by order of the Department of State. He was received by mayor David L. Lawrence of Pittsburgh while delivering a speech in that city.
Maček helped found the International Peasants' Union along with Georgi Mihov Dimitrov in 1947. He refused offers for the leadership of the numerous Croatian émigré groups. In 1949, he provided much of the material on Yugoslavia for "Communists Crush Churches in Eastern Europe," edited by Reuben H. Markham. He died of a heart attack in Washington D.C. on 15 May 1964, at 84. His remains were taken to Croatia in 1996 and buried in the Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Order of King Dmitar Zvonimir in 2004.

The office of High Sheriff of Cardiganshire was established in 1541, since when a high sheriff was appointed annually until 1974 when the office was transformed into that of High Sheriff of Dyfed as part of the creation of Dyfed from the amalgamation of Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. Between the Edwardian Conquest of Wales in 1282 and the establishment of the High Sheriff of Cardiganshire, the sheriff's duties were mainly the responsibility of the coroner and the Custos Rotulorum of Cardiganshire. The office of High Sheriff remained first in precedence in the county until the reign of Edward VII when an Order in Council in 1908 gave the Lord Lieutenant of Cardiganshire the prime office under the Crown as the sovereign's personal representative.

Rosa abyssinica is the only rose native to Africa. Europeans first learned of the rose in the writings of 19th-century Scottish botanist Robert Brown. Rosa abyssinica is included in the genus Rosa, and the family Rosaceae. No subspecies are listed in the Catalogue of Life.
Description
Rosa abyssinica is a prickly evergreen shrub, creeping or often climbing, capable of forming a small tree up to 23 feet (7 meters) tall. It has a few prickles on the stem, slightly curved from a wide base and all similar. It has many variable features. The leaves are compound and leathery. It has 3 pairs leaflets plus one at the tip, each narrowly ovate from .5 to 2 inches (1 cm to 6 cm) tip sharp, edge toothed, on a short stalk which is winged by the leafy stipules. Flowers are of fragrant white-pale yellow, and are usually 3 to 20 in dense heads, each stalked, the sepals long, narrow and hairy, soon fall, and have 5 petals about 2 cm long, tip rounded to square, with many stamens. The fruits are green at first, but later ripen to orange-red. They are about 1 inch (2 cm) long, fleshy and edible with seed within. It has been described as a "big prickly 'dog rose.'”
Geographical distribution
Rosa abyssinica is mainly found in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen and to a lesser extent Saudi Arabia, Somalia and the Sudan. It is common in the Ethiopian highlands and the mountains of Yemen across the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, a distribution paralleled by Primula verticillata and a few other plants. It commonly forms thickets in upland dry evergreen forests, margins, clearings, upland bushland, rocky places, and riparian formations.
Uses
Food (fruit and flower), medicinal (fruit), garden, ornamental.
Rosa abyssinica has sometimes been cultivated as a "living fence” surrounding home gardens in rural villages.
The fruit (hips) of Rosa abyssinica is eaten, mostly by children, and is believed to alleviate fatigue or tension. Birds eat the fruit as do baboons (baboons also consume the flowers). Medicinally, the fruit are eaten in as a remedy for worms (hook, tape and round). The crushed leaves have been used in remedies for hepatitis.
Common and Local Names
Ethiopian rose, Wild Ethiopian rose, African rose, Abyssinian rose (English), Kega (Ethiopian - Amharic), Ward (Yemeni - Arabic), Qaqawwii (Oromo), Dayero (Somali)

In a tradition of the Moriori people of the Chatham Islands, Rohe is the wife of the demi-god Māui. Beautiful Rohe was a sister of the sun, and her face shone. A quarrel arose after Rohe remarked that Māui's face was ugly. Māui then decided that they should change faces.
Afterwards Māui used magic to kill Rohe, but her spirit returned and destroyed Māui. Thus were black magic and death introduced into the world. After her death, Rohe ruled as the goddess of the pō (spirit world), where she gathered in the spirits of the dead. Evil influences were attributed to her.
Cook Islands
In Mangaia, the name Ro'e appears in Te Aka-ia-Ro'e (the root of all existence) which, according to Tregear, is "a spirit in the form of a thick stem tapering to a point, and is situated at the bottom of the Universe, sustaining the Cosmos".
Māori
The Māori knew little of Rohe. Tregear records the one myth associated with her, in which she is the wife of Māui. She was beautiful as he was ugly, and she refused his request to exchange faces. Māui, however, recited an incantation, and their faces were switched. In anger Rohe left him, and refused to live any longer in the world of light. She went to the underworld, and became a goddess of the pō (night or spirit world). Rohe is said sometimes to beat the spirits of deceased as they pass through her realm. Her home is in that division of the night world called Te Uranga-o-te-rā. Māui and Rohe had a son named Rangihore, the god of rocks and stones.
Tahiti
In Tahiti, the 'Father of Famine' is called Rohe-upo'o-nui (Large-headed Rohe).

Willem Doudijns (1630–1697), was a Dutch Golden Age painter and engraver.
Biography
According to the RKD he learned to draw from Alexander le Petit, and he spent 12 years in Italy. He returned home in 1661, where he collaborated with Jan de Bisschop on engravings. Both he and Bisschop were founding members of the Confrerie Pictura and Doudijns painted a large ceiling painting for the meeting hall that has not survived. His pupil Mattheus Terwesten made a sketch of this Allegory of the artists leaving the Hague Guild of St. Luke which is now in the Rijksmuseum print cabinet.
According to Houbraken he was the son of a mayor, and in Rome he joined the Bentvueghels with the nickname Diomedes. On his return became the head of the Confrerie Pictura. He was known for his wall and ceiling paintings, most notably the Judgment of Solomon in the Vierschaar, or courtroom, of the Hague city hall.
His pupils were Erasmus Arondeus, Frans Beeldemaker, Gijsbert de Bije, Bartholomeus van Burgindis, Arnoldus Gouda, Nicolaes Hooft, Pieter van der Hulst, Daniël Jacobsz., Lowys Paen, Nicolaes van Ravesteyn, Pieter van Reenen, Pieter Jansz van Ruyven, Augustinus Terwesten, Mattheus Terwesten, Michiel van der Valck, Daniël Walewijns, Domenicus van Wijnen, and Willem Wissing.

Howdy! is the seventh album by Scottish rock band Teenage Fanclub, released on 23 October 2000 through Columbia Records. With the addition of keyboardist Finlay MacDonald, the band wrote new material, eventually debuting some of it live in early 1999. Following this, they recorded their next album at Rockfield Studios in Wales, as well as Astoria in London, between August 1999 and March 2000. Shortly afterwards, drummer Paul Quinn left the band and was replaced by Francis MacDonald. Howdy! is an Americana and power pop album, recalling the work of the Hollies.
Howdy! received generally favourable from critics, with many praising the songwriting. The album reached number eight in Scotland and number 33 in the United Kingdom, where "I Need Direction" peaked at number 48. After signing to Columbia Records, Teenage Fanclub played a variety of festivals in Spain, Japan and the United Kingdom, leading up to the release of the album's lead single, "I Need Direction", in October 2000. That same month, the band toured the UK with support from Suckle. "Dumb Dumb Dumb" was released as the album's second single, coinciding with a tour of mainland Europe and a stint in the United States. Howdy! saw release in that territory in early 2002.
Background and recording
Teenage Fanclub released their sixth studio album Songs from Northern Britain through Creation Records in 1997, peaking at number three in the UK Albums Chart. All three of its singles – "Ain't That Enough", "I Don't Want Control of You" and "Start Again" – appeared on the UK Singles Chart, with "Ain't That Enough" peaking the highest at number 17. By the end of the year, former BMX Bandits keyboardist Finlay MacDonald formally joined Teenage Fanclub, having spent the previous six months on tour with them. Bassist Gerard Love said the band were in the planning stage for their next album; he said they wanted to record it across various studios in separate batches, in lieu of recording all of the songs in one location.
In February 1999, the band revealed they were in the process of writing new material. They debuted several new songs at the Bowlie Weekender festival the following month. Howdy! was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales between August 1999 and March 2000, with extra overdubs being done at the Astoria, a London-based studio in a boat owned by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd in February 2000. The band produced the sessions, while Nick Brine served as their engineer; they were assisted by engineers Lee Butler and Damon Iddens. They would record a few songs at a time, return home to Glashow to rehearse, and repeat the process. The recordings were mixed at Rockfield, before being edited by Steve Falone and mastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound in New York City.
Composition
Howdy! is an Americana and power pop album that was compared to the work of the Hollies. Neumu writer Ryan DeGama said it showcased the "well-polished guitar jangle and three-part harmonies" which were hallmarks of the band's sound". Ben Sisario of Rolling Stone wrote that the album's most prevalent theme was "an earnest quest to find love and a place to call one's own". Alongside the band, extra musicians contributed to the recordings: Megan Childs with violin on "Accidental Life"; Mick Cooke with trumpet on "Near You" and "The Town and the City", tuba on "Near You" and piccolo trumpet on "The Town and the City"; Sharon Fitzgerald with French horn on "Near You"; and Brine with backing vocals on "Dumb Dumb Dumb".
Howdy opens with "I Need Direction", which recalls the work of the Jasmine Minks. In the country-enhanced "Accidental Life", Blake consoles a woman who believes her Guardian angels had left her. Both it and "Near You" are soft-psych tracks, the latter being reminiscent of the work of Matthew Sweet. "Happiness" is centred around Hammond organ and a harmonica; "The Town and the City" incorporates bells, horns and keyboards. Steve Lichtenstein of PopMatters said "Dumb Dumb Dumb", which featured Turtles-esque backing vocals, offered a "rougher, more jagged exterior to the otherwise blinding sheen" when compared to the rest of the tracks, bringing to mind the work of John Mayer and Pete Yorn. With "The Sun Shines from You", which had a guitar riff reminiscent of the one heard in "Flame" (1999) by Sebadoh, McGinley compares the enjoyment of the weather to a relationship. "Straight & Narrow", which recalls "What Am I Doing Hangin' 'Round?" (1967) by the Monkees, tackles the topic of addiction. "Cul De Sac" evokes the songs on Bambu, an unfinished album by Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, as well as that band's own Pet Sounds (1966) album. In contrast to the other songs on the album, "My Uptight Life" sees McGinley during the verse sections and Blake during the chorus portions, returning to McGinley for its coda. The album concludes with the acoustic folk of "If I Never See You Again".
Release
On 28 March 2000, drummer Paul Quinn left the band, with their manager Chris Banks saying the decision was to focus on his family. Alongside this, Banks was unsure of where the band would go following the shutdown of Creation Records, explaining that their future was down to Sony Music, who owned Creation. Blake said Creation founder Alan McGee said he would try to get the band to sign with Sony; the company were forced to release the album or pay them for the studio album, ultimately going with the former option. On 10 May 2000, Banks announced that Francis MacDonald, formerly of BMX Bandits, would serve as Quinn's replacement. That same month, Blake took a break from the band to go on tour with Gorky's Zygotic Mynci as their guitarist. On 11 July 2000, the band announced they had signed to Sony imprint Columbia Records and that their forthcoming album would see release later in the year. Guitarist Raymond McGinley said they had received interest from other labels, but Columbia head Blair McDonald was "more interested in talking about the detail of the thing than going, ‘We'll sell X-amount of records.
In July and August 2000, the band performed at Santi Rock festival in Spain, Summer Sonic Festival in Japan and headlined one of the stages at the Glasgow Green Festival in the City. On 3 August 2000, Howdy! was announced for release in three months' time and its track listing was posted online. After initially being planned for release in early October 2000, "I Need Direction" was released as the lead single from Howdy! on 16 October 2000. The CD version featured "I Lied" and a cover of "Here Comes Your Man" (1989) by Pixies, while the seven-inch vinyl record edition included "On This Good Night". Howdy! was released on 23 October 2000 through Columbia Records. Following this, the band went on a tour of the UK in October and November 2000, with support from Suckle, ending with two shows at the London Astoria. The band closed out the year with an acoustic charity show later in November 2000 and a performance at Hogmanay in Glasgow on New Year's Eve.
In February and March 2001, Teenage Fanclub played a one-off show in Glasgow and two dates in Greece. "Dumb Dumb Dumb" was released as the second single from the album on 16 April 2001. The CD version featured "Thaw Me" and "One Thousand Lights", while the seven-inch vinyl edition included an alternative version of "Straight & Narrow". It coincided with a tour of mainland Europe, as well as a three-night residency at Camden Underworld in London. In June 2001, the band performed at Fleadh festival in London and the One in Four festival in Glasgow, followed by a tour of the United States in July 2001. Though Howdy! was planned for release in the US in early 2001; Blake said Sony did not view the band as a priority, resulting in zero distribution in the US. By the end of the year, the album was picked up by independent label Thirsty Ear Recordings, who planned to release it in November 2001, until it was delayed till 22 January 2002.
Howdy! was included in Original Album Classics (2012), a box set that also included the band's four previous studio albums. "I Need Direction", "Dumb Dumb Dumb" and "My Uptight Life" were included on the band's second compilation album Four A Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds – A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub (2003). In 2018, Howdy! was re-pressed on vinyl; coinciding with this, the band embarked on multi-night residencies where they dedicated a particular night to specific eras of their back catalogue.
Reception
Howdy! was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 74, based on 11 reviews.
AllMusic reviewer Andy Kellman said the majority of the tracks were "light-hearted and cheery", adding that its biggest draws were the "top-drawer craft, lovely three-part harmonies, delicately strummed guitars, and flawless arrangements". In a review for Playlouder, journalist Everett True echoed a similar sentiment, saying that there was "much to love about 'Howdy!' - its windswept harmonies, its jangling guitars and consummate grasp of pop history, for three". NME writer Jim Wirth said the album "demonstrates that Teenage Fanclub have attained such an imperious mastery of their one musical trick – Beach Boys, Big Star, Beatles, Bacharach, Byrds, Badfinger and Band imitated, assimilated and expanded – that you can't even be bothered to get annoyed with them anymore". Emma Morgan of Select said the band's distillation of their influences "makes the difference between mere imitation and true immortalisation". Sisario wrote that the album was "typically sunny Fanclub, yet more nuanced and colorful" than their past work.
JP of Billboard noted that there was "nothing harsh or grungy from the songwriting style" of the band, "[o]n the contrary, it's pure cotton candy for the ears, and it sounds sublime". The Day writer Thor Christensen expanded on this, adding that it showcased a band "blossoming as tunesmiths". Pitchfork Sam Sodomsky referred to it as "an album of quiet triumphs", highlighting "Dumb Dumb Dumb" and "Cul De Sac". DeGama's minor criticism was directed to the "almost pathological insistence here on consistency of guitar tone", as well as the lack of tempo variation. Nude as the News co-founder Troy Carpenter said it unfavourably retreads "territory the group mapped thoroughly" on Songs from Northern Britain and its predecessor Grand Prix (1995). Ed Masley of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was dismissive of the album, saying that "people aren't as likely to go for their whole Byrds-by-way-of-Big-Star thing in 2002". Ox-Fanzine writer Thomas Kerpen said it was "at best average", making him yawn by the third track.
Howdy! charted at number eight in Scotland and number 33 in the UK; "I Need Direction" peaked at number 48 in the UK.

CABINN Hotels is a Danish low-cost hotel chain with eight hotels in the five largest cities in Denmark: four in Copenhagen, one in Aarhus, one in Odense, one in Aalborg and one in Esbjerg. CABINN Hotels is owned by the entrepreneur Niels Fennet.
History
CABINN Hotels was founded in 1990 by Niels Fennet, who was inspired by the practical cabins he and his family stayed in on a tour to Norway. He found that the cabin contained everything needed for a stay, and that its functionality made it possible to have it all in a small space. This concept he transferred to the hotel business.
Rooms
CABINN Hotels have four room categories to accommodate price levels. Economy is the cheapest and smallest room; Standard is the most common room and a little bigger. The two last categories, Commodore and Captains are the most expensive.
Hotels
CABINN Express
CABINN Express is the first hotel to be built in the CABINN chain in 1990 in Copenhagen. CABINN Express is the smallest of all the CABINNs with 86 rooms and 260 beds. It is located at Danasvej 32 in Frederiksberg close to the city centre and Forum Metro station.
CABINN Scandinavia
In 1992 Niels Fennet expanded with CABINN Scandinavia, bigger than CABINN Express with 201 rooms and 617 beds. It is located around the corner from the first hotel on Vodroffsvej 55 in Frederiksberg, close to The Lakes.
CABINN Esbjerg
CABINN Esbjerg is from 1994 and was the first hotel outside Copenhagen. The hotel has been expanded several times, most recently in 2007, and now has a capacity of 320 beds in 136 rooms. It is located close to the city's pedestrianized principal shopping street and the main railway station at Skolegade 14. Another 73-room expansion has been announced.
CABINN Aarhus
CABINN Aarhus is from 2001 and is located at Kannikegade 14, close to the square Store Torv, Aarhus Theatre and Aarhus Cathedral. The hotel has 192 rooms and 486 beds, and the breakfast buffet is on the top floor. There are six different room options to choose from. Commodore, Captain, Standard, Economy, Standard Family, and the luxurious Penthouse. The breakfast buffet consists of cold cuts, cheese, pastries, bread, granola, cereal, yogurt, tea, coffee, juices, and the occasional DIY waffle. CABINN has commissioned a new 400 room hotel which will be designed by C. F. Møller Architects.
CABINN City
CABINN City opened in 2004 as the fifth hotel in the chain. It is located at Mitchellsgade 14, behind Tivoli Gardens and close to Copenhagen Central Station. The building was designed by Hvidt & Mølgaard and is located next to the historical Copenhagen Police Headquarters which were completed in 1920 to design by Hack Kampmann. The hotel has 352 rooms and 1020 beds.
CABINN Odense
In 2007, CABINN continued its national expansion with the opening of its hotel in Odense on the island of Funen. The hotel is located at Østre Stationsvej 7-9, next to Odense station and H.C. Andersen museum.
CABINN Metro
CABINN Metro was realised in 2009, when the seventh Cabinn opened in Ørestad, Cabinn Metro. The architect Daniel Libeskind designed the hotel which has resulted in a very unusual building with a complex facade and raw walls on the inside. The hotel is one of the biggest in Scandinavia with 710 rooms and 1760 beds. The hotel is close to the Ørestad Station and Copenhagen Airport Kastrup Lufthavn on Arne Jacobsens Allé 2.
CABINN Aalborg
Aalborg is the fourth-biggest city in Denmark and CABINN Aalborg opened there in 2010. It has 239 rooms and 630 beds.
The environment
CABINN strives to limit the release of CO2 by using environmentally friendly cleaning companies, sorting at source of trash, non-smoking hotel etc. In the year 2010 CABINN Metro received the Green key from the municipal for their environmental policy.

Nils Uhlin Hansen (6 May 1919 – 11 January 1945) was a Norwegian long jumper and resistance member during World War II. He had a successful athletics career before the war; setting a Nordic long jump record which was not surpassed for 20 years (14 years after his death). He was killed less than four months before the end of the war, as he was surprised by Wehrmacht forces following a sabotage mission.
Pre-war life
He was born in Trondheim, the son of Haakon Hansen and Swedish citizen Agnes Collin. Representing sports club SK Freidig, he had a successful career in the long jump; only nineteen years old he won the Norwegian championships. Jumping 7.39 metres, he was 25 centimetres ahead of runner-up Kaare Strøm. In 1939, Hansen won a silver medal behind Kaare Strøm. On 11 September 1939, Hansen established a new Norwegian record. Jumping 7.54 metres at Bislett stadion, he broke the two-year-old record of Otto Berg with two centimetres. This was also a Nordic record.
His sporting career was cut short by World War II. As Norway was invaded by Germany in 1940, regular sports events and championships were discontinued. The 1940 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan were also cancelled.
Resistance work
Hansen joined the Norwegian resistance movement in 1940. He had to flee the country, arriving in Sweden on 8 November 1941. He then escaped to England in 1942, where he became enrolled in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (), a part of the British Special Operations Executive. He conducted several sabotage missions in Norway, including one against the rail road Røros Line in January 1945. Saboteurs were active in Central Norway in late 1944 and early 1945, with sabotages against the Nordland Line, the Dovre Line and the Rauma Line in addition to the Røros Line. This was of high strategic importance, as German forces were retreating from Northern Norway, using the rail roads for troop transport. Although the war was going against Germany at the time, there were rumours that they would not leave Norway without an Allied invasion, thus, pockets of Norwegian resistance forces were prepared for warfare.
On 10 January 1945, German forces reacted, and began searching for militants under the codename Aktion Hengst. They had only vague knowledge on the whereabouts of Norwegian militants, but on 11 January they found a lone skier in Singsås. They questioned him, and then released him, only to follow his tracks. The tracks led the German task force to a cabin at Forsetvollan in Budal. Nils Uhlin Hansen was staying in the cabin at the time, and when shooting ensued, Hansen was killed. Two days after his death Norwegian saboteurs carried out Operation Woodlark, killing 70–80 troops by destroying the bridge over the Jørstadelva, west of Jørstad.
Awards and legacy
Uhlin Hansen was awarded the Norwegian War Medal, the Defence Medal 1940–1945 and then the Norwegian War Medal with Star. A road in Trondheim has been named for him.
His national long jump record stood until 1959, when it was broken by Roar Berthelsen with eleven centimetres.

The sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser) are a genus of birds in the family Ploceidae (weavers), but some taxonomic authorities place them in the family Passeridae (Old World sparrows).
Taxonomy and systematics
The genus Plocepasser contains the following species:
Phylogeny
Based on recent DNA-analysis (which only included P. mahali), the genus Plocepasser belongs to the group of sparrow weavers (subfamily Plocepasserinae), and is most related to the clade that consists of Philetairus socius and the genus Pseudonigrita. This clade is sister to the most basic genus of the subfamily, Sporopipes. Provided that genera are correct clades, the following tree expresses current insights.

DeWayne Lee Harris (born 1963), also known as The Seattle Jungle Killer or Chilly Willy, but most widely known as The Seattle Shoelace Slasher is an American serial killer who killed three women in Seattle between 1997 and 1998, dumping their bodies near freeways. While jailed for a robbery charge, he confessed to the murders and was later sentenced to 94 years imprisonment.
Murders
The first victim was 42-year-old Denise Marie Harris (no relation), whom DeWayne met on First Avenue in downtown Seattle. Along with an unnamed accomplice, they strangled Denise with a belt, removing some of her clothing and then binding her hands and ankles with shoelaces. He also stuffed a brassiere in her mouth. Harris' body was then dumped in the "Jungle", an underdeveloped plot of land under the I-5 and I-90 freeways. Denise's body was found on September 12 by a transient man wandering the area.
Not long after, Harris picked up 33-year-old Antoinette Jones. He accused her of stealing drugs from him, and proceeded to strangle her with a leather belt. Like Denise, he then bound her wrists and ankles with shoelaces, wrapping an additional shoelace around her neck. Her body was dumped in the Jungle, where her skeletal remains were found on February 1, 1998, about half a mile from where Harris was found. Forensic tests proved that she had been there for at least three months.
The last victim was 25-year-old Olivia Smith, whose date of death is uncertain. After picking her up from an apartment building at Airport Way South, Harris and Smith engaged in a violent argument about exchanging drugs for sex, after which DeWayne took out a knife and stabbed her numerous times and slashed her throat. He left the body on the scene, where it was discovered on the stairwell on January 10, 1998.
Arrest, trial and imprisonment
Some time after the murders, Harris was jailed for an unrelated robbery charge. While in jail, around April 1998 he phoned a detective and told him that he could lead him to the murderer. He later was confronted and confessed to murders of three prostitutes, claiming that it was his 'hobby' and he got a thrill out of doing it. Shortly after his confession, he was charged with all three murders, and was detained at the King County jail on $5 million bail.
At his trial, Harris, strapped in a restraining chair because of his unruly behavior, was described as a cunning and manipulative predator who preyed on vulnerable women. According to his attorney, John Hicks, his only reason for confessing was that he "wanted Seattle to recognize there was a serial killer." He was found guilty of all charges in December 1998, and finally sentenced to 94 years imprisonment the next month. Upon hearing the verdict, he dropped his head backwards and started to laugh, much to the courtroom's shock. For his final words before the court, Harris told the King County Superior Court Judge Marsha Pechman that there were more like him out there, and that nobody was safe, even in their own homes and apartments. He also added that there was no true justice, as he was still living and breathing, and had certain privileges in prison. He also expressed hopes for the victims' families' forgiveness. Upon being escorted out of the room, he hurled insults at the jury which convicted him. Initially at the Clallam Bay Corrections Center, DeWayne Lee Harris is currently serving his sentence at the Stafford Creek Corrections Center (SCCC).
In an interview, Harris claimed to have committed 32 other murders.
Popular culture
Dewayne Lee Harris murders and related investigation were adapted in the first episode of "Real Detective", a Canadian produced docudrama.
Harris was also featured in season one, episode two of "American Detective", a documentary series appearing on Discovery+.
Harris is interviewed on the "Unforbidden Truth" podcast dated January 26, 2021.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4}}
The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4, also known as the cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 4 (CHRM4), is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the CHRM4 gene.
Function
M4 muscarinic receptors are coupled to Gi/o heterotrimeric proteins.
They function as inhibitory autoreceptors for acetylcholine. Activation of M4 receptors inhibits acetylcholine release in the striatum. The M2 subtype of acetylcholine receptor functions similarly as an inhibitory autoreceptor to acetylcholine release, albeit functioning actively primarily in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors possess a regulatory effect on dopaminergic neurotransmission. Activation of M4 receptors in the striatum inhibit D1-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. M4 receptor-deficient mice exhibit increased locomotor simulation in response to D1 agonists, amphetamine and cocaine. Neurotransmission in the striatum influences extrapyramidal motor control, thus alterations in M4 activity may contribute to conditions such as Parkinson's disease.

Phototype can refer to a metal printing block, sometimes prepared using photogravure to reproduce a photograph in printing. The block may be a halftone image.
Phototype can also refer to type set using a phototypesetting process to prepare pages for photo lithography. This process replaced hot metal typesetting. It was commonly used in the late nineteenth century (for book illustration), and through the 1970s and 1980s, and was in turn rapidly rendered obsolete by modern systems which employ a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image which is then photoset.
Skin phototype depends on the amount of melanin pigment in the skin. It is assessed on a scale from 1 to 6. See Fitzpatrick scale for more details.

Zylyftar Poda, born Iljaz Poda, (1768-1835) was an Albanian leader, who led several revolts against the Ottoman Empire.
Life
Zylyftar Poda was born in 1768 in Podë, a village in the region of Kolonjë, south Albania. He became known during his service for Ali Pasha of Ioannina, a semi-independent ruler in Epirus. After Ali Pasha' death and the eventual destruction of his pashalik, Poda started to take part in revolts against the Ottoman Empire. He took part in a meeting of Albanian leaders in 1828 in Berat. There Poda was one of the three main participants, the others being Ismail Bey Qemali and Shahin bej Delvina. The meeting concluded with requests for Albanian officials in the areas with Albanian population and the removal of Reşid Mehmed Pasha, a local official with considerable power in parts of Epirus, from his official posts in Delvina, Vlora and Janina. In 1831 Poda led a peasant revolt in the region of Kolonjë and Leskovik, coordinating with other Albanian leaders such as the Bushati family. In 1835 Poda was executed by Ottoman authorities due to his activities for more rights for Albanians.
Legacy
Zylyftar Poda is considered one of the most important Albanian leaders of early 1800s, and many folk songs have been dedicated to him.

A falsism is a claim that is clearly and self-evidently wrong. A falsism is usually used merely as a reminder or as a rhetorical or literary device. An example is "pigs can fly". It is the opposite of a truism. A falsism is similar to, though not the same as, a fallacy.

Sommerhausen is a municipality and market town in the district of Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany.
History
Sommerhausen has been an important municipality on the Main since the Middle Ages. It did not belong to the prince-bishop of Würzburg; The inhabitants acknowledged the Reformation, so that Sommerhausen is now a Protestant enclave in the predominantly Catholic Mainfranken. As part of the rule mediated by Bavaria, Speckfeld, the heirs of the Counts of Limpurg (Count Pückler and Rechtern), Sommerhausen belonged to the Frankish Reichskreis from 1500 onwards. In 1810, the district of Würzburg, with which it fell back to Bavaria in 1814, came to settle in the area. In the course of the administrative reforms in Bavaria, the municipal council of 1818 created the present municipality.
The place, embedded in the Valley of the Main among vineyards, has been the hanger for Frankish romanticism for decades. The medieval city wall has been preserved. All buildings in the town center in the narrow, winding streets look back on several hundred years of history. The town hall dates from the 16th century.

Part 3 Random Thoughts or Pt.3 Random Thoughts is a studio album by Australian hip hop artists, Koolism, which was released on 10 May 2004 by Invada Records via Inertia Distribution.
It features guest appearances from Rodney P on "Warm and Easy", N'fa (credited as Nfamas) and BVA on "Stage Presence", BVA & Raph as Mnemonic Ascent for "On Deck". Three tracks on the album, "Koolism Is", "Adrenalin" and "The Grand Opening", received extensive airplay on Triple J.
At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 Koolism won Best Urban Release for the album – the first artist to take the new category.
Reception
Part 3 Random Thoughts was described by Sophiska of In the Mix,"we got Hau on deck, we've also got Captain Danielsan Ichiban and a great fucking album to boot. summarised her review, "All in all a refreshingly different approach to Aussie Hip Hop that people who appreciate good music regardless of their genre will really get into. Like the Hoods and Hyjack, Bonez & Torcha they are experimenting musically and pushing some boundaries which in turn is making our home grown scene healthier and stronger. Beg, Steal or Borrow this album."
Cyclic Defrosts Matt Levinson observed, "The production and rhymes are killer, but the best thing about Part 3 is just how much fun it is. It sounds like a band messing around and having fun in the studio, and the fact that it's come through on the record is just as exciting as the wildly original music and lyrics.""
Karl of Resident Advisor felt "MC Hau shows off his versatility as an MC combining feel good lyricism, party style rhymes with in your face diss raps and socially conscious messages while Danielsan compliments him with catchy rhythms, funky basslines, b-boy style breaks and perfectly timed scratching. Most importantly is being able to see them do it live and rock a show getting people to shake arses, jump up and raise their hands in the air."

The Undersecretary of State, in the Italian legal system, is a member of the government with the function of assisting the minister and exercising the tasks that have been delegated to him. It falls into the second category and 17th order of the Italian order of precedence.
History
The figure of the undersecretary of state was established in the Kingdom of Italy with the law of February 12, 1888, n. 5195 ("Crispina reform"), replacing the General Secretary. Although it is not expressly provided for by the Republican Constitution of 1948, the office has been conferred in all republican governments, up to, in recent years, a real proliferation of undersecretaries which has given rise to many criticisms.
It is governed by art.10 of the law of 23 August 1988, n. 400 (Discipline of Government activity and order of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers).
Appointment
The undersecretaries of state are appointed by decree of the President of Italy, on the proposal of the President of the Council of Ministers, in consultation with the minister whom the undersecretary is called to assist, after consulting the Council of Ministers. Before taking up their duties, they take an oath in the hands of the President of the Council of Ministers.
Without prejudice to the political responsibility and political powers of the ministers, no more than ten undersecretaries can be assigned the title of Deputy Minister, if they are conferred powers relating to areas or projects within the competence of one or more departmental structures or more general directorates. In this case the delegation, conferred by the competent minister, is approved by the Council of Ministers, on the proposal of the President of the council.
The law 24 December 2007, n. 244 (financial law for 2008) provides in art. 1, paragraph 376 that, starting from the XVI Legislature, the total number of government members, including ministers without portfolios, deputy ministers and undersecretaries of state, cannot exceed 65. Since this is a standard of ordinary and non-constitutional law, it should be kept in mind that it can always be modified with another law or act having the force of law.
The undersecretaries of state can be chosen among the members of Parliament, as is usually the case, but also considering candidates that are not Parliament members. After the appointment they can stay members of a chamber (or can be elected to be a part of it), since no incompatibility is foreseen in this regard.
Functions
The undersecretaries of state assist a minister or the Prime Minister and exercise the tasks delegated to them by ministerial decree (or by the Prime Minister) published in the Official Gazette. The undersecretaries of state can intervene, as representatives of the Government, at the sessions of the Parliamentary Chambers and Commissions, support the discussion in accordance with the directives of the minister and answer questions and interpellations.
The deputy ministers may be invited by the President of the Council of Ministers, in agreement with the competent Minister, to participate in the sessions of the Council of Ministers, without the right to vote, to report on topics and issues pertaining to the matter delegated to them. The undersecretaries do not participate in the meetings of the Council of Ministers, except for one of the undersecretaries to the Presidency of the Council who is attributed in the decree of appointment the functions of Secretary of the Council of Ministers who, according to art. 4 of the law n. 400/1988, takes care of the minutes and the conservation of the register of resolutions.

Pheidole jonas is a species of ant in the subfamily Myrmicinae.
Habitat and distribution
Pheidole jonas is known only from the Comoros Islands and Mayotte. It was collected mostly from rainforest leaf litter, but also from rotten logs, under moss, and above ground in rainforest and montane rainforest in elevations between 20 and 1235 m. The populations on Anjouan, Grand Comore, and Mayotte islands are morphologically distinct, but share enough characteristics with each other and with the original type material to be identified as a single species, until further research proves otherwise.
Description
The specimens from Anjouan are all orange in color, like the types, whereas those from the other two islands are brown. The Grand Comore and Mayotte populations can be distinguished further by minor allometric differences in the head, pronotum and postpetiole. The majors from Grand Comore tend to have a slightly wider head and a wider postpetiole than those from Mayotte. P. jonas is probably closely related to P. vulcan and P. loki. The minor workers of P. jonas can be separated from those of P. vulcan by slightly longer mandibles, scapes, and postpetiole, while the majors have a lower promesonotal process with a conspicuously concave transverse groove in profile view. Standing hairs are significantly less abundant and less flexuous in both worker castes than in those of P. vulcan. The minor workers of P. loki (majors are unknown) can be easily distinguished from the two other species, as the scapes are on average longer and the sculpture on dorsal head and mesosoma is largely reduced, whereas the heads and mesosomas of P. jonas and P. vulcan possess comparatively strong punctures.

The gens Otacilia, originally Octacilia, was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. The gens first rose to prominence during the First Punic War, but afterwards lapsed into obscurity. The first of the family to obtain the consulship was Manius Otacilius Crassus, in 263 BC.
Origin
The nomen Otacilius may be derived from the praenomen Octavius. Octacilius is the correct orthography, but Otacilius is the form most common in later sources. The earliest known member of the family was a native of Maleventum, an ancient city of Campania, which according to Pliny was inhabited by the Hirpini.<ref name="Festus Numerius">Festus, s. v. Numerius, pp. 170, 173, ed. Müller.</ref>
Praenomina
The early Otacilii favored the praenomina Manius, Titus, and Gaius. The earliest known Otacilius bore the praenomen Numerius, which passed through his daughter to the Fabii. In later times, Gnaeus and Lucius are found.
Branches and cognomina

The Sacred Heart of Jesus Cathedral () is the cathedral belonging to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Makassar in the city of Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi, Indonesia.
In 1525 the city of Makassar was visited by three Portuguese missionary priests, Antonio dos Reis, Cosmas de Annunciacio and Bernardino de Marvao, accompanied by a friar. The first priest to be assigned to Makassar was the father Vicente Viegas who came from Malacca. After this implementation, several kings and nobles of Sulawesi were baptized in the Catholic Church.
The King of Gowa, Sultan Alauddin (1591–1638) granted freedom of worship to Catholics in 1633. This decision was confirmed by his successors.
The church was built in 1898 and finished in 1900. It was then renovated and expanded in 1939, reached its present form in 1941.
Two suicide bombers attacked the cathedral on 28 March 2021. Twenty people were injured in the attack, and both of the bombers were killed.

Singles 1965–1967 is a box set compilation of singles by The Rolling Stones spanning the years 1965–1967. The second in a series of repackages by ABKCO Records, who licence The Rolling Stones' 1963–1970 recorded works, Singles 1965–1967 is the second of three successive volumes to commemorate their non-LP releases during this era.
While the set features faithful replicas of all individual single covers (even the CDs are reproduced in black), the set—and the two others in the series—came under some criticism as to their necessity, especially as 1989's Singles Collection: The London Years already covered this material to "Satisfaction".

Chinese Taipei competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. "Chinese Taipei" is the designated name used by Taiwan to participate in some international organizations and almost all sporting events, including the Olympic Games. Neither the common name "Taiwan" nor the official name "Republic of China" would be used due primarily to opposition from the People's Republic of China. This was also the region's ninth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics.
The Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee sent a team of 57 athletes, 26 men and 31 women, to compete in 18 sports at the Games. For only the third time in Olympic history, Chinese Taipei roster featured more female athletes than males. Among the sporting events represented by the nation's athletes, Chinese Taipei made its Olympic debut in equestrian jumping and golf (new to the 2016 Games), as well as its return to gymnastics, boxing, and wrestling after more than fifteen years.
World-ranked tennis star Lu Yen-hsun, table tennis players Huang I-hua and London 2012 fourth-place finalist Chuang Chih-yuan, and trap shooter Lin Yi-chun highlighted the list of athletes to make the Chinese Taipei roster for their fourth Olympics. Apart from the veterans, twelve Taiwanese athletes previously competed in London, with weightlifter Hsu Shu-ching leading them as the only medalist to return for her second appearance in Rio de Janeiro. Other notable athletes from Chinese Taipei also featured world's top 30 golfers Candie Kung and Teresa Lu, and lone show jumper Isheau Wong, who eventually served as the nation's second female flag bearer in the opening ceremony (the first having done so in 2008).
Chinese Taipei left Rio de Janeiro with only three medals (one gold and two bronze), a slight improvement on the team's performance at the previous Games. Among the medalists were the women's archery team (led by Tan Ya-ting, who eventually finished among the top eight in the individual recurve), and weightlifters Kuo Hsing-chun (women's 58 kg) and Hsu, who upgraded her silver from London to a golden finish in the women's 53 kg category. For the first time in history, Chinese Taipei did not obtain any medals in taekwondo, since the sport was officially added to the Olympic program in 2000.

Herbert Tobias (14 December 1924 – 17 August 1982) was a German photographer who first became well known for his fashion photography during the 1950s. His portrait studies, his photographs of Russia during World War II and his homoerotic pictures of men are all of artistic value. He was one of the first well-known people in Germany to die from AIDS.
Life
Herbert Tobias was born in Dessau, the son of a gunmaker. He taught himself photography from the age of ten. His ambition was to become an actor, but the early death of his father in 1936 prevented
him. After some time as a surveyor in Höxter Tobias was called up to the Wehrmacht in 1942 and sent to the Russian Front, where he took his first significant photographs. Shortly before the end of the war he deserted and was captured by the Americans on the Western Front. He was released at the end of 1945.
After attending a stage school in Siegburg he obtained an engagement with the touring theatre company Niedersachsen-Bühne. In 1948, while staying in the area of Heidelberg he fell in love
with, and began a relationship with, a civilian employee of the American Forces of Occupation. In 1950 both men were denounced under § 175 of the German Criminal Code, and moved to Paris.
There Tobias met the famous German photographer Willy Maywald, for whom he worked as a retoucher and who gave him his first contacts in the world of fashion. In 1953 Tobias' first pictures appeared in Vogue. In the same year, after resisting arrest during a police raid on a gay establishment, he was thrown out of France and returned to Heidelberg. From October 1953 his fashion photographs began to appear in West German magazines and in November, out of over 18,000 entrants, he won first prize in a highly lucrative competition for the front-page photo of the Frankfurter Illustrierten Zeitung.
After moving to West Berlin he had his first solo exhibition, in November 1954, and was praised by the critic Friedrich Luft. Also in Berlin he discovered the singer Nico, later famous with The Velvet Underground, and launched her career as a photographic model.
Through publication of his work in many high-class magazines Herbert Tobias had become by 1956 an established figure in West German fashion. His contacts in the worlds of fashion and film led in the following years to many photo-portraits of the famous, including Hildegard Knef, Zarah Leander, Valeska Gert, Amanda Lear, Klaus Kinski, Tatjana Gsovsky, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and Andreas Baader.
However, from about 1960 Tobias found it increasingly difficult to deal with the discipline of the fashion world and his commissions fell off significantly. In 1966 he turned back to acting and took roles in theatre and film.
In 1969, after moving to Hamburg-Altona, he was only able to support himself with financial assistance from friends and from a few commissions for album covers from Deutsche Grammophon.
From 1972 his pictures started to appear in various gay magazines, particularly in .
In 1981 there were highly praised exhibitions of his work in Amsterdam and Berlin. This late recognition and the planning of a book of photos caused him to have his old negatives copied and to caption them.
He fell seriously ill in February 1982 and died on 17 August of the same year, one of the first high-profile victims of AIDS in Germany. He was buried in Altona Cemetery; in 2007 his grave was declared an Ehrengrab ("grave of honour") by the Hamburg Senate.
Tobias bequeathed his photographic estate to the Berlinische Galerie (Landesmuseum für Moderne Kunst, Fotografie und
Architektur), which gave his work a large retrospective from May to August 2008, with 200 exhibits, also displayed in 2009 in the Deichtorhallen in Hamburg.

Tau Alpha (τα) is a fraternity based in the College of Engineering at the University of the Philippines located in Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines. It was founded in 1932, one of the oldest fraternities in Asia.
Founding
In the early days of 1931, a group of undergraduates thought of forming a fraternity that would develop their leadership traits and bring about their social and civic responsibilities, and foster camaraderie and fraternalism in the pursuit of academic excellence and enhance their engineering professions. Dubbed as Mu Epsilon, which stood for Manila Engineers, the fraternity was organized in the old Padre Faura grounds of Manila. Later on, upon the unanimous decision of the group that the fraternity should not be limited to the engineering students of Manila, its membership opened to all the students of the college. Thus came the search for the name that would best fit the principles of the group, and would also best represent their aspirations and ideals. An appealing and inspirational name found was the Argonauts of Greek mythology.
The name Tau Alpha stands for The Argonauts. The fraternity originally had 50 members, matching the number of oars on the Argo, which was built by the first Greek engineer, Argos.
Tau Alpha was founded and officially recognized by the University on June 27, 1932, with Angel Francisco Gutierrez de Jesus as the first Grand High Alpha.
In the beginning, the principal factors in the selection of applicants were good moral character and scholastic standing. Later, two other qualities were added: leadership and spirit of camaraderie. All these qualities showed themselves in the first University student elections where Tau Alpha participated. All positions were won by the fraternity, including the first ever Engineering Student Council Chairmanship.
Sorority
Tau Alpha is affiliated with the Tau Lambda Alpha sorority which was founded in 2012.
Service
Service by Tau Alpha includes the Tau Alpha Student Loan Guarantee Fund, Medical Missions, film showings, tree planting, Youth Build Blitz for Habitat for Humanity and Bloodletting.
Tau Alpha also organizes the Argo Cup, one of the legs of the UP Barkada golf circuit. Tournament proceeds go to scholarships and other projects in the UP College of Engineering.

James Spaulding Plays the Legacy of Duke Ellington is an album by saxophonist James Spaulding featuring compositions by Duke Ellington which was recorded in 1976 and released on the Danish Storyville label.
Reception
The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow stated "Despite being a top altoist and flutist since at least the mid-'60s, when he played with Freddie Hubbard's band, James Spaulding did not get his recording debut as a leader until this 1976 LP. Spaulding, on various flutes, piccolo, soprano and alto, performs eight songs associated with Duke Ellington ... The most unusual aspect of this set is that Avery Brooks (who has a deep baritone that Ellington might have liked) sings four of the eight songs. A sincere tribute".

Woody Bay is a small bay on the south coast of the Isle of Wight, England. It lies along the coastline beneath the village of St. Lawrence. The bay faces south towards the English Channel, its shoreline is in length.
The bay has a rocky and exposed shoreline with areas of shingle and a storm beach formed from large pebbles. It is backed by cliffs composed of landslide debris from the Upper Greensand and Chalk. The bay is part of the Undercliff landslide complex, although is a largely stable area of the landslide zone despite recent minor movements.
The Isle of Wight Coastal Path runs along the coast behind the bay and onto Woody Point, where the bay can be best viewed from. A small track runs down from the coastal path on which the bay can be accessed.
During the winter of 2019/2020 a large rotational landslide took place in the cliff face in the central section of the bay. Further minor landslides took place in the winter of 2020/2021, driving further landslide debris onto the beach.
Immediately west of Woody Bay is the Sugarloaf, a geological formation formed from a block of tilted and slipped Upper Greensand Formation originally derived from the inland cliff. A footpath leads to the top of the Sugarloaf, with views along the Undercliff coast.
History
According to author Adrian Searle in his 2016 book 'Churchill's Last Wartime Secret: the 1943 German raid airbrushed from history' Woody Bay is the purported landing site of a covert commando raid by German forces during the Second world war with the aim of retrieving equipment and prisoners from the nearby site of RAF St Lawrence. The landings were then supposedly the subject of a cover up by the British Government. The credibility of the raid however has been challenged, and it is not widely accepted that it was a genuine event.

Kosciuszko's Garden is a small retreat garden built by Tadeusz Kosciuszko on the side of a cliff overlooking the Hudson River at West Point, New York. First constructed in 1778, it still offers visitors and cadets a place of quiet tranquility during the warmer months. The "General Edward L. Rowny Family Endowment" was established to further sustain perpetual care and maintenance of the Garden and to dedicate a plaque commemorating the occasion.
Dr. James Thacher described it in his diary, "Colonel Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a gentleman of distinction from Poland...amused himself while stationed on the point, in laying out a curious garden in a deep valley, abounding more in rocks than soil. I was gratified in viewing his curious water fountain with jets and cascades."

The Allegheny River Turnpike Bridge carries Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) over the Allegheny River. The structure features a pair of twin 2,350' cast-in-place concrete segmental bridges. This is the first of its type in Pennsylvania. It was constructed between 2007 and 2010 and is the second bridge to stand on this site. The original truss bridge was built between 1949 and 1951 by the engineering firm Modjeski & Masters; the crossing predates the Interstate System by several years.
The replacement bridge was designed by the engineering firm Figg and built by Walsh Construction. The purpose of the new structure was to increase the capacity of traffic from two lanes in each direction to three; this was done to eliminate a bottleneck at the exit with Pennsylvania Route 28, which branches off at the bridge approach on the Harmar side of the river.
The replacement eastbound bridge opened in November 2009. It carried both eastbound and westbound traffic across the Allegheny River until the project was finished one year later.
On Tuesday, July 13, 2010, just after 10 a.m., the old steel structure of the Allegheny River Bridge was imploded with controlled demolition explosives. Roadway traffic was stopped for approximately 15–20 minutes, and river traffic was stopped for 24 hours for cleanup of the debris from the bridge.

The 33D Invader (蜜桃成熟時３３Ｄ) is a 2011 Hong Kong science fiction sex comedy film directed by Cash Chin. The film stars Macy Wu (whose bust size is exactly 33D, thus the name) as a girl named Future who has to re-populate the human race after radiation attacks from the Xucker race have made 99% of men on Earth infertile in the year 2046. The film was released in Hong Kong on 6 October 2011 and was shown at Far East Film Festival in Udine. The film has received negative reviews.
Plot
A young woman named Future (Macy Wu) is sent from the year 2046 to the year 2011 in Hong Kong. Future was sent by the United Nations in order to get pregnant, so she can then extract the genes and repopulate the Earth, as 99% of males have become infertile in the future due to attacks from Planet Xucker. Two assassins from Xucker (Taka Kato and Ya-wen Hseh) are sent after her to stop her. The assassins can turn people into sex zombies. Some of her friends got turned into zombies and they were turned against her. Future meets three university students: Felix (Justin Cheung), Dan-san (Andrew Kwok) and Sing (Tsui Ho-cheong). The men are obsessed with female students next door: Chin-chin (Akiho Yoshizawa), Chen-chen (Monna Lam) and Sai-sai (Chen Chih-ying). The students agree to help Future find a mate at the university.
Production
The film has an international cast with Chinese actress Macy Wu as Future, Taiwanese male lead of Chen Chun-yan as the lead role of Long and two Japanese AV idols (Akiho Yoshizawa as Chin-chin and Akiho and Taka Kato as a Xucker male assassin. Despite the film title, it is not a 3D film.
Chinese model Macy Wu stated she took on the role of Future as she felt director Cash Chin "filmed women in a beautiful way". Wu reportedly beat model Mavis Pan to the role.
Style
The 33D Invader'''s director Cash Chin is known for creating Category III sexploitation films in Hong Kong such as Sex & Zen II (1996) and the sequels to the film Crazy Love. Derek Elley of Film Business Asia described the style of The 33D Invader'' as "a harmless, silly-arse Cantonese youth comedy with lots of nudity and a couple of gross-out visual gags". A review in Twitch Film described the first half of the film as "a typical eighties student sex comedy, "Porky's" style" and that the science fiction "girl-from-the-future plot only kicks in when the film reaches its halfway point."
Release
The film was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 6 October 2011. The film was screened at the 14th Udine Far East Festival in Italy in 2012. The film grossed a total of $302,387 in Hong Kong where it peaked at the fourth highest-grossing film in the region on its second week of release.
A Blu-ray Disc of the film was released in Region A by Kam & Ronson. The disc contains Cantonese and Mandarin languages and English subtitles.
Reception
Film Business Asia gave the film a rating of three out of ten, calling it a "Lame softcore sex comedy" and that the best thing about the film apart from the lead of Macy Wu was "the title". A review from Twitch Film opined that it was "a pretty terrible film" but stated that the character's (portrayed by Akiho Yoshizawa and Chen Chih Ying) "willingness...to disrobe at the slightest provocation, and occasionally even to cause provocation, makes the film a not all-together arduous experience."

Jan Jambon (born 26 April 1960 in Genk) is a Belgian politician of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) who has been serving as Minister-President of Flanders since 2019. He replaced Kris Peeters as a member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 2007. The N-VA was, at that time, partnered with the Christian-Democratic and Flemish party. In June 2010 and May 2014 he was re-elected on an N-VA list.
He became mayor of Brasschaat in 2013 after his party won the local elections in 2012. In November 2014, he was replaced as acting mayor by Koen Verberck (also N-VA), after joining the new Federal Government.
In October 2014 he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior and Security, charged with the direction of public buildings, in the Michel Government. Jambon remained in this position until the government fell in December 2018.
In 2019, he becomes the new Flemish minister-president of the Jambon government. He is also the mayor of the municipality of Brasschaat.
Engagement in the Flemish Movement
Jan Jambon began his political career with the Volksunie Youth (VUJO) in Limburg and the Volksunie. From 1985 to 1988 he was a member of the main board of the national Volksunie Youth and chief editor of the monthly magazine WIJ-Jongeren. He belonged to the "right wing" in the party. Their position on the placement of nuclear weapons was diametrically opposed to the official VU party position. Jambon left that party behind in 1988, when nothing came of the so-called Third Phase of state reform. The broadening operation led by Hugo Schiltz and Jaak Gabriëls also proved difficult for him to digest, as did the election of the 'left-wing' member of parliament Herman Lauwers, national chairman of the VVKSM Scouts from Brasschaat. As a result He left this party in 1988 after the broadening operation wanted by Hugo Schiltz and Jaak Gabriëls, and moved with Peter De Roover to the Vlaamse Volksbeweging (VVB).
In the mid-1990s, Jambon tried together with Peter De Roover to influence the political character of the annual IJzerbedevaart in Diksmuide. He founded, among others with Lieven Van Gerven, then chairman of the Davidsfonds, the IJzerbedevaart Forum. This forum died a quiet death in 1996 after the much more radical Werkgroep Radicalisering IJzerbedevaart, consisting of Voorpost, VNJ, NSV and others, then started the current IJzerwake in Steenstrate and Ypres.
In 1992, he co-authored the book Vlaanderen staat in Europa with Peter de Roover and became a member of the pro-independence think tank In de Warande.
From 1992 he was for many years chairman of the Overlegcentrum van Vlaamse Verenigingen and also a national board member of the Vlaamse Volksbeweging, where he was elected treasurer in October 1998 and subsequently became political and administrative secretary. Since 1991 he has been a board member of the Algemeen Nederlands Zangverbond (General Dutch Singing Association).
For several years he was chairman of the Overlegcentrum van Vlaamse Verenigingen (think tank of Flemish associations) and a member of the leadership of the Vlaamse Volksbeweging (Flemish People's Movement), a separatist movement demanding Flemish independence, of which he was elected treasurer in October 1998 before becoming administrative and political secretary.
Political career
On 18 February 2006 Jambon resigned from the Vlaamse Volksbeweging to work for the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in order to preparte the separtition of Belgium.
On 8 December 2005 Jambon founded a branch of the N-VA in the Antwerp town of Brasschaat. At the municipal elections on 8 October 2006, Jambon received 565 preferential votes and from January 2007 he was alderman for finance and local economy. In mid-March 2007, he stood as a candidate in Antwerp on the list of N-VA and CD&V for the federal parliamentary elections, where he obtained 9,099 preferential votes.
On 28 June 2007 he became a member of parliament in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, succeeding Kris Peeters on the CD&V/N-VA cartel list. After the vote on the split of the electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde on 7 November 2007 Jambon declared that the N-VA would not step into an orange-blue emergency cabinet if there was no prospect of state reform. In the elections of 13 June 2010 and of 25 May 2014, he was re-elected respectively as list leader and list duper of the Antwerp N-VA Chamber list. In the Chamber, he was N-VA group leader from 2008 to 2014.
Within the walls of the parliament, Jambon founded a "Diamond Club". Jan Jambon became chairman, Willem-Frederik Schiltz from Open Vld and Servais Verherstraeten from CD&V became vice-chairmen. Their intention was to represent the interests of the diamond sector at parliamentary level. It was remarkable that people's representatives so openly called for the interests of one business sector to be defended in an 'informal club'.In the 2012 provincial council elections, Jambon was the last one on the list in the canton of Antwerp in the municipality of Brasschaat, where the N-VA obtained 39 percent of the votes. He then became mayor of the municipality on 1 January 2013. In the municipal elections of 2018, N-VA obtained an absolute majority in the municipal council of Brasschaat with 44 percent, allowing him to remain mayor.
In 2014, he was included in the Michel I government, where he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Security and the Interior. Koen Verberck became serving mayor of Brasschaat, Jambon however remained titular mayor.
After the attacks in Brussels on 22 March 2016, Jambon and Minister of Justice Koen Geens offered their resignations, but this was refused by Prime Minister Charles Michel.
With the governmental crisis surrounding the UN migration treaty, the Michel I government fell and Jambon's ministerial mandate came to an end on 9 December 2018. He then became a member of parliament again and resumed his role as mayor from 2019, which was the first time that he had been elected to the post of mayor.
In the 2019 federal elections, he was N-VA list leader in the constituency of Antwerp. He was re-elected to the Chamber with 187,826 preferential votes and was active there until early October 2019. On 12 August 2019, it was announced that he would lead the negotiations for the formation of a new Flemish Government. Jambon thereby took the place of his party leader Bart De Wever, who was a candidate for prime minister during the election campaign. The Jambon government was finally formed in early October with Jambon as prime minister. He also became responsible for Culture, Foreign Policy and Development Cooperation.
Controversies
After the 22 March 2016 attacks, Jambon, as Minister of the Interior, claimed in an interview with De Standaard that "a significant part of the Muslim community danced in response to the attacks." For this, he could not provide concrete indications of partying Muslims, but referred to information from the National Security Council showing that the incidents that occurred were marginal and did not involve a significant part of the Muslim community.
Case-Chovanec
In August 2020, Jambon came under scrutiny for allegedly failing to act as interior minister in 2018 following an incident or Charleroi airport. In that incident, a Slovakian man, Jozef Chovanec, was killed in a police cell after an intervention by the aviation police (part of the federal police). Two and a half years after the incident, surveillance footage of the police action surfaced, causing a social outcry. In a meeting with the Parliamentary Committees on Justice and Home Affairs, Interior Minister Pieter De Crem indicated that Jambon was aware of the incident at the time, which he would have previously denied. Jambon claimed after De Crem's revelation that he had no recollection of it and that the file shows that neither he nor his cabinet had found out that the police had acted in a problematic manner.
Birthday of Sint-Maartensfonds
Representing the Flemish People's Movement, Jambon spoke on 5 May 2001 at the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the Flemish Eastern Front Community Sint-Maartensfonds v.z.w., a former organization of Flemish former volunteers of the Flemish Legion and the Waffen-SS. Jan Jambon was later criticized for making a speech.
This was brought out for the first time in 2007 by Karel De Gucht on VRT, in an election debate with Yves Leterme, who was then working with CD&V and N-VA. The fact was brought out a second time on 23 October 2013 by the far-right New-Solidarist Alternative, but this time with photo material. The VRT program Terzake devoted extra attention to the case on 24 October 2013 and the news was taken up by the main Flemish media, in De Tijd and De Standaard Avond, the online evening edition of De Standaard, which devoted its front page to it on 25 October 2013. Then-Flemish minister Johan Sauwens had to resign in May 2001 after it was revealed that he had participated in the same meeting.
In 2014, three days after his appointment as federal minister, he gave an interview to the French-language newspapers La Libre Belgique and La Dernière Heure, where he sought to justify his presence at the anniversary of the Sint-Maartensfonds. During the interview he called the collaboration a mistake, saying the following: "It's easy to talk in retrospect. The people who collaborated with the Germans had their reasons. I did not live in that period." This statement was criticized by several Belgian politicians, as well as the Social-Democrat Group Leader in the European Parliament, Gianni Pittella.
By press release to the Belga agency, Jan Jambon apologized.

The Battle of Bazeilles was fought on 1 September 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War as a portion of the larger Battle of Sedan and was one of the first battles to feature modern urban warfare tactics. It took place in Bazeilles, France, a small village in the department of Ardennes near Sedan, and involved a force of Bavarian soldiers battling against French marines and partisans.
The battle was, in effect, an ambush of the Bavarians (who were allies of the Prussians), by a small detachment of the "Blue Division" Troupes de marine (known also as marsouins), under the command of Élie de Vassoigne. Marsouin snipers, along with local guerrillas, fired on the Bavarian troops using quick-firing Chassepot breech-loading rifles.
Although outnumbered ten to one, the French held the village until Napoleon III gave orders to withdraw. A small group under commander Arsène Lambert remained in the last house on the road to Sedan, the Auberge Bourgerie, fighting to the last bullet in order to cover the retreat.
After seven hours of conflict, the Bavarian troops took the village, and the captured Franc-tireur partisans, along with other civilians who were considered unlawful combatants, were later executed.
Later that same day, France suffered crushing defeats at the Battle of Sedan where Napoleon III and his army were captured. Coupled with the loss of another French army at Metz, these battles effectively ended Napoleon III's Empire, ushering in the Third Republic. For several months, people of the new republic saw continued partisan warfare.
General de Vassoigne famously remarked on the French soldiers involved in the battle, "The troupes de marine fought beyond the extreme limits of duty."
The anniversary of the Battle of Bazeilles is now celebrated by the Troupes de marine.
Course
The Bavarian vanguard had prevented the demolition of the railroad bridge south of Bazeilles the previous day, encountering fierce resistance in the pursuit of their enemy. That evening they retired to the bridgehead north of the Meuse. The following night the French army secured Bazeilles with infantry and Marines of the "Blue Division". They were tasked with defending the place to the last shot. Roads and houses were barricaded for defense.
On the morning of 1 September at 4:00 AM, General Ludwig von der Tann-Rathsamhausen, commander of the First Royal Bavarian Army Corps – who may have acted rashly out of personal ambition – ordered the attack on Bazeilles. The Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke was still leading troops up to the front-line at the time. Due to poor visibility, the Bavarian units quickly suffered heavy casualties during the attack. Continued troop reinforcements resulted in continued battle-readiness among the 1st and 2nd divisions at 9:00 AM. At 11:00 AM, the French began to withdraw as the area between Bazeilles and Sedan could no longer be held.
During the battle, French civilians actively participated by firing on Bavarian troops and tending to the wounded. Angered by the casualties the civilians inflicted, the Bavarian soldiers killed many of them, setting fire to houses from which the shots were fired. By midday, the whole village was on fire.
Casualties
The French army suffered 2,655 casualties. The Bavarian army lost 213 officers and 3,876 men. Although French propaganda showed massacres of men, women and children, an official French investigation found that 39 civilians from Bazeilles died. An additional 150 people (10% of the population) died from injuries in the subsequent months.
The battle for Bazeilles was a dark day for the Bavarian army; General Carl Von Helvig deemed it "a bloody contribution to the Bavarian military honor, an honorable putty for German unity." For many military artists and illustrators of the late 19th century, the struggle for Bazeilles was a popular motif. Michael Zeno Diemer described it in 1896, resulting in a panorama depicting the struggle for Bazeilles. It was shown in a building in Mannheim. Anton von Werner featured it in his 1883 Sedan panorama on Alexanderplatz in Berlin. The painters Otto von Faber du Faur, Friedrich Bodenmüller, Franz Adam, Carl Röchling, Richard Knötel, and the Frenchman Alphonse de Neuville all created representations of the battle.
Today the French Troupes de Marine recognizes the defense of the last house on the road to Sedan as an identity-building event.

The Natal Native Contingent was a large force of auxiliary soldiers in British South Africa, forming a substantial portion of the defence forces of the British colony of Natal. The Contingent saw action during the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War. The Natal Mounted Police was created in 1873 to bolster the defenses of Natal. It enlisted European officers, NCOs and natives. The infantry was created in 1878. Most enlisted troops were drawn from the Basuto and Mpondo tribes, which had had long experience fighting the Zulus.
Establishment and organisation
The Natal legislature established the Natal Mounted Police in 1873 and appointed Major J. G. Dartnell as commander. However, they were slow to appropriate funds for the organization. The first trooper enrolled in March 1874. The first headquarters were at Fort Napier in Pietermaritzburg.
The infantry was created in 1878 under Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony William Durnford as part of the Zululand expeditionary force.
The structure of the NNC followed the pattern of regular British infantry units at the time. Each regiment consisted of two to three battalions, divided into ten companies of 100 black soldiers each, with six European NCOs and three European officers per company. Units received rudimentary training at best. Elements of standard British infantry training were not added until after the Zulu War.
Equipment
Due to budget constraints, the British were unable to provide NNC troops with uniforms. Instead, soldiers wore traditional tribal apparel with a red cloth bandanna around their foreheads, the only item that distinguished them from Zulu warriors. NCO's and officers wore Khaki and black uniforms.
Primarily due to logistical and budget constraints, but also due to the European population's fear that arming the black population would create a severe security risk, initially fewer than one in ten NNC troopers were issued rifles; the rest made do with traditional assegais and cowhide shields. The officers and NCOs, about 90 men per battalion, carried rifles, ammunition and bayonets. In addition, soldiers who were issued a musket firearm were provided only four rounds of ammunition at any one time. The bulk of the NNC fought with traditional African spears and shields and only about 20% of the unit had some sort of gun.
Effectiveness
At the beginning of the Anglo-Zulu War in January 1879, the NNC's commander, Colonel Durnford, frequently voiced his opinion that the NNC troops should be used as scouts for the advancing British army, as their appearance (similar to Zulu warriors) would confuse Zulu scouts. The NNC was, in his view, particularly well-adapted to reconnaissance and light infantry roles, as NNC soldiers were generally in better physical condition than British regulars (some of whom were hampered by heatstroke and illness resulting from over-exposure to the sun in the South African summer) and were not encumbered with heavy equipment. Instead, the commander of the British forces, Lord Chelmsford, frequently assigned NNC troops to menial tasks, refusing to credit their fighting abilities.
Battlefield performance was uneven. At the Battle of Isandhlwana, NNC units fought alongside British counterparts and sustained heavy casualties. Many NNC were killed in hand-to-hand combat while trying to retreat across the Buffalo River. At the Battle of Rorke's Drift, the NNC officers, NCO's, and soldiers who possessed firearms were deployed along the barricade. The rest of the NNC, stripped of their command and armed only with spears, were posted outside the mealy bag and biscuit box barricade within the stone-walled cattle kraal. They broke and fled as soon as the Zulu force came into sight, some NCOs and Captain Stephenson joining them. Lieutenant Gert Adendorff and a Swiss corporal of the contingent, Christian Ferdinand Schiess, remained with the latter winning the Victoria Cross for his gallantry in the ensuing battle.
After Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, British commanders in South Africa worried about the loyalty of their NNC detachments, and many were incorporated into the Natal Border Guard instead. The NNC last saw action at Hlobane, where several NNC troops and a small British force were ambushed and killed by Zulu troops. After the war, the NNC was disbanded and the troops returned to civilian life.
Natal Native Horse
While the bulk of the NNC consisted of infantrymen, the Natal Native Horse added a cavalry force. Formed of six troops of approximately fifty men each, the NNH was largely recruited from the amaNgwane, a Natal tribe traditionally hostile to the Zulus, and other tribes, as well as black Christians from Edendale Mission. The NNH were much better-equipped than their infantry counterparts; they wore tan-colored European uniforms, rode horses with full equipment, and bore a rifled carbine in addition to traditional spears. Units of the NNH were led by European officers dressed in conspicuous sky-blue uniforms.
Five troops of the NNH were present at Isandlwana. Three formed the Zikhali Horse squadron, named after their chief. The troopers fought well against the Zulus and were dismissed late in the battle by Colonel Durnford who was eager to save as many of his men as possible from the chaotic battle. The mounted NNH soldiers escaped quickly from the battlefield, and many black NNH troopers are credited with stopping to give rides to native and British soldiers struggling to escape the battlefield on foot. Most notably, Horace Smith-Dorrien was rescued and ridden to safety by an NNH trooper. Around 200 NNH troopers survived Isandlwana, but unlike the NNC infantry, were recommitted to the war; the remainder of the NNH saw action at the Battle of Kambula and at the Battle of Ulundi. After the war, the NNH was retained as a police force in conquered Zululand and saw action during the Zulu civil wars which began in the early 1880s. The NNH was finally disbanded during the 1899–1902 Second Anglo-Boer War, under a government initiative to disarm all-black units in South Africa out of fear that they could side with the Boers.

James Bard (1815-1897) was a marine artist of the 19th century. He is known for his paintings of watercraft, particularly of steamboats. His works are sometimes characterized as naïve art. Although Bard died poor and almost forgotten, his works have since become valuable. Bard had a twin brother, John (1815–1856) and they collaborated on earlier works.
Life
James Bard and John Bard were born in 1815 in New York City. Their father was Joseph Bard, who had been born in England. Their mother was Nellie Purvis Bard, who had been born in Scotland. They had at least two brothers (Joseph and George), two older sisters (Ellen and Mary) and one younger sister, Margaret. Sometime before 1843, Bard married Harriet DeGroot, who was six years older than he was. They had six children, but between 1843 and 1856 five of them died. Only their daughter Ellen survived.
Harriet's brother, Albert DeGroot, later became a steamboat captain and a wealthy man, who commissioned a number of works by James Bard.
Works
Joint works with John Bard
The first known picture by the Bard brothers is of the steamboat Belona, done in 1827 when they were 12 years old. James continued to work with John through the 1830s and into the 1840s. It is not possible to tell which portions of the work were done by each brother. Their joint works are signed "J & J Bard" or "J & J Bard, Picture Painters." No work survives signed by John alone, but there are several signed "Jas. Bard." They began dating their work by 1836. When their father died in 1838, they were listed in the New York directory for the first time as "painters."
Their works in the 1830s were watercolor. They began improving their technique and moving into oil painting as a medium by the 1840s. There is only one instance recorded of a showing of the brother's joint work, this was in 1842 at a large display of work by other nautical artists held by the American Institute of City of New York at Niblo's Garden.
The last known joint paintings by the brothers were dated 1849. These were of the steamboats Wilson G. Hunt and Senator, both of which left the New York area in March 1850 to travel around South America to the California Gold Rush. After these paintings, there is no further indication of John Bard's participation. It has been suggested that he went to the gold rush, but there is no evidence as to John's whereabouts or activities during this time. John is known to have been admitted to the Blackwell Island alms' house, apparently in poor health. He died on October 18, 1856, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.
Later works
The break into works done alone by James Bard is marked by the oil paintings of the steamboats Ocean and Boston in March 1850, which are signed by James alone. The 1850s were a boom-time for ship construction in New York, and Bard received many commissions from owners of newly built vessels. Bard appears to have earned a modest living from his work, as he was listed as "artist" in various city directories, but his financial success was somewhat limited, as there is no record that Bard ever opened a bank account or owned real estate. There is some indication he may have worked as a railroad mechanic or engineer in the 1860s. In the 1880s Bard's commissions declined, although as late as 1890 he was still able to produce two commercial watercolors.
Bard may have gone to California in the late 1870s, as he painted two vessels that were assembled there from prefabricated parts manufactured in Brooklyn. There is no record of Bard having traveled to California but it has been pointed out that it would have been unlikely for him to have painted vessels he had never seen in operation.
By 1892, however, with age his ability to draw had deteriorated, and he apparently was no longer able to earn a living. In the 1890s, Bard and his wife moved to White Plains, New York, apparently to live with his daughter, Ellen, who apparently had the sole, if limited ability to support them. In late 1896, Bard's wife Harriet fell ill with pneumonia and she died on January 5, 1897. James Bard himself died on March 26, 1897. Their daughter Ellen lived until 1919. She worked as a maid. Her father's friend, Samuel Ward Stanton, helped her stay off public assistance by sending her money every month. Other than their works, James and John Bard left no papers, journals, wills, or other documents. Bard was almost forgotten by the time of his death in 1897, although he was the subject of a single obituary, probably written by his friend, the important marine artist and historian Samuel Ward Stanton.
Style
During his life, Bard painted or made drawings of at least 3,000 vessels, including probably every steamer built at New York during his active life as an artist.
Bard's works included common features intended to please patrons. Sailboats were shown underway with all sails up. Steamboats likewise were shown underway, with numerous flags flying, including a large one bearing the vessel's name. There would often be inscriptions about the ship and its owner. In one example, James and John Bard painted for their patron Cornelius Vanderbilt, then one of the wealthiest men in the United States, a portrait of the Hudson River steamboat Cornelius Vanderbilt racing the Oregon. Although Oregon won the race, the Vanderbilt is shown in the lead, and all that is visible of the Oregon is the prow and the flag on the jackstaff.
Bard went to great lengths to get the details of the vessel correctly, including personally measuring the vessel in question. Preliminary drawings exist for some vessels. It was customary at that time for marine artists to paint multiple works of a single vessel, which could be different as to the background and other details, depending on orders from patrons. Bard followed this practice, often painting the same vessel multiple times.
Later recognition
As Bard grew older, photography became increasingly used for marine as well as other subject areas, and steamboats themselves declined in importance in relation to the railroads. During Bard's life, Stanton, was the only artist who acknowledged Bard's influence, stating in his 1895 book American Steam Vessels that Bard was a gentleman who had begun the work of steamboat portraiture before 1830, and "to him the maritime world owes gratitude for his contributions to it of correct likenesses of many of the noted steamboats of early days".
Most of the Bard works were done for persons in the steamboat or maritime trades, and as these persons died or went out of business, the works were lost or destroyed. In the earlier part of the 20th century, historians began relying on the surviving Bard works as references. Three of these historians, Francis F.C. Bradlee, George W. Murdock, and Edwin M. Eldredge collected steamboat art and other materials, and they came to acquire many of the Bard works. In time, all three of these collections came into the hands of museums, in particular the Eldredge collection, the most extensive one, went to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News in 1940.
In 1924, for the first time since 1842, two of Bard's works were featured at an art exhibition. After the 1897 obituary, nothing was written about the Bards as artists until 1949, when Alexander Crosby Brown and Harold Sniffen wrote an article published in Art in America which focused on the output of the Bard brothers, the accuracy of their drawings, and their importance for marine historians.
Auction prices
In 1997, Bard works realized prices of over $200,000 at Sotheby's winter and fall auctions. Some recent auction prices are summarized below.

"Backwash" is the seventh episode of the second season of the HBO original series The Wire. The episode was written by Rafael Alvarez from a story by David Simon & Rafael Alvarez and was directed by Thomas J. Wright. It originally aired on July 13, 2003.
Plot
Bunk and Beadie meet with Landsman to discuss using a computer to monitor dock traffic. He is initially outraged but is more accepting when he learns that Daniels has granted them space in his detail's off-site location. Before storming out, he speculates that Daniels might take the Jane Doe case, which would relieve Homicide of the uncleared murders. Rawls later tries to persuade Daniels to take the Jane Does, but Daniels stands firm. Later, in an argument with Marla, Daniels defends his decision to stay in the BPD and tells her he is "playing their game" from now on.
Greggs and Prez follow up on the information from Shardene's friend, and find a strip club employing Eastern European dancers. They watch as the girls leave the club and file into a van, which they follow to an apartment building. Meanwhile, Herc and Carver borrow an expensive surveillance bug to get information on the portside drug trade, allowing the clerk to hold Carver's credit card as collateral. They place the bug in a tennis ball and have some success monitoring Frog. However, when Nick arrives, Frog distractedly tosses the ball into the busy street, where it is demolished by a Mack truck. Herc and Carver later plan to fraudulently claim to work with an informant to recoup the cost of the bug.
Beadie and Freamon continue to monitor drug trafficking through the port. When they note that Horseface will be working a ship, they call in Greggs and Prez for help with surveillance. Soon enough, Beadie sees him "lose" a container, which they follow back to an east side warehouse. There, they photograph Serge meeting with Proposition Joe. Meanwhile, McNulty tries to rekindle his relationship with Elena, who admits she can never trust him again. The detail persuades Daniels to take on the Jane Doe murders in order to make their investigation a success. Daniels informs Rawls that he's willing to take on the case in exchange for Rawls' full support. However, Marla expresses anger and disappointment that Daniels has abandoned his career ambitions.
Nick sets himself up as a supplier to Frog and gives Ziggy his share of the first drug profits. Frank attends a seminar on robotic dock technology and is appalled when he realizes the automated systems threaten to make stevedores obsolete. He pleads with Nat to let him extend his term as union treasurer for another year. Frank also confronts the union's lobbyist, Bruce DiBiago, and expresses his frustration that his lobbying efforts have failed to make political headway. Frank rants about his family's lack of a financially secure future and demands that Bruce work the politicians harder to get the canal dredged. After a stevedore named New Charles suffers a severe leg injury on the job, Frank delivers an envelope stuffed with cash to his family. Nat pointedly asks where the money comes from. Refusing to answer, Frank walks away.
Bodie buys a floral arrangement for D'Angelo's funeral and orders it to look like the tower he controlled before his demotion. Stringer visits Brianna's house for D'Angelo's wake and finds her inconsolable. In prison, Avon and Wee-Bey discuss D'Angelo's "suicide," unaware that Stringer engineered the murder. Despite being despondent, Avon musters enough anger to dismiss D'Angelo as weak for killing himself. After the funeral, Joe approaches Stringer to discuss sharing his supply for a share in the Barksdales' territory. Stringer pragmatically agrees to present the idea to Avon during his next visit. When he does so, Avon angrily dismisses it out of hand.
Production
Title reference

In Hawaiian religion, Lua-o-Milu is the land of the dead, ruled by Milu. Entrance to Lua-o-Milu is from the top of a valley wall or sea cliff where the soul departs via a tree. It is reported that each Hawaiian island has at least one leaping place. According to natives of the land, the entrance located in Waipio Valley has since been covered in sand and is now hidden from the sight of upper areas. Another documented area where souls enter the next world is Leina Kauhane. The spirits of the dead can watch what the living do and turn them to stone by staring at them.

The Lunenburgh River is a perennial river in the South West region of Western Australia.
The river rises in the Darling Range near the abandoned timber mill town of Worsley, then flows north-west discharging into the Brunswick River at Beela. The river's catchment of receives a mean annual rainfall of with mean annual runoff of . Vegetation is 100% jarrah-marri forest (severely affected by dieback disease), of which 15% is cleared. Land use is part state forest reserve, part private timber leases, with a few small mixed farms. The Lunenburgh's two tributaries are the Otho and the Sophia.
The river was named in March 1830 by Lieutenant-Governor James Stirling after Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg and King of Hanover, the fifth son and eighth child of George III. Over a period of 5 days in December 1813, while in command of HMS Brazen, Captain Stirling had transported the Duke and his entourage to Wijk aan Zee in Holland. In the period since 1813, Prince Ernest Augustus had greatly increased in importance. In 1813 he was fifth in line to the throne. Upon William IV's succession as King in June 1830, he was second in line to the throne after Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent. Following exploration of the Brunswick River and its tributaries by boat, Stirling named a number for Prince Ernest Augustus: the Brunswick; the Ernest; the Augustus; the Frederic (after his wife Frederica); the Otho (after Otho I, the first Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg); and the Sophia and the Matilda (after Prince Ernest's sister Princess Sophia Matilda).

Alec B. Francis (born Alec Francis Budd, 2 December 1867 – 6 July 1934) was an English actor, largely of the silent era. He appeared in more than 240 films between 1911 and 1934.
Biography
Francis was born in Suffolk, England. He studied law at Uppingham College in England and practiced with a legal firm in London.
Disliking legal work, Francis joined a stock theater company for which he played bit parts, and was baggage master and property man. He eventually came under contract with a touring company headed by Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Kendall, acting in leading roles in England, India, South Africa, and the United States. He also performed in vaudeville.
Francis served twice in the military, once for Britain and once for the United States. He was in India for a four-year tour of duty with the British Royal Horse Artillery, and He was a nurse with American forces during the Spanish-American War.
Although Francis tried farming after his service as a nurse, he returned to acting and appeared in some plays, including musical productions in which he sang as a baritone. He began acting in films in 1913 and worked for Vitagraph, World, and other film studios.
Francis died in Hollywood Hospital in Hollywood, California, on 6 July 1934, three days after emergency abdominal surgery. His funeral was held at St. Athanasius Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, and his remains cremated.

Henry Beekman Livingston Jr. (October 3, 1854 – September 8, 1931) was an American banker, sportsman, and clubman who was prominent in New York society during the Gilded Age.
Early life
Livingston was born at 18 Washington Square North in New York City on October 3, 1854. He was the son of Henry Beekman Livingston Sr. (1818–1861) and Mary Lawrence (née Livingston) Livingston (1821–1883). His siblings included Walter L. Livingston and Margaret Lewis Livingston ("one of the five most beautiful debutantes of her time in society"), who married John Lawrence Lee. His father, who inherited the most valuable share of his grandmother's estate, 68-72 Leonard Street, went into business as Foster & Livingston, which sold Indian shawls among other goods.
His paternal grandparents were Judge Maturin Livingston and Margaret (née Lewis) Livingston, the only daughter and sole heiress of Gov. Morgan Lewis. His uncles included Robert James Livingston and Maturin Livingston Jr. His aunt, Angelica Livingston was married to Alexander Hamilton, Jr., son of James Alexander Hamilton and grandson of Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury. His maternal grandparents were John Swift Livingston, a son of Robert "Cambridge" Livingston and grandson of Robert Livingston.
Livingston attended boarding school at C. D. Morris' in Lake Mohegan, New York and then entered Yale University with the class of 1877. Due to his "being delicate", he left Yale and went to England where he attended Christ Church, Oxford University for two years.
Career
After returning to the United States, he joined the New York Stock Exchange in August 1882 and, for many years, ran a successful brokerage business. He remained a member of the Exchange for 40 years.
Society life
In 1892, Livingston and his second wife Frances were included in Ward McAllister's "Four A Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Livingston was related and close with many of the most prominent people in New York society as the guests at his second wedding attest, including Mr. and Mrs. Robert L. Livingston, Mr. and Mrs. Maturin Livingston, Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Van Rensselaer, Mr. Campbell Steward, Mr. and Mrs. Philip Schuyler, Mrs. William Morgan and the Misses Morgan.
He was a member of the Union Club of the City of New York, the Knickerbocker Club, the Brook Club, the South Side Sportsmen's Club the Metropolitan Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club and the Turf and Field Club.
Personal life
Livingston was married twice. His first marriage was on September 27, 1876 to Stephanie Jacqueline Fox (1853–1878), the daughter of Samuel Fox and Marie Adelaide (née Livingston) Fox. Before her death in 1878, they were the parents of:
Mary Angelica Livingston (b. 1877), who was born in Dieppe, France and who resided at 164 East 72nd Street in New York City, a building memorialized in a poem by James Merrill.
After his first wife's death, Livingston was remarried to Frances Redmond (1849–1916), the fifth daughter of William Redmond and Sabina Elizabeth (née Hoyt) Redmond, on March 1, 1881. Frances was a sister of Goold Hoyt Redmond and a grand-niece of Jesse Hoyt, a Collector of the Port of New York who was known for his role in the Swartwout-Hoyt scandal. In New York, his home was at 63 East 82nd Street and he had a country home in Islip on Long Island. Together, they were the parents of:
Lilias Livingston (1882–1976), who married Henry Bowly Hollins Jr. (1882–1956), son of Henry Bowly Hollins and Evelina (née Knapp) Hollins and brother of golfer Marion Hollins, on June 28, 1904.
Mary Lawrence Livingston (1883–1898), who died aged 15.
Frances Lewis Livingston (b. 1886),
Livingston's wife died in June 1916. He later resided at 47 East 64th Street in New York. He died at his home in New York City on Tuesday September 8, 1931. His funeral was held in Hyde Park, New York and he was buried at St. James Church Cemetery. His estate, estimated more than $500,000, was shared between his unmarried daughters Mary and Frances. His personal property was share between Mary and another daughter, Lilias, who received stock in the Amsterdam Investment Company and the Importers' Building Company. A great-grandson, Reginald Frost, received a $2,400 annuity until he was 21 years old at which point he received the principal of the fund.
Descendants
Through his daughter Lilias, he was the grandfather of Lilias Hollins (b. 1905), who married Reginald Radcliffe Frost (1897–1950) in 1929; Evelina Hollins (b. 1906); Hope Hollins (1907–1970), who was engaged to the English explorer Frank Bickerton in 1931 but broke the engagement in May before the June wedding; Henry Bowly "Harry" Hollins (1909–1991), who first married Elizabeth Wolcott Elkins (daughter of William M. Elkins) in 1931, and later married author Elizabeth Morgan Jay (1911–1991) in 1948, a descendant of Edwin D. Morgan and John Jay and the former wife of artist Stephen Etnier; Jean Hollins (b. 1910); and Robert Livingston Hollins (b. 1912).

Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate ("Mother Tate") (January 3, 1871 – December 28, 1930) was an African American evangelist. She was the first American woman to serve as a Bishop in a nationally recognized denomination. She founded a Pentecostal denomination, The Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth, in 1903. Its first convocation was held in June 1903 in Greenville, Alabama. The church was the first Pentecostal Holiness church in America founded by a woman, and spread to at least twenty states. At least seven denominations currently trace their history back to her church.
Early life and education
Mary Lena Street was born in Vanleer, Tennessee on January 5, 1871. She was one of four sisters born to Belfield Street and Nancy (Hall) Street, and part of a larger extended family of nine children, including five half-brothers and half-sisters.
In 1889, at age nineteen, Mary Street married her first husband, David Lewis. They had two sons, Walter Curtis Lewis and Felix Earley Lewis. She is reported to have married and divorced twice more.
Church of the Living God
Mary Lewis began traveling and preaching in Steel Springs, Tennessee and Paducah, Kentucky. She was known as Saint Mary Magdalena. She gathered people into informal "Do Rights" bands in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee. She preached to both white and black audiences.
In 1903, Lewis led her followers in creating the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth in Greenville, Alabama. The name was taken from I Timothy, 3:15. Following a period of illness, Lewis experienced a miraculous healing and the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues. From June 25 to July 5, 1908, she held a ten-day General Assembly there, a Pentecostal revival at which she formally incorporated the denomination. As the Overseer and Chief Leader of the Church, she presided as bishop, ordained ministers, and baptized converts in the "indwelling" of the Holy Ghost. The church spread rapidly, in response to the work of Lewis and her sons. By 1911, presiding elders were appointed.
In 1914, Street married Robert Tate, a deacon in the church. In June 1914, State Bishops were ordained for four states at the 1914 General Assembly, held in Quitman, Georgia. Two of the bishops were Tate's sons. At the same assembly, the church adopted Tate's first Decree Book, written to summarize the doctrines, rules, rituals and governance of the denomination, for use in its churches. A later edition of 1923 was titled the Constitution, Government, and General Decree Book.
By 1916, the group had spread to twenty states. In 1923, its headquarters were moved to Nashville, Tennessee. There Tate established the New and Living Way Publishing Company to print religious literature and music. She is credited with writing many of the hymns used by the denomination.
In 1929, Tate identified Bishop Archibald Henry White as her successor in the Church. He was later elected Senior Bishop of all churches in Pennsylvania, incorporated under the name “House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, Pillar and Ground of the Truth”.
Tate died on December 28, 1930 in Philadelphia General Hospital while on a visit to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her death resulted from frostbite and gangrene in one of her feet, possibly complications of diabetes. Her body was originally buried in a family plot in Dickson, Tennessee, but was moved in 1963 to Greenwood Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.
Following Tate's death, three major branches were created under the leadership of various relatives of Mother Tate. These are currently known as the Keith Dominion, the Lewis Dominion, and the Jewell Dominion (previously the McLeod Dominion). At least seven denominations can trace their history back to Tate's establishment of Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth.
Teachings
Tate was a strong exponent of women's leadership, who intentionally used generic language and mentored women for leadership positions. Hundreds of women served in The Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth as evangelists, ministers, and bishops.
Tate propounded an approach to living that emphasized "cleanness", as a principle underlying all aspects of life, including food, marriage, family life, and community activity. Her dogma of "The Cleanliness of the Word" was based on St. John 15:3.

Ryan 'Ricey' McMenamin is a Canadian-born Irish Gaelic football manager and former player who formerly managed the Fermanagh county team. He played for the Tyrone county team, winning three All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals, two Ulster Championships and two National League titles. Forging a reputation for being a bit of a bad boy during his career, he was awarded an Star for his performances in 2005.
McMenamin played his club football for St Dympna's Dromore and won two Tyrone Senior Football Championships with the club.
Despite normally starting at corner back for his county, he was not a traditional corner back, often running with the ball up the pitch, and getting himself into scoring positions. However, his marking is among the best in the country, and often marks the opposition's leading scorers. He also played at centre half back for his club.
Playing career
Club
McMenamin helped Dromore win the Tyrone Senior Football Championship in 2007, beating Coalisland in the final. Dromore also reached the following year's final, but were defeated by Clonoe. In 2009 he once again helped Dromore win the Tyrone Senior Football Championship in dramatic style against Ardboe.
Inter-county
In 2003 McMenamin helped Tyrone win the county's first ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Two years later he won a second All-Ireland medal with Tyrone, and received an Star award for his performances that year. In 2006, he captained the much-depleted side due to injury to the captain, Brian Dooher. The side were knocked out of the Championship by Laois in July. In 2008, he won a third All-Ireland with Tyrone. In the winter of 2012, McMenamin retired from Inter-county football and is no longer with the Tyrone senior setup.
International rules
McMenamin represented Ireland in the International Rules Series.
Disciplinary problems
Discipline was an underlying problem in McMenamin's career, which at times threatened to overshadow his achievements. This indiscipline was apparent throughout his career, and he made a name for his verbal taunting of his direct opponents during matches as well, which was mentioned by Oisín McConville in his autobiography.
His 2005 achievements were blotted somewhat by his disciplinary record. He was given a yellow card late on in the replayed Ulster Championship, for dropping his knee onto a fallen player. This was upgraded to a sending off after the game, which meant that McMenamin would be suspended for the following four weeks, but Tyrone launched an appeal, employing the services of former player, and practising solicitor, Feargal Logan. The appeal was successful but only after McMenamin missed the All-Ireland qualifier against Monaghan.
In the opening game of the 2007 Ulster Senior Football Championship, despite being one of the few first choice panellists available on the injury-hit side, he was substituted just before half time because he had already picked up a yellow card and a ticking—meaning he was one bad tackle away from being sent off. He was visibly upset when he was shown coming off the field.
As a result of his behaviour in a league match against Kerry on Sunday 15 February, where he was seen to grab Paul Galvin in the groin area, he was banned for eight weeks. Initially the ban was for six weeks, but due to the nature of McMenamin's behaviour the ban was raised to eight weeks, when the Tyrone County Board appealed the initial six-week ban. In addition to the incident with Paul Galvin for which he received the ban, McMenamim was involved in a number of unsavoury incidents throughout the match, which led to intense criticism in the media.
Managerial career
McMenamin took over as Fermanagh senior manager in August 2019, having previously spent two years serving in the background. His time in charge was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. He departed as Fermanagh senior manager in August 2021. He joined the Cavan management team in late 2021.

The ingredients (in order on the product label) are cane vinegar, sugar, tomatoes, onions, raisins, sea salt, ginger, peppers, garlic, cloves, black pepper, thyme, mangoes, and orange peel, aged in oak barrels. The sauce is sweet, sour and mildly spicy. The company makes several variants of the sauce, including mango and extra-hot Scotch bonnet pepper varieties.
One traditional use of the sauce is to pour it over a block of cream cheese, to be spread on crackers.

Elodea nuttallii is a species of waterweed known by the common name western waterweed or Nuttall's waterweed. This is a perennial aquatic plant which is native to North America where it grows submersed in lakes, rivers, and other shallow water bodies. It is also found in Eurasia, where it is commonly weedy; it is not known as a weed species in its native range. It is sometimes used as an aquarium plant.
Description
It is similar to its relative, Elodea canadensis. However, the leaves taper to an acute point. It has a thin branching stem with whorls of flat leaves at intervals. Some leaves are recurved and twisted, with minute teeth. It bears tiny flowers, the staminate ones abscissing from their stalks and floating away from the plant. It flowers from May until October. In Europe nearly all individuals are female, only some places with male plants are known.
Distribution
This species is native to temperate North America. It has been naturalised in Europe since 1939 and in Japan since the 1960s. The first European record of Elodea nuttallii was probably 1914 in England, though it had been identified wrongly as Hydrilla verticillata, with correct identification as Elodea nuttallii occurring in 1974. It seems to have been originally naturalised in Oxfordshire in 1966, but has now spread to most of England, and many parts of lowland Wales and lowland Scotland. The first record in Ireland was in Lough Neagh in 1984, and it has now spread widely in the country. It is an invasive species in Europe; it reached Belgium in 1939, the Netherlands in 1941, Germany in 1953, Denmark in 1974, Sweden in 1991 and Norway in 2006. It is now present in most of Northern Europe, in many parts displacing the invasive Elodea canadensis.

The Catholic Church in Eswatini is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.
There are approximately 60,000 Catholics in Eswatini – around 5% of the total population. The country forms a single diocese – the Diocese of Manzini.
The Catholic Church began in Eswatini in 1913 with the arrival of Servite missionaries who began work in Mbabane. Two of Eswatini's bishops were born in Eswatini: MandleNkhosi Zwane and Ncamiso Ndlovu.

Our Big Kitchen, abbreviated as OBK, is a charity based in Sydney, Australia that provides a large commercial grade kitchen for community use. The kitchen facilities are used by various community groups to prepare and distribute meals. The community kitchen concept is similar to that of a soup kitchen, but incorporates volunteer and common-effort aspects closer to that of a community garden. Housed in the Yeshivah Centre, Sydney, Our Big Kitchen, a project of the Sydney Jewish community, is accessed by a large spectrum of both Jewish and non-Jewish community groups. OBK was founded by Rabbi Dovid Slavin and Laya Slavin in February 2005.
Services
The kitchen has a kosher kitchen. The organisation organizes events where community volunteers prepare food that is distributed to those in need. OBK organises birthday parties where participants cook food which is later distributed. The kitchen runs programs aimed at helping new mothers overcome post natal depression, corporate team building exercises where employees prepare food together, cook ins for single members of the community. The kitchen is also made available to caterers looking to start a business in the food industry.
Our Big Kitchen came to prominence to a wider public when it organised large scale community cooking for victims of the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009.
Our Big Kitchen has been visited by politicians and dignitaries who have lent their support, including Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull, the Governor-General Quentin Bryce, former Premier Nathan Rees and Tanya Plibersek, the Member for Sydney.

Solanum vescum, commonly known as green kangaroo apple or gunyang, is a small fruiting shrub in the family Solanaceae, native to eastern and southeastern Australia.
Solanum vescum was first described by Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller, in 1855 after being collected near the mouth of the Snowy River. The specific epithet is the neuter of the Latin adjective vescus, meaning "edible".
Solanum vescum is a soft green shrub which grows to high. It lacks the spines of many other species of Solanum. Its juvenile leaves are ovate with three or four deep lobes, and measure long and wide. The adult leaves are narrowly lanceolate and either lack lobes (unusually for a Solanum) or have 2 to 4 on each side. The small purple flowers occur in winter and spring, and are followed by yellowish- or ivory-green diameter globular fruit, often streaked, which occur in bunches of 5 to 20.
The range is from southeastern Queensland through eastern and central New South Wales (with Moree and Narrabri as western limits) and Victoria and into Tasmania. Solanum vescum is an understory shrub in a range of forest habitats including rainforest and wet and dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest.
Solanum vescum was eaten by the Gunai people of Gippsland. It grew from seed prolifically after bushfire, and the local indigenous people would practice controlled burns to induce it to grow and bear fruit.

Z comme Zorglub, written and drawn by Franquin, is the fifteenth album of the Spirou et Fantasio series, and the first part of Franquin's Zorglub diptych. The story was initially serialised in Spirou magazine before its release as a hardcover album in 1961.
Story
In Z is for Zorglub, Fantasio receives a hair dryer as a gift from a secret admirer, but its unexpected hypnotic abilities announce a new ominous presence in the Spirou universe. Zorglub, an old acquaintance of the Count of Champignac, appears from the past and offers the Count the chance to join him in seizing world domination, but it is firmly rejected. In response, Zorglub proceeds to demonstrate his powers by manipulating the township of Champignac to storm the Count's mansion, which nearly leads to the destruction of his laboratory. As this just barely fails, Zorglub decides to kidnap Fantasio, to "zorglhomize" him into a zorglhomme (zorglman), forcing Spirou and the Count to travel to the village of Zorgland, and attempt to outwit the criminal mastermind.
Background
Along with the introduction of the new arch-enemy Zorglub, a few inventions and vehicles associated with him are seen for the first time, most impressively the Zorglumobile and the Zorglécoptère. Another first is the stunning weapon of the zorglhomme, the Zorglonde (Zorglwave or perhaps Z-ray).
Champignac town gendarme (policeman) Jérôme is seen for the first time, and is given the distinction of becoming the first zorglhomme of Champignac-en-Cambrousse.
This album was translated into English and released in 1995 by Fantasy Flight Publishing, although this is currently out of print.
