He has been bitten on the nose by a leopard and had his shoulder separated after wrestling with a full-grown Bengal tiger.
But Carl Bovard, who is blind in one eye, believes living with 14 big cats including two lions, six tigers and a desert lynx, is a risk worth taking to raise awareness about endangered species.
They all spend time living in his Florida home before moving into the outside enclosure and are seen clambering over the pool table and cuddling up in his bed.

After an accident left him blind around 13 years ago, Mr Bovard realised the main thing he missed was seeing animals – so when he regained sight in one eye he adopted his first two tiger cubs.
The 43-year-old set up Single Vision – his educational, non-profit company – nine years ago and welcomes tours to his house and 274-acre garden in Melrose where his animals live with him.
'There are many dangers that come with keeping these animals and you've just got to take all the precautions you can to stay safe,' said Mr Bovard.
'There's no doubt about the fact that death would be the worst outcome from this. I know I'm dicing with death.

'Instinctively they just know to go straight for the vitals – when I'm with them I never give them a free shot at my neck.'
Mr Bovard plays rough with the tigers, allowing them to recreate the honing of the natural hunting talents they would develop in the wild – but that does not come without its drawbacks.
'I've had a leopard bite me on the nose and I had to get that sewed back together. I've also had my shoulder separated, he added.
'I was playing with a few of the cats and another decided to join the fun. He ran at me and they can get up to around 50 miles per hour in a couple of strides – that hurt.
'But when they're growing up they play really rough together in the wild. It's how they hone their natural instincts – I can't deny them that.'
Every Sunday, Mr Bovard treks to the local Walmart, where he picks up about 1,500lbs of meat for the week as his big cats can get through 200lbs in a single sitting.
This is around $400 for food per cat. He then stores the meat in six freezers in a shed by the alligator cage.

His biggest tiger is a Siberian named Samson – he weighs more than 700lbs and is over nine and a half feet tall when he stands on his back legs.
Despite the fact that Samson could tear him in two with one swipe of his massive paw Carl still carries his food right to him.
He added: 'Some people use a guillotine system to feed their tigers but I walk the food right in.
'I have a great relationship with the animals but it changes when I have food in my hands.'
'They become very territorial. I like to keep my distance from them – I don't want to push it, they snarl and growl when you go anywhere near them but that's their natural instincts.'
He currently has two lions, two bobcats, three cougars, two Bengal tigers, two Siberian tigers and an Asian black leopard in his backyard.
The future of his facility and others like it across the USA is being challenged by a petition seeking a federal ban on licensees who allow the public to have direct or physical contact with big cats.

Despite the controversy that comes with keeping and breeding big cats in captivity, Mr Bovard believes his organisation is helping tigers and lions.
'Having these cats in captivity and being able to show them off gives people a chance to get a passion for them,' he said.
'It is essential that we keep them in captivity to create that passion in people and make them want to help these beautiful animals.
'People say to me – they belong in the wild but my question to them is – what wild?
'There are seven billion people on this planet and we are destroying the habitat of these animals.
'Pretty soon the only tigers left are going to be those in captivity and they may need to be used to repopulate the wild.
'I do what I can to give these guys the best lives possible and I want to work to ensure more tigers and lions in captivity are better treated.'

He added: 'Your furniture pays the price as they're very destructive but it's important that they are socialised before going into the yard.
'We've got to get them used to being around people and other animals so inside the home is the best place for them.
'But as much as they are socialised they are still wild animals with wild instincts – these big cats will never be domesticated.
'But we have tigers and lions living together now – they would never encounter each other in the wild and I don't think they would get along if they did.'

At the same time, however, the company can also be saddled with a list of striking failures, missteps that would have doomed lesser firms. McKinsey consultants were on the scene when General Motors drove itself into the ground. They were Kmart's advisers when the retailer tumbled into disarray. They pushed Swissair in a direction that led to its collapse. They played a critical role in building the bomb known as Enron and collected massive fees right up until the moment of its spectacular explosion. And these are just the clients unlucky enough to have had their woes splashed across headlines. Many more have paid handsomely for guidance that shortchanged shareholders, led to unnecessary layoffs, and even prompted bankruptcies. And yet the consultants are rarely blamed for their bad advice—at least not publicly so.
Remarkably, that pervasive influence has come even though McKinsey contains more contradictions than the Bible. The firm is well known, but there is almost nothing known about it. Precious few McKinsey employees have ever become acclaimed in the outside world. The employees are trusted and distrusted—and loved and despised—in equal measure. They are a collection of huge egos that are yet content to stay behind the scenes. They are confident but also paranoid. And they are helpful yet manipulative with their clientele—and even their own people. What do they actually do? They are managerial experts, cost cutters, scapegoats, and catalysts for corporate change. They are the businessman's businessmen. They are the corporate Mandarin elite, a private corps, far from prying eyes, doing behind-the-scenes work for the most powerful people in the world. How do they do it? Well, their methods have been compared (by others and by themselves) to the Jesuits, the U.S. Marines, and the Catholic Church. They feel so strongly about themselves that they have insisted on a proper noun where one need not exist. To an outsider, they are a consulting firm.To themselves, simply, The Firm.

But the McKinsey story is even more than all of that. It's also about the rise and reach of American business in the twentieth century—and its remarkable adaptability to changing times. American capitalism may be under stress now, but modern American management technique—which McKinsey has played a part in both creating and disseminating—has distinguished itself as much by its innovative ability as by its sheer might. Today McKinsey is a global success story. But first it was a distinctly American one.

* European Union says ready to provide $15 bln to Ukraine
* Aid in loans and grants for next “couple of years”
* European leaders to meet Ukraine's PM on Thursday
* At summit, EU leaders will discuss measures against Russia (Releads, adds details on amounts to be loaned and how)
By Luke Baker
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Reuters) - The European Union offered a larger than expected package of aid to Ukraine on Wednesday, saying it was willing to provide $15 billion in loans and grants over the next several years to help get the shattered economy back on its feet.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the assistance, to be discussed by European Union leaders at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, would require widespread reforms by the new Ukrainian government and the signing of a deal between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund.
The EU had been expected to come up with a package of short-term assistance worth around 1 or 2 billion euros, but instead presented a more comprehensive programme that perhaps by coincidence matched the amount Russia had offered Ukraine before president Viktor Yanukovich's government collapsed.
“The package combined could bring an overall support of at least 11 billion euros over the next couple of years, from the EU budget and EU-based international financial institutions,” said Barroso. “It is a package designed to assist a committed, inclusive and reforms-oriented Ukrainian government.”
Among the elements is 1.6 billion euros in direct loans and 1.4 billion euros in grants, of which 600 million can be disbursed ove the next two years.
Beyond that, 3 billion will be released from the European Investment Bank between 2014-2016 and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, another EU-related institution, is looking into funding totalling 5 billion euros.
Other money will be raised by leveraging funds available from the EU's Neighbourhood Investment Facility, a fund set up to invest in projects in the EU's neighbouring states.
EU leaders will discuss the aid package with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk who will attend Thursday's summit.
After taking office late last month, Yatseniuk said the country needed $35 billion to survive the next two years. EU officials are currently in Kiev to assess more exactly its needs, which they have indicated are much lower than that.
GAS AND TRADE
While the EU's $15 billion offer is likely to be warmly received in Kiev, it is still contingent on the government striking a deal with the IMF on a longer-term aid package.
After years of bad relations between Ukraine and the IMF, the indications are that an agreement can be struck, although it will still require some harsh economic medicine for Ukraine.
At the same time, the United States is finalising its plans for assistance to Ukraine's new leaders, including around $1 billion of loan guarantees. It has said it will also send technical experts to advise the central bank and finance ministry on how to tackle economic crisis.
Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy after years of financial mismanagement, high energy costs and currency turmoil. The situation has deteriorated further since the overthrow of Yanukovich and the conflict with Russia.
The West has in recent days stepped up efforts to persuade Moscow to pull its forces from Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and avert the risk of a wider conflict.
As well as financial aid, the EU plans to bring forward trade benefits that Ukraine would have received had it signed an association agreement with the EU in November last year. Yanukovich rejected that deal, triggering the protests that led to his overthrow.
The EU says it will also work on providing energy to Ukraine via “reverse flows” of gas from the EU. Currently, Ukraine is almost entirely dependent on imports of Russian gas. By using “reverse flows” the EU can supply Ukraine with gas that it has received from Russia or elsewhere. (Additional reporting by Justyna Pawlak; editing by Ralph Boulton)

Jaime Alguersuari has been working as a summariser for BBC Radio 5 live
Former F1 driver Jaime Alguersuari has been named as an official test driver for tyre supplier Pirelli.
The Spaniard joins ex-Virgin driver Lucas di Grassi in the role.
Alguersuari, a BBC Radio 5 live summariser, was dropped by Toro Rosso in 2011 but hopes the Pirelli role will provide a route back to F1.
Alguersuari's top-10 finishes in 2011 Canadian: 8th
European: 8th
British: 10th
Hungarian: 10th
Italian: 7th
Korean: 7th
Indian: 8th
"I have a huge desire to get behind the wheel of an F1 car again and return to competition so this is a brilliant chance for me," the 22-year-old said.
Alguersuari and Di Grassi will drive a 2010 Renault in four development tests this year that will help Pirelli decide which tyres will be used in the 2013 season.
The tests will take place at Jerez and Circuit de Catalunya in Spain, Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium and Italy's Monza.
Alguersuari joined Toro Rosso in 2009 and, at the age of 19, became the youngest driver in F1 history. He achieved seven top-10 finishes in 2011, but he and fellow driver Sebastien Buemi were dropped in December in favour of Daniel Ricciardo and Jean-Eric Vergne.
Mining for sand extracts a price New demand brings money, jobs, but also potential risks, untold change.
The shale oil and gas exploration boom has created intense demand for high-quality sand, from mines such as this one near Brady operated by Frac Tech.

James Bode's family has lived in Katemcy, a tiny community in Mason County, for more than 100 years.
His grandfather, Arthur Hurley, donated land for the cemetery and aging clapboard church that sit off U.S. 87.
Sheep graze on the family farm; cattle wander in nearby pastures ringed with live oaks. At night, cicadas buzz loudly under an impossibly bright Milky Way.
That bucolic Hill Country setting, however, is about to change dramatically, as the boom in shale oil and gas exploration reaches far beyond the drilling fields.
An oil field services company bought roughly 200 acres in Katemcy, and now seeks to build a massive sand mining and processing operation across the road from Bode's farm, where he and his sister had hoped to retire.
The rolling fields, which abut about a half-dozen other homes, will give way to a 24/7 operation of regular blasting and glaring lights, as deep pits are carved out of the earth and processed sand is hauled away by dozens of trucks every day.
The silica sand shot through the ancient sandstone formations underlying Mason and adjacent McCulloch counties has become an increasingly hot commodity. Used in the hydraulic fracturing process, the hard, round grains prop open fissures in the shale, allowing the oil and gas to be removed.
The amount of industrial sand used in hydraulic fracturing has quadrupled from 2000 to 2009, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Some sand has been mined in McCulloch County for decades, but as shale drilling has increased exponentially, the search for high-quality sand has become intense — and the Hill Country boasts some of the most desirable.
The Katemcy mine would become the sixth in a roughly 20-mile radius; another is seeking permits in McCulloch, and an eighth mine may be opened in nearby Pontotoc, where 750 acres are about to be sold to an undisclosed company.
Five mines are clustered within a few miles of each other near Voca, in southern McCulloch County, where companies have scraped the topsoil off thousands of acres of land to get at the sand below.
Concerned residents of Pontotoc and Katemcy have mobilized, fearing potential air and water contamination, reduced property values and the loss of a way of life that attracted them to this rugged land settled by German immigrants in the 1840s.
The fight has pitted neighbor against neighbor, as some sell their land at a premium to mining companies. They fiercely defend their right to do so and point to the good-paying jobs and increased energy independence they say the domestic oil and gas boom will bring.
The friction isn't limited to Central Texas. Some residents of Cooke County, north of Denton, are fighting efforts by EOG Resources, a large oil and gas company, to build a mine there. Communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin that also sit atop rich veins of silica are struggling to find a balance between the economic activity the mines generate and protecting their roads, water and air.
Driving the dirt roads around Katemcy where the mine will go — one still carries his grandfather's name — Bode points out neighbors who would also be affected by the proposed mine.
He is sick about the possible changes.
"No more peace and quiet, no more stars in the sky," he said, his truck crunching slowly along the edge of the property.
Coated with sand
For Frac Tech Services LLC, which provides hydraulic fracturing services to oil and gas companies, mining its own sand for shale plays such as the Barnett and the Eagle Ford in Texas and the Haynesville, which stretches east into Louisiana, furthers the company's goal of controlling its supply chain.
By 2008, Frac Tech affiliate Proppant Specialists had acquired 1,200 acres near Voca and begun a major operation there. This year, it bought an adjacent 1,360 acres, some of which will be devoted to a plant that coats sand with resin.
About 60 people work at the Voca mine, spokeswoman Pamela Percival said, and an additional 40 or so will be hired at the resin-coating plant. They are good-paying, full-time jobs with benefits, she said.
Living near the mines, though, can be trying.
Jacque Elliott, who shares a property line with one of two plants owned by Carmeuse Industrial Sands, bought her place six years ago. Blasting operations, which have since stopped, were in full swing.
"Even when you're prepared, it's not pleasant," Elliott said. "The whole ground shakes violently."
The dust is a given. She's even painted her house the color of the sand, so the constant coating isn't as obvious.
At night, she said, "it's like a football field, with all the glowing lights."
Still, Elliott remains pragmatic: "It's jobs," she says simply.
She also feels strongly that the country needs to become less dependent on foreign oil, and the shale oil and gas unlocked by the sand mined behind her house helps accomplish that.
"We've all got to make concessions," she said.
Fight over permits
It's unclear who is buying the land in Pontotoc, but Frosty Miller, one of the sellers, said it will probably become a sand mine.
Proppant Specialists is seeking permits for the proposed mine in Katemcy, which will bring about 60 jobs, Percival said, plus an additional $15 million to $20 million to the Mason County tax rolls.
The plant needs an air quality permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and a water pumping permit from Hickory Underground Water Conservation District No. 1.
More than 30 residents have requested a contested hearing from the TCEQ, citing a laundry list of concerns, perhaps most notably over silica dust, which if breathed over a long period can cause silicosis, an ultimately fatal respiratory disease.
Lisa Heath, who lives less than a mile from the proposed plant, is not hopeful. The permitting process, she said, "is a joke, a formality. They don't deny permits."
If the TCEQ grants the hearing, it will be limited to air quality concerns, spokesman Terry Clawson said. Property values, noise, traffic safety and zoning are outside of the commission's jurisdiction.
Proppant has asked the water district for a permit to pump 499 acre-feet per year at the site; that's enough water to serve about 2,000 homes. Residents worry their water quantity and quality could be affected and that the district doesn't have the manpower to properly monitor all the mines.
Manager David Huie said the water district cannot deny a permit but can limit the amount to be pumped. The Katemcy property today allows up to 828 acre-feet a year, he said, for irrigation. The district's board is likely to vote on the permit request Oct. 8.
Proppant, meanwhile, has asked to meet with residents Monday to seek ways to ease their concerns, Percival said.
Water worries
For those in the blink-and-you'll-miss-it village of Pontotoc, water is the biggest concern.
Located on Texas 71 between Llano and Brady, Pontotoc boasts one café, the historic ruins of the San Fernando teacher's acad8emy and a row of turn-of-the-century, hand-hewn sandstone buildings that one landowner is working to turn into a winery, tasting room and live music venue.
Attorney Carl Money grew up in East Texas and doesn't live in Pontotoc full time. But he's restored the Willis House, commissioned in 1872 by the German Emigration Co., and has been growing Spanish-style Tempranillo grapes on the adjacent 5 acres the past several years.
Money is trying to turn the village into a Hill Country destination, but the eastern edge of the land targeted for the sand mine is just a stone's throw away. Who, he worries, will want to sip wine next to a noisy, dusty sand mine?
Pontotoc sits over a fragment of the Hickory aquifer, pinched off from the rest of the formation by a granite outcrop. Connie's Café, the only eatery in town, just had to close up, its shallow well run dry.
"The amount of water to clean all this sand, there are no studies on how it will affect our part of the aquifer," said Money, who has asked the water district to place a moratorium on new permits while it studies the issue.
Huie said he's not sure the district has the authority to do so but is willing to research it. But without a permit request in front of him, he said, "it's all theoretical."
It's not theoretical to Patricia Fleming, who lives with her husband in between the Willis House and the property up for sale. When that and another nearby property are being irrigated, she said, the pressure in her pipes plummets.
"We're afraid they're going to cut off our water," she said, "and we don't even know who it is to go to talk to them about our concerns."
Fleming said she and others are looking into hiring legal representation to guide their fight. She is realistic about their chances to stop the mine but hopes the owners will work to mitigate some of their concerns.
Miller, who along with two others is selling the land in Pontotoc, said he wouldn't do it if he thought it would destroy the village. Like so many families in the area, the Millers have lived and worked the land for generations.
"Listen, it's beautiful and I love it. I made a living off that land. I'm not fired up about having a sand mine," he said. "But I would be a fool not to do what I have the opportunity to do. This deal will help my family for the rest of their lives."
Miller is mostly dismissive of his neighbors' concerns: "Silicosis? Ah, give me a break," he said.
There's plenty of water, he said, though he acknowledged that Pontotoc wells are "terrible" and the aquifer underneath is "pretty marginal."
A real estate agent who markets ranches and other large properties, Miller said that given the interest he's seen from other companies looking for land, the area is likely to see more miners moving in.
Any concessions?
While residents who fear the loss of their way of life gear up to fight new sand mines, others are grateful for the economic activity the existing mines have brought, even as they grapple with the challenges.
They've created perhaps 1,000 good-paying jobs, said McCulloch County Judge Danny Neal, who has watched three new mines open in the past few years, swelling county coffers. But the estimated 500 to 600 heavy trucks a day coming to and from all the mines are tearing up the roads, he said.
County commissioners are now looking to get the sand mining companies to help defray the costs of beefing up the roads.
"It's a challenge, but a good challenge to have," Neal said.
In Greenfield, Wis., residents extracted an agreement from Unimin Corp., which also operates a mine in Voca, to pay the town up to $250,000 a year in user fees, according to news reports.
Neal is talking to other Texas county officials to see what they've done. Early conversations with mine owners, he said, have been positive.
Residents interested in stopping the mines, or at least mitigating the problems, are also looking to see what other communities have done.
Jack Curtis, a manager with Erna Frac Sand, southeast of the Voca cluster, said his company met with residents and ultimately made several concessions. It agreed to drill wells below the shallow water table used by residents, install downward-facing lights and even buy a couple of small properties close to the mine.
It was "a bunch more expensive," Curtis said, "but we were trying to be a good neighbor."

Right now is a terrific time to buy a house in many parts of the U.S. -- if you have outstanding credit and a suitcase full of cash. For most everyone else, the market is increasingly out of reach. Here are four reasons why.
1. Home prices are rising much faster than wages.
(Sources: National Association of Realtors, U.S. Census Bureau)
Historically, home prices and income have followed similar paths. A split began around 2000, when wage growth dropped to near zero, even as home prices began to soar. Since then, median household income growth has muddled along, while home prices have behaved like an addict on a meth bender: climbing to dangerous heights in 2006, crashing through the floor over the next few years, and now rising sharply again.
A recovery from the recent trough benefits many current homeowners, especially those who are underwater (meaning they owe more than their home is worth). But the jump in prices means that homes are becoming increasingly unaffordable.
In the past two years, from January 2012 to January 2014, prices for existing homes (as opposed to newly built homes) gained 18 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors, the source for the home-price data in the chart above. (The data company Core Logic, which uses a broader metric, estimates that prices were up 21.7 percent over this span). Wage and salary growth over the same time period, meanwhile, was 4.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
2. Fannie Mae has dramatically tightened its lending standards.
(Source: Fannie Mae)
Fannie Mae and its smaller cousin Freddie Mac were created to give middle-class Americans greater access to the housing market. But in the wake of a massive taxpayer bailout, the companies tightened up their standards considerably, even as they began to make huge profits. (Combined, they earned a record $133 billion in 2013. They have now dumped more money back into federal coffers than they received.)
Fannie and Freddie don't make mortgage loans directly, but they buy loans from lenders. As such, they set the standards that lenders use to make more than half of all mortgages in the U.S. When they tighten standards, they make low-interest home loans available only to buyers with the best credit.
The average Fannie Mae borrower credit score from 2001 to 2004 was 718, a few points less than the median credit score of all U.S. consumers. In 2013, the average score was 753, which is at the high end of the credit-score range and considered "excellent" by most lenders.
People with lower credit scores can often get a loan from the Federal Housing Authority, but these mortgages are more expensive, and come with higher monthly payments.
3. Fewer homes are listed for sale.
(Source: National Association of Realtors)
People just aren't selling as often as they once did, and new home building slowed dramatically after the financial crash. The number of existing homes on the market accounts for less than five months' worth of sales, according to the NAR, roughly matching the level of inventory before the housing bubble exploded. Tighter inventory may be contributing to wild price swings, too: When fewer homes are for sale, prices are more volatile.
4. Wall Street is in the landlord business.

In some markets, would-be homebuyers are showing up at open houses only to find so-called institutional investors already there, ready to pay cash. The investors are buying up homes, converting them into rentals and then selling those income streams on Wall Street.
The severity of the crash wasn't initially known as he posted, “The checks showed nothing and I just wanted to say that I am fine” on his official website. But it was actually a lot more serious than that. It stopped him from returning to F1 in 2009 to fill Felipe Massa's seat after the Brazilian's shocking accident during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. “What I did learn from it was what my limits were and what I was going to do in the future,” he tells us. “It happened. It was a lesson to me and I guess it's part of the natural learning that you go through in life.” It didn't put him off. He got back on his mechanical horse and continued riding at tracks - even during his second crack at F1 with Mercedes. And that's why he's at Paul Ricard today.
“Today's not about beating anybody.” Says Schumacher. “I just want to hang out with friends. It's not about going out to find that extra tenth of a second, just to go as fast as I feel comfortable. The point whenever I have a doubt, that is my lesson, I ease off completely. I don't even want to try anything that could be exciting as there's no warning or feeling of the limit. The next step is you're down on the ground. And there's no point to being down on the ground.”
A former Texas minister is extradited from New York Wednesday and charged with sexually assaulting a teen nearly 10 years ago. (Dec. 11, 2014)
A former Houston-area minister accused of having sex with a Texas youth group member has been extradited from New York City.
The Harris County Sheriff's Office said 33-year-old Jude Ramdial faces a charge of sexual assault of a child.
Investigators announced Ramdial's return to Houston Wednesday with bond set at $50,000. Online jail records Thursday did not list Ramdial's custody status or details on an attorney for him.
Ramdial was a youth minister at Woodforest Worship Center Church of God in Channelview. The sexual abuse investigation goes back to 2005 and a then-15-year-old girl, who recently reported the alleged abuse. Authorities are seeking other possible victims in Texas.
Ramdial had been a pastor with Hope NYC church, which he helped establish. He was arrested last month.

The beer is brewed with Old Bisbee Roasters' organic Nicaraguan coffee, making it a good pick-me-up kind of drink. According to the brewery, the Sexy Beast name comes from the drink's unique body.The Baja Arizona brewery, which opened a little over a year ago, will also be releasing their flagship strong pale ale in bottles within the next few weeks.In a statement, Beast Brewing owner Amanda Gibson said that while the bottles will help keep up with demand, she also hopes it will increase the brewery's steadily growing fan base.“Bringing bottles to Beast Brewing means we can reach that many more fans," Gibson said. "Bottles allow us to break into more accounts and give our fans the chance to bring our beer home to enjoy and share with friends, making us more of a household name. “You can find bottles of Beast Brewing's Sexy Beast coffee stout beginning Thursday at the three Tucson Whole Foods Market locations: 3360 E. Speedway Blvd., 5555 E. River Road and 7133 N. Oracle Road.
Leung has found lots of irregularities with USB Type-C cables -- he was the one that uncovered the OnePlus 2's fast-charging flaw -- but this is the first time that a manufacturer has got things so catastrophically wrong. It turns out that two wires inside the cable were soldered sloppily to the wrong connectors, which resulted in high-voltage power being delivered to the wrong place. Further analysis showed that the advertised SuperSpeed cables were missing entirely, and a 10 kΩ resistor was used instead of the 56 kΩ resistor the spec calls for. Needless to say, by the time the checks were done all of Leung's testing equipment was fried. And that means, for the time being at least, no more safety checks are inbound.
So what's an unnerved cable-buyer to do? Well, you could always buy branded cables from a reputable manufacturer, but that obviously comes at an expense. If you'd prefer something cheaper, Leung has tested a lot of cables already, so you can browse his Amazon reviews page if you're in the market for a new one.
Update: Good news! Benson was able to repair one of his testing devices, so they review will go on, sort of. He'll still be able to do negative reviews of cables that are definitely not up to spec, but will need a laptop to test advanced features like whether or not they can properly charge the Pixel at 2.4a.
The Mozilla Labs team recently posted about a new personalization initiative for Firefox, which fits into the larger “Personalization with Respect” aspiration that Jay Sullivan articulated in May. We want to give individuals more participation in their Web interactions so they can more easily get what they want, in a clearly defined way. This idea is gaining traction with leading publishers and marketers who see their craft as providing valuable, engaging and content-rich experiences to their audiences.
Our goal with UP (User Personalization) and other innovations in this area is to increase the quality of the user experience. In order to accomplish this, interactions must provide consumers with options on how much and which types of information to disclose in order to get the most relevant content and services on the Web. One recent example is The Guardian giving users the option to turn off coverage of the Royal Baby on their website. This encourages and allows them to participate in the content exchange based on their personal interests.
We also assume that nothing is really “free.” Good content has a “cost,” it doesn't magically appear. The cost may be underwritten by ads or subscriptions, other innovative models, or it might come in the form of user interaction or engagement. Bad content also has a cost. It reduces engagement, CPMs, and the overall value of the net. Poor user experiences that lack transparency also reduce engagement and diminish the value for all stakeholders.
We want this ecosystem of content creators and service providers to flourish at all levels. Best summed up by marketing guru, Jon Bond, “the value generated by the ‘net for both brands and publishers can be traced directly to the value of the user experience, and by enhancing that the economic power of the Web increases.”
The challenge is that today, the trade-off for users is often implicit and unclear, and few people really understand the value proposition behind the free content and services that they consume. The impression that there may be something not entirely above board happening to a user's personal data comes from the lack of transparency in the current system. This can damage the essential trust between the consumer and publishers, brands and service providers. The real currency here is trust, not CPMs, or eyeballs, or click-throughs.
Our exploration into personalization is an attempt to help consumers get the most relevant content, at the right time, in a way that makes them feel comfortable by incorporating transparency and choice.
To test this proposition, we talked to a wide range of stakeholders including users, publishers, brands, ad tech providers, developers, and privacy advocates. The responses so far suggest that the ecosystem would welcome better intent and interest signals combined with active user participation.
Jean-Paul Schmetz, Chief Scientist at Hubert Burda Media, a major German publisher, said that “Mozilla's proposed interests API gives us a clear signal of the user's interests in a way that respects their privacy and choices, and we're excited to test it out across the Burda network of websites.”
Terry Kawaja, creator of the famed LUMAscape, suggested “this could yield an alternative ecosystem powered by consumer preferences and conscious choices, versus one based on invisible tracking in which the consumer has no conscious choices. It would also level the playing field by making interest and intent signals equally available to the digital supply ecosystem on the same terms.”
Jim Spanfeller, publisher of the TheDailyMeal.com and TheActiveTimes.com and the former IAB Chairman, said: “In many ways this will help move the idea of content and experience personalization radically forward in a very consumer-safe way, giving end users a better experience by facilitating the ability of content providers to shape their on-page offerings to the end users' interests.”
Similarly, Dan Auerbach, Staff Technologist at EFF, thinks this is a welcome advance: “Projects like Mozilla's User Personalization are a big step forward for re-designing personalization on the Web in a way that protects user privacy.”
While this is all good conceptually, there's still much to be done. As the Labs post indicated, we are currently in an experimental phase and there are lots of assumptions that need to be tested. Upcoming tests will provide further insights and of course we will adjust over time. All in all, we think this is a promising solution to satisfy both individuals' and publishers' needs, in a way that creates a better, more transparent and more valuable Web experience.
Judge Posner Rips Apart Apple's Patent Litigation Strategy: Being 'Really Annoyed' Is No Reason To Sue
from the get-out-of-court dept
It's not as if nominal damages were compensation for a nominal harm. They are a symbolic recognition of a wrong that produced no harm, though it may have infringed a right. You can't go into federal court and say you had a contract with X and X broke it and you're really annoyed even though you sustained no injury of any sort (in fact you made money because you're contracted at a higher price) so please give me a judgment for $1 that I can pin on my wall.
“Going for broke” is the inescapable characterization of Motorola's damages claim. Motorola claims to be entitled to a minimum royalty of 2.25 percent for a license for the patents in the portfolio that contains the ‘898. Though it's the only patent in the portfolio that remains in this suit, Motorola claims to be entitled to damages equal to (or “up to,” or “at least”—it seems not to have made up its mind) 40 to 50 percent of 2.25 percent, which would be 0.9 to 1.125 percent of sales of Apple devices that infringe the ‘898.
The problem is not that damages cannot be calculated, but that on the eve of trial, with the record closed, it became apparent that the parties had failed to make a responsible calculation.
Apple is not a “small company”; its market capitalization exceeds that of Google and Microsoft combined. To suggest that it has suffered loss of market share, brand recognition, or customer goodwill as a result of Motorola's alleged infringement of the patent claims still in play in this case is wild conjecture.
In its latest written and oral submissions Apple attempts what I told its legal team at a pretrial conference I would not let it do in the liability trials then envisaged: turn the case into an Apple versus Motorola popularity contest. Apple wanted me to allow into evidence media reports attesting to what a terrific product the iPhone is. I said I would not permit this because the quality of the iPhone (and of related Apple products, primarily the iPad) and consumers' regard for it have, so far as the record shows, nothing to do with the handful of patent claims that I had ruled presented triable issues of infringement. Apple's “feel good” theory does not indicate that infringement of these claims (if they were infringed) reduced Apple's sales or market share, or impaired consumer goodwill toward Apple products.
The notion that these minor-seeming infringements have cost Apple market share and consumer goodwill is implausible, has virtually no support in the record, and so fails to indicate that the benefits to Apple from an injunction would exceed the costs to Motorola. An injunction that imposes greater costs on the defendant than it confers benefits on the plaintiff reduces net social welfare.
A few weeks ago, we wrote about influential appeals court Judge Richard Posner, who was slumming it down in a district court for fun (appeals court judges do that sometimes) and gave a brief statement about his plans to dismiss a major patent lawsuit between Apple and Motorola Mobility (now owned by Google). The patent dispute was over smartphones, so given the Google/Apple battle, it was seen as a fight over whether or not Apple's iPhone-related patents might stop Android. After Posner initial announcement, Apple sought a further chance to convince Posner he was wrong, leading to a followup. However, late last week, Posner came out with his full ruling (embedded below) and it's pretty devastating.The ruling itself is a bit technical, but basically, the companies did a horrible job trying to show any "damages," so Posner noted that the evidence on damages was inadmissable, but without that, what kind of case is there? Apple then tried to claim that they should be able to get "nominal damages," which is basically a tiny (meaningless) sum of money because there was no clear actual damages (or any statutory damages), but a "wrong" was still committed. In other words, Apple really really badly just wanted the court to say that Motorola infringed, even if it meant getting a dollar for it. Posner, while noting that there can be nominal damagesby a judge, it makes absolutely no sense to-- and thus chastised Apple:Motorola, for its part, doesn't get off easy either. Its own damages expert (on its counterclaim) made some outrageous claims that Posner calls out as well, including a ridiculous claim that a single patent taking out of a much larger portfolio could get a license of "up to" 40 or 50% of the entire portfolio. Posner mocks the use of "up to" noting that it "covers a lot of ground." Then, Motorola's "expert" tries to change his story, claiming40 to 50%. Posner notes that this is just as vague, but now vague on the upside, rather than down, and then chides the expert for giving no actual basis for this estimate, before bringing it back around to the obvious real reason for the crazy damages estimate:Finally, with both sets of damages requests dismissed, there's the question of injunctive relief (blocking each other from making the product). There again, Posner finds the whole thing to be a waste of time. He goes back to the fact that both companies totally failed in putting forth reasonable damages claims, saying that it's not that it's impossible to do so, just that these companies went too far:He goes on to mock Apple's claim that it was losing marketshare to Motorola, noting that even if he granted an injunction, it would be so easy to change Motorola's smartphones to avoid infringement that it would have no impact on Apple's dwindling smartphone marketshare. He also points out that the "value" of most tech patents are really to be used defensively, rather than offensively, and suggests that it's silly to be fighting over such small pieces of the smartphone ecosystem. Basically, letting either party win is pointless, saying it would create a "windfall" for the other side.Continuing in this vein, Posner again mocks Apple's claim that its brand recognition and goodwill suffered from this competition, relying on a case that focused on a small company that faced such troubles. Posner notes the ridiculousness of Apple using a ruling designed to protect a small company here:And then notes that Apple seemed to want to turn this into a show trial about how people love the iPhone:As Posner notes, Apple may have suffered harm from having to compete against Motorola, but that "harm is a perfectly legal one" unrelated to the specific patents in question.In the end, he dismisses the case with prejudice (so they can't just refile it), arguing that to do otherwise would just give the companies a second shot at trying again to prove damages.

New Delhi: Globally acclaimed economist Jagdish Bhagwati today said demonetisation will promote growth while Amartya Sen and other experts who denounced it stand "humiliated and exposed".
"On the effects of demonetisation on growth, I should say that I was the one economist who had argued (with my co-authors), from first principles, that demonetisation would increase, not diminish, growth," he said.
"And that is exactly what appears to have happened," he said further.
"The Prime Minister's success in Uttar Pradesh has therefore meant that Amartya Sen and his friends who argued that demonetisation would hurt growth, have been humiliated and exposed as much as the Congress," Bhagwati told PTI in an email interview.
He is a professor of Economics, Law, and International Relations at the Columbia University.
"After BJP's victory in Uttar Pradesh, indeed Prime Minister Narendra Modi is now in an even stronger position than when he was first elected resoundingly," Bhagwati said.
He also said that three things ought to be noted that made (Prime Minister Narendra Modi's) current position 'unassailable'.
"First, he has finally decimated the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty, so the Congress is not merely on the ropes; they also lack currently anyone of stature who can rescue it from oblivion," he said.
Second, the Muslim vote no longer is a monolithic anti-BJP vote, Bhagwati said, adding, "I suppose that while BJP did not field Muslim candidates in the Uttar Pradesh
election, surely Muslims were aware that the propaganda that Prime Minister Modi was anti-Muslim was an outrageous lie."
Noting that Modi has appointed a brilliant Muslim, ambassador Syed Akbaruddin to the United Nations as our representative, India's best journalist M J Akbar is in his
team also, and the new ambassador to the United States is a Sikh of great distinction, Bhagwati said, "India's diversity is thus manifest in Prime Minister Modi's approach to governance."
Referring to Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen's assertion that demonetisation was a 'despotic act', the eminent economist said, "Not knowing finance, he (Amartya Sen) made the mistake of taking the strange position that the demonetisation action was 'despotic'".
"But Sen seemed eager to rush quickly into the fray: here perhaps was his chance to 'get' at the Prime Minister, whom he had long denounced but without success," he said.
"Like Sen, I was also not an expert on finance but I had taken my time and educated myself and I paired myself with finance experts so I would not make a fool of myself."
"Unfortunately, with Sen and me on opposite sides on the demonetisation issue, many in the press seemed to seize on this coincidence and try a repeat of the old controversy, they had conjured up between Sen and me over the issue of the efficacy of growth in reducing poverty," Bhagwati said.
"He (Sen) had lost that time around, flipping from a 'growth does not matter' to 'I always argued for growth' position," the eminent economist said, adding, "Here was his chance to get both me and the Prime Minister, a double dividend."

Among the journalists I know covering Syria, almost everyone is swearing off crossing the border and going inside the country. It's not the threat of violence that's stopping people, but the risk of kidnapping.
Working in Syria during the war has always been dangerous. Since March 2011, the conflict has claimed the lives of at least 24 journalists and 60 citizen journalists. But for those working inside, there were ways to limit exposure to violence and there was relative comfort in knowing that you could trust the people around you. In opposition-controlled areas, Syrians wanted the outside world to hear their story and many locals went to great lengths to protect and welcome foreign reporters.
Nearly two and a half years into the war, all of that has changed. In northern Syria, the country has fallen into economic ruin and hardcore jihadist groups, many with foreign ties, have proliferated. These two factors have created an environment ripe for kidnapping. Those desperate for cash are willing to abduct people for ransom or to sell them to extremist groups willing to pay for a foreign hostage.
Last Wednesday, armed men abducted Polish journalist Marcin Suder. According to media reports, militants took Mr. Suder from a media office in Idlib. An activist at the media center intervened in an attempt to stop the kidnappers, but he was beaten and hospitalized.
Even just several months ago, the abduction of a foreign reporter under these circumstances would have been unheard of, but kidnappings like Suder's are rapidly undoing the idea that “safe houses” can exist in a place like Syria.
While some of the kidnappings appear to be conducted by criminal groups looking to make money, there are indications that groups with links to Al Qaeda or other extremist groups are now looking to kidnap people for potentially much more complex, political reasons. If this trend develops, it will drastically reduce the risk of foreigners surviving a kidnapping.
Already, Syrians throughout the north are suffering a rash of kidnappings. During my last visit there in late April and early May, I met one man who knew of eight people on his block who'd been kidnapped in recent months and he'd personally witnessed four of the abductions.
According to Reporters Without Borders, at least 15 foreign journalists have been kidnapped or gone missing inside Syria since the conflict began.
That figure likely does not include a number of incidents, like one that happened to me last November. Several other reporters and I were driving through an area of Aleppo that was firmly under opposition control when a car cut us off, gunmen surrounded our car, took our driver, and brought us back to their base for several hours. Eventually, they released us, claiming to have rescued us from another kidnapping attempt. They would not tell us who they were, what rebel group they belonged to, or even if they were Syrians.
I've heard a number of stories about reporters who experienced brief abductions like mine, but who were released within several hours. The kidnappings now taking place appear to be of a much more serious and dangerous nature. With at least 1,200 different opposition factions, controlling the various groups, or simply understanding who is a legitimate rebel military group or a criminal group will become exceedingly difficult.

Even those who travel to northern Syria without experiencing any close calls, often leave saying they're unwilling to return because they feel unsafe due to the massive number of foreign fighters and jihadists.
More than making it difficult, if not impossible for journalists to deliver on-the-ground reporting on one of the most brutal wars in decades, the cause of the problem is one that can only spell a dark and troubled future for Syria.
WAWONA, Calif. (AP) — Rangers at Yosemite National Park have alerted a small community about a wildfire that crews are struggling to contain as they fight it from the air and ground, officials said Monday.
Flames have come within 2 miles (3 kilometers) of Wawona, a tiny community near the park's south entrance that swells this time of year with up to 2,000 visitors attending a church camp and renting cabins around a market and small library.
A lightning strike in recent weeks may be to blame for the blaze that erupted into a wildfire on Sunday afternoon, Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman said.
It has burned 1.4 square miles (2.6 square kilometers) of wilderness and pine forests 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Fresno. Firefighters do not have the flames' boundary contained, the National Park Service reported.
It is burning through forest thick with trees killed during California's recent five-year drought that weakened trees, leaving many vulnerable to a beetle infestation, officials reported.
No campgrounds or popular Yosemite destinations have been closed due to the blaze, and rangers have not ordered anyone to leave Wawona.
"We've been out notifying residences and businesses," he said, adding that smoke from the fire has blown into Yosemite Valley, causing hazy air.
Farther south in California, crews saved several homes as a wildfire roared on hillsides near the University of California, Riverside. It was 30 percent contained Monday. Officials previously reported 44 percent containment but revised the figure after a daylight survey.
Evacuation orders were lifted after firefighters beat back the flames with help from retardant-dropping aircraft.
The fire, which broke out Sunday in the foothills of Box Springs Mountain, has scorched about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers) of dry brush.
WASHINGTON
About 2,200 individuals have been identified to be vetted for a train-equip program to help Syrian opposition fighters in the campaign against Daesh, the U.S. said Friday.
"We've begun the pre-screening process of compiling biographical data on more than 400 of these potential recruits," Pentagon spokeswoman Elissa Smith told The Anadolu Agency.
The Pentagon said in February that it had identified 1,200 opposition fighters to be vetted. The U.S. has added 1,000 in one month time.
Commander of the American Special Operations Forces in the Middle East, Maj. Gen. Michael Nagata, and his team, have been working to select and screen members of moderate Syrian opposition groups for the program.
The effort to train Syrian opposition groups is part of an overall campaign to defeat Daesh militants who have seized large swaths of Syria and Iraq since last year June.
Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey agreed to help opposition groups not only fight Daesh but to also battle the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad.
While the agreement with Saudi Arabia and Qataris is still being worked out, the U.S. and Turkey signed an agreement Feb. 17 on the program in which up to 1,000 U.S. troops will take particiape in the training.
According to the Pentagon, several hundred U.S. troops will take part in the training. The remainder will be deployed as force protection, intelligence support and enablers.
Listen to the author read Homosexual Marriage and the New Black Panthers
It was like a head feint in a boxing match. In the past couple of weeks, we've been fixated on this sudden explosion of loathsome New Black Panther videos on the Internet. Then, all of a sudden–BAM–out of left field here comes the ruling by U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro in Boston shooting down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Well, ain't that just swell?!
The Defense of Marriage Act was passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate in 1996 during Bill Clinton's administration. It defined marriage as being between one man and one woman for federal purposes. This was to set the standard at the federal level in regard to benefits and such, but it still left the states free to determine their own laws on marriage (with the exception of polygamy, which was ruled unconstitutional before Utah could become a state).
It's a terrible shame that such a common sense truth would have to be “defined” by the courts at all! There are only a handful of states that have declared homosexual “marriage” to be valid, but that's not because the people of those states voted on it. No. Those states have passed by judicial fiat the rulings which go against not just God's design and the natural order of the entire history of the world, but also against the will of the vast majority of the people in our country and those various states. Every state where homosexual “marriage” has been put up for a vote by the people, it has been soundly and rightly rejected.
On a positive note, the Family Research Council reports that this clearly bad ruling will likely be overturned on appeal. Please Lord!
So, what on earth does the radical, pro-homosexual, activist judiciary have to do with the despicable Black Panthers? Plenty. Both despise the truth of God's Word. Both are part of the enemy within America. Both are focused on tearing down America's Constitution, traditions and way of life, and in the case of the Black Panthers, our very life itself. You have by now, no doubt, heard the detestable street rantings of the Black Panther whose alias is Shazam, or some such nonsense, when he so eloquently stated,
“You want freedom? You gonna have to kill some crackers! You gonna have to kill some of they baby!”
How ignorantly insane! How is this goon any different than the Islamist goons who call for the murder of all infidels? They're not different, and both the Islamists and the Black Panthers are allowed to stand on American streets and shout their murderous trash with impunity. How long do you suppose a white man could stand on a street with a megaphone and call for the murder of black people and their babies before he would be arrested by police and then hauled into court by the quislings of the ACLU? Yeah.
This same guy is one of the Black Panthers who should be in prison for engaging in voter intimidation at a Philadelphia polling place during the 2008 presidential election. But the “Justice” Department, under the contemptible Eric Holder, inexplicably dismissed the open-and-shut case. This is an outrage, and it's not something we should see in America–maybe in a third-world country's court system, but not here. I guess this is what the Black Panther meant when he was spouting his garbage at the polling place, telling white voters they would know what it's like to be ruled by the black man. Now, it's payback time. Now, the left-wing black and homosexual activists appointed by Obama are going to show the white man how it feels to be denied his basic rights, like the right to approach a polling place in America free from harassment and intimidation.
The current administration in Washington has set us way back in our race relations–or perhaps they've only exposed the hidden agenda of the left that was there all along, but unknown to us. Maybe it's not so much that they've set us back, but that they're dragging us to a new place. They've created a crawl space beneath the all-time low of American race relations. This deep of a divide has surely not been seen since the Civil War.
And now we have the Black Panthers spoiling for a civil race war in America. These hateful ingrates, who have all the opportunity the world has to offer here in America, rather than contributing something positive and uplifting to their families and country, instead choose to devote their lives to infecting other weak minds with the venom of their ignorant and bigoted hatred for white people. I keep thinking back to the Islamists. It's the same vicious hatred–irrational, malevolent and mindless. It's also the same hatred we saw out of the militant homosexual activists who flew into fits of psychotic rage after California voters passed the Proposition 8 amendment to the state constitution defining marriage as being between a man and a woman. We're still waiting to see if the California Supreme Court will uphold the will of the people, or once again, spit in the people's face and rule with the small minority of perverts in the state, who insist that the rest of the state's residents validate and codify in law their twisted lifestyle choice.
I don't see how any of these ends well. I don't mean to be a downer here, but the forces of evil are so deeply entrenched in our country that it will literally take an act of God to keep us from falling, and I'm surely praying for that very thing, even though that's a scary prayer to pray. Be careful what you pray for, you just may get it!
Those of us who are Christians know that these wicked things must be, as we pass through the last days of our world, but it's really, really hard to watch your own country fall to the enemy within. We've read our history, and we know that countless people before us have watched as their countries have fallen to enemies, usually from without, but sometimes from within. It's a whole different ballgame when it's your own country and not some distant history printed on the pages of a book.
Of course, it ain't over yet, and just because the current time is bleak, does not at all mean that we will give up fighting for what's right in America. No way! The more hellish, unconstitutional, against the will of the people, un-American attacks these usurpers in Washington pull on us, the deeper my rage at them becomes, and the deeper my resolve to see them removed from their high places of power.

A 15-year-old Cranbrook student has been charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child over the alleged video-taped rape of a 15-year-old girl. Courtesy: 7 News
OPINION
STUDENTS at a Sydney high school who shared a video of a fellow classmate allegedly raping an unconscious teenage girl at a party could face charges under child pornography legislation.
A 15-year-old Cranbrook Grammar student has been charged with sexual assault, while a Rose Bay Secondary College student has pleaded not guilty to making and distributing footage of the attack.
Both are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence and I make no comment about their involvement in the case.
Under current laws anyone who forwarded the video could also potentially be charged under child pornography legislation, because both the teenage girl and the alleged perpetrator were under the age of 18.
And so they should.
Any person who films a rape or distributes a video of a rape being committed should be charged with a crime, regardless of how old that victim is.
I've worked with other young women who have experienced this kind of victimisation. And what they go through is horrific. I've heard it described as “a never ending assault”, “a virtual gang rape” or “a gang rape by proxy”.
Indeed, when rapes are filmed, the process of recovery is that much more difficult for the victim, precisely because the sense of violation is unending. The event can never be contained, and for the rest of that victim's life she or he will live with the knowledge that other people may be recruited to witness — and thus participate in — their humiliation, degradation, powerlessness and shame.
Psychologically, the victim can feel arrested in time — stuck in a dehumanised state, while a growing audience amasses around them.
In discussing other cases where teenage rape victims have had their assaults filmed, Dr Anastasia Powell from RMIT University says that “victims describe feeling doubly-violated, shamed and humiliated … Even walking down the street becomes a traumatic experience with victims saying that they just do not know who or how many people may have seen those images, and they fear that someone will recognise them in the street.”
According to Dr Powell, another devastating element for a victim of filmed sexual assault, is that once a video is released the rape “has no finality”.
“There is no end point to the assault. It's unending. Victims simply have no way of knowing who has and hasn't seen the video, so everywhere they go becomes unsafe … It's not just an ‘add on' to the assault. It's like a second assault.”
According to Powell, there is a disturbing culture emerging around such videos, where “images of sexual assault are deliberately being taken and distributed as a way to increase a man's status within their peer group” and to “signal a particular form of masculine dominance or status”.
These videos then serve as “reminders”, “trophy videos” or “scorecards” which memorialise both the abuse, and the perpetrators' domination and control. They then become the gateway through which other male students and teen boys can join-in the rape and be socialised into rape culture.
Which is precisely why anyone who aids and abets these perpetrators by sharing such a video, can and should be charged. In cases where the victim is under the age of 18, they can also be charged under specific child pornography legislation.
So what are schools and parents doing to address these issues?
In light of the distrubing report this week about the alleged rape by a student from Cranbrook, neighbouring Scots College school sent home a letter to all parents urging them to discuss the issues with their students, and informing them that a special assembly had been hosted to discuss the matter at school.
By contrast, Cranbrook Grammar sent home a letter to parents distancing the school from events, stating that “we are not able to disclose further details at this stage” except to say that “this incident did not occur on school grounds”.
Did not occur on school grounds? So what!
A school's culture extends well beyond its school gates and, it should be noted, this is not an isolated incident at Cranbrook.
In 2013, two Year Nine students aged 15 from Cranbrook Grammar allegedly sexually penetrated a heavily intoxicated Year 8 girl at a party while a third male student reportedly filmed the act on his smartphone.
Three months after that incident, three Year Eight Cranbrook students were “encouraged to leave” the school, after they met with a 14-year-old girl on the grounds of Bronte Public School where they allegedly took turns engaging in sexual acts with her.
So what is the school doing to achieve cultural change?
While parents play a significant role, school environments set the culture that students are immersed in and they must address issues such as consent, respect for girls, bystander behaviour, and sexual assault within teen relationships.
Talking about or blaming social media and digital technology is not the answer. After all, the problem is not just the smartphones in their hands, it's the attitudes in their heads.

After listening to a great talk issued by Lighthouse Catholic Media's new young adult line, Truth be Told, I found myself greatly in need of an emotional chastity makeover. The talk, entitled “Why Do Women Do That?” and given by Lisa Cotter, examined the way a woman's mind works, how men should best respond, and why it is so important for men to help women remain emotionally chaste- both for the sake of their relationships, and for each individual's personal growth.
After doing some research and some thinking, I've compiled this list of how to jumpstart this emotional chastity makeover, for myself and for others out there who- like me- feels it's time to give up mentally stalking guys and to start mentally focusing on Christ. This list works in a backwards fashion- so the numbered items are what NOT to do, and the blurb below each goes into why the particular activity will hurt you, and how to do the opposite instead. Gentlemen, though these five points are aimed at the ladies, I hope you will read along in order to gain insight into how the women around you operate.
Once you have this insight, you will be better equipped to understand your sisters, friends, or girlfriends, and thus be able to help them along their paths to holiness. In order to help you guys out, at the end of each point there is a bold sentence in italics, giving you gentlemen tips on what you can do to help the ladies with each particular temptation/struggle. So, without further ado, here's the list:
TO GROW IN EMOTIONAL CHASTITY, DO NOT:
#1: Dream of Guys All Day
After reading that heading, many of you may be thinking- “All day, that's a long time. There's no way I dream of guys all day. She must really have some issues!” Well- stop and think for a minute. I'm not talking about the daydreaming which includes pairing your favorite kids names with your latest crush's last name, I'm talking about the fleeting, wistful thoughts which enter into your mind as you come into contact with various guys throughout the day- thoughts which are not bad, but which can escalate into a problem when dwelled upon.
It can happen in a split second. You go to see a movie with friends, and as the handsome actor comes on screen, you find yourself wondering how old he is, whether or not he has a girlfriend, and what your chances are of becoming that girlfriend. Or, as you're running into the library, the guy ahead of you turns around and opens the door for you before entering himself, and as you flash him your best smile, you find yourself worrying about how you look, and if Mr. Doorman has continued to follow you because he likes you, or because you're both headed for the same section (which would be romantic also!).
Little things like this, which spark and die within five minutes as the movie plot thickens or the bookshelves become daunting, hardly qualify as “all day” time wasters, but if four or five of such bursts of excitement happen in one day, than the majority of your mental reflections can unintentionally become boy-centered. No, there is nothing wrong with noticing a man's attractive nature, or hoping to date one of these attractive men one day. But dreaming of men who you hardly know for short bursts can quickly grow into a time-consuming habit.
In order to conquer this, do learn to see men as potential friends first, instead of viewing every single individual as a candidate for courtship.
And gents, do not be constant flirts. Giving girls flirtatious attention all the time only encourages her fleeting hopes, leading her to believe that you care about her much more than you actually might.
#2: Allow Yourself an Exception
So, you decide that today is the day the “new you” is going to emerge, and you start the day in the adoration chapel just to prove to yourself that you are going to focus on God first today. You get ready and applaud yourself for showering, dressing, and doing your make-up without even thinking about that adorable actor from the movie last night, or the attractive concessions cashier. You walk to class and manage to smile and nod at several male classmates without blinking twice, and once you sit down in your first period class, you are feeling great. And then HE walks in, “HE” being the incredibly handsome Ryan Gosling look-a-like who just transferred into your class last week.
As you watch him walk to his seat, his gaze falls on you and he smiles before turning away. And then all of your good intentions are forgotten, and you don't even hear a word of the history lesson because you're too busy convincing yourself that Mr. Handsome's smile was an indication that he really does like you. This is the danger of allowing yourself an exception. You tell yourself that since this guy is a good Catholic, does charity work, and is a top-notch student that it's okay to dream about him, because unlike the other guys you encountered today, he would actually be a good guy to date, and maybe one day marry. But this can be even more dangerous.
This is when the light musings turn into serious emotional commitments. If you become an expert at avoiding romantic daydreams with all but one guy- but you've already planned the wedding, named the children, and picked out the house you're going to have with that one exception, you could not only be missing the other great guys surrounding you, but also turning off the guy you want the most, for once a girl is this emotionally invested in a guy, it is hard for her to sit back and allow him to be the pursuer.
In order to avoid this, be open-minded, and (as Lisa said) don't pick the house until you've bought a ring.
Gentlemen, this goes for you as well. Avoid discussing the deep, personal topics concerning hopes for the future until you've been with a girl for a while, whether as a friend or a date. The more of her heart a girl shares, the more she trusts and comes to depend on the guy she's sharing it with. Just as the physical side of a relationship must proceed slowly, so must the emotional side. Though this doesn't mean you have to talk about the weather for the first six months you know each other, it does mean taking precautions to avoid vulnerable situations which could lead further than intended.
#3: Neglect the Discernment Process
Lately the word “discernment” has been appearing frequently in Catholic circles, often in connection with the religious life. Pamphlets about discerning the priesthood or discerning a convent are becoming commonplace at Catholic parishes and events. Did you know that the discernment process is not the time in which you decide which religious community to join, but the time in which you decide if you are called to be a consecrated religious or a married spouse? Yes, discerning one's vocation actually means praying and meditating on which path God wants you to take: the religious path, the consecrated laity path, or the marriage path.
How do you do this? Fr. Mike Schmitz lays out three easy steps, and two conditions, to follow when discerning. The two conditions are: 1. know that God loves you more than you love yourself, knows you better than anyone, and wants the best for you; 2. remember that God wants you to discover your vocation, and is not going to play hide-and-seek with you- He may not reveal it to you right away, but if you're patient, it will become clear to you.
Now, what to do: step number one: Be in a state of grace, and if you're not there- get there! Staying plugged into God's grace only makes it easier for Him to reach you, because you are already open to His urgings.
Step two: do your daily duties. This one is particularly important to remember. If you are a student, go to class, do your homework. If you have a job, be at work on time, do your assignments well. Discerning your vocation is not an excuse to drop everything that is expected of you, everything which you are supposed to do, declare “God told me I had to discern first”. He has placed you in each situation for a reason, and it is your duty to bloom where you are planted. Of course, if you have overloaded your plate or are in a situation which is not wholesome, prayerfully consider what you must do to either balance out your schedule or drop the immoral activities so as to center your life around Him.
Step three: pray. Just start with fifteen to twenty minutes a day, kneel down and say ask God what his will is for you, and then listen. If you've spent time quietly awaiting Him, and do not feel any urgings or indications to pursue or look into one path as a possibility, simply say “God, I understand that today is not the day for me to know, help me to do Your will today, and stay with me as I continue this process”. If you do these things, Fr. Schmitz says, your vocation will become clear to you- until then, don't worry.
Do not determine your calling without asking God first, and do not spend your time fretting about why you haven't found your vocation- as Padre Pio said: “Pray, Hope, and Don't Worry”.
Gentlemen, the exact same process works for you as well. Do not decide on a Roman collar or a wedding ring until you've asked God's opinion first.
#4: Fill the void with Taylor Swift and Meg Ryan movies
As Lisa points out- there is nothing wrong with love songs or chick flicks; what is wrong is turning to these things as emotional escapes from loneliness, depression, or boredom. “Only boring people become bored”, Lisa states, so watch yourself! If your longing to be loved leads you to eat way too much chocolate while obsessively watching Sleepless in Seattle, then you're looking for satisfaction in the wrong place.
Make prayer your first-line relief tactic, and then go do something to get your mind off of your sad thoughts, instead of doing something which will only deepen them later. Doing something active outside is always a good idea; you could also read a new book, or revisit an old favorite, take up a new craft, finish that science paper a day early, play with your little siblings, redecorate your bedroom or dorm, make cookies, start a garden- the list is endless!
Though at first these options may pale in comparison to crying over a Nicolas Sparks film, you will feel so much better afterwards. Songs also have a powerful impact on us. I don't know about you, but after belting out with some of Josh Groban's greatest hits, I'm ready to fall in love with the next guy who walks in the door. If there are certain romantic songs which you know trigger you, which leave you in a discontented mood and can make you long for things which God has not yet given you, it may be a good idea to fast from them for a while. Not every love song will have this effect on you, but we all have our weaknesses- and while you are in the thick of trying to regain your emotional chastity, taking these off of the playlist would be a good idea. Save them for when you actually have a fiancé to associate them with- or at least for a time when your heart has become stronger in Christ.
Avoid turning to Hollywood for temporary satisfaction, and learn to lean on Christ in moments of weakness.
Guys, keep in mind that sweet words impact a girl heavily. As Jason Evert says, just as guys are affected by what they see, girls are affected by what they hear. Do not pour sugar-coated phrases and lovely lines out to a girl you are not serious about; it's not fair to her.
#5: Pretend like Everything's Okay
Too often we refuse to consider that we could be the ones with the problem. We read post after post about others trying to amend their lives- and maybe because our problems are not as extreme, we think we're all right. It is hard and it is painful to really look at ourselves through honest eyes and acknowledge our need for change.
For those of you who found yourselves laughing nervously at some of the situations described above, first know that I am not condemning you; I am nervously laughing with you and I am also calling you, as Christ called me, to start over and to change things for the better. Maybe your problem is more serious than this. Maybe a bad break-up has left you heartbroken, or maybe your struggle with daydreams led to something more extreme like a pornography addiction (which both men and women struggle with) or a promiscuous life. Know that there is hope for you to begin again, and that God will always love you and is ready to forgive you. There are a plethora of resources available to those of you who are struggling (I've included some in the links offered for each category above), maybe without anyone else even knowing.
Don't let your fear of the difficult journey keep you from seeking the peace and joy at the end, take the bull by the horns and do whatever you must to finally reach that self-contentment and strong faith which come with denying yourself for Christ's sake.
Gentlemen, you also need to take courage, be strong, and face the temptations which are tainting your ability to love. Seek help, advice, and support from other men you admire or trust. Do not be afraid or embarrassed to admit to them your struggles. In most cases, the men you come to will be so touched that you came to them for help, will be inspired by your desire to change, grateful that you finally did ask for assistance, and will do everything in their power to support your journey home. But nothing can happen until you take responsibility for yourself, recognize your need for change, and then- with God's help- begin the process.
Are you ready to regain your emotional purity, to become the “feminine, confident, and virtuous” women (or “masculine, confident, and virtuous” men) that Lisa Cotter praises and upholds in her talk? Are you ready to encourage each other in your efforts to become the best-versions-of-yourselves, which Matthew Kelly so often describes? Most importantly, are you ready to become the person you always wished you would be?
Do not wait any longer then, for Jesus is just waiting for you to give Him permission to take you on the most wonderful ride of your life: the ride which begins the minute you surrender to Him, and only pauses for a second, to jump from the tracks of this world and onto the paths of Paradise. It will not be easy, but it will be better than anything you've experienced yet- Austen novels and Lifehouse concerts included.

Brendan Rodgers believes Jordan Henderson is “absolutely perfect” for England's World Cup squad.
The Liverpool FC midfielder hasn't featured for his country since he won his fifth cap in the quarter-final defeat to Italy in Euro 2012.
However, Henderson has been ever present for the Reds in the Premier League so far this season and is certain to keep his place for Saturday's lunchtime showdown at Newcastle United.
Rodgers says his outstanding club form merits an international recall and he's backing the 23-year-old to join the likes of clubmates Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Glen Johnson on the plane to Brazil next summer.
“I think there is a great opportunity there for Jordan,” Rodgers told the ECHO.
“I look at Jordan and I think he's absolutely perfect for the World Cup squad.
“Firstly, in terms of the performance level he has shown so far this season. But also because when you go to a World Cup you are taking a squad with you.
“You need players who are going to be flexible and can play well in a number of positions and I am sure Roy Hodgson knows that.
“We have seen it already this season when he has played as a wing-back, as a wide midfield player in a 4-2-3-1 and as a central midfield player. Jordan plays all those positions really well.
“His best position in the longer term for me will be central in the corridor making runs forward.
“He's a player I've been really impressed with and above many other players he should be in that squad.”
Luis Suarez is set to make his 100 appearance for the Reds at St James' Park.
The Uruguay striker only returned to Merseyside from international duty in his homeland late on Thursday.
Suarez played 90 minutes in their hard-fought 3-2 win over Argentina but Rodgers has no concerns about throwing him straight into battle in the North East.
“It was a long trip back for Luis but he should be fine,” Rodgers said.
“We've had this a number of times where he doesn't get back until late on a Thursday and then only links up with the squad on the Friday. It won't be a problem.
“I remember last season he came back looking tired and got a hat-trick against Wigan that day. Hopefully it will be the same impact at Newcastle as he had then.
“Luis Suarez has a phenomenal mentality. His hunger to play is as good as I've ever seen in a player.
“He keeps going and going. He's remarkable really in terms of his desire to play football. He is relentless.”
Meanwhile, Rodgers confirmed he flew to Boston during the international break to meet Liverpool principal owner John Henry and chairman Tom Werner.
“It was informal, I just went more out of respect,” he said. “I said I would pop over for a few days and just give them an update really in terms of where we were going, and where we were at.”
We're just over eight days away from the first Star Trek premiere in sixteen years, when Discovery takes flight on CBS next Sunday evening, before the show makes its warp to CBS All Access here in the United States.
With our proximity to the premiere shrinking with each passing day, we've now reached the point where television listings – including TV Guide – have now been updated to reflect the Star Trek: Discovery premiere episode, including the title and synopsis of the series' pilot hour.
EPISODE 1.01: “The Vulcan Hello” While the crew members aboard the USS Shenzhou patrol through the far reaches of Federation space, they encounter a certain object of indeterminate origins, which presents a considerable challenge for the ship's first officer.
As we know, the series' central character Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) was raised on Vulcan in the logical lifestyle of that planet's inhabitants, and a great deal of the Discovery promotional material – dating back to the first poster released for the show – has centered around her upbringing.
The classic Vulcan hand salute, famously created by Leonard Nimoy based upon his Jewish upbringing, has been a centerpiece of Burnham imagery since Martin-Green was announced in the role back in April, and the character now has been shown making the salute herself in a recent Netflix video promotion.
In addition, Burnham's specialty as a xenoanthroplogist – an alien culture and first contact expert – makes some form of “hello” especially appropriate for the Starfleet officer's debut.
While we're still working to determine our episode spoilers policy for TrekCore comments, we've decided that Discovery episode titles will NOT be considered spoilers in our reporting.
“The Vulcan Hello,” directed by David Semel and written by Bryan Fuller, Alex Kurtzman, and Akiva Goldsman, will premiere on CBS television on Sunday, September 24 at 8:30PM ET, followed by the immediate release of the name-yet-unknown second episode of Star Trek: Discovery on CBS All Access that evening – with subsequent releases each Sunday.
In Canada, the two hours will air together on Space Channel at 8:30PM ET, with subsequent releases each Sunday as well.
Internationally, Discovery premieres on Netflix starting September 25 and each episode past the premiere weekend will be available within a day of the US release.
In addition, here's a new promotional image from Netflix, featuring Michael Burnham staring up at the USS Discovery from within her thruster suit.
Rochester, N.Y. – Two doctors at the University of Rochester are combining their passions and talents with the latest technology -and a little arts and crafts - to create life-like organs.
"We worked together and we were able to create these physical organs that looked real. But they also felt real, as if you were doing a real operation,” said Dr. Jonathan Stone, a neurosurgery resident at University of Rochester.
The process starts with a patient's CAT scan, which is then created into a 3D model on the computer. The next step is using a 3D printer to create a mold. Hydrogel is injected into the mold, and paint and dye are used to make the organs look real.
Dr. Ahmed Ghazi of the University of Rochester is an Assistant Professor of Urology and the Director of Simulation Training.
"It bleeds, it has the same anatomical characteristics and that allows us to not only look at it, but also practice and cut through it,” said Dr. Ghazi.
Dr. Ghazi has rehearsed surgeries that involve removing a tumor from a kidney. He says each surgery is unique, and many times surgeons go into it without fully knowing what they might encounter or have to do for the best result. He says simulating the surgery beforehand is very helpful, especially for complicated procedures.
“Patient's hospital stay was reduced, patient had fewer complications, there was less blood loss and patient were able to reserve their kidneys, especially in cases like this,” said Dr. Ghazi of a cardiac patient who had another surgery weeks earlier.
The simulation takes place in the operating room, with the same tools and technology and includes the other organs and parts of a human body a doctor would need to work around during the surgery.
Dr. Stone says it's an ideal way to get hands-on training for residents who are learning.
“How do you learn how to do a surgery without harming someone? That's really where this science allows us make it safer for patients in the operating room,” said Dr. Stone.
In the near future, Dr. Ghazi and Dr. Stone hope to create a simulation service for surgeons who'd like to rehearse a day before the actual surgery.
Yesterday, Wired's usually reputable Danger Room blog posted an article on “China's mystery complex”, titled “What Did Google Earth Spot in the Chinese Desert? Even an Ex-CIA Analyst Isn't Sure”.
But even this old analyst is having trouble ID'ing the objects he found in the overhead images of Kashgar. “I haven't the faintest clue what it might be — but it's extensive, the structures are pretty big and funny-looking, and it went up in what I'd call an incredible hurry,” he emails. So he'd like your help in solving this little mystery.
As a Google Earth user and blogger, and having traveled to Kashgar and written about the city and its surroundings, I was certainly intrigued, so I decided to take a look.
View Kashgar in a larger map, with explanations.
I had no trouble finding the location, and immediately surmised it is just another huge industrial park being constructed, one of many propelling China's development at breakneck speed. Here's what a little context can tell you:
In May 2010, Kashgar was selected as a special economic zone by the Chinese government, which means that, just like Shenzhen and other places before it, it is in for a wild ride on a scale not often seen outside China. I'd be surprised if there wasn't anything massive being built in Kashgar right now. Kashgar's economy is growing at around 15-20% per year, and it is perfectly placed for cross-border trade with the central Asian republics. The complex in question is conveniently being built just to the northeast of the very modern Kashgar airport, very close to a reservoir which I drove by on an excursion to nearby ruins (also marked on the map). The railway from Urumuqi to Kashgar veers into Kashgar just south of the reservoir, and would be perfectly positioned for an offshoot into the industrial zone. This complex is not at the far edge of some small desert town; it is located on prime real estate near transportation hubs in a rapidly expanding trading and manufacturing center that was once a major waypoint on the Silk Road. It would be the absolutely the worst place to build a secret base. Anybody with a visa for China can fly, drive or train it to Kashgar. There are no restrictions to travelers into the region, unlike in Tibet. In fact, landing at the airport, I had a wonderful view of the slopes on which this complex is now being built. Fly into Kashgar on one of many daily scheduled flights and you'd know right away how work is progressing.
In sum, I was disappointed. Not with the Chinese for failing to construct a mystery complex, but with the gullible reporter, who should at the very least have gotten a second opinion before letting loose on the Internet a retired analyst with an overactive imagination and no on-the-ground knowledge of the area. I left a comment to that effect.
That, of course, did not nip this meme in the bud. My RSS reader started filling up with rewrites, soon enough including from mainstream news outlets such as Salon, Australia's Telegraph and even Sweden's Nyheter24. The rewrite-industrial complex was going gangbusters. All that was missing was the Huffington Post version. [Update: Here it is.]
This story thus reveals more about us than about China. It is above all a story about technology racing ahead of our ability to put it into context. We are overawed by the notion that we can observe any place on Earth in high resolution, but we lack the tools to understand this power and the limits of this power. Into this cognitive vacuum we pile on conspiracy theories. Any absence of information suddenly requires a cover-up. Comments to the original Danger Room article betray an amazing appetite for conspiratorial beliefs that are incompatible with even a passing knowledge of how satellite imagery is collected.
And the story also reveals how many in the West continue to see China as an oriental mystery opaque to westerners, fair game for wild conjecture. But it's not. Those days are long gone. Here be no more dragons. China is knowable. Just not from Google Earth alone.
The Sarah Palin Grifter Bus Tour is officially underway, and it's currently spewing toxic fumes across the Washington, DC area. There are many questions surrounding this family vacation, but so few answers. People need to know.
Politico rattles off all of the places Sarah Palin has been in the last two days: On the back of a Harley. At Mount Vernon. Lurking around the National Archives. Making "unannounced visits to monuments and other landmarks." Saying stupid things to people. But she's not saying really stupid things to reporters (yet). Can you believe the gall of this woman? Is she running for president or not? Why won't she tell us? And where is she going on this tour? No itinerary? No briefings? No interviews? Even Greta Van Susteren is out of the loop. What the fuck is going on here?!
Instead, she's been telling people to check her website for information, which (gasp!) only comes after she's done something. Here's a thought: She's probably retiring to her bus each day, turning on the TV and laughing at everyone trying to figure out what the hell she's up to, then watching hits on her website go through the roof.
And then there's this:
CNN reported Monday that some of Palin's supporters had already started to gather midday at Gettysburg in hopes that she might be on her way. But by then, Palin's bus was rolling into Mount Vernon instead.
And that's just sad.

generalist: a person competent in several different fields or activities
business software developing generalist: I know how to do the simplest tasks with many different languages/tools, but I can not be considered competent with any of them.
me: So, I see you have Erlang on your resume, how do you like the language?
candidate: I like it's concurrency handling, but I'm a bit weary of it's syntax.
me: (thinking - okay, do you have any original thoughts on Erlang?) I can understand those points of view, what problem were you trying to solve with Erlang and why did you think it was the right tool?
candidate: Oh, I really only got through the 2 minute tutorial, you know, hello world basically. But if you guys have Erlang projects you want me to work on I'm happy to, I'm a generalist, I like all languages.
me: Okay, so what language would you say you know the most about?
candidate: I don't bother to specialize, I do a little bit with each language, you know, hello world or whatever, so I can use the right tool for the job. That's the best part of being a generalist.
me: (thinking - this interview is already over) Okay, so tell me about the languages/tools you've had to use at your different jobs?
If you read my blog entry on Language Specialization you might have concluded that I prefer generalists. If, in our industry, generalists were what the definition describes, then I would prefer generalists. Unfortunately, business software developers seem to have created their own definition of generalist.I blame Scott Ambler. To me anyway, it seems like the daft generalist movement started when Scott wrote Generalizing Specialists Our industry has always been saturated by bad programmers. I'm on record stating that at least 50% of the people writing business software should find a new profession. The problem with bad developers is that they take good ideas and turn them in to monstrosities.I remember reading Generalizing Specialists and being inspired. I thought Scott gave fantastic and relevant advice. Unfortunately, many bad or junior developers heard: Don't bother to deeply understand anything, instead, you're agile if you know a little about everything. Suddenly, when I started interviewing developers I ran into situations like this.Inevitably, the candidate doesn't even have a deep understanding of the tools they've used at work, because they are too busy doing hello world in every language invented. They also love to say that they take the Pragmatic Programmers advice to extreme and 'learn' several languages a year.The truth is, these generalists have little in the way of valuable knowledge. They provide their projects with little more knowledge than a Google search can bestow in 30 minutes. In short, they're worthless, if not destructive I don't actually blame Scott Ambler. In my opinion he was right then, and he's right now. Become a Generalizing Specialist is still the advice that I currently give developers.Specializing in something makes you an asset to the team. If I'm building a Web 2.0 website, I want everyone to have an understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, & SQL. However, I also want each team member to specialize in one of those areas. Knowing IE quirks is just as important as knowing how to optimize MySQL. And, I want to make sure I have team members that can get into the deep, dark corners of delivering highly effective software. That doesn't mean everyone needs to know what a straight join in MySQL does, but at least 1 person should. The rest of the team isn't entirely off the hook though, they better understand how to write basic SQL statements that are maintainable and at least semi-performant.Becoming a Generalizing Specialist takes time, but the first step is becoming a Specialist. Once you deeply understand one language/tool, you can move on to the next relevant language/tool. How do you know when it's time to move on? When you start having answers to questions that people aren't asking. If you're constantly looking up answers to common questions, you aren't a specialist. However, if you start providing more (relevant) detail in your answers than people are looking for, you're on your way to possessing the deep understanding that a Specialist should have. At that point, it's probably time to start looking deeply into something else.One painful mistake to look out for is specializing in something less relevant. If you work for a trading firm that writes only thick client applications, understanding why Chrome's Javascript VM is better than Firefox's Javascript VM is probably not the best use of your time. It's true that you may move on to a web application at some point, but by then your information will probably have become stale anyway. Stick to specializing in things that you work with day to day. Your language, your IDE, the Domain Specific Languages you use in your applications (regular expressions, SQL, LINQ, etc), or the frameworks you use (Spring, ASP.net, etc) are things you should specialize in to increase the value you provide to your team.Eventually, you become competent with several different tools and languages. You've become a Generalizing Specialist and as such you are significantly more valuable to your team.
Vaccines play an essential role in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Yet, the underlying immune activation mechanisms for many of these prophylactic therapies remains elusive. Yellow fever—a deadly viral infection spread by mosquitoes—devastated much of the world until a vaccine was developed in the late 1930s. Now researchers at Princeton University have just uncovered a critical role for a new immune signaling pathway in controlling infection by the yellow fever virus (YFV). Findings from the new study—published online today in mBio in an article entitled “Type III Interferon-Mediated Signaling Is Critical for Controlling Live Attenuated Yellow Fever Virus Infection In Vivo”—are not only important for understanding immune control mechanisms of YFV but may help scientists elucidate the signaling pathways that control other flaviviruses, such as Dengue and Zika.
Infection with YFV causes a devastating illness, with mortality rates soaring to 50% in some areas. Fortunately, there is an effective vaccine for YFV: a live-attenuated strain of the virus called YFV-17D, which differs by only a few amino acids from the virulent viral strain YFV-Asibi but provokes a potent and durable protective immune response in humans.
“An improved understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating YFV-17D attenuation will provide insights into key viral–host interactions that regulate host immune responses and infection outcomes, [and] open novel avenues for the development of innovative vaccine strategies,” explained senior study investigator Alexander Ploss, Ph.D., assistant professor in Princeton's department of molecular biology. Still, research efforts have been hampered because mice, which are used in the study of viral infections, are resistant to YFV infection. Nonetheless, recent mouse experiments have pointed to a key role for cytokines called interferons (IFNs) in controlling the virus.
Interestingly, much like humans, mice possess three types of IFNs, molecules produced by the immune system during infection: type I IFNs, which signal through the widely distributed IFN-α/β receptor; type II IFNs that act on IFN-γ receptors present in most tissues; and type III IFNs, which activate signaling by IFN-λ receptors found on epithelial cells.
Mice lacking type I receptors die after infection by YFV-Asibi, but survive YFV-17D infection despite extensive viral replication at an early stage of infection. Type II IFN signaling has also been shown to be important for clearing up late-stage YFV-Asibi and YFV-17D infection when type I IFN signaling is defective. Conversely, the contribution of type III IFN signaling to control of YFV infection was unknown. The researchers sought to address this question by studying YFV-17D infection in mice lacking the type III receptor.
Historical video produced by the predecessor agency to the CDC about how to control the spread of yellow fever (1945). [NIH].
“…we report that while wild-type (WT) and IFN-λ receptor knockout (λR−/−) mice were largely resistant to YFV-17D, deficiency in type I IFN signaling resulted in robust infection,” the authors wrote. “Although IFN-α/β receptor knockout (α/βR−/−) mice survived the infection, mice with combined deficiencies in both type I signaling and type III IFN signaling were hypersusceptible to YFV-17D and succumbed to the infection. Mortality was associated with viral neuroinvasion and increased the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). α/βR−/− λR−/− mice also exhibited distinct changes in the frequencies of multiple immune cell lineages, impaired T-cell activation, and severe perturbation of the proinflammatory cytokine balance.”
The initial experiments showed that these mice could control viral replication and rapidly cleared YFV-17D, indicating that type III signaling alone wasn't necessary for resistance to YFV-17D. However, mice lacking both type I and type III receptors succumbed after YFV-17D infection, suggesting type III signaling does contribute to the antiviral immune response.
As they dug deeper, the research team examined YFV-17D levels in various tissues. Early in the infection, the virus was present in every tissue of each mouse model examined. However, although viral loads were low in wild-type mice and type III receptor-deficient mice, they were much higher in type I and type I/III receptor-deficient mice.
Unexpectedly, investigators found that the viral loads in brains of type I/III receptor-deficient mice increased over time in comparison to type I receptor-deficient mice, showing that loss of type III IFN signaling enhances the susceptibility of type I receptor-deficient animals to a brain infection. This was a significant find as the presence of viruses in the brain can cause brain damage such as spongiosis or encephalitis. The low level of YFV-17FD brain invasion in wild-type mice caused mild spongiosis, whereas type I/III receptor-deficient mice had severe spongiosis—potentially explaining YFV-17D lethality in those animals. However, this raised the question of why YFV-17 was present at such high levels in the animals' brains.
Previous work showed that type III IFN signaling affects the epithelial cells that make up the BBB and modulates BBB integrity during infection by another flavivirus, West Nile virus. This was consistent with the Princeton team's findings that the BBB of type I/III receptor-deficient mice was especially leaky to a blue dye. However, this wasn't the only way that loss of type III IFN signaling impaired the body's response to YFV. The researchers also found evidence that type III receptor deficiency provokes strong imbalances in several distinct kinds of immune cells during YFV-17D infection. In particular, type I/III receptor-deficient mice were defective in the activation of T cells, critical immune cells that control YFV-17D infection.
“We uncovered a critical role of type III IFN-mediated signaling in preserving the integrity of the BBB and preventing viral brain invasion,” Dr. Ploss stated, noting that work is needed to explore how type III IFN signaling affects YFV infection in primates.

“I am not a member of Donald Trump's campaign staff. The thought never occurred to me that between the two he would be the best for Europe and Hungary. I would never have thought this. Nevertheless, the situation is the following: I listened to the candidate, and I have to tell you he made three recommendations on how to stop terrorism, and as a European I could not have expressed any better what is needed for Europe.” – Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister, Hungary In a speech delivered at the “Tusványos Free University” summer camp in Băile Tușnad, Romania, on Saturday, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán effectively endorsed the candidacy of Donald Trump for President of the United States. The Hungarian prime minister's infamous illiberal democracy speech was delivered at this event in 2014.
He said Trump was right on three points, namely:
that immigration is bad and dangerous;
that it is necessary to expand the secret services; and
that it is necessary to give up trying to export democracy, and in its place endeavor for stable relations to prevail in the countries of the Middle East.
Orbán said that the United States is one of the biggest supporters of the migratory pressure on Hungary, for which he blames President Barack Obama and US refugee policy.
Black sheep
Sharing his opinion on “the situation in Europe” the prime minister said Hungary was being squeezed out of mainstream Europe, that the “black sheep of Europe” will rejoin the flock when it turns out the mainstream was wrong.
He observed that a number of crazy things are happening in the world right now and said they were connected. “The people are full of fear and uncertainty” and Europe had no idea what it was up against, referring to its ineffectual handling of the migration crisis.
Orbán said there were similarities in the problems faced by the US and Western Europe, which he attributed to their failure to realize that their own dominance has waned as new players on the global economic scene have taken over. He said this has caused younger generations in the West not to see the future as promising as their parents once did. Orbán accused traditional political elites of having let youth down and warned that the financial crisis had turned into a crisis of elites, for which he offered the rise of Donald Trump in America and Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany as proof.
The prime minister said there existed a crisis of democracy, caused by the fact that “the masses want something other than what the elites are proposing”.
“The people live in a constant state of restlessness, nervousness and tension,” observed Orbán, adding that in the meantime “terror attacks, violence and a seemingly unstoppable wave of migration” are crashing down on Europe. He warned that “uncertainty and fear are now the basic psychological state on the European continent”.
He said “the fear of uncertainty needs to be banished from our lives” and the European Union needed to put an end to three things:
the mistaken western notion of “denationalization”, that is, “the suppression of national sovereignty for the benefit of European power” needs to be stopped;
False self-assessment based on the false assumption that the EU remains a major player in global politics; and
The “idealization of Europe” by which he meant “This idea, ideology, or closed-ideological system of more Europe”.
Orbán said there are times when it is good to come up with common solutions, and there are times when common solutions are bad. He criticized common solutions for border defense and the migrant issue, and said Hungary has found solutions for these issues on its own. In his opinion, “the EU needs to move back to the practical from the ideological, otherwise the uncertainty will not end”.
The Hungarian prime minister believes the EU has made three bad decisions:
The growing size of the European Parliament has ruined its effectiveness;
The European Commission has exceeded the powers granted to it by the EU Charter, becoming a political player; and
Allowing the Commission, through the support of only two thirds (accordance to population within the EU) of Council, to be able to enforce all kinds of agreements that were not agreed upon by all EU member states.
Migration, migration, migration
Orbán said illegal migration is the main reason Europeans are scared, and he cited a poll according to which 63 percent of EU citizens believe immigration will change a country's culture.
“Migration is a danger. It increases terrorism. It increases crime. Migration, in high numbers, will change Europe's cultural identity. Migration, in high numbers, dismantles national culture. If this position does not become a European position, we will not be able to act against this danger,” said Orbán.
Other pearls of wisdom:
With respect to Turkey, it is important to Hungary that Turkey have stable leadership in order to prevent migration;
The stability of frontier countries needs to take precedence over criticisms of their democracies;
If these countries are not made stable, they will not prevent mass migration into Europe;
“By 2050, the population of Egypt will increase some 90 million to 138 million”;
“The population of Nigeria will increase from 186 million to 390 million”;
“The population of Uganda will increase from 38 million to 93 million”;
“The population of Ethiopia will increase from 102 million to 228 million”;
These are the real numbers that Hungarians need to be prepared for, and the next big wave of migration will come from Africa, not the Middle East;
So, fences need to be built and people need to be stopped;
But it is also important to show the outside world that Hungary is not a heartless nation;
That is why Hungarians make a distinction between the migrant and migration;
Migrants are mostly victims, except for the terrorist migrants;
But “migration will kill us”;
Migration manifests itself through migrants, so it is the migrants that need to be stopped;
In conclusion, “Europe has lots its role as a global leader”;
“Europe is not able to defend its own citizens”;
“Europe is not able to defend its own external borders”;
“Europe is not able to keep its community unified” — see Brexit;
This is all proof that European leaders have failed;
“We have to make it clear that our problem isn't with Mecca, our problem is with Brussels”;
“The bureaucrats in Brussels are the problem, not Islam. We could manage Islam if they let us manage Islam the way we see fit”;
There are two types of Europe: that of the founding countries, which happen to be stagnating, and the energized “new Europe”, the V4;
Unlike in the EU's founding countries, the “European dream” is still alive in V4 countries;
If they follow the rules, it is still possible for youngsters in the V4 to live better than their parents lived;
The proof is that, unlike Western Europe, Central Europe did not undergo the many crisises listed before (financial crisis > crisis of the elite > crisis of democracy);
Thanks to Hungary's anti-EU refugee quota referendum, “Hungary is the only country in Europe where citizens can make their feelings about migration known”;
“The only place in Europe where the voices of the people is being heard is in Central Europe”; and
Everything that Fidesz started in Hungary in 2010 is rooted in making the following statement true: “Hungary will remain a secure point in an uncertain world.”
During the questions and answers session of the discussion, Orbán was asked about the plight of Ukraine.
According to him, Europe did not keep its promises to Ukraine following the Euromaidan protests. As a result, Ukrainians cannot enjoy the quality of life they had under the Yanukovych regime.
Orbán said there are three constant factors that have always dominated Hungarian policy: the size of its population, its geopolitical position and the “spirit of nation”.
“Hungarians do not want to be servile”
The spirit of the nation, Orbán said, is “that the Hungarians do not want to be a servile nation. They do not want to be the servants of other nations, and they do not want to be servants within their own nation.”
If Hungary were to follow ideology-based policies, it would mean the end of the country and loss of its sovereignty.
That said, Hungary has elemental interests in what is happening in Ukraine and the situation of ethnic Hungarians living in Transcarpathia (southern Ukraine).
“We are helping everyone who lives there, not just Hungarians,” Orbán said.
The prime minister went on to say that Europe needs to give more money to Ukraine, as well as visa waivers to Ukrainian citizens.
On the subject of the refugee crisis, Orbán said the United States is one of the biggest supporters of the migratory pressure on Hungary. He blames this on the President Obama and US refugee policy.
Orbán told the attendees that he is not critical of the Americans, “but what they think is right is something that would kill us, and that is why their [refugee policy] cannot be supported.
“The truth is that I can even understand the Americans' positive point of view on migration because that is how the United States came to be, but they have to be able to see that in this situation we are the indians.”
The audience erupted in laughter.
Orbán then said that he has known there is some kind of correlation between the fate of the Hungarian nation and the indians, but he never thought the correlation would be this stark.
In this respect, he said, the future leader of the United States is of great consequence to Europe and the migration crisis.
The need for a European military
Orbán then transitioned to Brexit and Europe's need to create a European military.
“It does not have to be like NATO where nations offer up military personnel. It should be a real shared military, with real shared colonels, a shared military language, a shared military structure.
“Continental Europe will need military with serious power in the future because it does not exist today. Until today, our defense was guaranteed by the Americans and the Brits. This cannot stay this way.”
Orbán opined that Europe needs to start thinking about growing its military industrial complex because this would be good for the national economies, and it would generate many positive technological developments.
He said a European military would take years to create and should operate without the British and Russians.
“Because a European military would need to protect the continent from the east and from the south,” Orbán said, signaling that this is something that could be used to deal with migratory pressure as well.
He then encouraged everyone to vote in the upcoming anti-EU quota referendum on October 2.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich confirmed on Thursday that he is not seeking a Cabinet-level post in the next administration, dispelling rumors that he was being considered to lead the Pentagon or State Department.
"I will not be in the Cabinet," Gingrich, a steadfast supporter of President-elect Trump, told McClatchy.
Instead, Gingrich said he intends to assist the Trump administration as a private citizen. He will focus on "strategic planning" and working to expand "the GOP victories nationwide ahead of the coming 2018 mid-term elections."
"Which is exactly what I did under the Bush administration," he noted.
The former House speaker, who spent two decades in Congress, was a finalist for the Republican vice presidential slot in July and has been floated as a potential Cabinet pick following Trump's election victory.
"I think that's Trump's loss, but I think [Gingrich] is very good at where he's most effective," former Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn, said of Gingrich's decision. Johnson chaired the House Ethics Committee that reprimanded Gingrich for ethics violations in the late 1990s.

BEIJING - China's state prosecutor said Monday it had formally charged Jaycee Chan, son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan, with a drug offense — meaning he is almost certain to face trial. The 32-year-old actor and singer was arrested in Beijing earlier this year after testing positive for marijuana, and police said they found 100 grams of the drug at his home. Prosecutors said they had begun legal proceedings against him for "the crime of sheltering others to take drugs,” without elaborating.
Action star Jackie Chan, 60, served as a goodwill spokesman for the China National Anti-Drug Committee in 2009, state media reported, promoting anti-drug education. Jaycee Chan was not available for comment. In August, his father offered the public a "deep bow of apology" for his son's arrest. China has detained a string of other mostly B-list celebrities in recent months on drug-related charges, cases that have been publicized widely in both state and social media.

A note before I begin: trying to track down original posts and sources from those years is a daunting task. I may throw myself at it someday, to make the trail, but in some cases blogs don't exist, archives aren't available, and most of what I'm going on right now is memory, things that stood out to me at the time and set off my radar as a deliberate choice to mold the narrative to fit some greater agenda. It jives with what others remember, though, in conversations I've had over the years, and while I won't out them because it could damage their careers, I hope they chime in. I plan on doing due diligence as I have time, and adding links to the relevant posts as I track them down. If you know of any, please feel free to share them in the comments. These are my personal observations, from my memories of the events as they happened.These are things I've personally observed and witnessed or have been related to me. And in the interests of clarity and full disclosure, I am a professional quilter, I have gone to every Quilt Market for the last four years, I have online classes, a book, magazine articles, a national quilting award (not QuiltCon) and have taught locally and nationally, and will be teaching at one or more national shows (not QuiltCon) this coming year. I am not writing as a newbie, but I do have a dog in this hunt. I'll get to that in the post. These are my reasons for leaving, and I do not expect them to be reflective of everyone's experiences.
I started writing out this response as a private message to those people people who asked what my reasons were for leaving the MQG. The original impulse to write this privately was that I was afraid of backlash: The MQG would see it! And my quilts would never be accepted into the show again! They have a reputation for having a shit list. And then I laughed and got over it because I'm not going to be submitting to QuiltCon any more, by personal choice. I had made that decision after the last show, actually, and it's been a long angsty period the last few years as I've watched a movement I loved and supported betray its roots, not to mention its paying members.
I feel like I need to trot out some background info, so that you know my view is based on a long period of observation and not just in response to the question of “is it derivative or not”. I started reading blogs around 2002, the year I made my first quilts, (my fella worked for Bloglines back in the day), and as I was making my own things, I started looking for blogs using the software my fella was developing to help test things for him.
I watched as these new DIY/sewing/quilt/lifestyle-y bloggers were standing up and wandering around on wobbly new legs. “Here's what I am working on!” “Look, I'm learning to use a rotary cutter! and strip piece!!” It was cute and exciting and real as everyone seemed to wake up to the idea that they could make the things they wanted for a life that was theirs.. They shared their successes and failures, and it was real and true to them, and we shared in it with them. We shared photos on Flickr, talked about things to try and patterns to explore, and where to find the fabric we loved that was new and unique. People were making cloth diapers! And selling them! And knitting! Eventually there was a chicken craze! It was a fun time.
Years passed, and in 2008 Rossie Hutchinson organized and moderated one of the (if not the first) first modern quilt Flickr groups, Fresh Modern Quilts. It's quite an archive. Groups of people who were excited about quilting and teaching themselves started forming groups if they lived close together, and in Summer 2009 Latifah Saafir and Alissa Haight-Carlton put out the call in LA for a modern guild to form.
From what I recall, all over the country people thought “huh, we have people who could make a group like that!” and guilds started spring up on their own, from this first seed of an idea. [If you were one of these guilds and existed pre-affiliation-requirements and have firm dates on when you began, please leave a comment below. I know you're out there. I know of Atlanta, East Bay, ] About a year later, the LA MQG (spearheaded by the leadership of the LAMQG without full knowledge or approval of the group) formalized a national guild and called for the other guilds to join them, with them as the head of the organization. From the first, I believe, the MQG was seeking control of the message, and this was the first movement towards being a brand as opposed to a true guild. After a planning committee was appointed, the first board was also appointed.
At this early point,the modern quilting groups across the country who had a group that identified with the modern movement and idea of a modern guild, could link up with the MQG's main website, a clearinghouse for the guilds across the country, so to speak. In 2013, the MQG decided to stop offering this as a “free service” and told those guilds who had linked up that they were to join with the national guild (by paying dues and turning over a list of members to the mothership) or they had to change their name to not include “modern quilt guild” and to have their website removed from the MQG's site. This, to me, is the second major step in the branding push. Guilds such as Atlanta, East Bay, NYC and others did not incorporate [if you know others of 'em, list 'em in the comments!] although these non-conforming guilds encouraged members to join individually if they were so moved.
At the time, I got all those emails because I had tried to start up a local chapter with a friend before they moved to assimilate everyone. I really had hoped for a local group of like-minded sewists to be with once a month, to share things with. I was really concerned at the reach the MQG was extending, and the dues were not cheap. Due to this and lack of interest, we decided to fold (I should say I decided to fold. It's hard to have a guild when you're the only one who shows up for meetings lol)
As the MQG became more prominent, the arguments over definitions of what was “modern” or not were also starting to pick up. Their Facebook page by 2012 or 2013 had around 8 or 9,000 members. My main reason for leaving the facebook page (2013?2014? No idea, sometime around there) was watching person after person get eviscerated for the quilts they posted. Pronouncements came from Very Famous Quilters that batiks aren't modern. Black backgrounds were never going to be allowed on modern quilts. Riffs on traditional were no longer modern. Shadowy authority figures of the “founding members” were being quoted as the reason behind these rules, and people were kicked out and banned at increasing rates. Around this time, three members of the original board left en masse. I would like to know why, when the official transition and vote was still not in place.
About a year before the first QuiltCon, the MQG started their own website, and their own forums, and announced they would not be moderating the facebook page any more. And then, eventually, QuiltCon happened. Most of us remember the issues around that, so I won't rehash, but I do want to point out that leaders of daughter guilds were told directly by the MQG that all quilts shown in their local guilds had to be accompanied with an explanation as to why it was modern. Craftsy, which has all of the keynote speakers on video, does not have the lecture given by Heather Grant where she laid out definitive rules as to what makes a modern quilt. That's a shame, because it is important to this conversation. I, and others, were excited to find a place for us, and yet oddly discomfited about the messages we were receiving. This push to control the brand, control the message of a movement was entirely at odds with what made us excited to be a part of the movement.
What I most certainly believe is a pivotal moment, though, was when Angela Pingel of Cut to Pieces noticed that the original definition of a modern quilt had been changed without notice, without a vote of the members, and without any public discussion. I've included the first and original definition below:
“Modern quilting is a new twist on the traditional art of quilting. This may mean something as simple as using a traditional quilt block and updating it in a fresh, fun new way. That includes using modern fabrics, modifying the block arrangement or even the scale of the block. The piecing could be improvisational and wonky, or it could be very exact and measured, following a pattern or creating your won. The quilting could be traditional stippling, clean straight lines, or a very “free” have fun and quilt-as-you-go style. Fabrics could be upcycled vintage sheets, custom digital printed fabric, a yummy selection from one of the new modern fabric designers, or an old fabric from an ever growing stash.
Modern quilting is sometimes difficult to define because in many ways the definition is as individual as the quilter – changing from quilter to quilter. In addition to reflecting the individual personality and personal style of the quilter, it also reflects the current aesthetic of the day. Modern quilting is also about the attitude and the approach that modern quilters take. It respects the amazing artistry and talent of the tradition of quilting, while allowing the quilter to challenge the “rules”. In fact, if there were one rule in modern quilting, it would be that there are no rules. The concept of modern quilting is not meant to divide or segregate. It is meant to welcome new quilters, of all ages, to the world of quilting in a style that they can relate to. In many ways, modern quilting takes us back to the basics of the early quilters, when women of the day used the colors and styles of their time to express themselves creatively”
And this was the new definition that she had noticed, silently slipped in without a public comment period or vote:
“We define modern quilts as quilts that are functional, include bold colors, and are inspired by modern design. Minimalism, asymmetry expansive negative space, and alternate grid work are often a part of modern quilt compositions, as are improvisational piecing and solid fabrics.”
What's this “we” stuff? It did not reflect me or most of the quilts in the show or the work of most of my friends. It did reflect the work of a very small subset. I also came to believe that it was a dangerous proposition to speak publicly about these types of things. I think many of us learned this lesson and became very cautious about saying anything that could be held against us.
Why is this?
At the time MQGNational was formed, those of us making these types of quilt and hunting for these types of fabrics were revitalizing an industry that was on the decline. The companies who were seeking to profit from this new influx of quilters is sometimes late to the party and didn't understand the movement. The appointed leaders of the MQG became a convenient touchstone for these companies seeking to get a line on what was happening, and what people wanted. From the get-go, I believe this established what I think of as the gate-keeping culture: It's not modern unless is having the MQG stamp of approval. I believe that this is a critical point to understand in how and why things are the way they are today.
As gate-keepers, they have a very real impact on who is allowed to have a voice and who is not. Don't stay on message? You'll never teach at QuiltCon. Point out something that goes against the openness of the community you love and work within? Forget about any recognition or links to you or your quilts. Death by silent treatment.
In that original post, which is no longer available (and which I sadly did not think to screenshot, though I should know better by now) the definition of what is “derivative” was exceptionally broad, faulty, and flat out incorrect in places. Most of that has been changed to be less extreme and egregiously wrong. I am glad for that, I guess, but they've been “working on this post for months” and that was what they put out? And current Board members didn't know about it until it was published? This authoritarian and elitist culture was established from the beginning. It is why I believe the MQG fulfills the function of a brand with an agenda rather than a guild supporting its members as seen through the numerous ,continuous and persistent actions of pronouncements such as what is a derivative work or not.
And it is the real crux of the matter. The most recent post about derivative work (the current iteration of the post has been altered from the original, so keep that in mind) was presented by fiat, much as the first board was presented, much as the definitions of modern quilting were presented. Because the MQG has established itself as some sort of authority, people like me who have skin in the game are consistently afraid of speaking out because of what the damage and fallout might be. Those of us in the industry not of the Favored Few all have stories of the people we know who have been affected and the strongarm tactics that have been used. These stories are not mine to tell and I hope the people affected share them. I am only speaking out now because I want nothing more to do with the national organization. I won't be submitting proposals, I won't be submitting quilts. I believe I have nothing to lose except the fences and strictures that have bound me creatively and I realize this will be the end for me by speaking out, and I'm ok with that. I cannot support a national organization that says one thing, then does another. Repeatedly. To the detriment of the paying members and the modern movement as a whole.
There is much more, but I feel I have written enough to explain my reasons for leaving, which are measured and as factual as I can make them. I am not nor have I ever been “on the inside” and I know some of these actions were meant well in the beginning. I've observed this organization for a long time as an outsider, I have supported the idea of a place for modern quilters, actively work to encourage everyone who makes stuff, and have no confidence that the agenda of the mothership is congruent with supporting their paying membership, representing me as an individual member or the amazing daughter guilds I have had the pleasure to meet and see in action. The modern quilting community i know encompasses a truly amazing group of people, supportive and caring, excited, of all ages, genders, races, political leanings and more. I am sad that leaving an organization I had hoped to find a home in is a choice I now feel is inevitable.
A final word: My experiences may not be yours, and I appreciate that. I cannot be true to the things that I value about myself–honesty, integrity, my sense of fairness, and my desire to support and encourage people making whatever the hell they want with delight and passion–and yet stay silent. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
A Crossroads
A few weeks before Ben's third year at UVA, Andre was killed by a drunk driver while crossing a highway. He was 17. Ben was 20.
“That almost derailed me,” Ben said in a low voice. “I did not know how to deal with that. I had been able to suppress and compartmentalize my feelings and my emotions up to that point. Abuse. Anything.
“I just experienced so much trauma in my life,” he said. “I was just like, ‘God, why did you take him? You should have taken me. I'm not worth this. He is. What more do you want me to shoulder?'”
Ben was numb. He felt responsible for Andre's death.
“I blamed myself for not putting us in a situation to be successful and to take care of him. But I was more upset with not being able to say goodbye,” he said with a choke in his voice, “because I literally had just seen him a couple of days before.”
And then, Williams had a vision.
“There was a moment – I can explain it – many people won't believe it, but I believe it and I know it happened,” he recalled. In a conversation with God, “I said, ‘Man – at minimum – if I have a place in heaven, let him take my place because he deserved that.'
“I saw Andre ascend and he told me, ‘Everything is OK. You're going to be fine. I am going to be looking down on you. This is goodbye.'”
And in that moment, Ben said he stopped crying and knew he needed to ask for help. His cousin lived with a local psychiatrist who had become a family friend. Ben asked if he would meet with him. “And Doc said, ‘Yes, we can meet at 7 o'clock on Sunday mornings,'” he said. They met for several weeks.
“Doc just sat me down. He was just talking to me about all if it – about trauma – about how my experiences led up to that moment. I was blaming myself, but it was just a culmination of everything I had gone through and how it finally came out. I'd been suppressing it for so long.

Despite saying that Michael Schumacher can triumph again, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has backed another German for the 2010 title - Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel.
The 2010 F1 grid will feature four world champions, but Ecclestone believed the honors will go to the 22-year-old who finished nine points behind Jenson Button in 2009.
"Schumacher can of course win the title but the younger drivers will absolutely want to beat him," Ecclestone told told Bild. "There are five or six drivers that can race for the championship title but I predict that Sebastian Vettel will be the next world champion in Formula One."
Vettel joined F1 in 2006 as BWM Sauber's third driver, and made his race debut for the team at the American Grand Prix in 2007, standing in for injured Robert Kubica. He joined Toro Rosso for the Hungarian race that year, and remained with the team for the 2008 season. He moved to Red Bull in 2009 and enjoyed a superb season finishing second in the championship.

A Baltimore judge has tossed crucial evidence obtained via a stingray in a murder case—the trial was set to begin this week.
According to the Baltimore Sun, local police used the device, also known as a cell-site simulator, to locate the murder suspect in an apartment near his victim's. In 2014, investigators used the stingray to locate the suspect, Robert Copes, who allowed them into his apartment. There, amid cleaning supplies including bleach and the phone they were looking for, police found the blood of Ina Jenkins, 34, in Copes' apartment. Jenkins' body was found “dumped across the street.”
The Baltimore police had a court-approved pen register, a legal authorization, to use the stingray. However that is not the same as a search warrant that requires probable cause.
Circuit Judge Yolanda Tanner said in court Monday that while she is suppressing the evidence “with great reluctance,” Copes is “likely guilty.”
"It was nonetheless an unconstitutional search," Tanner said, according to the Sun. "I can't play the 'what if' game with the Constitution.”
This case marks yet another example of judges pushing back against warrantless uses of the powerful surveillance device. In recent years, stingray use has come under increasing scrutiny, with several states including California, Washington, Virginia, Minnesota, and Utah now requiring a warrant for their use. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice also imposed new policies that mandate a warrant for stingray use in most cases.
Last month, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals published a legal opinion finding that state police must not only obtain a warrant before deploying a cell-site simulator but must also fully explain to the court what the device does and how it is used. Back in 2014, a Baltimore robbery case was dropped when the defendant challenged the use of a stingray.
As Ars has reported, stingrays can be used to determine a mobile phone's location by spoofing a cell tower. In some cases, they can even intercept calls and text messages. Once deployed, the devices intercept data from a target phone along with information from other phones within the vicinity. At times, police have falsely claimed the use of a confidential informant when they have actually deployed these particularly sweeping and intrusive surveillance tools.
A similar case also examining the warrantless use of stingrays, known as United States v. Patrick, is currently pending before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. When that opinion is handed down later this year or next year, it will be the first such ruling in a federal appellate court.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs approached CBS approximately one year ago in an attempt to secure a content deal for a streaming television service that was in development at the time. CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves publicly spoke of the negotiations once before during an earnings call late last year, and now he is quoted again after having reportedly discussed the matter on stage during a presentation at the UCLA Entertainment Symposium. “I told Steve, ‘You know more than me about 99 percent of things but I know more about the television business,' ” Moonves said according to Hollywood Reporter. Moonves said he denied Jobs access to CBS content for the service out of fear it might disrupt CBS's existing revenue streams. Apple is reportedly still working on a unique streaming TV service that it intends to launch alongside an Apple-branded HDTV later this year. Some reports suggest the service may treat channels like apps, allowing users to subscribe to individual channels or groups of channels a la carte.

Last year, Motorola pushed out a freshly announced Kit Kat update to the Verizon Moto X (1st gen) in under three weeks. As you can imagine, we are still impressed by this feat, considering they not only had to test and prep the software for the phone, but it also needed approval by Big Red in order to go live for all on their network. It's one thing to push an update to a Nexus or the new Moto X “Pure Edition,” both of which do not have carrier ties and can be given new software as manufacturers see fit; it's a completely different struggle when a carrier is involved.
Which brings us to this year's Moto X (2nd gen) and its impending Lollipop updates. We have already seen Motorola push Android 5.0 to the “Pure Edition,” but what about all of the carrier variants? Our team has been discussing this subject a lot over the last few days, all the while wondering if Motorola and Verizon would try and repeat last year's success. Tim was even ready to put money on the updates starting yesterday or this upcoming Monday. While no new software has begun pushing as I type this, he might be right.
Yesterday afternoon, Motorola began inviting members of its Motorola Feedback Network who own the Verizon model of the Moto X (2nd gen) to test out a “early preview of a new software release.” The invite doesn't mention Android 5.0 “Lollipop,” but the timing seems right knowing that its uncarrier brother has been running it.
With that said, keep in mind that the Verizon Moto X (2nd gen) is also still awaiting the arrival of Advanced Calling 1.0 from Verizon, which gives the device Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE), simultaneous voice and data, and HD calling. Is that the update we are about to see instead? Or maybe Verizon and Motorola are combining VoLTE with Lollipop? I have no insight into this update, but my guess is that this update will bring both Android 5.0 and Voice-over-LTE. Otherwise, Motorola and Verizon would have to do this update song-and-dance one more time when they could just as easily do it all together.
Once the update starts and we hear from testers, we will be sure to pass along the news.
Ready, Moto X owners?

After an election decided by a single vote, organizers for the Business Loop Community Improvement District are looking ahead to their long-term goals and visions for the business corridor.
In a 4-3 vote Thursday, voters approved a half-cent sales tax to fund improvements along the Business Loop 70 corridor. The sales tax � estimated to generate $220,000 annually � will go toward funding the Community Improvement District, or CID. The tax is set to take effect April 1.
Carrie Gartner, executive director of the CID, said she was happy and surprised by the results. As reporters peppered her with questions after the vote, she took a quick break to let board members know about the victory.
�I say, �We won,� and they say, �Really?� � Gartner said.
As Gartner, board Chairman Tom May, a handful of reporters and at least one voter waited outside the CID�s Parkade Center office, election judges pulled the blinds for privacy while they verified voter signatures and tallied votes. May, who had been visible in his efforts to reach out to voters, said he absolutely expected voters to reject the sales tax.
Gartner said she thinks May�s outreach helped, adding that even people who were unsupportive of the tax had someone listen to their concerns.
�It has looked this way for so long,� Gartner said, referencing the neglected region in north Columbia. �People are ready to fix it.�
The district has a volunteer board of directors and can advocate for the area when it comes to matters such as infrastructure investment. The CID also can use its money from the sales tax and a property assessment in the area to invest in improvements such as landscaping and public art.
Before she became executive director of the Business Loop CID, Gartner headed the Downtown Community Improvement District. During her 14-year tenure downtown, parts of the area were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The organization also launched a campaign to rebrand itself as �The District,� spearheaded the demolition of sidewalk canopies and implemented a downtown beautification plan.
Property owners in the Business Loop CID already voted to levy a special property assessment of about a half-cent per $100 of assessed value for properties within the district. Organizers expect that assessment to generate about $50,000 annually.
The district has been the subject of sharp criticism for months because organizers drew boundaries in a way that would have excluded residents from having a vote in the tax. The district includes properties that front Business Loop 70. Had no registered voters lived within the boundaries, property owners would have had the final say on the sales tax. County Clerk Wendy Noren eventually discovered 15 voters registered with addresses in the district, sending the sales tax to a public vote.
Jen Henderson, a voter in the district who has vocally opposed the CID, said she planned to stay involved even though the election did not go the way she had hoped.
Her lawyers on Wednesday asked the CID to delay the election, citing concerns about voter privacy, short notice time and that the CID was conducting the election itself. The letter implied possible legal action, but none had been taken. Henderson said she and her lawyers would discuss what, if anything, to do now that the election is over.
�I may not be coming to every meeting from here on out, but I will most likely be coming in to check in to see progress,� she said. �They had a long list of vague things they want to do, and if they�re going to be accessing this money, I hope to see something out of it.�
The CID has been gauging what people want to see in the area using an online survey. It has received more than 200 responses so far. Respondents have rated attractiveness, business development and infrastructure such as sidewalks as their top priorities, Gartner said.

Writing Advice
Decoding Narrative Distance
by Dave King
Most writers have already mastered the basics of point of view — choosing first, third or omniscient and sticking with a single viewpoint character within a scene. But control of narrative distance — a more advanced use of point of view — is a technique many new writers still need to learn. Though it is difficult to master, control of narrative distance will help to convey subtle emotions, give characters a rich internal life, and draw readers more effectively into the world of the story. These are often just the elements that are needed to push a writer's work over that all-important line from promising to pro.
Judging the Distance
Narrative distance doesn't break down into nice, neat categories. Instead, it's a continuum that measures how close your narrative voice is to your viewpoint character's voice. There are four things that determine where your narrative voice falls on the continuum, the most basic of which is the vocabulary and grammar you use. The words we have at our disposal to describe the world around us arise out of our history, our education, even our culture, which is why the Inuit have so many words for snow and the Irish so many terms for a rainy day. When you describe your settings and action using only words from your viewpoint character's vocabulary, you're not only telling your readers the facts, you're running those facts through your viewpoint character's history and worldview. On the other hand, when the voice of your descriptions is more sophisticated, more verbose, perhaps more acutely observant than your viewpoint character's voice, you've put distance between the two.
Consider how much of Little Lucien's life experience comes through in this brief description of a summer's evening from Carolyn Chute's Letourneau's Used Auto Parts:
Junebugs growl like bulldozers in the corners of Big Lucien Letourneau's slanty old piazza and the old twisty tree-sized lilac bushes put off a smell. Big Lucien is nowhere around tonight. Norman is not around. Little Lucien is squatted with his back against the clapboards, his eyes closed, listening to the tantes whisper in French just inside the screen door … something about the gas stove, he surmises…
Even though it's not clear we're in Little Lucien's head until near the end of the paragraph, his view of life is already there in the comparison of Junebugs to bulldozers and the way lilacs "put off" a smell.
You also control your narrative distance when you choose which details of your settings and characters to include. For one thing, we see what we expect to see, look for what interests us, notice what we feel is important. When your descriptions include only the details your viewpoint character would notice, you're writing from an intimate point of view. If, for instance, your viewpoint character walks into a strange room and notices first whether or not the books are lined up on the shelves and the paintings are hung straight, you learn as much about the narrator as you do about the owner of the room.
The details we notice also depend on our state of mind. If your hero is fleeing for his life through the woods, he probably won't notice what species the trees are as they flash by. If your heroine is fighting for her life, you might describe her enemy's movements in precise detail to underscore her tightly-focused attention. When you describe details that aren't appropriate to your character's state of mind or history, you're putting more narrative distance between your character and your readers.
Another stylistic technique that controls narrative distance is how you handle your interior monologue. The more intimate your writing, the more the interior monologue starts to blend into the descriptions. The more distant your writing, the more you set your interior monologue apart through separate paragraphs, italics or even thinker attributions ("he wondered," "she thought").
For instance, consider this passage:
There had been no rain for two weeks. Last year's dried leaves crackled underfoot as Winston made his morning trek down Spruce Corner Road to the mailbox at the intersection. Then, just before he stepped out of the woodland and into the open land near Dymond's farm, he sniffed. Wood smoke. Brush fire? It was too warm for anyone to be using a stove. Or had the neighbors started a brushburn without a permit again?
And now a more intimate version:
Hadn't been rain for coming on two weeks, and the leaves crunched underfoot. Winston would have to get the hose out of the basement when he got home, get some water on the garden. He stepped out into Dymond's land and stopped. Was that wood smoke? It was too warm for anyone to be using a stove. Brush fire? Or had the neighbors started a brushburn without a permit again?
Note how the other techniques for controlling narrative distance are reinforced by the handling of the interior monologue mechanics. When the language is more idiomatic ("Hadn't been…" rather than "There had been no…") and the choice of details more personal (Winston probably wouldn't think of the name of the road he walked every morning), the interior monologue should blend seamlessly into the narrative. When the language is more neutral and the details impersonal, Winston's thoughts should be marked off as something separate.
Finally, you can control your narrative distance by how much you allow your viewpoint character's emotions to color your descriptions. For instance, while I worked on this article, I was watching snow fall outside my office window. We'd had two feet earlier in the week and were expecting another six inches - I was already walking the dog on snowshoes. A scene written from my point of view might describe the snow as falling "slowly and inexorably, smothering the landscape." The two little girls who live down the road, and whom I saw leaping from their swing into the soft drifts after the last storm, would doubtless feel very differently about it. A scene from one of their points of view might describe the snow "floating gently down and making the yard fresh and new again." Same facts, different feelings.
Note, by the way, that narrative distance really only applies to writing from your character's viewpoint in the third person. The first person, where the narrator talks directly to readers, is intimate by definition. The omniscient, where the narrator is not a character, is as distant as you can get. It is only when you use your viewpoint character in the third person that you have some control over the narrative distance.
Getting Up Close and Personal
So how do you determine how much narrative distance you need? In most cases, the more intimate your point of view the better, simply because an intimate point of view is such a powerful storytelling tool.
For instance, allowing your viewpoint character's feelings of the moment to color your descriptions lets you convey a wide range of emotions, including ones so subtle that your viewpoint character may not even be aware of them. This can be a powerful corrective for writers who take the "show, don't tell" advice too much to heart, stripping all hint of emotion out of their narrative for fear of slipping into purple prose. The result is often writing that is cold and spare, if not worse.
I once had a client who tried to convey nearly all of his characters' emotion through dialogue and interior monologue. As a result, his characters only felt the most self-conscious, intrusive emotions — primarily anger, fear and lust, which wore on his readers after a while. He had to learn to allow his viewpoint character's mood to color his narration before he could capture ennui, anticipation, contentment and a host of subtler emotions.
How do you avoid purple prose if you write with narrative intimacy? The key is to pay attention to your viewpoint character. It's usually only when an author focuses too much on trying to achieve an effect that the metaphors start to grow forced and the language turgid. Forget the reviewers, focus on your characters, and you will probably be all right.
Showing your readers the world as your viewpoint character sees it is also a terrific way to generate sympathy for your character. It's hard not to understand and appreciate somebody when you're seeing life through their eyes. This is true even if you disagree with them.
I once received a workshop submission from an author who opened her mystery with a narrated statement against the destruction of woodlands for the sake of development. She needed to lay these ideas out because they would eventually lead to the murder of an environmentalist. She wanted to know how she could make the statement without alienating readers who weren't environmentalists. I suggested that she open with a scene in which her environmentalist took a walk through a new development, remembering what it used to look like and seeing the damage done. Because readers inhabited the environmentalist's head and experienced her love of the woodlands and sorrow at their destruction, they were drawn to her. They may have still disagreed with her, but they felt what she felt, and that created a human connection that transcended differences of opinion.
Finally, because an intimate point of view lets you build your characters' history into the narrative, it allows you to convey the facts of that history powerfully and subtly. For instance, if your point of view character spots an old Mustang and recognizes from the sound that it has a 302 Windsor under the hood with dual carbs and a Holly glasspack muffler, then you get a feel for how he spent his high school years. Or, as was the case in a Writer's Clinic submission, if your main character idly thinks about how much she enjoys staying up all night and plans to meet a friend she's known for seven centuries, you eventually get the feeling she's a vampire.
When to Pull Back
Of course, there are times when you're going to want more narrative distance, when you want the narrative voice divorced from the point of view character's voice. Say, for instance, that in order to set up a particular plot twist, you need to show a scene from the point of view of a very minor character — what is known in theater as a "spear carrier." If you were to write the scene with great narrative intimacy, you would leave your reader feeling that they knew your spear carrier well and that he was a much more important character than he really is. So you might want to write that scene from a bland distance, so your readers pay more attention to the facts than to the character you needed to use to convey them.
Another case where you might opt for more narrative distance is where your character is in a state of mind that's painful or difficult to inhabit. If your viewpoint character is sinking into a drug-induced delirium, for instance, you'll probably want to back away from him or her. There's only so much delirium your readers can stand.
Take for instance, Claudia Osborne's Over My Head, her memoir of how she recovered from a head injury caused by a bicycle accident. The injury robbed her of her short-term memory to the point where she had to write notes to herself reminding her to eat breakfast or carry bus fare. If she were to write scenes of her altered state with narrative intimacy, readers would be left as hopelessly confused as she was. She had to write her scenes with just enough intimacy to convey her confusion clearly.
Finally, there are certain states of mind that can only be conveyed by using narrative distance. Powerful emotions often blow through children who don't yet have the language to describe them. Truly capturing a moment of ecstasy or epiphany in words is beyond most people's capabilities. So what language do you use to convey states of mind that your characters themselves could probably never convey?
Consider the following passage from Edith Pargeter's The Eighth Champion of Christendom, in which Jim, her main character, first hears the radio announcement of England's declaration of war on Germany in 1939:
"That means we've declared war. Did you hear that, Dad? We've declared war." "'Bout time too," said his father roundly. "Folks was beginning to wonder if they meant to." But it was easy for him. He was old. He didn't have to turn around and look at the thing and find it the only thing in the world. His very self would endure and would not be changed. The responsibility was not his, the terror was not his. If there should be a vision, the vision would not be his, and that was gain as well as loss. To be an old man at war, with the weight of life behind you and little need to do anything about anything, that was an easy thing. But to have the whole of life ahead of you, and to have the earth reeling under your feet and the sky bowing over your head, and to feel fallen on your sole self the onus of keeping the one secure and the other suspended, that was not so easy. He didn't think of it like that. He thought, I'll have to make up my mind what to do. Up to me to do something now. Nothing clearer, nothing more complex than that.
Note that Pargeter's narrative voice here is quite distant. She clearly marks off Jim's conscious thoughts, for instance, and "fallen on your sole self the onus" is probably not a phrase that Jim would come up with on his own. But though the passage isn't in Jim's voice, it clearly conveys his complex state of mind at a critical moment in the story. The language is sophisticated, but because Pargeter stays focused on Jim, it never goes over the edge into purple prose.
So experiment with narrative distance. Learn to judge how close you are to your characters and to decide how close you want to be. Once you're familiar with the tool, you can use it for some remarkable effects.
Some years ago I worked with a client whose main character discovered her husband dead in their bedroom. The key scene started with her arrival home after a nighttime meeting, tracking her driving through the neighborhood, walking up her walk, moving through the house. And the closer she got to the bedroom, the more intimate the narrative grew. At the beginning her interior monologue was in the present tense and in separate paragraphs. By the time she snapped on the bedroom light and saw the body, it was in past tense and blended seamlessly with the descriptions. Readers would doubtless never notice the mechanics at work, but the effect was to subtly build the tension right up to the moment of revelation.
That's the kind of power control of your narrative distance can give you.

goalie carey: A Statistical Tribute
Background Many Montreal Canadiens fans have noticed that the club's starting goaltender Carey Price plays exceptionally well on Saturday nights. I mean exceptionally well, even compared to his usual exceptionally-good play. See here an image religiously posted by Canadiens fans after a Saturday night win: I was curious about how big the “Saturday night effect” really is. It's hard to find NHL statistics broken down by day-of-the-week, so I did a little bit of web scraping and analysis. I also look the opportunity to give a simple but somewhat accurate explaination of classical statistical hypothesis testing.
Basics Including playoffs, Price has played in 558 total NHL games. He was awarded a decision (credited with either a win, loss or overtime loss) in 545 of those games. His record is 290-200-55 To begin, let's focus on just the regular season, as the playoffs are a different beast, where every night is Satuday night. Carey has played in 504 regular season games, with 495 decisions, for a record of 267-173-55 Without further ado, Carey Price's regular season record on Saturday nights is 92-31-18 for a win percentage of 65.2%. Compare this to his season record on all of the other nights: 175-142-37 On the other nights of the week, Carey wins 49.4% of his games.
Pretty pictures That seem like a pretty big difference. Here it is graphically: Just from those numbers we can't tell the whole story: do other days stand out? Are Saturdays actually good or is some other day just really bad? Here are Carey's percentage wins, losses and overtime losses for each day of the week: That's pretty impressive! We see that Saturday really is a stand out day, with a 10-point higher win percentage than any other night. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays are Price's best nights. Interestingly, Friday stands out as Carey's worst night: it is the only night with more regulation losses than wins (Wednesday is exactly even). There's one problem: by looking at percentages only we may have a skewed idea of what is going on. While good for direclty comparing days of the week, this view sells short how much Carey wins overall, because it does not take into account the fact that more games are played on certain days. So now let's look at the raw count of each results on each Day: Aha! Price wins the biggest majority of his games on the days when the most games are played. Furthermore, his weakest day, Friday, is not that big of a game night. In fact, the three days we picked out as being Carey's best are also the days with the most games. Carey's record is best on the most popular game nights, making him a winning goaltender over all: So far everything we've looked at has been based on the outcomes of entire games. Is it really Carey that play wells on Saturdays or are the Habs just better in general? Because the two are so linked, this would be a good question to look into in its own right, by pulling in a bunch of team stats, looking at games without Price, etc. For now I'm happy to just look at Price's save percentage and call it a day: Indeed, Price's best save percentage is on Saturdays. That doesn't mean his play is solely responsible for the high proportion of Saturday wins, but it does support the idea that Carey plays at his best on Saturdays.
A simple statistical test in detail I'm going to go into a lot of detail for those interested understanding the basics of statistical testings. If you don't care or already know this, the long and short is that Carey really does win “statistically significantly” more on Saturdays. Looking at these plots is nice, and they show that Carey's record is better on Saturdays than the other nights of the week. But we wonder whether this is just a fluke. After all, if you flipped coins every day of the week, some days are going to have more heads than others, just due to chance. This sort of question is where “statistical significance” comes into play. Stated very simply, the idea of statistical significance just involves combining the difference in win percentage with information about sample size. For better or for worse, the standard approach to determining statistical significance uses “classical” statistical hypothesis testing. I had one specific question, that I had in my head before I saw any data: “Does Carey Price really win more on Saturday Nights?” To rigorously interpret a statistical test, it's important to know the research question ahead of time and stick to it. The hypotheses we are testing are: \[\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \text{Null Hypothesis }(H_0) & \; \text{: Carey wins the same proportion of games regardless of whether it is Saturday or not} \\ \text{Alt. Hypothesis }(H_1) & \; \text{: Carey wins a higher proportion of games on Saturdays than on other days} \end{aligned} \end{equation}\] Our test will either present strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, or it won't. The evidence will come in the form of a test statistic, a number that summarizes information about the relative proportions of wins on each type of night, along with the sample sizes. The classical approach is pretty much: if this test statistic is big enough, we will reject \(H_0\). This means we conclude that Carey wins more on Saturdays. If the test statistic is not begin enough, we are stuck with our null hypothesis. We haven't proved that the null hypothesis is true, we've just failed to find any evidence that the alternative is better. To start, we a choosey statistical model for the data, which involves making some assumptions and simplifications. My model views each game as a Bernoulli trial, from one of two populations (Saturday games and non- Saturday games). This means that the Saturday games in our dataset are a random sample from a hypothetical, infinite population of Saturday games, that all share a common probability of a win, \(p_1\). Similarly the non-Saturday games are a sample from a population with a possibly different chance of winning, \(p_2\). Our hypothesis test can then be stated: \[\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} H_0: \; & p_1 = p_2 \\ H_1: \; & p_1 > p_2 \end{aligned} \end{equation}\] Now, we form our test statistic \(Z\), which depends on the observed proportions of wins, as well as the number of games worth of data we have: \[ \frac{p_1 - p_2}{ \sqrt{ p ( 1 - p ) [ (1/n_1) + (1/n_2) ] } } \] where \(p_1\) is the Saturday win percentage, \(p_2\) is the non-Saturday win percentage, \(n_1\) is the number of Saturday games, \(n_2\) is the number of non-Saturday games, and \(p\) is the overall win percentage. Why this statistic? See here. Without getting into the math, you can see some basic facts about this statistic: the greater \(p_1\) is compared to \(p_2\) , the bigger the statistic
is compared to , the bigger the statistic the larger \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are, the bigger the statistic For our data, \(p_1 = 0.652\), \(n_1 = 141\), \(p_2 = 0.494\), and \(n_2 = 354\). So \(Z \approx 3.186\). As I mentioned, the larger \(Z\), the stronger the evidence that Carey wins more on Saturdays. From the test statistic, we can compute the infamous “\(p\)-value”. The \(p\) value is the probability, if the null hypothesis were true, that our test-statistic would come out to be \(3.186\) or bigger. In plainer speak, the \(p\)-value is the chance that we would see Carey win at least this much more on Saturdays, even if the Saturday effect isn't real. Two things can increase \(Z\): seeing a higher difference in win percentage, or observing more games. For our data, the \(p\)-value is \(7.22\times 10^{-4}\), or almost exactly \(0.001\). This means that the chances we saw such a big Z value given no real improvement on Saturdays is about \(1/1000\). At any reasonable confidence level, I conclude Mr. Saturday night is statistically legit.
The Playoffs As a Habs fan, I hate to say it, but in the playoffs the Mr. Saturday Night effect is not present. If anything, it's reversed. Remember that the sample size of playoff games is small, so this data is not as informative. I've run out of steam on this whole thing, so I'm just going to present the playoff results without any hard-hitting analysis. All ears to comments on this reversal. First off, the win percentage plot again: And here is the raw count plot: Saturdays look rough. Does Carey really play worse on Saturdays in the playoffs though? Let's look at the SV% plot: I hate to even bring this up because Carey price is the closest thing to a god that I believe in, but if the Habs are going to win a cup, the Saturday night magic must continue on through to the post season. If you're wondering, including the playoff data in all of the previous analysis doesn't change anything much. The number of playoffs games (54) is so small compared to regular season games (504) that the effect is minimal.
All Birmingham City Schools students now receive free breakfast and lunch regardless of their family's income, the school system announced on Monday.
The free meals are made possible by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Community Eligibility Provision. This program allows school districts in the nation's highest poverty areas to provide free meals to all students without collecting household applications.
According to Birmingham City Schools, the free breakfast and lunch program started at the beginning of the 2017-18 school year.
Eligibility for participation is determined by information from other programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance Program for Needy Families (TANF).
Students, however, don't have to apply for the program.
"Nutrition plays a major role in the healthy growth and development of students, and we want to ensure that every child has access to a healthy breakfast and lunch each day," said Michelle Sailes, Director of Child Nutrition for BCS. "When students are fed and are receiving proper nutrition, they are able to focus in school which leads to better overall academic performance."
Faculty and guest meals will be charged at normal price, according to the school system. Students will also have the option to purchase a la carte items.
Florida man runs into flaming house to save woman, her two dogs Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Florida man saves dogs (Photo via NBC) Good Samaritan saves woman, 2 dogs from house fire Florida man saves dogs (Photo via NBC) prev next
NBC News - BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. (WESH) -- A Good Samaritan saw a Cocoa, Florida home on fire Tuesday and ran into the flames to save a woman and two of her dogs.
"Driving by and I have seen some clouds and it was too big to be a bonfire," Josh Leissa said.
Leissa decided he needed to act.
"I went into the front door and that part was blocked so I couldn't go in there. So I had to go to the back and she was in the back room." he said. " A lot of smoke. Could barely see anything."
Inside Leissa found a woman lying down, the only protection he could offer her was a yellow rain poncho.
"I grabbed her and her dogs and got her out of there," Leissa said.
People are arguing about whether genetically modified foods should carry labels. But the next generation of GMOs might not only be unlabeled—they might be unregulated.
Over at Scientific American you can read a 6,000-word story about how one such organism, a GM mushroom, was created. The short version is that a plant scientist named Yinong Yang used the gene-editing technique called CRISPR to snip out a few DNA letters in the genome of “Agaricus bisporus, the most popular dinner-table mushroom in the Western world.”
The result: he turned off an enzyme that turns mushrooms brown.
Why wouldn't a modified mushroom be regulated, you ask? Because regulation of GMOs is a big mess that doesn't make too much sense. Back in the 1990s, when Monsanto and the like were first coming out with biotech crops, the U.S. cobbled together a way to regulate them from existing rules.
Those early GMOs (and most since) had genes from bacteria in them, like the gene that makes Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans survive a dousing of weed killer. What the U.S. Department of Agriculture decided is, since the plants had DNA from germs, it could regulate these crops under its authority to control plant pests.
But Yang's mushroom doesn't have any bacterial DNA in its genome. He didn't add any DNA at all, he told the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Instead, he just used gene-editing to blow a few teeny little holes in one gene and shut it off.
As a result, the USDA's APHIS division told Yang his GMO plant isn't going to be regulated because it sidesteps the regulation:
APHIS has concluded that your CRISPR/Cas9-edited white button mushrooms as described in your letter do not contain any introduced genetic material. APHIS has no reason to believe that CRISPR/Cas9-edited white button mushrooms are plant pests.
It's not the first product to get cleared in this way. Last summer we wrote about a potato with a similar modification, also to stop browning, and there have been a handful of others.
Biotech plant companies are excited. They're going to be able to innovate fast now that they don't have to spend a decade doing field trials.
Regulators are scrambling to catch up with the science. Right now, the U.S. is revisiting its rules governing how GMOs should be handled and crop developers are also “anxiously waiting” to find out if gene-edited plants will be treated any differently in Europe, according to Jennifer Kuzma, a professor and policy researcher at North Carolina State University.
Kuzma's recent analysis of GMO regulations will interest anyone who wants the details. Her takeaway is that “oversight of [genetic-engineering] has never seemed so much like a powder keg waiting to explode.” She thinks the rise of gene editing is “a chance to start over” with regulations that make more sense scientifically but that also find a way to reflect the “values” of people who oppose GMOs and just don't like messing with nature.
Don't hold your breath for this mushroom to hit store shelves. Yang, a professor at Pennsylvania State University, told me that the company that helped pay for the research, Giorgio Mushroom Co. of Pennsylvania, isn't convinced they'd want to sell it. “[The] marketing people at Giorgio are more interested in organic mushrooms and are afraid of negative response regarding GMO from consumers,” Yang says.

How People Find Lawyers in 2015
Curious about how people find lawyers in 2015, Moses & Rooth Attorneys at Law partnered with Mike Blumenthal to survey over 1500 people nationwide who recently hired a lawyer. Taking into consideration survey participants' gender, age, location, urban density, income, and parental status, we wanted to share the survey results and hope you find the data as interesting as we did.
Most Common Way: Through a Friend
People turn to their friends for a lot of reasons, including legal problems. Across all demographics, the most common method of choosing a lawyer was through a friend. There were only two exceptions to this trend:
Survey participants ages 18 to 24 years-old were more likely to search the internet to find a lawyer. In fact, 17.8% of survey participants in this age category said they had retained a lawyer via the web compared to only 12.1% who indicated they had chosen a lawyer based on a friend's recommendation. Survey participants earning more than $150,000 per year were more likely to choose an attorney based on an internet search, than via a friend.
With the help of NiftyLaw, we put together this visualization to represent the data.

Additional Insights
Friend recommendations, referrals and word of mouth continue to dominate in lawyer marketing.
More women retain lawyers than men based on friend recommendations.
The use of the internet is growing and appears to be giving word of mouth some legitimate competition.
People with higher income rely heavily on the internet to find lawyers.
Younger generations also rely heavily on the internet.
Lawyers can expect continual increase in traffic to their sites as younger generations grow older.
Among the least sought out methods were recommendations based on TV, using the phone book, being in jail and using LegalShield. All other methods were much less prominent than a friend, referral and the internet.
*the question that consumers answered in the survey was an open ended question.
US President Barack Obama begins his second term having failed to honor a promise from his first to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, to the bitter regret of prisoner 552, Fayez al-Kandari.
The 34-year-old Kuwaiti, accused by US authorities of being an advisor to slain Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, was one of the first captives to be flown to the US naval base in Cuba and has languished there for 11 years.
It took six years for the US military to charge Al-Kandari with giving “material support to terrorism” and five more to abandon the case. Now he is deemed too dangerous to release but no longer faces prosecution.
When Obama was elected in 2008, he promised to close the prison camp.
But his plan was thwarted when some countries were reluctant to accept the return of their nationals and when US lawmakers banned the military from transferring prisoners to the United States for trial or sending them abroad.
Obama's decision last week to re-authorize the law imposing this ban was another blow for Al-Kandari and his 165 fellow detainees.
Al-Kandari agreed to talk to AFP via email, the mails passed to our reporter by the military lawyer assigned to represent him, Colonel Barry Wingard, in the first interview of its kind at Guantanamo.
“Each time Colonel Wingard travels to Gitmo to visit me,” Al-Kandari said, “my first question to him is ‘Have you found justice for me today?' And sadly he has answered every time: ‘Unfortunately, Fayez, I have no justice today'.”
Al-Kandari was seized in Afghanistan in December 2001, three months after the September 11 attacks by hijackers who flew airliners into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, killing 2,977 people.
The Pentagon says Al-Kandari “was an al-Qaeda propagandist who produced and distributed multimedia recruitment material and wrote newspaper articles paying tribute to the September 11, 2001 hijackers.”
The military has thus deemed him “high risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests and allies.”
For his part, Al-Kandari insists he was in Afghanistan for charity work and is innocent of all allegations. Since the United States has failed to bring him to trial and Kuwait has not pushed for his release, the matter is unresolved.
In the meantime, he describes his indefinite detention as an “agony” that began with rough treatment in transit, harsh interrogations and abuse — even if the regime has mellowed slightly in recent years.
“In May 2002, I was drugged, my ears were plugged, I was diapered and a sandbag was shoved over my head. I was hustled into a military aircraft, where I was short-shackled to the deck before a rough takeoff,” he told AFP.
“After what it seemed to be an eternity, I landed in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, my agony to this day,” he added.
“In the early days, I was interrogated over 300 times,” he said.
“I was shackled to the floor of the interrogation room, sometimes for as long as 36 hours. Ice cold water was thrown on my naked body, and barking dogs were brought into the room,” he said.
In an account that matches those of several other detainees now released, he alleged that during the years of his detention, he has been dragged roughly from his cell and subjected to racial and religious abuse.
Over time, he admits, physical mistreatment has waned, and now: “There is a relative peace in the prison, which is based on mutual respect.”
But he is still angry with US authorities and in particular with Obama over his failure to close the Guantanamo jail, a controversial military detention center on Cuban soil beyond the reach of US justice.
“I feel extremely let down by President Obama,” he said.
“To add insult to injury, for the second straight year, Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act that allows for the indefinite military detention of any individual,” he said.
Obama signed the act last week, an annual measure, and one of his last before he is sworn in for a second term on January 20.
The president spoke of his regret that he has not closed Guantanamo even as he signed the act, which Republican lawmakers ensured retained clauses stopping the use of federal funds to transfer prisoners home or to the US mainland.
“I continue to believe that operating the facility weakens our national security by wasting resources, damaging our relationships with key allies, and strengthening our enemies,” Obama said.
“The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers,” he added.
At its busiest moment in 2003, Guantanamo held 680 prisoners and in all 779 detainees have spent time in its high security compounds, condemned by rights groups as a zone beyond the reach of law that stains America's reputation.
The former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo, former Air Force colonel Morris Davis, has spoken out since his resignation against the interrogation tactics used and the shortcomings of the military commissions process.
He told AFP Obama must share the blame for the detainees' legal limbo.
“I believe he was sincere when he said he wanted to close Gitmo when he first ran for office in 2008 and I think he would still like to close it now — what I think he lacks is the political will to make it happen,” he said.
“Some of the detainees will mark the 11th anniversary of their arrival at Gitmo on January 11th. I suspect it may not be the last one for many if not most of them,” he said.
Of the 779 inmates only nine were ever convicted or brought to trial, and of the 166 who remain, 55 are considered safe to be released by the US military, but have nowhere to go. But Al-Kandari has not given up hope.
“I am happy for all the former prisoners who were released,” he told AFP. “It gives me hope that my turn will be next. I am optimistic that I will soon be released. My faith in God has never been so unshakable.”

(1/9/16 @ 12:41am) If there is no collision model on a bridge you walked into, download the latest build!
(1/9/16 @ 10:41am) Fixed a bug with collision models not registering properly. I believe the SFX in the game starting up silent on first bootup until changed bug has been fixed, if someone could let me know, that'd be great. Also the menus are fully displayed at all times now, and there's an option for enabling and disabling Depth of Field.
(1/12/16 @ 11:06am) Changed credits to be displyed along with the controls screen upon starting the game. MAY have fixed the sound bug. Fixed awkward collision model in cabin. Added 'SFX' text back to option slider.
A petition for former “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart to moderate a 2016 presidential debate has passed 100,000 signatures, gaining steam over the past few hours.
The Change.org petition says that Stewart has become influential and iconic when it comes to covering U.S. politics and media.
“Jon Stewart is more than qualified to tackle the moderating job,” the petition states. “Mr. Stewart has interviewed 15 heads of state, 22 members of the United States Cabinet, 32 members of the United States Senate, 7 members of the United States House of Representatives, and scores of other political leaders from this country and around the world while establishing himself as the most trusted person in (satirical) news.”
Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley even endorsed the notion via Twitter.
Stewart's opopportunities seem to be piling up in his post-“Daily Show” career. It was announced this week that Stewart will host Sunday's WWE SummerSlam.
Stewart stepped down from “The Daily Show” earlier in August. He ended his final episode by telling the audience that his 16-year-long conversation with them wasn't over. “We are merely taking a small pause in the conversation,” he said, “a conversation, which, by the way, I have hogged, and I apologize for that.” Trevor Noah will take over “The Daily Show” beginning Sept. 28 on Comedy Central.
The Cavaliers are still atop the Eastern Conference, but the past month has been a mess. How much can be attributed to the JR Smith injury?
JR Smith moved into Cleveland like a hurricane. He burst into the starting lineup while Iman Shumpert recovered from injury and never looked back. He immediately improved his stats - Points, FG%, Win Shares, Plus/Minus, and Rebounds immediately went up in Cleveland. He was one of the only guys not named LeBron James who made it through the 2015 NBA Finals in one piece and it kept him in the starting lineup for the 2015-16 campaign.
In that season, of course, he endeared himself to the Cavalier faithful, had the lowest turnover percentage of his career, shot 40% from beyond the arc, and played all-out hustle-defense throughout the season. The Cavs won the title, JR Smith gave a tear-jerking speech at the podium, famously stopped wearing shirts, and was rewarded with a four-year $57 million contract.
Life was good.
The contract was seen as a bit much, but Smith used the leverage he had by being a client of LeBron's management group and secure the money he felt he deserved. I wrote on multiple occasions that I supported the big contract, but there was little doubt that he'd continue to play well.
JR tweaked his ankle early this season and missed three games. There was a small fear that it could linger, but it didn't and he was quickly back in the lineup. Then came the thumb injury.
Since the thumb injury, things have taken a turn. But how bad has it been?
The Stats
The Cavaliers are 16-5 this year when JR Smith is in the lineup. Prior to the injury, the Cavaliers were shooting 40% from deep as a team, outscoring their opponents by about 7 points per 100 possessions, and taking care of the basketball. Below are the simple stat-line and the advanced stat-line for the team before JR went down.
Since then...not so much.
The Cavs are 17-10 without JR Smith (16-10 before the Minnesota win Wednesday night). Scoring is down. Shooting percentage is down. Plus/Minus is down. Win percentage is down. Assist to turnover percentage is down. The PIE stat is NBA.com's way of tracking how well a team is doing overall with one statistic. 50% means you're a dead-average team. If you're over 50%, that means you're likely to be a winning team. The Cavs' PIE is, of course, down.
In short, nearly every team statistic has gotten worse.
The Personnel
It's no secret that the injury to JR Smith was a factor in the decision to get Kyle Korver. The Cavs were hurting for some offense in the second unit - Shumpert had been playing extremely well but was heading back into the starting lineup with JR out. The fallout has been added stress on the rest of the lineup.
Most notably, the lineup stress has fallen on LeBron James. James averaged a surprisingly high 37.1 minutes per game before JR's injury. The following night he played 34 minutes and followed that up with 28 in a blowout win over Brooklyn. Since then, however, he's averaged 38.7 minutes a night. With a "point guard by committee" approach when Kyrie Irving is off the floor, it's been more James. While JR Smith isn't known to fit that role, he would be one more player to split the load, perhaps reducing minutes by a small amount for those around him.
The second aspect of this personnel shakeup is that his role wasn't exactly a plug-n-play replacement. Despite shooting poorly at the start of the season, JR averaged nine field goal attempts and almost seven three-pointers per game. Those shots went up for grabs the moment he went down. That's why Korver arrived; without Korver, who would those shots go to? Maybe Irving, possibly LeBron, but did the Cavalier brass think that spreading nine extra field goals between a suddenly off-the-mark RJ, Shumpert, Liggins, and Mike Dunleavy was a good idea? The answer was no, and that's how Korver got to Cleveland.
Korver needs to have someone who can feed him the ball. That leads to LBJ's minutes staying high or Kyrie playing with the second unit more. That leads to less function as the team works to get Korver shots and abandons the offensive gameplan (which sort of exists in the first place). That confusion about who should be doing what and when they should do it leads to losses. Those losses lead to LeBron publicly demanding a "playmaker."
This isn't to say that the Cavaliers would be 40-10 if JR were healthy, but it's hard to imagine them going 7-8 in January if JR Smith had both thumbs available.
The Money
So now the Cavaliers need that alleged playmaker. They held a workout for Mario Chalmers, Kirk Hinrich, Lance Stephenson, and Jordan Farmar, figuring that one of these guys could fit the bill. Fine. But these guys only fit the bill because they don't cost much money.
All of these trade rumors that are swirling will be nearly impossible for Cleveland to pull off because they don't have any money. Dan Gilbert is willing to pay high tax penalties, but it's still not likely that the Cavs' salaries will work. The salaries don't work because Gilbert was already willing to pay high tax penalties instead of being more uptight with contracts.
This one isn't JR Smith's fault because, again, I thought he deserved the contract that he got and you can't blame a guy for taking the money he's offered, but it's at least partly his fault. The JR contract, the Tristan contract, the Shump contract... those are the reasons the Cavaliers can't make trades. Nobody was offering JR $14.5 million per year, just like nobody was offering Tristan $16 million per year. The end result is that nobody is willing to make a trade for guys who are overpaid* even if they're good players. The Cavs are just completely hamstrung by their payroll.
Fortunately, it's a good roster. They're just playing poorly right now.
I am in no way advocating for the Cavs to trade either TT or JR. I don't want the Cavs to get rid of any of the guys they have, which is why this is such a frustrating time.
• A daily summary of global reports on security issues.
Right-wing militia groups are on the rise in the United States after nearly a decade of obscurity, according to a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors hate groups and extremist activity.
The report, released Wednesday, warns of "unmistakable signs of a revival of what in the 1990s was commonly called the militia movement."
Militia rhetoric is being heard widely once more, often from a second generation of ideologues, and conspiracy theories are being energetically revived or invented anew. "Paper terrorism" — the use of property liens, bogus legal documents and "citizens' grand juries" to attack enemies and, sometimes, reap illegal fortunes — is again proliferating, to the point where the government has set up special efforts to rein in so-called "tax defiers" and to track threats against judges....
Militia training events, huge numbers of which are now viewable on YouTube videos, are spreading. One federal agency estimates that 50 new militia training groups have sprung up in less than two years. Sales of guns and ammunition have skyrocketed amid fears of new gun control laws, much as they did in the 1990s.
The report also cites a range of events and reports as evidence for the purported upswing in militia activities, including the murders of six law enforcement officials over the last several months by those espousing anti-government, racist, or pro-militia beliefs. It also singles out the June shooting of a National Holocaust Museum guard by James Von Brunn, who had ties to white supremacist groups, as The Christian Science Monitor reported.
The SPLC report also claims that with the election of Barack Obama to the head of the US government, which militias typically perceive as their enemy, the messages of militias, not traditionally focused on racial hatred, have taken on racial undertones.
Agence France-Presse reports that some experts believe that the upsurge in militias is in part caused by "a vibrant world of unsubstantiated yet widely publicized conspiracies."
Fox News writes that conservative groups are dismissing the report, which they say relies on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report released earlier this year on right-wing extremism. They say that the DHS report relies on unofficial reports and unfairly lumps together legitimate critics of the Obama administration with radical militias, and as a result the new SPLC report is suspect for the same reasons.
They are attempting to brand all right-of-center protesters as potential domestic terrorists or extremists," [William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC,] said. "They are painting whole swaths of people as hate groups and extremists."
As for the purported rise in "militia" groups, which SPLC includes as part of the broader anti-government "Patriot" movement, Gheen said: "We're just not seeing it."
Dwight Lewis, a columnist for The Tennessean, writes that "the Southern Poverty Law Center's track record is one that doesn't show it disseminates information to the public just to be blowing smoke."
Consider the letter SPLC officials wrote to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno 15 years ago warning about extremists in the militia movement, saying that the "mixture of armed groups and those who hate'' was "a recipe for disaster.''
Six months later, the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed.
Yes, we've got to take note of the return of these right-wing militia groups, but more importantly, government and law enforcement officials need to make sure they're kept in check.

Text description provided by the architects. Bravo House is organized by two bodies that articulate through a double-height ceiling lobby that works as the house entrance, it also works as a transition space between the social and the private areas of the house. Surrounding the house there are a variety of gardens which size and proportion vary depending on the characteristics of the interior space for which they work.
The L shaped building “hugs” the main garden from the side. In the access through the garden, the Sierra Madre works as a background thanks to the view it offers. The house receives the visitors with a double-height doorway which works as a preface for the interior spaces.
The north-south orientation of the terrain site allows the house facades to open directly to the north, turning its views to Garza Garcia, Valle Oriente and Loma Larga. The south-east facade opens through a series of small-discrete windows and wall openings that frame certain views of the Sierra Madre.
The Bravo house is built in a residential development which urban image was designed with the collaboration of the same architects that worked in the Bravo project. The geographic characteristics of the residential development (framed by mountains and irregular topography), so as its urban image, were conceived to remark the natural context of the site, these were the basis of the design of the project.
The house have walls that hide and reduces spaces, these walls force the visitor to realize certain walkthroughs that reveal the richness and complexity of these spaces. This idea is based on the concept of the residential development, which consist in a series of walls that form walking and vehicular ways that create spatial sequences.
The house is located in the superior part of the terrain, so the main garden is placed in front. The access separates de house from the street creating a traverse through an open space, the garden and the doorway before the double-height ceiling lobby exposes.
The placement of the house over the terrain is achieved with platforms slightly stepped. The main facades were designed according to its orientation. TO the north they're open, and to the east they're closed. The floating slab and the walls work as curtains to protect the house of the east sun, leaving just some openings that allows certain views.
The house is conformed almost in its totality of exposed concrete. The use of this material enforces the sincere and definite character of the design.
The steel and crystal elements enforce the tectonic clarity of the house. These materials were used in carefully planed details and finally executed.
The wood elements of the access doorway enforce the space character of the place as one to welcome and stay.
Schizophrenia is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with dysfunction in the cholinergic system. Early prevention is a target of treatment to improve long-term outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated the preventive effects of omega-3 fatty acids on AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum in an animal model of schizophrenia.
Young Wistar rats (30 days old) were initially treated with omega-3 fatty acids or vehicle alone. Animals received ketamine to induce an animal model of schizophrenia or saline plus omega-3 fatty acids or vehicle alone for 7 consecutive days beginning on day 15. A total of 22 days elapsed between the treatment and intervention. Animals were sacrificed, and brain structures were dissected to evaluate AChE activity and gene expression.
Key findings
Our results demonstrate that ketamine increased AChE activity in these three structures, and omega-3 fatty acids plus ketamine showed lower values for the studied parameters, which indicate a partial preventive mechanism of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. We observed no effect on AChE expression. Together, these results indicate that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation effectively reduced AChE activity in an animal model of schizophrenia in all studied structures. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that ketamine and omega-3 fatty acids affect the cholinergic system, and this effect may be associated with the physiopathology of schizophrenia. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms that are associated with this effect.
Drill down into any leftist cause and the solution they offer is almost always the same. Socialism. It seems there's no problem which can't be solved by taking wealth from some and giving it to others.
Here's a prime example from Investor's Business Daily:
Another Climate Alarmist Admits Real Motive Behind Warming Scare
Fraud: While the global warming alarmists have done a good job of spreading fright, they haven't been so good at hiding their real motivation. Yet another one has slipped up and revealed the catalyst driving the climate scare.
We have been told now for almost three decades that man has to change his ways or his fossil-fuel emissions will scorch Earth with catastrophic warming. Scientists, politicians and activists have maintained the narrative that their concern is only about caring for our planet and its inhabitants. But this is simply not true. The narrative is a ruse. They are after something entirely different.
If they were honest, the climate alarmists would admit that they are not working feverishly to hold down global temperatures — they would acknowledge that they are instead consumed with the goal of holding down capitalism and establishing a global welfare state.
Have doubts? Then listen to the words of former United Nations climate official Ottmar Edenhofer:
“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole,” said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015.
So what is the goal of environmental policy?
“We redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy,” said Edenhofer.
If you don't read books and don't care about the bookshelves, don't be too quick to close this article. Just think about it. What impression does a room full of books make? That's right! It will immediately make you look smarter!
Make sure to put some smart books about topics you barely understand like quantum physics, advanced mathematics or neuroscience. Then decorate the book display with some antique looking weird sciency things you've found in a thrift store (a figurine of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles won't do this time, sorry). If in need, consult this list of gorgeus bookshelf ideas. Of course, you might run into a problem if some smart ass tries to chit chat about something you have in your bookcase. Don't worry, just fake a phone call and when you finish, no one will ever remember the topic.
Now that we agree that it's essential to have a library, let's take a look at some of the most creative bookshelf designs out there.
Which one of these book racks would you put at your house?
1. The Invisible Book Shelf
“This book shelf, which holds up to 15 pounds of books, screws directly into a wall stud and presto – you have an invisible book shelf! The maximum stack height is 16-Inches.

The books rest on a small wooden plate so the pages stay intact. The plates can be moved back and forth on the bottom of the book to control the height of which the book hangs, making it possible to line different sized books up in a straight line.” (Designers: Agusta Magnusdottir & Gustav Johannsson)
Hassan Hassan on the merger of the three extremist forces loyal to ISIL in Dreaa. This is a big and ominous development, he says
For the past three years, ISIL has tried to establish a footing in southern Syria. It tried in the mountainous Qalamoun region near the Lebanese border, but it was expelled after intermittent clashes with Al Qaeda and Hizbollah. Its attempts to co-opt forces near Damascus did not get far either, particularly as rebels preemptively clamped down on the group's fledgling cells there.
Following its failure to grow organically, it opted last year for a pincer strategy to link up its pockets of control between Palmyra and Homs to ones in Damascus's north east, such as Dumayr. That effort also failed since its territory in the Homs desert was largely cleared by the pro-government forces in April. The group was also expelled from the Palestinian Yarmouk camp after a brief takeover in April last year.
But there is now bad news. In Deraa, ISIL may see not only an opening but that the opening could be the first of its kind in the whole of Syria since the group was formed in April 2013.
Last month, three local groups in Deraa formed Jaysh Khaled bin Al Walid. ISIL announced the merger on Friday. The groups -- namely the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade (YMB), Islamic Muthanna Movement (IMM) and Mujahideen Group – operate mainly in western Deraa. Last Thursday, the US state department designated the YMB as a terrorist group.
For ISIL, the south in general is strategically and symbolically important. Deraa borders Israel and Jordan and has historical resonance. The new formation is named after the historical Muslim figure, Khaled bin Al Walid, who commanded a key battle in the Yarmouk Basin against the Byzantine empire in the 7th century.
Nowhere in Syria has ISIL succeeded in growing organically as it has done in Deraa. This is a remarkable development especially since the Southern Front has been hailed as a good example of international support to the opposition.
Members of the three factions are overwhelmingly locals from Deraa. Many of them are part of prominent tribes in the province. Members often describe the movement as more extreme than Jabhat Al Nusra. Unlike other areas in Syria, these groups have become loyal to ISIL voluntarily rather than because they had no other choice.
The name change to Jaysh, or army, is also meant to affirm the subordination of these groups to ISIL since the organisation does not recognise “movements” or “groups”. The word “Jaysh” suggests the new group will operate as other ISIL's military sections, such as Jaysh Al Khilafah or Jaysh Al Badia. Restructuring of the merged groups is already underway, with reports that the new leader, Abu Othman Al Shami from Idlib, arrived shortly before the merger took place.
ISIL will probably seek to alter the way the new force operates. Before they unified, the three forces were in a constant conflict against rebel forces in Deraa but they rarely coordinated. Recently, the groups started to collaborate but they were also weakened as factions inside the province pushed back against them with help from the multi-country Military Operations Centre in Amman.
The new group will undoubtedly have different priorities and might seek to protect its forces, especially after the US and other countries, including Russia, appear to be turning more attention to it in that region. ISIL is not about to throw such hard-earned strategic assets into an open battle. A combined strategy of persistent fighting and quiet outreach will be its focus, a familiar move by the group.
ISIL will probably benefit from two main factors to increase its presence in Deraa. The Southern Front, a coalition of nationalist forces operating in the south, has been bitterly criticised by people in Syria because it has not conducted meaningful military operations against the regime in recent months. Military stagnation in that region, while Aleppo and Daraya were pounded, is seen as a result of foreign backers' tight control of the Southern Front – unlike the situation in the north where Turkey provides unfettered support to its allies.
Another factor that might help ISIL is that one of the factions of Jabhat Al Nusra, which was known to have strong knowledge of ISIL's operatives and cells in Deraa, had relocated to northern Syria. Unlike other anti-government forces, aside from ISIL, Jabhat Al Nusra has an effective underground apparatus that regularly uncovered ISIL cells undetected by the rebels, whether in Idlib, Homs, Deraa or eastern Syria. Examples are abundant, including the YMB.The loyalty of three groups in the Yarmouk Basin to ISIL presents more than a military challenge. Their members are combat ready and locally entrenched in a strategic area in which ISIL long desired to build influence. These groups are still outnumbered and can be defeated, but the story of how ISIL could establish presence despite persistent setbacks sheds light on its long game.

Four days after our initial report that Uber would soon enter the Cincinnati market, the technology company that has been changing the way people think about the taxi and ridesharing industry officially launched their uberX and uberBLACK services in the Queen City.
With one week remaining on Uber's initial two weeks of free service, people who wish to use the service are asked to download the company's smart phone app and then create an account. This is important because this is how users will pay, rate their drivers and access information about where and how many vehicles are available.
The use of this application also allows Uber to track important data about their drivers and their customers. It also helps the company make business decisions.
“Cincinnati has certainly been a market that's been on our radar for a while,” James Ondrey, Uber's Ohio General Manager, told UrbanCincy by email. “As a tech company that likes to look at data to drive our decisions, we could see that many people had downloaded Uber or opened the app to look for a ride in the Cincinnati area. So there is definitely pent up demand here.”
Beyond that pent up demand, Ondrey also says that changes to Ohio's for-hire-sedan code, which allowed for rates to be charged beyond only an hourly rate, opened the door for Uber to work with area limousine operators using rates based on time and distance.
Cincinnati, however, is not Uber's first market in Ohio. They launched in Columbus in December 2013 and are currently rumored to be eyeing Cleveland for a launch later this year.
“Columbus has been great so far – riders and drivers have been embracing us in drovers and I think the city sees the benefits to having Uber in town,” continued Ondrey, whose position is based out of Columbus. “We expect to see the same here in Cincinnati.”
Ondrey says that the goal is to establish Uber as the most reliable transportation option for Cincinnatians, and he expects that service levels will only improve as they are able to add driver-partners.
“I want you to be able to open your Uber app and always see a car available in less than five minutes,” Ondrey said. “We are in soft launch phase now, so we start with just a handful of initial partners, but you'll see that grow quickly as we try to keep up with all the demand.”
Not everyone, however, has been thrilled about Uber's launch.
One UrbanCincy reader explained difficulties with signing up as a potential uberX driver, and was frustrated by what he perceived as a lack of transparency about the need for cars to be no older than eight years. Other readers from the taxi and limousine industries have also expressed frustration.
Bob Michaels, owner of Crown Car & Coach, told UrbanCincy by email that, “As a black car service operator of 11 years in Cincinnati, it is not the taxi industry that is affect, but our core business also.”
While those issues are sorted out, along with a variety of other complaints that have been lobbed at the startup company, Uber officials are moving forward and happy to bring a new transportation choice to Cincinnatians.
“I think transportation choice is ultimately a great thing for consumers,” Ondrey concluded. “We are bringing efficiency to the transportation system in Cincinnati. And again, consumers will ultimately benefit from that competition.”
“You look at all the resurgence that's happening in Cincy right now – the continued neighborhood development and the increasing desire of folks to return to the urban core – and you can see why it's a match made in heaven.”
In follow-up correspondence with Lyft officials, the company has said that it has not yet decided officially whether it too will enter the Cincinnati market, but conceded that they are considering it at this time.
Stay tuned to UrbanCincy for further developments on that, and for additional reports as we continue to examine the other aspects on the region's car-for-hire industry.

Just one more thing...
We are not a travel agency. We are skiers, snowboarders and above all travelers. We travel to Japan every winter and we do one thing consistently: we travel hard.
We have done this so many times now that we have been on every style of trip you can think of. The family vacation mayhem, sponsored video shoots, exploratory expeditions, gourmet food hunts, mega-resort activity overload days, boys trips, girls trips, yoga retreats, with pro skiers, not-so-pro skiers, young guns and old legends on skinny skis.
We can tell you all about the places we visit and the ones we always return to, but we prefer to let our photos and videos do most of the talking.
If you like what you see, then send us your travel dates and group details using the Contact Us page. We will put together a custom trip for you to have similar experiences in Japan. We will send you an itinerary and quote based on your selections and then tweak the trip from there.

If you happen to be one of those New Yorkers who uses the mostly non-existent/sometimes crappy cellphone service and Wi-Fi inside train stations as a reason to ignore dreaded things like work emails, texts from an ex and the dreaded "showtime," your days of excuses are over.
Wi-Fi is finally arriving at all the train stations of New York City and so is another basic necessity of communication — cell phone service. By Jan. 9, the 5.7 million people who ride the NYC subway system every day will finally be able to access Wi-Fi and cell phone service for all four major carriers(AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless) while underground, according to an announcement by Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
“By bringing Wi-Fi and cell service underground ahead of schedule, we are reimagining our subway stations to meet the needs of the next generation,” Cuomo said in a statement.
Great news: Wi-Fi and cell service will be available underground at ALL @MTA stations as of January 9. pic.twitter.com/LbzD7O6JL8 — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 5, 2017
Along with cell phone service already active inside many train stations, Transit Wireless Wi-Fi is currently active at 277 subway stations.
Nearly every underground station has been connected, according to the governor's office, with the final station — Clark Street on the 2, 3 line in Brooklyn — going live on Jan. 9. The only stations left out are four that are currently under renovation and will be connected as soon as work is completed.
All the new connectivity is coming considerably sooner than usual, with Wi-Fi connection coming two years ahead of schedule and cell phone coverage arriving a year ahead of schedule, the governor's office said. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority sped up the project after Gov. Cuomo announced a directive at the beginning of 2016 requesting that it do so.
But in the year 2017, it's something the city of New York has been waiting quite a while for.

In a wide-ranging interview with the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles, Luz, a major contributing cartoonist to the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, said that he will no longer draw cartoons of the prophet Muhammad.
The announcement comes days before the magazine is scheduled to receive PEN America's Freedom of Expression Courage award, an honor that's been widely protested by prominent writers and critics.
Luz, who's become one of the main cartoonists after a terrorist attack in January that killed eleven and left eight of the magazine's staffers dead, told Inrocks that he was simply tired of drawing Muhammad, as the subject “doesn't appeal to [him] anymore,” he said, according to publications that previewed the interview.
“I've let it go, like I did with Sarkozy,” he added, referring to his old obsession with skewering former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. “I will not spend my life drawing [Muhammad cartoons].”
Luz drew the iconic cover for the first issue of Charlie Hebdo published after the terrorist attacks, which featured a crying Muhammad holding a sign saying “All is forgiven.” Though the cartoon was miles away from the type of sacrilegious cartoons the magazine would draw of the prophet, it immediately drew criticism from the Islamic community (Muhammad cannot be depicted in works of art, period).

“Bernie did well last weekend but he can't possibly win the nomination,” a friend told me for what seemed like the thousandth time, attaching an article from the Washington Post that shows how far behind Bernie remains in delegates.
Wait a minute. Last Tuesday, Sanders won 78 percent of the vote in Idaho and 79 percent in Utah. This past Saturday, he took 82 percent of the vote in Alaska, 73 percent in Washington, and 70 percent in Hawaii.
In fact, since March 15, Bernie has won six out of the seven Democratic primary contests with an average margin of victory of 40 points. Those victories have given him roughly a one hundred additional pledged delegates.
As of now, Hillary Clinton has 54.9 percent of the pledged delegates to Bernie Sanders's 45.1 percent.That's still a sizable gap – but it doesn't make Bernie an impossibility.
Moreover, there are 22 states to go with nearly 45 percent of pledged delegates still up for grabs – and Bernie has positive momentum in almost all of them.
Hillary Clinton's lead in superdelegates will vanish if Bernie gains a majority of pledged delegates.
Bernie is outpacing Hillary Clinton in fundraising. In February, he raised $42 million (from 1.4 million contributions, averaging $30 each), compared to her $30 million. In January he raised $20 million to her $15 million.
By any measure, the enthusiasm for Bernie is huge and keeps growing. He's packing stadiums, young people are flocking to volunteer, support is rising among the middle-aged and boomers.
In Idaho and Alaska he exceeded the record primary turnout in 2008, bringing thousands of new voters. He did the same thing in Colorado, Kansas, Maine, and Michigan as well.

Yet if you read the Washington Post or the New York Times, or watch CNN or even MSNBC, or listen to the major pollsters and pundits, you'd come to the same conclusion as my friend. Every success by Bernie is met with a story or column or talking head whose message is “but he can't possibly win.”
Some Sanders supporters speak in dark tones about a media conspiracy against Bernie. That's baloney. The mainstream media are incapable of conspiring with anyone or anything. They wouldn't dare try. Their reputations are on the line. If the public stops trusting them, their brands are worth nothing.
The real reason the major media can't see what's happening is because the national media exist inside the bubble of establishment politics, centered in Washington, and the bubble of establishment power, centered in New York.
As such, the major national media are interested mainly in personalities and in the money behind the personalities. Political reporting is dominated by stories about the quirks and foibles of the candidates, and about the people and resources behind them.
Within this frame of reference, it seems nonsensical that a 74-year-old Jew from Vermont, originally from Brooklyn, who calls himself a Democratic socialist, who's not a Democratic insider and wasn't even a member of the Democratic Party until recently, who has never been a fixture in the Washington or Manhattan circles of power and influence, and who has no major backers among the political or corporate or Wall Street elites of America, could possibly win the nomination.
But precisely because the major media are habituated to paying attention to personalities, they haven't been attending to Bernie's message – or to its resonance among Democratic and independent voters (as well as many Republicans). The major media don't know how to report on movements.
In addition, because the major media depend on the wealthy and powerful for revenues, because their reporters and columnists rely on the establishment for news and access, because their top media personalities socialize with the rich and powerful and are themselves rich and powerful, and because their publishers and senior executives are themselves part of the establishment, the major media have come to see much of America through the eyes of the establishment.
So it's understandable, even if unjustifiable, that the major media haven't noticed how determined Americans are to reverse the increasing concentration of wealth and political power that have been eroding our economy and democracy. And it's understandable, even if unjustifiable, that they continue to marginalize Bernie Sanders.

Marvel has announced that it will remove some artwork from X-Men Gold #1, as well as take unspecified disciplinary action against artist Ardian Syaf, after it was discovered that he included coded references to an ongoing religious and political conflict in Indonesia.
Over the weekend, some Indonesian readers started pointing out how a few panels in the debut issue for the new comic series featured references to a currently political situation involving the Governor of Jakarta and the region's conservative Islamic population. Specifically, Colossus's shirt seen during a baseball match between the new members of the X-Men team, which read "QS 5:51," and a building labelled "212" above new X-Men leader Kitty Pryde's head (her character is one of the most prominent Jewish heroes in Marvel Comic's roster, a factoid that will become important shortly).

The current political situation in Jakarta, Indonesia, is very complicated, and not one that's been widely covered in the United States. Currently, Jakarta's governor Basuki Purnama Tjahaja, better known as Ahok, is currently on trial for blasphemy while also battling to keep his seat in a runoff election.
Tjahaja, who was elected in 2014, is Jakarta's first non-Muslim governor in 50 years (he's Christian) and the first ethnic Chinese person to hold the position. He's been relatively popular for his stance against corruption, including among the nation's moderate Muslim population. However, some conservative Islamists, largely led by the Islamic Defenders Front (also known as FPI), have argued that the world's largest Muslim-majority nation should not have a leader who isn't Muslim.
They tried to block Tjahaja from becoming governor on the basis of his faith, and they have been accused of committing vigilante acts against religious minorities since the group's founding in 1999.
Last year, everything snowballed after an edited video surfaced of Tjahaja telling voters that his political opponents were using QS 5:51, a verse of the Quran, to lie to them. One translation reads: O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them.
The verse, much like some controversial verses in the Judeo-Christian Bible, has been interpreted in different ways. (Update: Ms. Marvel co-creator G. Willow Wilson has offered some insight into the verse's various translations and interpretations.)
The FPI, specifically, has cited that Quranic verse in the past to defend their views that non-Muslims should not be leading their government. But, despite different interpretations of the text or the situation, many conservative and moderate Muslims agreed that Tjahaja had criticised the Quran.

Tjahaja has since apologised for his statement, but large-scale protests from the country's conservative Muslim population have called for his arrest on charges of blasphemy against Islam. The biggest one was on December 2, 2016, hence the term "212." There are fears these recent actions could put the country's secular government and overall foundations of pluralism at risk.
In a public Facebook post, Syaf acknowledged the references to 212 and the Quranic verse in the comic book, and indicated he put them in after attending a 212 rally in Indonesia. (Update: In a later post, he didn't apologise for his actions, and encouraged people to buy the first edition of the comic book).
Following today's discovery of Syaf's messaging in his artwork for X-Men Gold #1 io9 reached out to Marvel Comics early Saturday morning for comment, but did not receive a reply — however Marvel has now released a statement to Comicbook.com regarding the issue in the wake of reactions to the news on social media:
"The mentioned artwork in X-Men Gold #1 was inserted without knowledge behind its reported meanings. These implied references do not reflect the views of the writer, editors or anyone else at Marvel and are in direct opposition of the inclusiveness of Marvel Comics and what the X-Men have stood for since their creation. This artwork will be removed from subsequent printings, digital versions, and trade paperbacks and disciplinary action is being taken."
It's unclear whether Syaf, who is a freelance artist, will continue his working relationship with Marvel. We've reached out to Marvel to clarify what kind of disciplinary action will be taken.
CAIRO — Violence erupted across Egypt on Friday as tens of thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square to mark the second anniversary of the country's revolution with an outpouring of rage against the rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood. At least seven protesters and two police officers were killed in clashes in Suez, the state news media said.
More than 250 people were injured in similar battles around government buildings across the country, including the Interior Ministry, the presidential palace and the state television building in the capital. The deaths reported in Suez took place near the provincial government headquarters, which protesters set on fire.
The Egyptian military deployed armored vehicles in Suez on Saturday to restore security, several news organizations reported. On Friday, Muslim Brotherhood offices were ransacked or burned in at least three cities, including Ismailia, the Suez Canal town where the group was founded 85 years ago.
In the most striking episode, masked men attacked the offices of the Brotherhood's Web site in Cairo, upending furniture, littering the floor with broken glass and papers and smashing computers. Several witnesses said the assailants came in a large group to the third floor, carrying pellet guns and acid to burn through the padlock, and left with computer hard drives.
Jim Bourg / Reuters Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is trying to straddle the line between supporting Donald Trump for president while denouncing virtually everything Trump says. Good luck with that!
WASHINGTON ― The fallout over Donald Trump's attacks on the family of a Muslim American soldier continued Monday as military vets in Congress urged Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to drop his endorsement for his party's presidential nominee.
“As veterans who previously served on active duty, we are horrified by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's slander of parents whose son died serving our country,” reads a letter to Ryan, signed by Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu (Calif.), Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) and Seth Moulton (Mass.).
“Your continued endorsement of Mr. Trump's hateful, bigoted and sexist vision threatens the integrity of the House of Representatives in which we serve,” they wrote. “We were heartened by your first instinct, which was not to endorse Mr. Trump. We respectfully request that you follow what we believe your heart is telling you and withdraw your endorsement of him now.”
Their letter comes after last week's moving speech at the Democratic National Convention by Khizr Khan, who spoke of the heroism of his son, U.S. Army Capt. Humayun S.M. Khan, who was killed in Iraq while protecting his troops. Khizr Khan denounced Trump and his proposed ban on Muslims, asking if the real estate mogul has even read the Constitution. Trump responded by criticizing Khan for saying he has “sacrificed nothing,” claiming Khan “has no right” to say “inaccurate things” in front of millions of people. He also questioned why Khan's wife Ghazala, who stood by his side during his speech, didn't speak, suggesting she wasn't allowed to talk because Islam oppresses women.
That hasn't gone over well with anyone, including Republicans.
Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong declined to say Monday if Ryan would pull his support for Trump over the flap. Instead, she pointed to a statement Ryan issued over the weekend, in which he says Capt. Khan's sacrifice should be honored but says nothing about Trump himself.
“Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example,” reads Ryan's statement. “His sacrifice ― and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan ― should always be honored. Period.”
There are dozens of military veterans in Congress, and for those who are Republican, Trump's latest flap makes it even more difficult for them to stand by their party's nominee. The Huffington Post reached out to ten GOP lawmakers who served overseas, randomly selected, to see if they still endorse Trump for president ― or if they plan to formally endorse Trump at all. Only a few responded.
“The Congressman has yet to endorse,” said Maura Gillespie, a spokeswoman for Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.).
“Rep. Coffman has not endorsed Trump,” said Cinamon Watson, a spokeswoman for Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.). “In fact, Rep. Coffman has voiced grave concern about Mr. Trump's policies and his tone.”
That's not the full story, though. A Coffman aide said in February the congressman would “obviously” support Trump over Clinton.
“Of course Hunter is still on board with Trump,” added Joe Kasper, a spokesman for Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.). “But I think this is a real learning lesson for Trump in that he's got to be more careful when discussing points of such sensitivity. In this case, he should have acknowledged the sacrifice and separated it from the broader policy issue, but he's still right on the problem related to immigration and I have no doubt that he believes anyone who makes the ultimate sacrifice is the truest of heroes.”
As the Arizona State Sun Devils just squeak through nonconference play, the 2-1 Sun Devils begin their Pac-12 gauntlet against an old rival, the USC Trojans, who ASU conquered with the "Jael Mary" in last year's meeting in Los Angeles. Here is your first look this week at the 2015 Trojans:
Head Coach - Steve Sarkisian
Steve Sarkisian returns for just his second year as head coach of the most storied football program on the West Coast, and holds a 11-5 record with the Trojans. After being in and out of the program from 2001 to 2008 working under Pete Carroll and Lane Kiffin as an offensive coordinator, Kiffin returned to USC in 2014 and beat out Ed Orgeron for the vacant head coaching position left by Kiffin.
Sarkisian also served as the Oakland Raiders' quarterbacks coach in the 2004 season. He made a name for himself as a head coach at Washington, where he accumulated a 34-29 record from 2009-13 and took the Huskies to three bowl games in five years.
2015 Results
Well, USC (2-1, 0-1 Pac-12) took care of its first two nonconference opponents that seemed like automatic wins from the start. It was an easy day at the office for quarterback Cody Kessler, who tossed four touchdowns in the Trojans' 55-6 season-opening win over the Arkansas State Red Wolves. The following week, Kessler continued his aerial assault by going 26-for-31 with 410 passing yards and three touchdowns in a 59-9 victory over the Idaho Vandals.
Pac-12 play, however, became an entirely different story. The Trojans dropped their conference opener to the Stanford Cardinal 41-31 in the Los Angeles Memorial-Coliseum. USC gave up 474 total yards (195 on the ground) to a Cardinal offense that experienced little success in its previous two games. Stanford dominated the ball by controlling it for just under 40 minutes and held the Trojans to 4-of-10 on third-down attempts.
Key Players
QB Cody Kessler - The senior returns in his third year as a starter and has established himself as a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate in his best season so far. Along with his 10 touchdowns, Kessler boasts a 78.7 percent completion rate and hasn't thrown an interception in 89 pass attempts.
RB Tre Madden - After missing the entire 2014 season due to turf toe, Madden returns as USC's premier tailback. The senior has had just 28 carries in three games, but he averaged 7.4 yards per rush and found the endzone four times on those touches. Madden's health is something to watch this week, though, as the Orange County Register reported he's listed as questionable due to a left knee injury he suffered against Stanford.
WR JuJu Smith-Schuster - One of college football's best underclassmen, Smith-Schuster has scored at least once in his first three games this year and has four touchdowns for the season. Although Smith-Schuster played second-fiddle to Nelson Agholor in 2014, the Sun Devils kept him in check in last year's meeting, as Smith-Schuster only recorded 39 receiving yards on four catches.
LB Su'a Cravens - A linebacker-safety hybrid, Cravens anchors the Trojans' defense as a captain in his senior season and seems to always be near the ball. He recorded 13 total tackles last week and stands second overall on the team with 21. He has recorded a sack in each of his last two games and had an interception against Arkansas State.
The other Josh may become an important part of the Miami Heat's race to the top. Rested and loaded for heavy minutes for the race to the top, Josh McRoberts could join Chris Bosh and Tyler Johnson as secret weapons for the team's role as an unexpected contender for the NBA title.
Who would consider McRoberts a dangerous 3-point shooter? Since the All-Star break McRoberts has converted his treys at almost a 40% clip. As a group they made 57 of their 97 3-point attempts, or an astounding 59%.
With McBob, Josh Richardson and Joe Johnson on the court together they open up the floor for finishes at the paint by Dwyane Wade, Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside, Amar'e Stoudemire, Luol Deng and Justise Winslow.
Erik Spoelstra redefined the 5
Rotating Stoudemire, Whiteside and McRoberts at the 5 shows how creative Spo is. Starting Amar'e prevents Whiteside getting two quick fouls in first quarter, so Hassan can finish each half when he is needed most. Putting McRoberts in leads to a quick sharing-the-ball group.
McRoberts mastery on the art of assisting sets up teammates for open treys, cuts to the basket and lobs to Hassan and Gerald Green, who can elevate high enough to throw down dunks at the rim. While on the floor together, McRoberts and Green are both threats to see who is the best dunker, bringing back memories of their high-school dunk contest.
The new high-octane Miami Heat have captured the attention of "must-see" NBA action as the season winds down. Coach has the weapons to challenge anyone because Bosh, Richardson, McRoberts, Green, T. Johnson are not exhausted at this time of the year and ready to out-run the more weary stars of their competition.
As LeBron James said, "The pace, we couldn't keep up with it. With it being our fifth game in seven nights, we just couldn't keep up with their pace."
The lockdown defense of Winslow, Richardson, Deng, Whiteside, Green is the core principle of the Heat identity. Add that to Winslow or Dragic bringing the ball down the court coast-to-coast, makes other teams pay for not getting back fast enough. Leaving the splash to Richardson and J. Johnson, Winslow is the Russell Westbrook of Miami.
At this time of the season teams are suffering from burning out their key players. The Heat are just starting to bring talented fresh legs into the mix. If Green can get his stroke back, the team could light up their newfound 3-point prowess. The Warriors are getting tired. The Heat are hitting their stride.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will decide whether to keep in place Obama-era protections that allow nearly 800,000 undocumented young people, known as Dreamers, to work and study in the United States. As the controversial decision approaches, the policy—officially called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA—has received support from an unlikely group of people: prominent Republican politicians. They're joined by Democrats, immigrant rights advocates, and the leaders of some of the country's largest companies in calling on Trump to reject immigration hardliners' demands to end the program.
DACA provides Dreamers with two-year, renewable permits that allow them to live the United States without being detained or deported. To qualify for the protection, Dreamers have to show, among other requirements, that they arrived in the United States before they turned 16 and have not committed serious crimes. The average Dreamer came to the United States at six years old and is now 25, according to a survey by University of California-San Diego professor Tom Wong.
“These are kids who know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don't know another home.”
Many Republicans have long argued that DACA, which is not a law but a 2012 executive action by President Barack Obama, is unconstitutional. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized DACA, calling it one of Obama's “illegal executive amnesties.” But Trump softened his position after winning the election. “The DACA situation is a very difficult thing for me, as I love these kids,” he said in February. In July, he repeated that it was a “very very hard” decision. Asked about the issue Friday, Trump said that “we love Dreamers”; he's reportedly torn about whether to end DACA. Later on Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that a decision will be announced on Tuesday, ending weeks of speculation about when the decision would be made.
On Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan became the most prominent Republican to pressure Trump not to end DACA, saying that the president should leave it up to Congress. “These are kids who know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don't know another home,” he said in a radio interview. “And so I really do believe there that there needs to be a legislative solution.” Ryan's comments come one day after hundreds of CEOs and business leaders, including executives at Apple, Facebook, and General Motors, sent Trump an open letter calling on him to keep DACA in place.
Perhaps the most surprising statement in support of DACA has come from Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III, a Republican. In June, Slatery, along with nine other state attorneys general, threatened to challenge DACA in court if the Trump administration didn't end the program by September 5, which is Tuesday. The White House announcement may be intended to meet the AGs' deadline, but on Friday afternoon, Slatery announced that he's changed his mind. “There is a human element to this…that is not lost on me and should not be ignored,” Slatery wrote in a letter addressed to Tennessee Republican Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker. “Many of the DACA recipients, some of whose records I reviewed, have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit and service to our country. They have an appreciation for the opportunities afforded them by our country.”
Instead, Slatery suggested that Congress should consider a bipartisan bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship. “It is my sincere hope,” Slatery wrote, “that the important issues raised by the States will be resolved by the people's representatives in the halls of Congress, not in a courtroom.”
Read Slatery's full letter here.
To read many news headlines, it would be easy to get the impression that the Trump administration isn't very accessible to the media.
Consider Politico's report during the transition about the White House Correspondents' Association's complaints: "WHCA says lack of media access to President-elect Trump is 'unacceptable.'"
Or this one from the Hill last month, "Spicer clashes with press over access to Trump."
But over just seven days as the administration crossed its 100 Days anniversary, Team Trump put on an explosive display of access, providing over 200 interviews to network, mainstream press, conservative media, Hispanic TV and even satellite radio — more, said insiders, than previous administrations.
The White House tallied a total of 237 interviews with 29 officials and President Trump over seven days from April 23-30, when the media was focused on 100 Days stories.

TV was the big winner, with 151 interviews. Radio got 62 and print the rest.
The president and his team also did large meetings and conference calls with regional news organizations, editorial boards and conservative media.

"Clearly, this administration provides an enormous amount of access to the media in contrast to others," said Helen Aguirre Ferre, White House Director of Media Affairs.
Notable was the inclusion of conservative media. Of the seven interviews Trump did, for example, four were to those with a conservative bent: Fox, the Washington Examiner, the Washington Times and the New York Post.

Large TV groups also did well, including Sinclair, Gray TV, and Nexstar. Together, those three have 437 stations.
Sinclair Chief Political Correspondent Scott Thuman, who snagged the most interviews — eight — with cabinet members and Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, said the White House is recognizing non-network operations that reach into middle America.
"For better or worse, I think Trump's team has made accessibility a priority. They seem to be focusing heavily on going beyond the cable networks and spending time with chief correspondents for the biggest companies with the most TV stations—even if we're asking the tough questions, which we do," he told Secrets.
"I believe it's partially a numbers game to them: talk with unbiased journalists who report to millions each night from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine. It gives them reach. Since we've got that reach, I get to have frank chats with the real decision makers on occasion, and our viewers benefit from our objective reporting," said Thuman whose company has 173 TV stations.
During the week, virtually every cabinet member was provided for interviews, as were many top White House aides.
The outreach included wire services, websites such as Yahoo, the Heritage Foundation's Daily Signal news shop and Telemundo and Univision.

And of course the big network and cable TV names got access to top officials including ABC's George Stephanopoulos, CBS Face the Nation host John Dickerson, Fox & Friends, NBC's Chuck Todd, Today's Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie, and PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff.
Inaccessible? It depends on who is asked. Politico, for example, asked White House reporters to judge the Trump team, and 38 percent said there is less access than in previous administrations. But 42 percent said it is "about the same," and 21 percent have seen more.
White House Spokesman Sean Spicer believes the administration has got the balance with the media right. He told CBS This Morning this week:
"We feel very good about the relationship that exists. And I understand the press is always going to want more access, more transparency. And we do our best to make sure that they have access to the president, to leaders — throughout the White House and the government. But we want to make sure that it's fair coverage. And I think that's where I think a lot of the tension comes is when you take an issue out of context or try to create a narrative that isn't there."

India Intends To Double Coal Production Within 5 Years
The man responsible for maintaining India's power supply says he wants the country's coal production to double within the next five years.
Piyush Goyal, Minister of State for Power, Coal, New and Renewable energy, says India needs to dig twice as much coal as it does today if it is to meet its soaring energy demand. By 2019, it is expected to be consuming two trillion units of electricity annually, with one unit equalling one kilowatt hour.
Describing coal as “an essential input for power”, Goyal said: “I see Coal India production doubling in the next five years. It makes about 500 million tonnes hopefully this year. We [will] do a billion tonnes in 2019.”
He was speaking at the India Economic Summit, held in Delhi from 4 to 6 November, and hosted by the World Economic Forum and the Confederation of Indian Industry.

JUST over a century ago, Rudyard Kipling wrote that the advent of the aeroplane would herald a time “when the most extreme distances will be brought within the compass of one week's—one hundred and sixty-eight hours'—travel”. Technology has brought us quite a bit further than that. Designers are now suggesting planes that could fly business passengers from New York to London in 11 minutes or to Shanghai in 24.

That saves tiresome time inside the cabin. But speed solves only part of the problem. Our bodies are wired to a 24-hour day, with regular cycles of daylight and darkness. Crossing time zones ever faster only serves to throw our internal clocks further out of whack when we arrive.
Fortunately, researchers at Stanford University believe they have found a cure for jet lag—or at least a way to make it much less of a nuisance. The solution, not surprisingly, involves light, which dictates our circadian rhythms. In an experiment, the researchers subjected participants to brief, frequent flashes of light while they slept to see if they could alter the body's natural rhythms and trick it into thinking it was on a different schedule.
It seems to have worked. Typically, sleep researchers say it takes about one day to adjust to a one-hour time change. So a person flying from London to Moscow, over three time zones, would need three days to adjust to the local time—making a two- or three-day business trip a very sleepy affair. But if, the night before the flight, travellers were exposed to an hour of intermittent light flashes while sleeping in the early morning, their body would be fooled into thinking the sun had risen three hours earlier. In other words, before flying to Moscow, they would already be on Moscow time.
Scientists have previously experimented with exposure to continuous light in order to alter the body's circadian rhythms. But according to the Stanford researchers, continuous light shifted a person's internal clock by just 36 minutes. A two-millisecond flash of light every 10 seconds, by contrast, advanced the clock by an average of nearly two hours, and sometimes more. Of course, most travellers can't spend a night in a lab before every flight. So the Stanford team is working to develop a sleep mask with LED lights that can be programmed with a smartphone.
The researchers published their findings in a report this week. It is surely not the final word in the long battle to combat jet lag. But given that other so-called cures have not been terribly inspiring—”wear sunglasses”, “keep calm”—we may at last be getting closer to a future in which travel isn't only fast, but also leaves us feeling rested and able to get to work once we arrive.

Judge Michael Martinez has ruled that former UFC champ Jon Jones will be able to fight at UFC 197 in Las Vegas on April 23. Jones spent a night in jail for probation violation after being pulled over and accused of drag racing.
The Bernalillo County District Attorney had sought "to have Jones' probation revoked and then reinstated with three new conditions: Jones completes a driver improvement course; he agrees to a curfew; and he enrolls in and completes an anger management counseling course" according to MMA Fighting.
The judge declined to impose a curfew after his defense argued it would impede his ability to travel to Las Vegas for the title fight. However Jones is not permitted to drive without the permission of his probation officer, and Martinez warned Jones that another court appearance "won't end well" for him.
Jon has been released following a night in jail.
Jones is on probation after a conviction for a hit-and-run last year that resulted in injuries to a pregnant woman and Jones being stripped of his UFC title. UFC 197 will mark his return to the Octagon.
CHELMSFORD, Mass. - Valerie Celeste Coffey is a woman on a mission. For six years, her small group of local atheists has gathered to exchange bemused stories about the things Christians do in worship and swap tips for raising confident skeptics.
But on a recent Wednesday evening here at the Java Room cafe, Ms. Coffey said the time had come to take the meetings in hand.
"I don't think this group has a vision," said Coffey, a freelance editor who lives in nearby Boxborough, Mass. "We need to figure out what our values are."
Ten days later, something unprecedented happened: The group met over Sunday brunch for a structured discussion with preplanned topics.
The ranks of nonbelievers are on the rise, research suggests, and as they seek out each other online and in small groups, they are increasingly looking to do more than just vent.
Some are adopting rituals themselves, from de-baptisms to wedding ceremonies, as a way to cement ties among members. Others are organizing science-related outings or enrolling in community-service programs. Nationwide, atheists' groups are now treading, sometimes gingerly, into unfamiliar territory.
"This is the transition moment right now," says Dale McGowan, author of "Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids Without Religion." "Some groups are really diving in 1/8to foster a robust sense of community 3/8, and some of them are holding their noses and standing on the diving board. They're not quite sure what to do."
Some 15 percent of Americans claim no religious affiliation, up from 8.2 percent in 1990, according to Trinity College's American Religious Identification Survey, released in March. Also, the American Humanist Association claims 20,000 financial supporters. That marks a doubling from five years ago, says spokeswoman Karen Frantz.
Moreover, signs point to non-believers seeking fellowship as never before. During the first five months of 2009, 95 new atheist groups have formed through meetup.com, bringing the US total to 372. That's up from 59 in 2005, says Blair Scott, director of national affiliates for American Atheists, a networking and advocacy organization. Known parenting groups for nonbelievers have proliferated from just one in 2005 to 33 in 2009, adds Mr. McGowan, the author.
The intersection of the two trends is evident across the United States. For example, the North Alabama Freethought Association, which has grown from 50 members in 2006 to 350 today, drew 30 people to a camping event in May and runs regular outings to visit caves or other science-related sites.
"It used to be that these atheist groups ... met almost in hiding," says American Atheists spokesman David Silverman. "Now they're doing a lot more stands at town parties, a lot more trash pickups, a lot more blood donations - a lot more stuff that gets their group out and noticed."
Some say such initiatives are necessary to improve an image problem. Rebecca Grieve founded South Lake Atheists and Freethinkers in Groveland, Fla., last year because she felt the nearby atheist group in Orlando "wasn't doing enough in the community." Through an Adopt-A-Lake project, the new group monitors a section of Lake Minneola and promotes its efforts on a big sign at Clermont Waterfront Park.
"A lot of atheist groups are really negative," says Ms. Grieve, who now lives in Derry, N.H., and describes herself as a secular humanist. "They're not standing for anything. They're not making a difference.... I want to be accepted just like everybody else. We need to be showing people through example that we're decent people."
For some, however, the status quo suits just fine. Of the monthly Atheists of Greater Lowell (Mass.) gatherings, where no one convenes or adjourns the group, Paul Ratner of Lowell says: "I like this group as it is now."
Rob Butler of Westford. Mass., agrees: "I love coming here because I can just say whatever's on my mind, and people won't be offended by it."
In some ways, the lack of structure or ritual has been a defining characteristic of atheist groups. McGowan notes that many atheists bristle at ritual because it feels too religious or superstitious. American Atheists' Mr. Silverman insists, "there are no rituals with us."
But America's 27 Ethical Societies, which attract many nontheist attendees to their humanist "platforms," or services, see growing interest in rituals, ranging from children's education to weddings, according to membership chairman Thomas Hoeppner.
Through ritual, "you build up not just common intellectual values, but the emotional and personal connection with people," says Mr. Hoeppner, a member of the Ethical Humanist Society of Chicago. "That's what it's all about."
"So when one of my dear friends in his 80s lost his wife, he'd be over at our house every Sunday afternoon for dinner," he says. "That's a ritual for us."
In Florida, atheists are pioneering a new ritual: de-baptism. Since last year, American Atheists' Florida state director Greg McDowell has been donning a mock clerical robe and officiating at services where family and friends come to watch the baptized renounce their baptisms.
The events spoof baptisms by using blow-dryers in the place of baptismal waters. They culminate in certificates for the "de-baptized" and letters to churches requesting that the names of those de-baptized be removed from baptismal rolls.
Elsewhere, ties that bind the faithless continue to grow stronger, even without ritual per se. After one member of the North Alabama Freethought Association was robbed earlier this year, fellow members collected a few hundred dollars to see him through to payday. And when another was injured in a motorcycle accident, atheists brought meals every day for him and his caretakers.
"It makes me sit back and smile to know that this community has built itself up in a way that they're looking out for each other, watching each other's backs, and supporting each other," says Mr. Scott, who founded the Alabama group six years ago. "It almost makes me feel fatherly - like you raised your child right."
On the shores of Lake Ontario between Whitby and Oshawa is an area now known as Intrepid Park. Very little of what remains today hints at its intriguing history – but during the Second World War, this was the site of Camp X, the Allies' secret intelligence and espionage training facility. Although it was officially called Secret Training Centre 103, it is better known by its nickname which reflects the highly confidential nature of its activities
The camp was established by a joint effort between the British and Canadian Governments and opened on 6th December 1941, just before America entered the war. Although technically the US was still politically neutral at that point, the camp was intended to foster support between the US and Great Britain.
However, following the bombing of Pearl Harbor the day after the Camp officially opened, America was no longer neutral and became directly involved both in the war and in the training of personnel at Camp X.
Inside the Camp
Over 500 Allied personnel were trained at the camp. Most were being prepared for special missions behind enemy lines. The skills they learned included silent killing and unarmed combat, sabotage, and how to recognize potential supporters of resistance movements who could help them in their mission. They were also trained in methods of finding suitable new recruits.
Because of the highly sensitive nature of the training facility recruitment had to be done through direct contacts or through known and trusted channels. Other skills taught at the camp included demolition, map reading, and Morse Code. The training covered both the physical and psychological aspects of their work.
New recruits initially completed ten weeks of training in all aspects of intelligence and espionage. After this, some would go on to further, more specialist training while others were ready for their first mission.
The Recruits
Initially, recruits came mostly from Canada and included many different nationalities. Canada had a large population of European immigrants who provided a useful range of language skills. Later these were joined by recruits from South and Central America and the US. A number of British spies trained there. Well-known figures who passed through Camp X include the writer Roald Dahl, who was also an Ace pilot during WW2.
The screenwriter Paul Dehn was another recruit. Dehn wrote the screenplay for a number of spy films including Goldfinger and The Spy who came in from the Cold. Dehn held the rank of Major and the role of Political Warfare Officer. It has also been speculated that Ian Fleming, creator of the James Bond character attended Camp X. Although Fleming worked for the British Naval Intelligence during the war, his connection with the camp has been disputed.
The Hydra
‎One of the most important parts of the camp was the so-called “Hydra.” Named after the many-headed serpent of Greek Mythology, the Hydra was a sophisticated communication center ideally placed for gathering intelligence and passing on important information. The location of the Hydra was suited to its purpose because it received strong, clear radio signals.
The building itself looked rather mysterious. It was a simple four-sided structure and was completely open on the inside. All the windows were placed seven feet above ground level because of the secret nature of what went on inside. The only entrance was through the two large front doors which had been designed to allow large equipment to be brought in and out.
The brains behind the Hydra as a Canadian electrical engineer named Benjamin de Forest Bayly. It was rather experimental and unlike previous intelligence gathering operations because of its size and sophistication. Yet none of the equipment had been purpose built. It was made up of an assortment of transmitters “borrowed” from different organizations and locations.
Here recruits were trained in code breaking, and those who were most successful stayed on to work within the Hydra rather than being sent out on missions. Both men and woman played an important role in this aspect of the camp's work. The Hydra regularly conveyed information to its British counterpart the Aspidistra, a huge radio transmitter located in a secret bunker in Sussex, England.
Among the intelligence received were messages from German submarines. Many of these messages had been intercepted by agents working in South America who had previously trained at Camp X. The intercepted messages would be re-coded by the spies who had picked them up and then sent on to the codebreakers at Camp X for further de-coding. Coded messages were also sent from England's code-breaking center at Bletchley Park to be worked on by the newly trained experts at the Hydra.
The Postwar Years
After the war, the Hydra was the only part of the camp that remained in use.
It was renamed the Oshawa Wireless Station and was now an interception station for the Royal Canadian Signal Corps. During this time the station was used mainly for listening rather than transmitting. It played a key role in Canada's post-war intelligence sharing community which became known as the “Five Eyes.”
This was a cooperative venture between Canada, Britain, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. This activity continued into the Cold War era, with the Hydra finally ceasing operations in 1969. However, the camp no longer provided any training in practical espionage skills as it had during the war.
Few written records have survived as many of these sensitive documents were destroyed at the end of the war in the interest of security. Others have been withheld under the official secrets act. Once the facility was decommissioned in 1969, the buildings were demolished into Lake Ontario.
Little physical evidence remains of what took place on the site except for a number of craters which serve as a reminder of the explosives training that took place. There is also a monument erected on the site – today known as Intrepid Park – to honor the men and women who trained and worked there and to commemorate the important contribution they made to the war effort.

WASHINGTON/SANAA, May 23 (Reuters) - When a barrage of drone-fired missiles hit al Qaeda cells in Yemen in mid-April and killed dozens of militants, the results were strikingly different from a mistaken U.S. attack on a Yemeni wedding convoy just four months earlier.
But even though the drones apparently found their targets this time, they were still blamed for a number of civilian deaths.
It was a stark reminder that a year after Obama laid out new conditions for drone attacks around the world, U.S. forces are failing to comply fully with the rules he set for them: to strike only when there is an imminent threat to Americans and when there is virtually no danger of taking innocent lives.
Although Obama promised greater transparency in his speech at the National Defense University, U.S. lawmakers are increasingly critical of the secrecy surrounding the operations.
Despite some spectacular drone hits that took out militant leaders in places such as Yemen and Pakistan, there are growing concerns in Washington that the net effect of the targeted-killing program may be counterproductive. “Collateral damage” is seen as an al Qaeda recruiting tool that undercuts the main rationale for the drone campaign - to make Americans safer.
“It's never a good idea to make more enemies than you get rid of,” a former U.S. national security official said.
In his speech on May 23 last year, Obama defended the drone program as effective while promising to narrow its scope, but he is showing no sign of relinquishing what has become his counterterrorism weapon of choice since he took office in 2009.
Drones are spreading to new areas as U.S. operations hone in on al Qaeda affiliates in far-flung places like Somalia and in Nigeria, where American forces are helping search for more than 200 girls kidnapped by the Islamist group Boko Haram.
“Here we are, a year later, asking ‘what has really changed?'” said University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O'Connell, a leading expert on extrajudicial killings who has testified before U.S. congressional committees. “The drones are still flying and the president still sees the attractiveness of this cold and antiseptic means of killing.”
CASUALTIES FALLING
Obama's restrictions for drone attacks are having some impact. Even with the recent surge of strikes in Yemen, the overall pace of attacks and the rate of civilian casualties have fallen appreciably.
There has even been an unofficial pause in attacks in Pakistan since the beginning of the year, after a Pakistani request for restraint while it negotiated with the Taliban and a dwindling number of “high-value” targets in border areas.
Obama's vision of shifting control of the drone program from the shadowy paramilitary arm of the Central Intelligence Agency to the more publicly accountable Pentagon is moving at what one national security source described as a “glacial pace.”
Apart from bureaucratic impediments, the main obstacle may be concerned about civilian casualties among top lawmakers such as Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who see the CIA as better at killing with accuracy.
The Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command is widely believed to have been behind the Dec. 12 drone strike in a remote part of Yemen that hit a convoy later identified as a wedding procession, killing 15 people. An official U.S. inquiry was launched but no findings have been released.
The number of allegedly bungled military strikes in Yemen led to a suspension of the Pentagon's drone operations there earlier this year, while the CIA, which has its own fleet, continued drone operations, a national security source said.
OBAMA'S “NEAR CERTAINTY” RULE
Obama, in last year's speech, said drone strikes would be barred unless there was “near certainty” that no civilians would be hit and the administration says every precaution is taken to avoid killing the innocent.
The New America Foundation, which compiles drone casualties, put the number of militants killed in U.S. strikes in Yemen this year at 79 in addition to four civilians.
“Our forces go to extraordinary lengths to avoid civilian casualties,” said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. “But when we believe that civilians may have been killed despite these efforts, we investigate thoroughly.”
Washington has long argued that reports of hundreds of civilian deaths in the U.S. drone war are exaggerated, though in the absence of the government's own casualty counts it is all but impossible to verify the assertion.
There are clear signs that “collateral damage” feeds anti-American sentiment in the Muslim world and fuels sympathy for groups such as Yemen's al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which Washington sees as a threat to the U.S. homeland.
“We oppose drone attacks because more people are dying,” said Mohamed al-Qawli, head of Yemen's National Organization for Drone Victims. “It is killing outside the law.”
Qawli's brother Ali, a science teacher, was killed in 2013 when a taxi he and a nephew were riding in picked up some strangers. A missile obliterated the car. At least six suspected militants died, local sources said. The Yemeni government said Ali and his nephew were innocent civilians.
“My brother was completely charred. We identified him by his teeth,” Qawli told Reuters. Afterwards, people in the area started listening to al Qaeda tapes and exchanged militant videos on mobile phones, Qawli said.
Former CIA director Michael Hayden said Washington's new calculus should be to look at the value of each strike in terms of whether it is worth “alienating friends and feeding the al Qaeda narrative.” (Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Mehreen Zahra-Malik and Katherine Houreld in Islamabad and Mohammed Ghobari in Sanaa; Editing by David Storey and Ken Wills)
An interview clip of the famous atheist has gone viral. So what?
You may have noticed a bit of a kerfuffle lately, stemming from a 2:24 minute clip on RTÉ's “The Meaning of Life with Gay Byrne,” in which Fry relates some frankly unsurprising views about God and suffering. Or, as one of my friends put it on Facebook: “Famous atheist says the sort of things famous atheists say.” And ever since Saturday afternoon, the big question on my mind has been “Why do we care?”
The main reason I'm asking this question has to do with the peculiar nature of my Facebook feed, which is populated by a strange mix of right-wing Christian fundamentalists, some fairly left-wing Americans of various intensely religious stripes, some more or less intellectual Anglicans and Episcopalians, and a fair number of atheists and agnostics. Some members of all of these groups are also well-respected academics; most aren't. I like to think of it as a fairly representative slice of the English-speaking world, but it makes for an odd feed: some of my friends are gleefully clapping their hands about Fry, others could not care less, and others are enraged.
But there's another reason I'm asking “Why do we care?”

I broke my usual code of Facebook discretion to engage in an extended debate with a friend and colleague who'd approvingly posted the video on his wall. Ever since, I've been trying to figure out what it was about seeing the Fry video on his wall that made me do this. Essentially, why do I care? I think I've come up with some answers.
First, let me rule out some potential reasons. The video hasn't generated so much attention because Fry has said anything particularly new or groundbreaking. In some ways, his comments were really quite tedious, as far as atheist critiques go (there's a reason the interviewer pulled a face). It also wasn't because the critique was well put: it hardly comes up to the level of Ivan's discourse in The Brothers Karamazov, though its quality as a sound bite deserves some kudos. It also wasn't because Fry is a paragon of morality and cultural wisdom: he may be funny and interesting, and he's certainly perceptive, but he's not exactly someone most people would turn to for life advice.
It wasn't even because of Fry's slightly pompous claim that he would chastise the Almighty at the Last Judgment. This is mostly because, despite Giles Fraser being impressed, Fry's “bravery” strikes one as somewhat improbable. It's not that God has a problem with people being angry at him or disputing his judgment (see the whole book of Job, most of the Psalms, and the book of Jeremiah), nor will he necessarily stop anyone from attempting to do rather terrible things to his person when they reject him (see, well, Jesus Christ). It's just that, when confronted with the unveiled majesty of God, people tend to quail in terror and shut their mouths (see Moses and the burning bush, the end of the book of Job, most of the Psalms, and the book of Jeremiah). I'd honestly be impressed at someone holding onto their head when the earth flees and the heavens are rolled up like a garment at the coming of the Lord, but it seems unlikely to say the least. Fry has the bluster and bravado that comes from lack of exposure.
So what is it? Why did Fry's comments grab our attention and elicit so many reactions?
One reason is the much observed rage-cycle on social media. Frankly, we spend a lot of time getting worked up about inconsequential stuff. Something about Facebook and Twitter seems to do this to us, in a way that other forms of communication don't. But more importantly, I think a lot of us have started falling into the trap of (a) providing controversial material when we know it will anger others or (b) reacting poorly and without consideration when we know better.
We do this for a simple reason. Though we'd deny it, most of us like being angry and worked up. And we like making other people angry and worked up, especially if we can feel intellectually, emotionally, or culturally superior while doing it. We've got a problem of the heart; and it's interesting that this has been exposed to such an extent in the week after Archbishop Justin Welby pretty clearly pointed out that the problem has infected members of the Church. (I even put his comments online, unveiling the depth of my character, surely.)
I think Christians have reacted so strongly to Fry for some other important reasons as well; I'll come to atheists momentarily. A personal example. In my own feed, seeing Fry's comments pop up on an atheist friend's wall generates about the same feelings that I have when someone like Pat Robertson pops up on a Christian friend's wall (well, maybe not quite that bad, but close). They both tend to attribute evil to God with some regularity. And, in either case, I groan inside because I know something I classify as ignorant drivel is about to be cast out into the world to the delight and chagrin of many millions. Worse yet, I think to myself somewhat dejectedly: “Somebody whose opinion I value thinks this is actually worth consuming. Someone I value actually thinks the God I worship is a baby-killing maniac.” When it comes to Fry, I think his comments are unworthy of atheism and unrepresentative of most of the people I know who have made considered decisions to reject religious faith. It would be crediting him too much to say that the remarks vilifying faith were ill considered; he undoubtedly knew the question was coming, given the interviewer, so one can only suppose that he hoped he could do some cultural damage. And he undoubtedly has. Thanks, friend.
But I also found myself reacting strongly because I felt I needed to do some damage control. Every time I hear something like this said by a “respected” public figure, I think: “Man, we are really failing at our job of witnessing to the truth, if people think this is credible. And we've really failed to demonstrate the beauty and compassion of the Christian faith.”
And as a theologian and historian, and (Lord — or the impersonal cosmos — willing) as a future priest, I think, “Man, I am failing my friends and colleagues terribly, and I'm worried that I can't do anything about it.” After all, how to react appropriately? Ignore it out of a sense of civility and professional decorum? Write a private message? Bring it up awkwardly a week later at the pub? Engage strongly online? In “post-Christian” Britain, I've found this a much more difficult problem than I would have elsewhere. And I'm not sure I'm negotiating it so well.
Then, in terms of atheists — or, more accurately, let's say, people somewhat on the “unbelief” side of the spectrum: Why have so many approved of Fry's comments? Answering this question appropriately could be a challenge, but I'll take a few stabs.
The first thing to realize is that the atheist community has a strong sense of its own cultural and intellectual superiority but perhaps an inflated sense of its character as an embattled minority, awash in a sea of deadly believers, who are doing crazy things like attacking French satirical publications, attempting to institute religious theocracies, and generally refusing to trust atheists. Because of this, engaging in ceaseless polemics against religion is very much a part of atheist self-definition. They've got to do something to stem the tide of hatred and irrationality just to survive but also to demarcate their social space as members of the secular vanguard. This is a trademark of the New Atheism especially.
This rationale shouldn't surprise us. After all, I don't just read, write, and post things about theology to convince others; I also do it to locate myself within a space partly defined by my beliefs and my identity as a Christian intellectual. And, I find it important to engage in these issues in order to challenge the idea that atheism somehow has more intellectual credibility. I shouldn't be surprised at others doing the same.
The second thing is that, despite the decline in religious observance in the West (especially in Europe), the cultural visibility and profile of unbelief and of atheists remains quite low. It cannot match the pervasiveness of faith. This is especially true in the United States, but even in Britain we see rather few public figures whose personal identity is wrapped up in their atheism. We may doubt David Cameron's religious sincerity, but we cannot dispute his church attendance. And there's still a sense that atheism doesn't play well in the Home Counties or “Up North,” not least in an election year when we've got UKIP and Nigel Farage to fight off. Keep your atheism in the City or in the student unions, please.
So, when a prominent comedian, professor, or any other cultural figure appears on television and actually makes shocking statements, they make the news simply because such things are still a relative rarity. It's titillating. And atheists and agnostics around the Anglophone world prick up their ears because they finally hear something they can sort of agree with, even when it's stated by a prat like Richard Dawkins.
More might be said, but the real question is: Where do things go from here?
It's now something of a cliché, but we need to work this social media thing out a little better or just give up on it. People of faith and those without any also need to work out a better cultural politics than open warfare. I'm sure that statement will leave many red-blooded, militant culture warriors shaking their heads, especially those who make slaying the dragon of faith or of unbelief central to their self-identity. However, I think we can honestly say that these sorts of statements fuel bad reactions. If Fry really thinks, as he recently said at the Cambridge Union, that the Church of England's mildness and “smiling vicars on bicycles” help to inoculate the British population against religious extremism, he needs to realize that he and his loyal followers have a rather different effect. The same should be said to religious fundamentalists, however. Their personal crusade helps create a belligerent secularity. For every convert the extremist gains, crossing and transgressing land and sea to win him (whatever his creed), he creates a hundred more who will not be converted. Extremism of all kinds is a Hydra. Hacking away like a maniac isn't going to solve the problem, so put your sword away, O Hercules, at least until you work out a better plan.
But I think we all need to start engaging a little more directly with each other. Whether or not we work out how to talk to each other on Facebook, a little more face-to-face time with our family, friends, and colleagues is the only place where the right sort of discussions can take place: discussions that lead to better understanding and to the conversion of our positions.
Life — even the life of faith — isn't simply about coming to a settled position on everything and then fighting trench warfare ever after. Far too many of us have professed to have open minds when we were 15 or 18 or 22, only to close them shortly afterwards. I'm not advocating some kind of open hand, loosey-goosey, spineless approach to everything. Settled convictions, passionate arguments, and even raised voices have their place. But if we are not open to the possibility of true conversion, we are not open to truth. And if we are not open to truth, we are not open to life.

Twitter is abuzz with speculation that the McLobster might be hitting McDonald's nationwide.
But is it true?
Sadly, no. However, the product is certainly more than a legend -- it can be found occasionally among New England McDonald's locations.
The fast food giant felt it necessary to quell the misinformation on Twitter, but who knows, maybe after all the hype McDonald's might just get the idea to roll it out nationwide!
Crustaceans everywhere are rejoicing...there are no plans to bring McLobster or McSushi to our US menu. #sorryCharlie #McLobster #McSushiMcDonald's McDonald's
Despite all the rumors there r no plans 2 bring #mclobster or mcsushi 2 the US menu. We are working on a new menu item called McWinning.McDonald's McDonald's
@elisabethos Yep!There r a few McD's on the east coast that may serve it time 2 time-but we don't have any plans to roll out nationally.^MYDMcDonald's McDonald's
Here's the original McDonald's commercial, featuring the McLobster:
Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone admitted in a radio interview that he wouldn't stand in the way of Diego Costa if he wanted to move to Chelsea, hinting that Fernando Torres could move in the opposite direction.
Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone has suggested that Diego Costa has an offer from Chelsea and said he would not stand in his way should he want to earn more money at Stamford Bridge.
Diego Simeone said he would be willing to allow Diego Costa to leave.
• Brassell: Atleti success good for soul
• Worrall: Courtois the talking point
El Confidencial recently claimed that Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had approved a 60 million euro deals for the Spain international this summer, with the knee injury suffered by Costa's former Atletico teammate Radamel Falcao having ended plans to make a move for the Monaco man.
Simeone told Al Primer Toque that he was not surprised that Atletico's players had attracted interest from richer clubs.
“[Chelsea] are very powerful,” he said. “They have [Samuel] Eto'o, a great player, but they will think about alternatives and Costa could be one of them. He knows that on one side he could earn more money, but here he is going to compete. It would surprise me if the best teams in the world did not also come looking for Miranda, [Diego] Godin...
“If Costa decides to go, it will be OK with me. Our philosophy is to make players better -- for us, that is something fundamental. When Falcao left for Monaco, you could not say no to him. He gave us life.”
Atletico being paired with Chelsea in the Champions League semifinal draw has led to speculation that the potential deal for Costa, 25, could also figure in negotiations around whether on-loan Blues goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, 21, can play against his parent club in the upcoming games as well as whether he will play again on loan at the Estadio Vicente Calderon next season.
With regard to the Champions League matches, UEFA has insisted that Chelsea cannot prevent the Belgium international playing, but Atletico president Enrique Cerezo has indicated that Courtois will not play unless the clubs come to an agreement.
Simeone, however, said both he and Courtois were confident the goalkeeper would face the Blues.
“I have no doubt that he will be there against Chelsea,” Simeone said. “He does not have any doubts either. It is not something to be worried about. I still do not know where he will play next year.”
He was also positive about the injury Costa sustained when he collided with a post while scoring late in Atletico's 2-0 La Liga win at Getafe on Sunday.
“With the speed of the play, I was not so worried,” Simeone said. “Gabi told me he [Costa] was cut. After the game they stitched him up. [Costa] is a bull. The game needed that goal and he stuck his leg in. That is an example [of the players' commitment], but so is what was done by Courtois, Miranda, Gabi… them all. We play every minute as if it were the last, it does not matter if it is a friendly in Colombia or the last game against Getafe.”
Costa has already said he will be available for Friday's game against Elche.
Members from all parties were dismayed at a decision to withdraw from a voter ID pilot scheme, which was taken at a Slough Borough Council (SBC) meeting on Thursday.
At the meeting in The Curve, in William Street, Slough's Labour group submitted a motion proposing a withdrawal from a government-led voter ID pilot scheme.
In January the council unanimously voted in favour of the scheme, which was set up as a part of an electoral fraud crackdown.
It would see Slough residents given government funded voter IDs to use in 2018's local government elections.
In 2009, Slough Tory councillor Eshaq Khan and five party activists were jailed for voter fraud prompting Cllr Rayman Bains (Con, Upton) to propose joining the pilot.
Several Labour councillors said they had been whipped to vote to quit the scheme, causing seven, many of whom took part in the debate, to walk out of the room for the vote.
Cllr Ted Plenty (Lab, Langley St Mary's) walked out brandishing a large cucumber and did not want to give an explanation when asked by The Express.
Two Labour councillors, Cllr Nora Holledge (Cippenham Green) and Cllr Martin Carter (Britwell and Northborough) defied their party whip, voting against the motion.
“It's better than 50 Shades of Grey with all the whipping that's gone on,” said Cllr Diana Coad (UKIP, Langley St Mary's) who called the leadership's motion ‘a disgrace'.
The decision to quit the scheme was approved with 20 votes for, 10 against and one abstention, with seven councillors not taking part.
Cllr Natasa Pantelic (Lab, Cippenham Meadows) said: "I'm absolutely disgusted at my colleagues on this side of the chamber that are going to supporting this recommendation and absolutely ashamed of the leader of the council for even putting this on the table.”
Supporters of abandoning the voter ID scheme said it would disenfranchise many voters including lower income families and ethnic minorities.
Cllr Amarpreet Dhaliwal (Con, Langley St Mary's) accused the councillors of playing ‘a race card', calling the withdrawal a ‘slap in the face of the officers who put this together'.
Cllr Bains suggested after the meeting that the motion was influenced by Labour members on a national level.
After the meeting Cllr Hussain said: “This pilot offers the worst of both worlds: making it harder for most people to vote while not preventing those who really are trying to defraud the system from doing so.”
Cllr Munawar said: “We are not closing the door to working with the government to protect the integrity of the vote in Slough.
“All councillors want to make our democratic process as secure as possible, but in doing so we must not restrict a person's right to vote.”
In an email on Monday, October 2, former SBC leader Richard Stokes asked Cllrs Munawar and Hussain to reconsider the decision, recounting the voter fraud he came across as a Haymill Ward councillor.
“I had to obtain between about 240 or 250 votes before the contest really started because about 240 or 250 votes were regularly fraudulent at elections,” he added.
“I had hoped that elections could be held in Slough that would be competitive but honest. Your decision sends out the wrong signals and will be welcomed only by fraudsters.
“The honest Slough residents will view your decision with dismay.”

A new paper published in the Journal of Climate reveals that the lower part of the earth's atmosphere has warmed much faster since 1979 than scientists relying on satellite data had previously thought.
Researchers from Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), based in California, have released a substantially revised version of their lower tropospheric temperature record.
After correcting for problems caused by the decaying orbit of satellites, as well as other factors, they have produced a new record showing 36 percent faster warming since 1979 and nearly 140 percent faster (e.g. 2.4 times faster) warming since 1998. This is in comparison to the previous version 3 of the lower tropospheric temperature (TLT) data published in 2009.
Climate skeptics have long claimed that satellite data shows global warming to be less pronounced than observational data collected on the earth's surface. This new correction to the RSS data substantially undermines that argument. The new data actually shows more warming than has been observed on the surface, though still slightly less than predicted in most climate models.
Produced by Carbon Brief using data from RSS and NASA.
Both the old record, version 3 in grey, and new record, version 4 in red, are shown in the figure above, along with the difference between the two, in black. The trends since 1998 for both are shown by dashed lines.
Most of the difference between the old and new record occurs after the year 2000. While the old record showed relatively little warming during the oft-debated post-1998 "hiatus" period, the new record shows warming continuing unabated through to present. Similarly, while the old RSS v3 record showed 2016 only barely edging out 1998 as the warmest year in the satellite record, the new v4 record shows 2016 as exceeding 1998 by a large margin.
Produced by Carbon Brief using data from RSS and NASA.
The figure above shows a comparison between the new RSS record and the global surface temperature record produced by NASA. RSS v4 shows about five percent more warming than the NASA record since 1979, when satellite observations began.
Challenge of satellite-based temperatures
Satellites have been used to measure the temperature of the earth's atmosphere since the late 1970s. While the first global temperature records from satellites were assembled in the early 1990s, they have gone through multiple major revisions over the years, as researchers discovered and corrected various issues in the dataset caused by changing satellites, instrument types and flyover times.
A total of 15 different satellites have been used to measure atmospheric temperatures since 1979, with around two satellites actively measuring at any given time. Two different groups, RSS and the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) produce global TLT records that are widely used, with RSS originally developing their record in response to issues they identified in the UAH group's work.
As these satellites circle the earth, their orbits slowly decay over time due to drag from the upper atmosphere. While the satellites are designed to fly over the same spot on the earth at the same time every day—a precondition to accurately estimating changes in temperatures over time—this orbital decay causes their flyover time to change. The figure below shows the local time that each different satellite flies over the equator and how they have changed over the lifetime of the satellite.
Figure 2 from Mears and Wentz 2017
For more information on satellites used by climate scientists, see this 2016 infographic produced by Carbon Brief.
Some satellites have fairly large orbital drifts, going from measuring temperatures at 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. Since the temperature changes since 1979 are on the order of 0.6°C or so, it is relatively easy for bias, due to changing observation times, to swamp the underlying climate signal.
Changes in the new RSS record
The new RSS v4 TLT record makes a number of changes to the time of observation correction, as well as corrections for the change in instruments that measure temperature from microwave sounding units (MSU) to advanced microwave sounding units (AMSU) sensors, which occurred around the year 2000.
To account for changes in observation times, the RSS group used a number of different approaches and models to try and estimate what the temperature would have been if the measurement time remained constant. This involves a combination of satellite observations (when different satellites captured temperatures in both morning and evening), the use of climate models to estimate how temperatures change in the atmosphere over the course of the day, and using reanalysis data that incorporates readings from surface observations, weather balloons and other instruments.
Depending on the time of the observation correction approach chosen, the resulting temperature trends between 1979 and 2016 ranged from as low as 0.13°C per decade to as high as 0.22°C per decade. The RSS group ultimately decided that the most reasonable set of parameters give a temperature trend of 0.17°C.
The RSS group also used the presence of multiple satellites in recent years to test for "odd man out" behaviors, when three or more satellites are available and one differs substantially from the others. They decided not to use NOAA-18 used prior to 2009 because of this. AQUA was also not used after 2009, and NOAA-15 was excluded after 2011. This choice increased the 1979-2016 temperature trend by around seven percent compared to leaving in satellites whose readings were identified as anomalous.
Finally, the RSS group found differences between MSU and AMSU sensor readings caused by spurious calibration drift in either NOAA-14 or NOAA-15 satellites. They tested using only MSU data or only AMSU data during the period of overlap, but decided that it was best to combine the two. Using only MSU data during the 1999-2003 overlap period would have resulted in four percent more warming, while using only AMSU data would have resulted in six percent less warming.
In an interview with Carbon Brief, Dr. Carl Mears, a co-author of the paper and senior research scientist at RSS, explained the main changes between the v3 and v4 TLT products:
"In version 3 we overcorrected for the diurnal cycle in NOAA-15. NOAA-15 starts at 7:30 p.m. and drifts to 4:30 p.m., so it has artificial warming, and what we took out was too big. Other big differences are removing AQUA and NOAA-15, which appeared to have an evolving bias based on comparisons to other satellites, especially over oceans where we don't expect diurnal cycle problems to be big."
Comparisons to other satellite records
Large differences remain between groups estimating lower tropospheric temperatures from the same underlying MSU satellite data. If anything, they have diverged more in recent years. RSS shows considerably more warming in the change from version 3 to the new version 4, while UAH shows much less warming in their version 6 released last year than the prior version 5.
Produced by Carbon Brief using data from RSS and UAH.
These divergences suggest that there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding satellite temperature records that needs to be resolved, as the range of reasonable assumptions for corrections can lead to large differences in results.
While the new RSS v4 record shows about five percent more warming than surface records since 1979, this behavior would to some extent be expected. Climate models on average predict around 18 percent amplification over the 1979-2016 period, though this value ranges from as low as six percent to as high as 40 percent in individual climate models. Even with these new corrections, there is evidence that the rate of warming of the troposphere is a bit lower than expected by climate models in recent years.
Surface temperature records, on the other hand, all tend to agree quite closely with each other, despite different groups using different datasets. Unlike the satellite temperature record, where only a few satellites are measuring temperatures at any given point of time, there is a large amount of redundancy in surface temperature observations, with multiple independent sets of data producing consistent results. Therefore, it is not too surprising that corrections to problems with satellite data would move them closer to surface records.
As Mears tells Carbon Brief:
"By correctly accounting for the changes in satellite measurement times, the new satellite data are in better agreement with the surface data."
Carbon Brief has contacted Dr. John Christy at UAH, but he says he is currently at a conference and unable to comment at present. This article will be updated should he provide any comment.

The mythology of CHIKARA plays out in “seasons” that run yearly. While it's a concept other wrestling promotions flirt with, no one tackles it with the dedication and aplomb that CHIKARA has done for years now. It includes anything from the secret teachings of a wrestling move to a mystical amulet with mind-controlling powers. It's never enough that a causal fan can't understand what's going on, but fans that have been with the company for years are constantly rewarded with new twists and turns or the return of story elements thought to be long discarded. For CHIKARA, the most arcane elements of the characters, storylines, and even matches often become vital parts of comprehensive story arcs later and the beauty of it is that it perfectly works every time.
“A lot of advance planning goes into our seasons. You can never be ready for injuries or leaves of absence (people get sick! people have babies!) but the beginning, middle and end is clearly mapped before we play Note One for our audience. A lot of time, energy and love goes into the crafting of each season or multi-season arc.”
In addition to the intricate mythology, CHIKARA also gives fans another reason to obsess over each new chapter: Easter Eggs. Since the very beginning, CHIKARA has been known for their obscure references to comic books, films, science fiction, and of course, wrestling in general. Just like any Marvel movie, there are plenty of obvious ones that everyone seemingly picks up on, but for each obvious one, there's probably a dozen more hiding under the surface that CHIKARA's loyal fans meticulously hunt for.
“For a while, we had some very studious, trivia-minded fans that were expert at finding every little Easter Egg we dropped into the narratives. They would just pick right up on it. Every once and again we sneak one past them, but we've cultivated a fan base that prowls every corner in search of them. It's rare one goes unnoticed.”
It's ridiculous to think an independent wrestling promotion would excel so brilliantly at having this deep mythology rich with Easter Eggs, but like we said from the start, CHIKARA is completely original in the field of professional wrestling, even down to their merchandising efforts which completely blows away all of their competition except for maybe WWE. But while the big promotion of the wrestling land is more content to put John Cena's face on everything, CHIKARA's merchandise is a lot more structured and set up in a way that it enhances the fans' experience as opposed to just emptying their wallets.
“We've dabbled in graphic novels in the past. That's a fun extension of our physical universe. We recently, just as an experiment, made a few videos called ‘Journey into CHIKARA,' to see what a TV program might feel like. It was an interesting exercise. Up next for us will be our video game, ‘CHIKARA: Action Arcade Wrestling' which just got green-lit on Steam.”
CHIKARA's show this Sunday will be their second (and sadly final) show at The Norfolk Masonic Temple, a venue they jumped to in March for Altar Egos after running the Greater Richmond Convention Center last year. While the show was a success, it's not surprising to hear just why CHIKARA made the jump from the Convention Center to the more relaxed Masonic Temple.
“The Masonic Temple in Norfolk is a warm, intimate venue. It suits us much better than the giant convention center we played in Richmond. That convention center, to draw an analogy, is like Queen Live at Wembley Stadium. In Norfolk, we are Clapton's Unplugged album. That's how we roll.”
Running a show with an “unplugged” is almost routine for CHIKARA in their stomping grounds of Philadelphia now, but it's been great to see CHIKARA branching out more and more, especially with this season that sees them travelling from Minnesota all the way to the United Kingdom. Again, it's atypical of an Indy promotion and in fact, only two other wrestling companies in the entire country travel more than CHIKARA does month to month. While those other promotions may plan specific matches or plot points or feuds to coincide with their location, CHIKARA relies much more on their established brand as they travel outside of the Northeast, something that only adds to the cohesion of CHIKARA's final product.
“I think it's really important to not plan for the differences in audiences, but meet them at the top of the show, and mold the performance around what they give you. It has to be organic in that way. If we ‘planned' something we thought was right for Norfolk, and we walk out and find that isn't the audience's vibe at all, we'd be set up to fail. All too often I think, the value of being good improvisers in the ring goes overlooked.”
The value of a good improviser will be on full effect at CHIKARA's show this Sunday and if you're smart, you won't miss an afternoon of hilarious hijinks and impressive agility. There's absolutely nothing in this world quite like a CHIKARA event and this Sunday is your last chance to catch it within the comfortable confines of our state borders.
Wrestling fan or not, it's a great way to spend your weekend afternoon and just think about that watercooler talk come Monday. Instead of some boring story about a football game, regale your office mates with stories of Ice Cream clad wrestlers battling giant sized Ants while a yacht enthusiast cheers them on. That's not even half of what you'll get this Sunday at CHIKARA's The Marta Complex so start planning your trip to Norfolk now, people. We know we will!
CHIKARA's latest chapter, The Marta Complex, arrives in Virginia this Sunday at The Norfolk Masonic Temple. For more information on the show and where to buy tickets, click here.
When the Obama administration announced it would stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) last year, conservatives slammed the decision as a subjucation of the Constitution, but this morning, a federal appeals court in Boston sided with the administration in ruling a key provision of the anti-gay law unconstitutional.
Specifically, the First Circuit Court of Appeals took issue with Section 3 of the law, which defines marriage, for the purposes of the federal government, as between a man and woman. The decision of the three-judge panel was unanimous.
Advertisement:
Judge Michael Boudin, who was appointed by George H.W. Bush, wrote the opinion, declaring the law discriminatory. “One virtue of federalism is that it permits this diversity of governance based on local choice,” Boudin writes, including deciding to allow gay couples to marry. Congress, he continued, does not have the right to discriminate against gay couples and states that choose to recognize them without clearly showing why that discrimination is in the “federal interest.”
This is not the first time a court has found the law unconstitutional, but it is the highest court to do so thus far. However, DOMA's ultimate fate will almost certainly be decided by the Supreme Court at a future date.
“We've been working on this issue for so many years, and for the court to acknowledge that yes, same-sex couples are legally married, just as any other couple, is fantastic and extraordinary,” Lee Swislow, the executive director of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, which helped litigate the case, told the AP.
When Obama announced the Department of Justice would stop defending the law, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) established an outside group to fight on its behalf in court, costing taxpayers at least $1.5 million. DOMA also became a minor issue on the campaign trail, with Rick Santorum saying Obama's decision to let it die was an effort to “erode” America. Newt Gingrich even suggested it was an impeachable offense.
With Microsoft expected to make available a public technical preview of Windows Threshold around late September or early October , it's a good time to revisit the thorny cadence question.
For individual consumers, especially power users, Microsoft can't release new versions of Windows quick enough. But for many IT pros, a new version of Windows every year is too fast for them to test and update to their liking.
Read this Windows 9: Microsoft faces four daunting challenges The rumor mill says a public preview of the next big Windows release will appear this fall. But don't get fixated by features. This release isn't a "big bang" but is actually just the starting gun for the next stage in a very long race. Read More
Microsoft is believed to be trying to change the way users of all stripes think about "new releases" and updates starting with Threshold.
As I blogged previously, tipsters claim Microsoft will make monthly updates a mandatory part of participation in the upcoming Threshold technical preview. That preview, by the way, is aimed at enterprise users, according to sources of both mine and Neowin's. It's expected to show users some of what's new in the desktop experience and be limited to running on Intel-based PCs/devices.
There will be a separate preview of Threshold running on ARM processors, too. My sources are saying the current target date for that preview is January or February 2015. As the ARM-based version of Threshold -- which should run on both Windows Phones and tablets -- isn't expected to include the Windows deskto p, the focus will be on changes Microsoft is making to the Metro-Style Start screen environment.
Windows Threshold, which is widely expected to make its debut as "Windows 9," is expected to be released in the spring of 2015, I continue to hear. It's after that point that the cadence will really start to matter.
After Microsoft releases Threshold, sources say, the operating systems group is expected to go the route of Azure and Office 365 by releasing regular, incremental updates to Windows client and Windows Phone on a regular schedule, rather than bigger updates every year or two. (I am not sure right now what the game plan is for Windows Server, but as Server and Client are developed in tandem, I'd guess Server will be on this schedule, as well.)
These regular updates will include fixes as well as new features, from what I've heard. So instead of delivering Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 12, Microsoft's focus will be on updating Threshold.

This will be a big change for the company that not so long ago charged OEMs and users substantial fees for each new operating system release. But change already started with Microsoft making available its operating systems for "zero dollars" to Windows Phone and tablet makers with devices under nine inches.
The next phase of change could get really interesting. Does Microsoft go the subscription route with its updates and patches , as my colleague Larry Dignan is assuming? Or does Microsoft make these patches and updates free in the hope of keeping users on its platforms and hope to offset the cost by attracting users to subscribe to its other software and services? I've heard from my sources that Microsoft might go so far as to make Windows Threshold free to Windows 7 and Windows 8.X users to try to get the majority of its Windows users on the most up-to-date release.
Brad Sams at Neowin.net recently reported that recent builds of of the Threshold technical preview include a button in Windows Update that will allow users to move more quickly and seamlessly to the latest updated version of the operating system. While I'm sure there are lots of customers who'd love this, I foresee problems with IT departments who don't want users moving to untried and untested new bits with the click of a button.
Given the operating systems group's increasing focus on responding to what business users want, I'd be surprised if all users would have this kind of one-button update capability turned on in the final Windows Threshold release. I'm thinking there would have to be options for those who want all the latest bits all the time vs. those who don't. Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft's operating systems group, has made it clear the team realizes different users have different release-cadence tolerances . How Microsoft brings this realization to reality should be interesting....
BARILLA DUMPLINGS
571 Dominion Rd, Balmoral
Newly renovated and expanded, and busier than ever, Barilla is the beating heart of the Dominion Rd/Balmoral precinct. Why? Maybe it's the big fat juicy pork-and-fennel dumplings, or maybe it's those fried french beans with spicy salt. Don't forget to take some frozen dumplings home with you.

DUMPLING ACE
39 Pearn Place, Northcote
The dumplings are very good in this little restaurant, but it's the noodles that make the joint. The owners are from Shaanxi in China's west, so you'll find Sichuan-style chilli and hand-shaved noodles, which are a specialty of the area — thick and lumpy, they go well with a side of chicken “gizzards”, chargrilled and dusted with cumin and chilli powder. Yum.
Shaanxi
EDEN NOODLES
105 Dominion Rd, Mt Eden
One of our judges admits that in the middle of rushing round eating at other places, she just had to join the crowds at Eden Noodles and “get some of those dumplings ‘in spicy sauce'”. The hand-pulled dan dan noodles are magnificent, too, and they don't skimp on the tongue-numbing Sichuan pepper. It's not much to look at, this place, which makes it perfect for a first date. Assuming, that is, you're only interested in other food lovers.

JOLIN SHANGHAI
248 Dominion Rd, Mt Eden
Jolin is not the only restaurant in town to serve xiao long bao, the dumplings with soup in them, but we confess it's still our favourite. Sweet, hot, so tasty, such a treat. We're very partial to the lamb with cumin seeds, too, and the braised pork belly, served in a single large piece with bok choy, is magnificent.
Shanghainese
MAMA RICH
205 Great South Rd, Greenlane
The menu here is similar to that of sister restaurant Selera (see below) but it has been tweaked to include customer requests such as beef noodle soup, steamed pork dumplings and some vegetarian options. Selera's famous curry laksa is also on offer (chicken, seafood or vegetable). Extensive rice dishes — from fried to Mama village rice, pandan chicken rice, and dirty rice, as well as Hainanese chicken rice — are other popular options.
Malaysian
MR ZHOU'S DUMPLINGS
3130 Great North Rd, New Lynn
Mr Zhou used to own New Flavour, but when that got a bit tiring, he sold up and moved to New Lynn for the quiet life — at which point dumpling obsessives started heading west and Mr Zhou found himself as busy as ever. The classics are all there: lumpy handmade dumplings, cucumber salad, the shredded potato. Just go now.
Northern Chinese
NEW FLAVOUR
541 Dominion Rd, Balmoral
A frontrunner in the Dominion Rd dumpling wars, New Flavour is always busy. Try the 20 different dumpling flavours, but don't stop there. The salads are great: cucumber and sliced dried tofu; shredded potato; mixed vegetable with peanuts. Other dishes also beckon: a terrific fried eggplant with sticky toppings, the spring onion pancake, the deep-fried chicken strips with cumin. And for afters, there's an excellent sweet bean paste pancake.

SHAOLIN KUNG FU NOODLES
636 Dominion Rd, Balmoral
The sound of noodle dough banging on the kitchen counter greets you at Shaolin: be sure to order something with “hand-pulled” noodles in it. The food is heavily influenced by the cuisine of Henan, which in turn is very Muslim — not what you think of as Chinese food. We're pretty fond of the Xinjiang noodles fried with cumin and lamb and chilli; the kung fu soup, meanwhile, with chunks of lamb and those noodles, is brilliant. Also at 486 Queen St in the central city.

To determine Auckland's top 100 cheap eats 2015, the Metro judges considered the claims of 314 places: restaurants, takeaway bars, holes in the wall, food trucks and pop-ups, where you can buy dinner for not much more than $20, not counting whatever you want to spend on drinks. The full list can be found in the September issue.
When the doctors told amputee Mark Lesek that the severity of his injury made him ineligible for a prosthesis, he refused to give up. Left with nothing but his own welding and engineering business, several hundred thousand dollars, and an indomitable spirit, the Tasmanian gentleman began the quest for an artificial arm. First, he shopped around until he found a doctor who agreed to order an $80,000 prosthesis from Germany -- which eventually broke down (but not before he shelled out $6,000 for repairs on the thing). His next stop was the Branemark Osseointegration Centre in Sweden, where he was fitted with an $80,000 bolt that works as a sort of "artificial shoulder." Still unable to find a suitable arm, the guy teamed up with one of his employees to design and build his own lightweight magnesium "body powered" prosthesis. But that's not all -- he's also working with the University of Tasmania to develop a more agile computer-controlled arm, controlled with "a cap with electrodes which will be interfaced into the computer." Let's hope that all his hard work pays off -- and that he teaches those doctors a thing or two in the process.[Via Switched
When Eabametoong First Nation's first girls hockey team finished their first competitive hockey game in Thunder Bay, Ont., this week they skated to centre ice shouting: 'We won! We won!'
The scoreboard did not reflect their view.
A team made up mostly of boys — big boys — from Couchiching First Nation scored so many goals against the girls team that the timekeeper stopped posting them. (The Facebook page for the All-Native Goodwill Hockey Tournament says the score was 40-0)
Still, at the end of the game, the Rez Girls 64 team skated to centre ice, threw their arms around each other in a giant group hug and collapsed in a heap of giggles.
"It was the greatest feeling to see your girls lose humbly and still show love and respect for one another," said Candi Chin Sang, one of two co-coaches for the team of 10- to 12-year-old girls. "Their positivity is infectious."
Coach Leslie Campbell gives the Rez Girls 64 team a pep talk during the intermission of their first competitive game. (Jody Porter/CBC)
The team started the year with no equipment and no idea how they'd ever raise the money to afford a trip out of their First Nation, located 400 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay, to experience tournament play.
A surprise donation of equipment from a high school student in Markham, Ont., started a flood of goodwill for the team. A $45,000 grant came from the Arthur and Audrey Cutten Foundation, and was facilitated by financial planning service Scotia Wealth Management. And with it, the dream of playing against other teams got a little closer to reality.
"It just really showed us, and motivated us, that there are all these people and resources that are willing the help us get there, and all we needed from the girls was to put in their time and effort, which they did," Chin Sang said.
Excitement about flying in a plane, visiting the city and putting their new skills to work on the ice has been building among the girls for weeks. About 1,500 people live in Eabametoong and the biggest building is the school.

"I'm excited about going shopping and to McDonald's, going to movies and swimming," Alicia O'Keese wrote as part of a school assignment the day before the team was set to leave.
"I love hockey because we can have fun at the tournament and play a good game," she wrote.
Bad weather in Thunder Bay nearly ended the adventure. No planes were landing in the city on the day the girls were scheduled to arrive.
From plane to bus
But their coaches remained determined to fulfil the promise of a team trip, so they scrambled to find a different plane that would fly west to Sioux Lookout, Ont., and then chartered a bus to make the 400-kilometre journey south to Thunder Bay.
The next day the puck was finally dropped on their first big game.
"Within the first minute I was thinking about all the challenges we've overcome as a team and how proud I am of you," the other co-coach, Leslie Campbell, told her team after a first intermission that never saw them leave their own end zone.
"What I want you to know is we can overcome this. Keep skating hard. Keep playing hard," she said.

And they did. The team had only ever played one other game, against the boys from their own community. They'd never played on artificial ice before.
"It's slippery and people skate fast — a lot faster," said Kyrah Wabano, still smiling in the change room after the game.
"I had a great time. It feels the same playing here, but harder," said Kaydence Wapoose, "They're fast and really good."
"These boys just push," Wabano added.
But Wapoose, a 10-year-old who is the smallest skater on the team, said she wasn't intimidated by the boys' size or speed.
"I just hit their sticks," she said with a grin.
The confidence and compassion for their teammates demonstrated by the girls is what makes the team winners, regardless of what's on the scoreboard, said Chin Sang, who is also a social counsellor at the school in Eabametoong.
"Their attendance has improved, their schoolwork has improved and their love of each other has skyrocketed," she said. "This has been a journey that these girls needed to have to build themselves up as women."
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Titans receiver Justin Hunter remains in a Houston hospital after suffering a lacerated spleen in Sunday's loss to the Texans.
Hunter, a second-round draft pick out of the University of Tennessee in 2013, was hurt on a hit by Texans safety Danieal Manning in the first quarter on a pass that wound up being intercepted by Johnathan Joseph.
"Justin is actually doing well," Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said at his Monday news conference. "I talked to him last night and this afternoon. He is in Houston at the hospital and we expect him to be released over the next day or two. But everything is going well there, so that's good."
He returned to the game but was taken to the hospital after complaining of stomach pains. Teammate Nate Washington told The Tennessean Hunter was spitting up blood but Whisenhunt said he was not aware of that.
Hunter posted a message on Twitter Sunday, thanking his followers for their support.
Thanks for all the love, n to all the titans I'll come back strong — Justin Hunter (@justinhunter_11) December 1, 2014
Whisenhunt didn't rule Hunter out for the remainder of the season and said the team would know more later in the week.
The coach also offered a positive report on rookie quarterback Zach Mettenberger, who was knocked out of the game in the third quarter with what he said was a Grade 1 AC joint sprain of his throwing shoulder.
"The shoulder is not as bad as we thought it might be," Whisenhunt said. "He's sore, but he's moving around pretty good so we'll see how the week progresses with him as far as having a chance to play."

We are living in boom times for the private prison industry. The Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the nation's largest owner of private prisons, has seen its revenue climb by more than 500 percent in the last two decades. And CCA wants to get much, much bigger: Last year, the company made an offer to 48 governors to buy and operate their state-funded prisons. But what made CCA's pitch to those governors so audacious and shocking was that it included a so-called occupancy requirement, a clause demanding the state keep those newly privatized prisons at least 90 percent full at all times, regardless of whether crime was rising or falling.
Occupancy requirements, as it turns out, are common practice within the private prison industry. A new report by In the Public Interest, an anti-privatization group, reviewed 62 contracts for private prisons operating around the country at the local and state level. In the Public Interest found that 41 of those contracts included occupancy requirements mandating that local or state government keep those facilities between 80 and 100 percent full. In other words, whether crime is rising or falling, the state must keep those beds full. (The report was funded by grants from the Open Society Institute and Public Welfare, according to a spokesman.)
All the big private prison companies—CCA, GEO Group, and the Management and Training Corporation—try to include occupancy requirements in their contracts, according to the report. States with the highest occupancy requirements include Arizona (three prison contracts with 100 percent occupancy guarantees), Oklahoma (three contracts with 98 percent occupancy guarantees), and Virginia (one contract with a 95 percent occupancy guarantee). At the same time, private prison companies have supported and helped write “three-strike” and “truth-in-sentencing” laws that drive up prison populations. Their livelihoods depend on towns, cities, and states sending more people to prison and keeping them there.
You might be wondering: What happens when crime drops and prison populations dwindle in states that agreed to keep their private prisons 80 percent or 90 percent full? Consider Colorado. The state's crime rate has sunk by a third in the past decade, and since 2009, five state-run prisons have shuttered because they weren't needed. Many more prison beds remain empty in other state facilities. Yet the state chose not to fill those beds because Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and CCA cut a deal to instead send 3,330 prisoners to CCA's three Colorado prisons. Colorado taxpayers foot the bill for leaving those state-run prisons underused. In March, Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, estimated that the state wasted at least $2 million in taxpayer money using CCA's prisons instead of its own.
That's just one example of how private prison companies keep the dollars rolling in, whether crime is rising or waning. Not surprisingly, In the Public Interest's report calls on local and state governments to refuse to include occupancy requirements and even ban such requirements with new legislation. “With governmental priorities pulling public funds in so many different directions, it makes no financial sense for taxpayers to fund empty prison beds,” the report says.

Disclaimer: I realise I am an unsociable bastard. And that it may be "just me" - in which case this makes no sense. And I guess it offends that kind of "be positive" American sensibility (which I know is one of your strengths, even if I find it creepy). But damn there are a lot of idiots out there. I read stuff in various places and I think, "must remember not to bother with them". But then I forget. So I want the inverse of an RSS feed, or a Twitter subscription: I want something that tracks people I don't want to be bothered with. And then filters them out. The result might, for example, grey-out their comments on web sites. I can see various technical difficulties: detecting persistent identities across multiple sites; associating content with particular people on multiple sites; modifying HTML on sites with unknown structure. But I can also see that we're getting close to this been possible: single sign on is a big help; people seem to be getting better at interpreting social relationships and constructing social graphs. So, is this possible? Is anyone going to build it? Andrew
This just in – England's House of Lords has passed the same-sex marriage bill in what is believed to be the final hurdle before it becomes law.
The bill will now head back to the House of Commons for review of amendments and will be signed into law by the queen in a matter of days.
Lord Waheed Alli, who is openly gay, was among many Lords who wore pink carnations to show their support for the legislation. He told MSN UK that he is proud to have been a part of the 15-year fight to get the legislation passed.
"You have given me dignity where there was sometimes fear,” Lord Alli said. “You have given me hope where there was often darkness and you have given me equality where there was sometimes prejudice."
The first same-sex weddings in England and Wales are expected to take place in 2014.
Social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder, preventing millions from living the life they want for fear of being judged or embarrassed in front of others. (iStockPhoto)
When he was younger, Angelo Andreatos, now 48, was so self-conscious about his peers' opinion of him that he skipped out on social events if he had a pimple. After college, the aspiring actor put his Broadway dreams on hold when his fear of commuting from New Jersey to Manhattan, surrounded by people on the train each day, outweighed his desire to see his name in lights. By middle age, Andreatos stopped leaving his house for extended periods – sometimes a year or two at a time. He couldn't answer the phone because the mere thought of making conversation with a stranger – a takeout delivery person, a sales representative – terrified him.
Andreatos knew he wasn't just shy or antisocial. He had a problem. So in 2014, Andreatos – who had previously seen a therapist for depression and related conditions – returned to therapy and was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.
According to experts, social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder, as well as one of most prevalent psychiatric disorders in America. Just like Andreatos, millions of people are so paralyzed by the fear of being judged or embarrassed in front of others that they're unable to lead the life they want.
Some cases of social anxiety – like Andreatos' – are extreme; these individuals can't hold down a job, maintain friendships, use public restrooms or walk down a supermarket aisle. In particularly dire circumstances, they can't leave home. Yet others are less severe, says Dr. Beth Salcedo, medical director of the Ross Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders in the District of Columbia. These people might appear to function normally – complete school, transition into a successful career and attend social gatherings. However, their social anxiety disorder still impacts them, albeit in a more insidious way. They might be unable to, say, raise their hand during a lecture or speak up in a work meeting. As a result, they're thwarted from achieving their fullest potential – hence why some therapists have dubbed social anxiety "the disorder of missed chances."
"I see a lot of people who've stepped short academically or professionally," Salcedo says. "People who say things like, 'I really wanted to go get my MBA, but there was no way I was going to do all that group work. So I decided to become a data entry person for the IRS because I don't have to interact with anybody.'"
As humans, we all want to be liked. We all want to fit in. So where, exactly, does ordinary, run-of-the mill shyness or fear of humiliation end and social anxiety begin?
"It's all on a continuum," says Jennifer Shannon, co-founder of the Santa Rosa Center for Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in California and author of "The Shyness and Social Anxiety Workbook for Teens." "I think of social anxiety disorder, or any anxiety disorder, as a 'disorder' when it starts interfering with the person's functioning – when it's interfering with the goals they have in their life."
Plus, people who are merely shy are able to let down their barriers as they become more familiar with a situation or group, says Dr. Richard Heimberg, director of Temple University's Adult Anxiety Clinic. People with social anxiety? Not exactly.
Typically, those with social anxiety disorder engage in escapist or avoidant behavior, Heimberg says. Sometimes they purposely avoid places or events where they know they'd be forced to interact with people; they skip conversations with small talk because they're worried about awkward silences or being judged. Or they drink too much because they find alcohol makes them feel less uncomfortable around others. One patient, Heimberg says, almost didn't attend his own wedding because he was so nervous about walking down the aisle in front of a crowd of people. These actions are spurred by exaggerated thoughts and beliefs about how someone is viewed by others. What if I accidentally offend someone? What if I make a bad joke? If I'm not interesting, will people no longer like me? They're all watching me. They're laughing at me.
"They believe they need to be socially perfect, and then if they're not, they feel this exaggerated sense of threat that they're going to get kicked out of the tribe," Shannon says. "People who don't have social anxiety disorder ... just kind of jump into conversations. They don't worry too much" about being boring or awkward, or making a social faux pas. And research supports the notion that people with social anxiety disorder rate their own behavior more poorly than others observing them, Heimberg says. They're not as socially inept as they imagine they are – but their social anxiety tells them otherwise.
Most of the time, it's not externally obvious that someone is struggling with such thoughts. In fact, many people with social anxiety appear fine in social interactions, Heimberg says. But there are, occasionally, physical clues that reveal the person's anxiety. For instance, Andreatos used to sweat profusely during social interactions and occasionally has anxiety attacks. Others with social anxiety might avoid eye contact – they're afraid they'll be met with a harsh or mocking gaze – or tremble, blush or speak in a quaking voice. And in addition to anxious thoughts, people with social anxiety disorder might also experience a quickened heart rate, dry mouth or nausea in social settings.
In addition to missing out on life events, avoidant behavior spurred by social anxiety disorder reinforces negative thought patterns, Shannon says. "You'll think, 'It's good I didn't speak up at the meeting, because people didn't see how stupid I am,'" she says. "[Or], 'I'm glad I ended that conversation early because the other person now doesn't know how boring I am.'"
Those who struggle with social anxiety are often told to be "less self-conscious" or to "care less about what other people think." Often, children are told they'll outgrow it. But it's a little more complicated than that, Salcedo says.
Social anxiety disorder can manifest at a young age – say, elementary or middle school – but sometimes it presents even earlier. It often occurs during adolescence. And some individuals, like Andreatos, recall having it their entire life.
Researchers think social anxiety is partially genetic; people with the disorder, including Andreatos, often note that it runs in their families. Environmental factors, such as childhood bullying and social stressors, or parents who also have anxiety and/or exhibit avoidant behaviors, can also contribute to development.
You don't "outgrow" social anxiety or snap out of it; you'll likely need therapy, a medication like a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a combination of the two to alleviate your symptoms. Heimberg notes that an average of 15 to 20 years typically lapses between the onset of social anxiety disorder and seeing a professional.
Since social anxiety can worsen with time – and eventually lead to substance abuse problems or depression – early intervention is important, experts say. "The data are getting stronger and stronger that things like childhood bullying [and] cyberbullying ... really do have an effect" on the development of social anxiety disorder, Heimberg says. "So monitoring some of those kinds of things, and developing prevention programs at the school and community level, are really important."
Even if early intervention isn't possible, individuals of all ages can benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, Salcedo says – the go-to therapy most professionals use for anxiety disorders. In a typical session of cognitive behavioral therapy, therapists help patients with anxiety challenge their distorted thoughts – for example, "If I walk into a room, everyone's staring at me and thinking bad things" – and replace it with a more rational one. And by exposing themselves to stressors that cause anxiety – say, visiting the dry cleaner and complaining about a missed stain on a shirt, thus drawing unwanted attention to themselves – they can learn coping tools to deal with their symptoms.
Andreatos recently started cognitive-behavioral therapy. He's now leaving the house, and he's trying to pick up the phone when it rings. Eventually, he'll make it to a mall. He's slowly but certainly making progress against his social anxiety, he says. "I'm trying to get better."
Clad in just a flimsy freezer bag, the Android phone (in this case a Samsung Galaxy Nexus) has to withstand a whole hour in the freezer at minus 15 degrees

Two researchers at the University of Erlangen in Germany have demonstrated a way of accessing an encrypted Android smartphone using a freezer. To access the cryptographic key stored in the phone's memory, they placed the phone in the freezer compartment for an hour, with the result that the memory content remained – almost literally – frozen. They used a special tool to read the cryptographic key from the phone's memory (cold boot attack).
By cooling the device to below 10 degrees, the volatile memory can be made to retain data for a short period of time without power. Tilo Müller and Michael Spreitzenbarth exploit this to disconnect the battery for a moment, resulting in a reboot.
The researchers use a special recovery image to read the secret cryptographic key and other information from the frozen RAM
Source: Tilo Müller and Michael Spreitzenbarth They then use a key combination to invoke the bootloader, allowing them to flash and run their own recovery image, dubbed "Frost". For this to work, however, the bootloader needs to be already unlocked, as any unlocking would wipe user data. Frost then searches the memory for, among other things, the cryptographic key for decrypting user data stored in the (non-volatile) storage.
Since version 4.0, Android has offered the ability to encrypt personal data (if the user activates the appropriate checkbox in the settings).
When disconnected from the power supply at room temperature, data stored in RAM rapidly disappears. The Android logo after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 seconds without power

Writing these tips make me laugh considering I just got back from Europe – where I went on a major bender. Letting very loose in Italy! We ate everything. Multi course meals twice a day. Lots of great pasta, pizza, desserts & lots of gelatos – all incredible dishes and not a single bad meal. Usually I would always order my pizza back home with a 1/3 less cheese, but somehow I didn't quite make the effort to translate that to the Italians. Must have been something in those Tuscan grapes!
Regardless of my recent lack of self control, these tips below are really ingrained in the way I live and are second nature to me. Balance is key, you can't live your whole life with a drill sergeant going off in your head. Following these principles allow me to stay fit and healthy while still enjoying a great meal out.
1. Try to only eat out for special occasions or when you can afford to go to a good quality restaurant. This makes it special and why would you want to go out to spend money on food that isn't nutritionally good for you? If you are going to eat junk – make it at home from scratch to minimize the damage on your health. Even when you are traveling, you don't have to eat every meal out – consider eating breakfast in your hotel room or stopping by a grocery store and picking up some things for a picnic at lunchtime.
2. Order a salad for the first course with dressing & cheese on the side – this helps alkaline the body and get your digestive enzymes working to help digest your food easier. If the menu doesn't indicate what kind of lettuce is used – ask and then request all mixed greens, arugula or romaine – tell them to leave the iceberg out! (there are no nutrients in iceberg). Do not pour the dressing on your salad, simply dip your fork in the dressing before each bite!
3. Quiz the server to see which dish they think is the most healthy– The server has probably seen all dishes brought out one time or another and can tell you if your fish is swimming in butter or covered in cream sauce.
4. Go as far as telling the server you allergic to butter and dairy, soy and corn. Butter really isn't bad for you if it is organic and you use it in moderation – but restaurants can go crazy with it adding several hundred extra calories you can live without. Instead the chef can use olive oil to grill vegetables or fish. Soy and corn oil are the cheapest oils available so many restaurants use them. These cheap oils contain an overdose of Omega 6 fatty acids in your body and are probably not organic and have been genetically modified. When you have too much Omega 6 fatty acids and not enough Omega 3, your body goes out of wack, which is why the typical American is Omega 3 deficient and why you see everything being supplemented with Omega 3 now. Americans are getting too many corn products throwing off the balance!
Update: I know this advice can be controversial, but as someone who has suffered from some of the worst allergies, have been hospitalized and have taken prescription drugs to control them, I take avoiding GMOs very seriously. When I removed GMOs from my diet, eating a majority of whole, unprocessed foods, my allergies improved and was able to stop taking several prescription medications to control them.
How GMOs can increase exposure to allergies (see links for scientific studies, summaries and source data):
5. Don't order the meat unless you know it's organic, if there are no organic choices – fish is better, but not farmed salmon, which is fed corn and dyed pink! Try a bean dish and mostly veggies. Goat cheese can add protein on your salad.
6. Before you order the soup – ask if it's homemade or if it contains additives. Sometime last year it was a cold rainy day and I live right across from a gourmet food shop called “Dean and Deluca” – all of their soups sounded amazing and I wanted some soooo bad – but then I asked for the list ingredients and I was shocked! They get their soups premade from Sysco – a huge manufacture of processed foods. The first ingredient was Soy Oil and it contained MSG. MSG has so many negative side effects that I won't go into here – google it – you'll be shocked too. Another lesson here is not be fooled by fancy packaging and marketing – they are trying to dupe you in to paying more for the same quality food at fast food restaurants.
7. Drink hot water with lemon during your meal or hot decaf green or ginger tea – this helps digestion as you eat. Jugging any liquid during your meal slows down digestion which isn't good – because you could easily feel the bubble gut – my word for the dreading bloating & gassy feel after a large meal with lots of drinks! Drink a large glass of water before you eat about 20 mins before or wait after for about 30 minutes to 1 hour after.
8. Mix and match – not seeing anything you like on the menu? Check out the specifics for each dish and ask the waiter to create you a plate. One time I remember I was stuck in an airport with one food option – Ruby Tuesdays! They had fresh guacamole served with chips and another platter that had shrimp. I asked them kindly to make me a plate of Grilled Shrimp and large scoop of that guac. It was delicious and satisfying and I made it home without biting the arm of the pilot.
9. Order off the menu – Ask the chef to create something for you – this is especially great at a more established or fancier restaurant where the chef is highly skilled and can test his creativity for you. I remember one time I was at a fancy steak place in a casino for a work function – I don't eat steak and nothing else really was appealing to me – so I asked the chef to make me a vegetarian plate that only used light olive oil with some whole grains . It was so fabulous that one of my bosses who was sitting right across from me – looked over and said “Wow – I wish I had that.”
10. Create an old standby and build a relationship with the staff – I have my favorite standby restaurant when I am too busy to cook but still want to eat healthy. I've gotten to know the staff and they make everything perfect for me every time. At one of my standbys – The sushi chef makes me my roll just how I like it – a special roll with all veggies with no white rice or fatty sauces. He knows that I like my ponzu sauce on the side of my Ahi Tuna Sashmi to control the amount of salt that I eat. I always start with a big bowl of romaine with extra cucumbers and the ginger dressing on the side. They also have great hot green tea! It's a fail proof meal, I don't have to worry about it or stress over anything.
11. If you end up eating too much or not the right thing, follow the meal with fresh grapefruit juice. The grapefruit juice will minimize the insulin spike in your body (when insulin spikes rapidly, this releases fat storing hormones). Then take a brisk walk or do 50 air squats about 45 mins after. Some of the extra calories you just consumed will be used up and you'll be able to sleep better. (I credit this tip to “4 Hour Body” by Tim Ferris – it really works)
Everyone has known a rose. Perhaps your nana grew one from which she would snip the odd blowsy bloom to place in a little vase on the windowsill above her sink, or your landlord's slack garden maintenance meant mornings dodging wet droplets hanging from sodden flowers along a rainy garden path. Maybe you once plucked soft, cool handfuls of petals to stuff into bottles to make perfume that sat and turned rank a week later, or kept a single rose from a lover until it crisped dustily to pieces.
Roses weave themselves into our lives in a way no other flower does, and they have our devotion in return: in every annual nation's favourite flower poll, they leap into first place, leaving lilies, tulips and sweet peas flailing in their wake.

If you don't have a rose in your life at the moment, it is a good time of year to remedy this. It is not, from a horticultural point of view, the best time for planting – that would be in autumn or winter, when they have lots of time to develop their root system before any top growth is required – but it is the best time for gazing, sniffing and falling in love with them, which is of course the most important part. Once you have found the one you want, you can plant now, too, as long as you are prepared to keep it well watered all summer. This is absolutely the time to wander gardens, garden centres and nurseries, and stick your nose deep into a few roses to find out which one best evokes the perfumed hillsides of Iran, the perfect English country house summer garden, or your nana's kitchen.

For shade
Generally roses want sun and lots of it; the best and most plentiful displays will always come from roses that bask in full sun all day. But there are varieties that will tolerate shade for some of the day, so seek these out if you are determined to fit a rose into a less than ideal spot. Pale roses are particularly good in darker corners, as they light them up. Try the almost thornless ‘A Shropshire Lad', which has beautiful cupped and ruffled flowers in pale pink, with a rich fruity fragrance. Flowers will last longer and can keep their scent better in shade, too. ‘Susan Williams-Ellis' is a vigorous, early-flowering, pure white rose with a classic old rose fragrance, and worth trying in a little shade.

For containers
If you don't have soil into which roses can sink their roots, you can still have them in containers. Choose as large a pot as you can muster. Roses thrive best in deep, rich, moist but well-drained soil; recreate that richness with a compost such as Dalefoot Wool or Carbon Gold biochar and be prepared to keep them well watered and fed in summer. Poor, starved-looking plants with few flowers will be the result if you neglect them. ‘Sir Walter Scott' has a short, bushy habit and deep pink flowers with an old rose fragrance, and is good in a pot. It flowers all summer long. ‘Robin Redbreast' is a ground-covering rose that grows happily in a container. It is little and low-growing, and has the brightest red single flowers with sunny yellow stamens.

For fences and walls
Whether you have a short fence to clothe or an ugly outbuilding to hide, there is a rose that will do the job fragrantly and prettily. Some climbers are particularly good at staying compact, and ‘Gertrude Jekyll', which grows to around 1.8 metres (5ft), is one of the best at this, its stems covered in perfect ruffled pink flowers with a beautiful fragrance. ‘Alchymist', with soft, salmon-orange flowers and a strong scent, grows a little larger, to around 3 metres (10ft). For clothing bigger structures and for growing into trees, consider the beautiful and dramatic rambler ‘Veilchenblau', which grows up to 6 metres (20ft). The flowers have an intense fruity scent and open a bruised purple colour, fading to lavender. ‘Rambling Rector' is another beauty for climbing through trees, producing pure white, scented, double flowers in great clouds.

For scent
Every rose we come across, we lift to our noses, breathe in deeply and sigh “Ah!”, whether or not it deserves it. In the past, breeders became caught up in developing roses for a particular shapely bloom and let scent fall by the wayside, so many of those used as cut flowers lack fragrance. Happily, breeders of garden roses now realise that scent is high on the list of must-haves; as long as you avoid the hybrid tea roses bred in the low-scent years, you shouldn't find it too hard to track down a great-smelling rose. Some are particularly worth seeking out for their fragrance. ‘Ispahan' is a very old Middle Eastern damask rose with a heady, strong and sweet fragrance, and clear pink flowers. ‘Charles de Mills' flowers only once, but spectacularly and fragrantly, with flat discs of rich purple, full-petalled flowers. ‘Jude the Obscure' has beautifully cupped and full, soft apricot flowers, and a delicious fruity scent. Plant any of these and you will be sniffing and sighing with utter sincerity every June and July for years to come.

Crossword Puzzle
AMERICAN CROSSWORD puzzles conform to a set of established rules. The most popular of these rules are the ones formulated by Simon & Schuster, the original crossword puzzle publisher, and enthusiastically embraced by most markets.
Know the rules. To begin with, a puzzle should fit into one of five grid sizes: 15×15, 17×17, 19×19, 21×21 and 23×23. Many publications accept 13×13 and smaller, but 15×15 and larger sizes are generally accepted as standard, with 15×15 being the most common size.
The diagram (placement of black squares within the grid) has to be diagonally symmetrical. If a black square appears in the upper left hand corner, there must be one in the bottom right hand corner, and so on throughout the diagram. (Puzzles that are horizontally symmetrical are sometimes permitted, but rarely.)
Two-letter words are not allowed, and even three-letter words must be kept to an absolute minimum. Every letter square must be part of both an Across and a Down word; letters not interlocked in this way (unkeyed) are forbidden.
Except for theme entries which are given a greater degree of creative latitude, all words contained in the puzzle grid must be referenced: for the most part in standard dictionaries, atlases or encyclopedias, but almanacs, specialty dictionaries, thesauri, movie guides, works of literature, text books, concordia and a wide range of print sources are fine. Common expressions that may not necessarily appear in dictionaries—“dream on,” e.g.—are perfectly okay, but don't get carried away. “Cold pizza” is clearly a stretch.
Do not duplicate words in the grid. This holds true for expressions which share a common word. SEE RED should not appear in the same puzzle with SEE OFF, or MUST-SEE.
Themes are the newest development in crossword puzzles. Although not required, themes are increasingly preferred by more and more publishers and solvers alike. In a really well-constructed crossword, the longest words are related by topic or reference. This is the theme. Themes make crossword puzzles a lot more fun and interesting. Themes can range from the ordinary, like people with animals in their names (Stephen HAWKing, Thomas WOLFe), to “twisted” movie titles that elicit funny definitions (Mr. Holland's SOUP, The SORE Tattoo).
Begin with the grid. When I construct a puzzle, I first pick my grid size. This can be dictated by the theme (three or four 12-letter theme words are hardly enough for a 21×21 puzzle), or the market (most newspapers accept only 15×15 puzzles for the daily editions).
I find it handy at this point to draw up a list of as many possible theme words/phrases that I can think of, sorting the list according to word length. It makes it easier to juxtapose various theme words or replace any later if I have to. Let us say that I want to make a puzzle themed with computer terms, which I will define using wacky puns. First I develop a potential list of thematic words and phrases coupled with their letter counts, and tentative definitions. It looks something like this:
INTERNET [ 8] “Cooperative fishing trawlers?”
MOUSEPAD [ 8] “Where Mickey Lives?”
DIRECTORY [ 9] “Facts on files?”
HARDDRIVE [ 9] “Tough job for a trucker?”
MICROCHIP [ 9] “Snack food for an amoeba?”
SELFSERVE [ 9] “Autonomous Web site?”
MONITORLIZARD [13] “One who scrounges for CRTs?”
Position theme words. Next, I position my theme words on the grid, careful to avoid any situations which result in two-letter words or other troublesome juxtapositions. Additionally, I keep in mind that I must maintain a diagonal symmetry with the theme words. Having done this, I fill in only those black squares demanded by the theme words (Figure 1, at right).
After satisfying myself that no awkward traps have been inadvertently set (such as words that end in Q, or KX or IY pairings), I then complete the diagram by arranging the rest of the black squares. This task can be made even more interesting by trying to come up with a pleasing design in addition to following the rules!
Incidentally, most professional markets establish limits as to the number of black squares allowed in a puzzle. Simon & Schuster prefers that about one-sixth of the total number of grid squares be black. Other markets are more lenient, but if a puzzle clearly contains too many black squares nobody will want it. Around one-sixth is a good target.
Here's the finished grid with the thematic entries placed according to diagonal symmetry (Figure 2, below right). Four Down theme entries and three Across theme entries is pretty impressive for a puzzle of this size. Because MONITORLIZARD extends the full width of the grid and is situated in the exact middle, it complies with the rules of symmetry by itself and does not require a “mate.” You can also readily see that some of the black squares, such as those to the left of M and O in MOUSEPAD, and to the right of E and T in INTERNET were required in order to eliminate two-letter words.
The secret to designing a good grid is to break it up significantly enough not to have to fill in mammoth sections of white. (Just try to complete a solid 6×6 block!) On the other hand, you don't want to overdo the black squares or break up the grid to the point it resembles a Scrabble board. Remember, half the satisfaction a solver gets from working a puzzle is being able to remark in amazement, “Wow! how'd they do that?”
Complete the grid. Now comes the most enjoyable part: filling in the rest of the squares with legitimate words, abbreviations or phrases (Figure 3, below right). It usually takes me a good three or four hours to put together a 15×15 puzzle.
During the construction, I sometimes discover that my original grid design contains problem sections and has to be altered. This is perfectly normal, as long as the revisions maintain symmetry.
Try to use words that are fun and interesting. Nobody is going to delight in ABLATE or MYOCYTE, although “ugly” words are often unavoidable. Words like BATMAN or FUZZBALL can be enormously entertaining.
Digital dictionaries that come on CD-ROMs with wildcard search features are invaluable construction tools! So are disk-based libraries.
At this point, I am at last ready to think up the definitions, or clues. For many constructors, writing the clues is the final step. Therefore, it may also seem like the easiest, but this is far from the case. Boring clues, too many obscure clues, over-used clues can all lead to a puzzle being unceremoniously rejected by a puzzle editor. “Girl's name” is a definite no-no. “Australian dog” elicits yawns. “Chelated hydrocarbon.” You see the point?
A good mix of clue styles ensures success. About one-third of the clues should be straightforward: “Hammerhead” for SHARK, “Vidalia or Spanish” for ONION, “Exhausted” for TIRED. Another third should be clever: “Bamboo eater” for PANDA, “They're sold in lots” for USED CARS, “Farm animals” for ANTS. The rest of the clues can include fill-ins, names, crosswordese and, of course, clues for the theme words. “Return ___ Jedi” is a fill-in. The answer is OF THE. “Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow ___ Bikini” is also a fill-in. You figure the answer. “Actress Winona” is a name clue for RYDER. “Novelist Koontz” is a name clue for DEAN.
Crosswordese encompasses all those bizarre animals, genuses, weights, and the like, which are only found in crossword puzzles. Words like ADDAX or BAHT or ITEA, while perfectly acceptable, should be kept to a minimum.
One final caveat. Trademarks have been creeping into more and more puzzles recently at an alarming rate. My advice is to avoid them. After all, they are legally protected, use of which could result in lawsuits. And why give away free advertising, anyway?
STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- More than 100 union members and supporters rallied outside the Spectrum store in New Springville on Wednesday in support of the strike against Spectrum/Time Warner Cable.
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3 members have been striking at the store, located at 2845 Richmond Ave., since March 28, when they walked off the job after breakdowns in contract negotiations. Wednesday's rally accounted for day 121 since the strike began.
"This is considered skilled labor," said foreman Mark Dandrea of Local 3. "We're skilled labor. What they want is unskilled labor. I care about my customers. I've been here for 30 years."
Main reasons for the strike are the elimination of contributions into workers' pension, wage benefits and medical plans. Workers also claimed they were disciplined over repeated service calls from customers expecting unobtainable Wi-Fi speeds the company promotes.
"Charter is offering Local 3 a generous compensation package that includes an average 22-percent wage increase -- some employees up to a 55-percent wage increase -- and comprehensive retirement and health benefits, including a 401(k) that provides a dollar-for-dollar match up to 6 percent of eligible pay," said John Bonomo, a Charter spokesman. "This competitive offer will have a positive, lasting impact on employees' standard of living and allows us to grow a well-paid, highly skilled workforce for the benefit of our customers."
Local 3 explained that, although they are being offered higher wages, they would rather keep the benefits that were in place already instead. Many workers and their families are concerned that both parties will not reach an agreement.
Jillian Reyes, whose husband works for the union, said she is concerned every day about being able to feed her family or keep a roof over their heads.
"There are so many benefits on my life and my kids lives that they're trying to take away," Reyes said.
Council members on the technology committee and zoning and franchises subcomittee in New York City sent a letter to Hon. Kathleen H.

New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a suit against Charter Communications and Spectrum Management Holding Company for allegedly defrauding New Yorkers over Internet speeds and performance and not providing services to all neighborhoods.
Charter Communications closed on its $67 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks last year. The deals made Charter the second-largest home internet provider and third-largest video provider in the United States.
Her partner is still abroad and police are liaising with the authorities in the unnamed country to bring him to justice
The 39-year-old was guided during the 'sex lesson' with her son
Abuse: A mother has been jailed for having sex with her 12-year-old son while her partner told her what to do as he watched on a webcam from abroad (file picture)
A mother has been jailed for having sex with her 12-year-old son - while her partner watched and directed her over a webcam.
The woman wore headphones as she abused the boy in her bedroom as her lover viewed online from abroad.
The boy told police how he could hear his 39-year-old mother being told what to do as she gave him a 'sex lesson'.
The offence came to light when the woman 'blurted out' that she had abused the older of her two sons while speaking to a domestic abuse charity about her partner.
A court heard that her 'highly destructive' partner had so far escaped justice.
The woman, who cannot be named to protect her son, was jailed for three years and three months at Bristol Crown Court.
Judge Michael Longman told her: 'Your behaviour towards your son was contrary to human instincts and basic decency.
'It occurred after you met a man who clearly was controlling and over-bearing; a man who, it is also clear, should be prosecuted himself but is outside the jurisdiction and beyond the reach of this investigation.
'Even though he was at a distance from you, he continued to exert that influence, but you continued to behave towards your son in a way which, despite that pressure, your own instincts should have prevented.'
The court heard that the boy was just 11 or 12 when the abuse took place.
It came to light when his mother made a complaint at Next Link Domestic Abuse Services in Bristol.
Her confession was passed on to Avon and Somerset police and she was taken in for questioning, and the boy was interviewed.
Prosecuting, Mark Hollier said: 'In a very ordinary voice, he described an incident to the police officers about how his mother had given him a sex lesson in the main bedroom of the family home and this was observed by [the partner] via a webcam and computer link.'
The woman, who cannot be named to protect her son, was jailed for three years and three months at Bristol Crown Court (pictured)
The mother - who cried through much of the hearing - denied 'volunteering' to have sex with her son.
She was charged with engaging in penetrative sexual activity with a boy under 13 which she admitted.
The court heard that her two sons were taken into care by social services and are now living with a foster family.
The abusive partner is still abroad and police are liaising with authorities in that country - which can't be named for legal reasons - to bring him to justice.
Defending, Fiona Elder, said it was an 'extremely unusual' case and the mother was acting on instructions from her 'highly destructive' partner.
She added: 'She's absolutely devastated by the loss of the children and what she has done.'
A psychiatric report found the woman had a personality disorder which made her susceptible to being in abusive relationships and would become dependent on abusive partners.
Top-ranking Capitol Hill Republicans released a new report Monday on the Obama administration's Operation Fast and Furious that concludes high-ranking Justice Department officials “failed to identify red flags” in the mishandled gun-tracking operation.
The 140-page report singles out five senior agency officials: Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein and Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed Siskel.
This is the second installment in Rep. Darrell Issa's and Sen. Chuck Grassley's final investigation into Fast and Furious.
The first report focused on the involvement of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which ran the operation from its Phoenix bureau.
Fast and Furious ran from 2006 to 20011 and put roughly 2,000 guns into the Mexican black market in an attempt to trace them to leaders of drug cartels. However, many of them surfaced at crime scenes including the fatal shooting of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.
Grindler and Siskel were presented with detailed evidence during a March 2010 briefing on Fast and Furious that showed illegally purchased firearms being recovered in Mexico and the United States, but failed to ask probing questions or “take any significant follow-up action to monitor and supervise the conduct of the case,” according to report.
In addition, the Justice Department officials took no action when asked by ATF officials to help speeding up the indictments in Fast and Furious, instead showing concern only for how the press might react to the indictments, the report also found.
Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, says the agency has taken only limited action against the “negligent managers” and has yet to make changes to prevent a similar “disaster.”
The report begins with a detailed account of how then-acting AFT Director Kenneth Melson -- amid news report he would be fired over Fast and Furious -- agreed to several congressional interviews that appear to connect high-ranking Justice officials with the operation.
The findings are also based on testimony from senior Justice Department officials.
“The failures happened because of conscious decisions to encourage gun dealers to sell to known traffickers and avoid interdicting … all in the hope that would lead law enforcement to cartel connections,” the report concluded.
An Inspector General's investigation found no evidence that Attorney General Eric Holder was aware of the operation or involved in a coverup.
The Justice Department, whose headquarters was closed Monday because of the storm, could not be reached after several attempts.
“Officials in the Justice Department saw countless warnings and some even had the gun-walking information right in front of them, yet nothing was done to stop it, said Grassley, an Iowa senator and ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Climate change is causing the North Pole's location to drift, owing to subtle changes in Earth's rotation that result from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The finding suggests that monitoring the position of the pole could become a new tool for tracking global warming.
Computer simulations had suggested that the melting of ice sheets and the consequent rise in sea level could affect the distribution of mass on the Earth's surface. This would in turn cause the Earth's axis to shift, an effect that has been confirmed by measurements of the positions of the poles.
Now, Jianli Chen of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues have shown that melting due to our greenhouse-gas emissions is making its own contribution to the shift.

The wobble in Earth's axis of rotation is a combination of two major components, each with its own cause. One is called the Chandler wobble and is thought to arise because the Earth is not rigid. Another is the annual wobble, related to Earth's orbit around the sun.
Additional wobble
Remove these wobbles, and you are left with an additional signal. Since observations began in 1899, the North Pole has been drifting southwards 10 centimetres per year along longitude 70° west – a line running through eastern Canada.
This drift is due to the changes in the distribution of Earth's mass as the crust slowly rebounds after the end of the last ice age. But Chen's team found something surprising. In 2005, this southward drift changed abruptly. The pole began moving eastwards and continues to do so, a shift that has amounted to about 1.2 metres since 2005.
To work out why the pole changed direction, Chen's team used data from NASA's GRACE satellite, which measures changes in Earth's gravity field over time. The data allowed them to calculate the redistribution of mass on Earth's surface due to the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and mountain glaciers, and the resulting rise in sea level. It correlated perfectly with the observed changes in the mean pole position (MPP).
“Ice melting and sea level change can explain 90 per cent of the [eastward shift],” says Chen. “The driving force for the sudden change is climate change.”
Greenland thaw
Chen's team calculated that the biggest contribution is coming from the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which is losing about 250 gigatonnes of ice each year. Another big factor is the melting of mountain glaciers, which contributes about 194 gigatonnes per year. The contribution from Antarctica adds up to 180 gigatonnes per year, but there is considerable uncertainty here because changes in the gravity field due to Earth's crust rebounding are less well understood over Antarctica than elsewhere.
Since the MPP can be accurately measured using multiple independent techniques, its position and drift can be used to gauge the extent of ice sheet melting, especially in between the end of the ageing GRACE mission and the launch of the next generation of gravity-field-measuring satellites, says Chen.
Jean Dickey of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who was not associated with the study, agrees. “It's a way to monitor climate change by continuing to measure the deviation [of the MPP] from what we have seen in the past,” she says.
Chen presented his findings this week at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.
On a mid-April night in Afghanistan 10 years ago, an American fighter pilot dropped a 225-kilogram laser-guided bomb on a section of the Third Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry's “A” company, killing four. A catastrophic friendly fire mistake.
It's commonly called the Tarnak Farm incident, a soft name for such a deadly moment in Canadian military history.
Today, three survivors say the keys to coping with the fallout from that fatal April 17 — the worst Canadian Forces fratricide loss since the Korean War — include remaining in the military and redeployments to Afghanistan.
There was more carnage. Eight Princess Pats were injured, one severely. Others were traumatized emotionally. Some had both kinds of scarring, the latter often proving more troublesome to heal.
The dead, all in their 20s — Sgt. Marc Leger, Cpl. Ainsworth Dyer , Pvt. Nathan Smith, Pvt. Richard Green — never saw it coming. They'd been conducting an authorized live-fire exercise near Kandahar at an old Al Qaeda training base, a place called Tarnak Farm .
“I'll stay in until they tell me I have to leave,” says Perry.
So are Sgt. Lorne Ford and Warrant Officer Brett Perry, also in Edmonton.
“I'm a glass half-full type of person, so I'd say it has been very good,” says Edmonton-based Warrant Officer Curtis Hollister, 39, of his upward path through the Canadian Forces since 2002.
One more common bond: They don't give disgraced F-16 fighter pilot Harry Schmidt much thought any more.
The trio is remarkably similar in other ways, too. They think often of their dead comrades; they downplay their injuries from 2002; they are thankful for unwavering military support for their physical, mental and workplace needs. They've all since married and had two children each, with family life central to their happiness.
“He was an idiot. He did what he did and it's over,” says Ford.
Sgt. Lorne Ford's two young sons have never asked why he limps. They don't know he lost an eye, either.
“They may look and notice something is off but for them, that's been daddy since they were born — I limp,” says the Brampton-born Ford, 43.
“When I wear shorts, it's an obvious injury of missing flesh behind my leg and they've asked about that. I say, ‘That's when daddy got hurt overseas, when I was in Afghanistan.' And they're like, ‘Oh, OK.' They don't pursue it.”
Ford knows his boys, who are just starting elementary school, will eventually be more curious. At that point, Ford says he will deliver the “blunt truth” — that the American bomb's explosive power injured his right eye so badly it had to be removed; there was massive soft tissue damage above and behind his left knee; a leg nerve was severed, leaving him with no feeling on the bottom of his left foot.
Ford will limp for the rest of his life. But the injury doesn't diminish the soldier, who also served in Bosnia.
“The desire to soldier is still there,” says Ford, noting for a time it was difficult to accept “not doing what I love to do, which is leading troops in battle.”
“I knew I wasn't going to get back to being a section commander because of the nature of my injuries — that was a no-brainer.”
Ford credits the Canadian Forces for supporting him through his recovery and finding him demanding roles over the years. He is now back with the Third Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry as the unit's embarkation officer, a logistics wizard whose planning skills include the acquisition and movement of vehicles and cargo — some of it dangerous — “with as little hiccups as possible.”
Ford returned briefly to Afghanistan twice to escort families of the fallen, an important duty he values. But he yearned for a longer deployment: “I wanted to go back for years.”
He got that wish in the fall of 2011. Ford was part of a nine-month training mission in Kabul after Canada had officially ceased combat operations. The work was rejuvenating and fulfilling, he recalls. It was also a healing experience.
“I never felt like I really completed anything,” he says of the 2002 tour cut short by the tragedy.
“In my mind, I think I needed to do it.”
While in Afghanistan, the sergeant did not travel to Tarnak Farm. Half a world away, the site still pulls at him, memories strong of “the four guys.”
If the Canadian Forces offered him the chance, would he return?
“If they said tomorrow they were going to bring me right back to the site, I would go in a heartbeat.”
Warrant Officer Brett Perry urgently needed to speak to his old section commander, Sgt. Lorne Ford.
It was Sept. 3, 2008. Three of Perry's men were killed when their Light Armoured Vehicle was hit by a Taliban rocket. Perry, the section commander, was 50 metres away; he saw two gunners ejected, his driver was on fire, his second-in-command lost a leg. More Princess Pats' Second Brigade soldiers were wounded, one critically.
The devastated battle group was just three days from returning home. Perry, distraught, needed an emotional anchor.
“Naturally, the first guy I talked to as soon as I could was Sgt. Ford because he'd gone through that already,” says the Winnipeg native, referring to the Tarnak Farm deaths. In 2002, Perry was a 25-year-old corporal when he was riddled with shrapnel and concussed.
“There were some leaders that I've had in life along the way and he was one of the very first I had. Sgt. Ford was a machine and we all wanted to be like him.”
Speaking to Ford was comforting, recalls Perry, as he grieved the “very best a section commander could want”: Pte. Chad Horn, 21, Cpl. Andrew Grenon, 23, and Cpl. Mike Seggie, 21. Perry worried he hadn't done enough to protect them. Ford reassured him he had.
“Those kids were awesome, they did some very heroic things in the battlefield,” Perry says of the combat mission in the Zhari district.
“Chad Horn saved my life a number of times. He was my gunner, he fired me out of some stuff that was pretty bad. Mike Seggie was fearless. Andrew Grenon ran through fire in order to get us ammo as we were running low on another occasion.”
Perry also faced “pretty bad stuff” away from the battlefield; troubles rooted in Schmidt's decision 10 years ago to disobey orders. The former pilot claimed he acted in self-defence, an explanation rejected by a 2004 U.S. air force inquiry that found Schmidt guilty of dereliction of duty.
“I was just a fallen-down soldier for a lot of years,” says Perry, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after 2002.
He describes himself as “the angry guy,” a frustrated young soldier trying to make sense of Schmidt's actions.
Then Perry sought help. He found relief through Canadian Forces and veterans affairs' medical services. Perry also found peace in religion, becoming a born-again Christian prior to his 2008 deployment.
“I still struggle with a lot of things. But my faith and my wife, Andrea — my wife, especially — stood beside me during the very worst. Without her, I wouldn't be here.”
As for Schmidt?
“I had to release all my anger toward him,” Perry says.
“I just prayed and let it go. God took that particular part from me (but) I know there are some things that he left in me and I think there's a reason for that.”
Perry believes his “remnants” of anguish allow him to help troubled soldiers seeking answers from him the way he sought solace from Ford.
“I have them coming to me now with questions. They're suffering from things that they've seen or done overseas, so I think I'm left with some remnants just to give those guys a hand.”
How does one reflect, almost daily, on four dead brethren without raging at the man who caused their deaths?
It takes time, says Warrant Officer Curtis Hollister.
And over the course of 10 years, he's become proficient in navigating a delicate emotional boundary that separates sorrow for the fallen from anger at their killer.
“I do think about it. I think mostly about the individuals who died but I try not to dwell on the subject,” says the 39-year-old native of Cupar, Sask.
“You never forget the guys or that the incident happened, but it's part of your daily routine. I guess you could say you just learn to live with it.”
Hollister can now dismiss Schmidt as “a nonfactor for me.”
“I've moved on.”
Family has helped. He's fulfilled as a father to two preschool-aged children and husband to “my beautiful wife,” Jenifer.
Hollister says the military has also played a vital role in recovering from his physical and emotional traumas from a decade ago. He was hit by shrapnel after the Mark 82 exploded, suffered burns to his face and neck and was concussed.
“We went over for a mission and I thought it was my duty to complete the mission.”
But it was quickly evident Hollister was not fully recovered: “I was back too soon.”
The battalion directed him to the leave centre in Dubai, where Hollister would greet Canadian soldiers coming off round-the-clock rotations and assist them with administrative or personal tasks. That contact was therapeutic.
“It was good for me on the mental side because when I went back, talking to them and knowing that — what's the word I'm looking for? — I didn't let them down,” Hollister says.
“They reassured me that I was wounded and I think it was a healing process for myself. Working at the leave centre helped me immensely. It enabled me to meet my fellow soldiers from the battalion and helped me reconnect with them.”
Hollister, like Perry, would later be diagnosed with PTSD. Like Perry, he sought treatment (“It worked,” Hollister says) and was supported by his unit.
Hollister was deployed to Afghanistan again in 2005 and 2007. Today, he remains passionate about his career choice. He is now with the First Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and balks at the suggestion that the decision for him to remain in the military was difficult.
“Why was it important for me to stay? I've always loved the military. I loved being in the infantry. The camaraderie of your fellow soldiers is an important thing for me.”
The GOP tax bill unveiled this week doesn't mention President Trump's infrastructure plan, but it contains a number of provisions that could impact the administration's rebuilding effort.
Some transportation advocates had hoped the package would set aside some money for the White House's infrastructure proposal, which has yet to be released, or contain a fix for the ailing Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by federal fuel taxes that haven't been raised in over 20 years.
Those items didn't make the cut.

Worse, from the standpoint of groups that have been pressing for an infrastructure bill, the legislation did include provisions that could actually hurt efforts to upgrade U.S. roads, bridges and other public works.
Here are the top tax changes that could have major implications for the transportation sector.
Abolishing private activity bonds
For transportation advocates, one of the most disappointing tax provisions in the GOP measure would eliminate tax breaks for private activity bonds.
The bonds are considered a critical tool for public-private partnerships, which are supposed to be a cornerstone of Trump's infrastructure bill.
Private activity bonds are issued for private projects and have been used by businesses to finance a wide range of infrastructure projects around the country, including roads, highways, housing, hospitals and airports.
San Francisco International Airport just issued $179 million of private activity bonds to help make facility upgrades.
And the American Association of Port Authorities said tax-exempt private activity bonds are expected to play a major role in helping its members and their private sector partners complete $155 billion in planned port infrastructure investment over the next four years.
But the bonds have also faced some criticism, with a GOP summary sheet saying, “the federal government should not subsidize the borrowing costs of private businesses.”
Under the GOP tax bill, interest on newly issued private activity bonds would no longer be tax-exempt. Ending the program would save $38.9 billion, according to a summary sheet.
There is growing concern that ending preferential tax treatment for the bonds could undermine the administration's goal of incentivizing the private sector to help leverage $1 trillion worth of overall infrastructure investment in the U.S.
“This provision is particularly surprising as Congress and the Administration develop a new infrastructure initiative focused on attracting private-sector investment and encouraging public-private partnerships,” Richard A. White, acting president and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association, said in a statement on Friday.
“Instead, this provision would have a chilling effect on private sector investments in infrastructure projects.”
End of electric vehicle tax credits
House Republicans want to end a popular $7,500 federal tax credit for the purchase of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. It's just one of several tax breaks Republicans would end as a way to help pay for their massive bill.
Supporters have praised the electric vehicle tax credit for reducing the price of costly, emission-free cars for consumers and helping the burgeoning American electric vehicle industry, especially as an increasing number of automakers have bet big on the technology.
Advocates have ramped up lobbying efforts in recent months in an effort to protect the credit, which has benefited electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla. The credit is limited at the first 200,000 electric vehicles sold by each manufacturer, but no one has yet hit that cap.
“Electrification for vehicles is extremely important for the future of the auto industry, particularly given the fact that as we move towards autonomous, self-driving vehicles, those vehicles will be powered by electric,” said Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who represents America's automobile manufacturing hub. “That tax credit is really important for moving this technology forward.”
Less tax benefits for commuters
Under the GOP tax measure, businesses that offer parking or transit benefits to employees would no longer be able to deduct the cost of those expenses.
Some groups worry that the move will discourage businesses from offering commuter benefits, which can help defray transportation costs for working families.
But employees would still be able to receive untaxed transportation benefits or have them deducted as pretax income from their paychecks under the Republicans' tax overhaul. The pretax contributions for transportation subsidies are capped at $260 per month.
Democrats and Republicans representing urban areas have long supported the benefit.
“This is a valuable benefit that provides savings to millions of American workers and their employers,” White said. “In many regions of the country, transportation costs are the second highest household expense.”
It is, as I understand it, fairly customary for each new presidential administration to rewrite the Executive Order on classification. George W Bush didn't do so right away — he finalized his classification EO on March 23, 2003. Obama moved a bit more quickly, superseding the Bush EO with his own classification EO on December 29, 2009.
But even among the flood of Executive Orders that Trump has signed thus far in his term, I don't believe he has modified the Obama one.
That means a change made in 2003, which was retained in the Obama EO, remains in place: the inclusion of the Vice President among those who is and can name Original Classification Authorities (here's Bill Clinton's EO for comparison). Here's the language that gave Dick Cheney classification authorities:
Classification Authority. (a) The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by: (1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President;
And here's how Obama slightly tweaked that language to retain that authority for Joe Biden:
a) The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by: (1) the President and the Vice President;
Now, Cheney got this authority at an interesting time. That was a key time for Torture cover-up; in fact, sometime in that period, someone in the White House ordered George Tenet to make torture a Special Access Program. He was already pushing back against the CIA whistleblowers who knew the intelligence behind Iraq was crap, an effort that would lead to Scooter Libby sharing Valerie Plame's identity with Judy Miller on Cheney's orders (it remains unclear whether Cheney had Bush's permission to leak this). Yet for some reason, the new classification rules appear most closely connected with Stellar Wind (I believe this had to do with a change in whom Stellar Wind could target).
In any case, from that moment forward, the Vice President has had the authority to classify things. As you can imagine, given Cheney's role in the Plame outing, there was a heated and still publicly unresolved debate whether the Vice President also got declassification authorities, including of things that the President or Presidential authority had classified.
I raise this issue because more and more people have started raising questions about whether Mike Pence is sabotaging Donald Trump, especially as leaks like this come out of the White House.
President Trump told Russian officials in the Oval Office this month that firing the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had relieved “great pressure” on him, according to a document summarizing the meeting. “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Mr. Trump said, according to the document, which was read to The New York Times by an American official. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.” Mr. Trump added, “I'm not under investigation.” The conversation, during a May 10 meeting — the day after he fired Mr. Comey — reinforces the notion that Mr. Trump dismissed him primarily because of the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives. Mr. Trump said as much in one televised interview, but the White House has offered changing justifications for the firing. The White House document that contained Mr. Trump's comments was based on notes taken from inside the Oval Office and has been circulated as the official account of the meeting. One official read quotations to The Times, and a second official confirmed the broad outlines of the discussion.
If Pence believes — perhaps based on knowledge personally imparted by Cheney allies — that he has the ability to declassify anything that the President can, then he can leak details of White House events with utter impunity. Having him insta-declassify things would be a fairly safe way to feed the never-ending stream of embarrassing information coming out of the White House.
Oh, sure. He'd have utterly venal motive to do so. By feeding the Trump Russian scandal, Pence would make it increasingly likely he'd become President without having to expose his regressive views to the review of voters. But there's nothing Trump could do about it so long as an EO granting Pence the same authorities that Cheney abused to great effect remains on the book.
Claim: The Disney Junior program Doc McStuffins aired curse words and implied swearing through the use of creative bleeps.
FALSE
Example: [Collected via e-mail, November 2014]
Curse words being allowed and used on Disney Juniors Doc Mcstuffins….is this true !?
Origins: On 6 November 2014, the website One Million Moms, a subsidiary of the fundamentalist Christian organization the American Family Association, posted a petition urging concerned parents to contact Disney over the purported use of swearing and implied profanity in their popular Disney Junior program Doc McStuffins.
According to the petition, Doc McStuffins featured profanity or implied expletives on at least two occasions. In one instance, One Million Moms claims, a character's remarks were “bleeped,” implying that a swear word was used. In another, a brontosaurus on the show used the word “shitty” during a sneezing fit before hastily apologizing for his use of the word:
“Doc McStuffins” is an animated program that many found to be a clean show, but we have recently found that this is no longer true. “Doc McStuffins” includes curse words and bleeps to cover up foul language during this cartoon. Disney Channel has questionable content at times, especially when it portrays kids showing disrespect towards parents and adults. However, many still consider, or at least hope, it is a family-friendly channel since it is a network created for children, particularly the Disney Junior division, which is primarily for preschoolers. “Doc McStuffins” is an animated program that many found to be a clean show, but we have recently found that this is no longer true. “Doc McStuffins” includes curse words and bleeps to cover up foul language during this cartoon. Disney Channel has questionable content at times, especially when it portrays kids showing disrespect towards parents and adults. However, many still consider, or at least hope, it is a family-friendly channel since it is a network created for children, particularly the Disney Junior division, which is primarily for preschoolers. During one episode of “Doc McStuffins,” the dino stuffed animal said “sh*tty,” purposely placed immediately before a sneeze which was so it was not easy to catch, but it was still there. Just this week the program also used a beep to bleep out a curse word.
One Million Moms' latter claim, about the use of the word “shitty” on Doc McStuffins, was highlighted in a YouTube clip first posted to the service in July 2013:
However, that episode featured a toy brontosaurus with bad breath whose exhales stinky clouds whenever he says a word beginning with the letter “h.”
In this particular clip, he starts to say that his situation is “hopeless, horrible, hideous.” Halfway through the word “hideous,” he realizes he is saying a lot of “h” words and therefore exhaling stinky breath over everybody, so he stops and apologizes, saying, “Hopeless, horrible, hiddy … sorry!” In the poor quality, out-of-context YouTube clip it is easy for the viewer to mistake “hiddy” for “shitty,” but in the full context of the original episode what the brontosaurus is actually saying is obvious (and non-profane).
In another instance the group claimed occurred “just this week,” a YouTube video was presented showing a clip of the show with a supposed profanity bleeped out. That clip was uploaded on 2 November 2014, four days before One Million Moms' petition was published. In that footage the “bleep” does not appear to suggest a profane term, as it doesn't even occur over one specific word (or anywhere profanity would intuitively be used):
Quite possibly this “bleep” was not actually part of the original Doc McStuffins episode, but rather was a glitch in a particular cable or
satellite transmission of the show (or some other localized phenomenon).
While rumors of Disney animators slipping risqué elements into otherwise clean family fare are rife, genuine instances of such tomfoolery are extremely rare.
After a public hearing which was full of passion and anger, the MTA's board approved its 2009 budget, which includes service cuts and a 23% increase in revenue from fare and tolls hikes. The MTA is facing a $1.2 billion budget deficit next year, and it's expected a monthly unlimited Metrocard could cost more than $100 while bus lines and subway stops are limited.
The cuts and fare hikes will not go into effect until next spring, which the NY Times points out provides "time for state lawmakers to enact a rescue package to shore up the authority's teetering finances." (The Post reports, "The MTA legally has to have a balanced budget by year's end, no matter how the gap is filled.") Indeed, MTA Chairman Dale Hemmerdinger said, “Our fervent hope is that available resources will grow in the coming months, so that this budget can be amended before it is implemented.” That sounds like a Christmas miracle—waiting for the state to act!
MTA Executive Director and CEO Elliot Sander said, “I have called this budget draconian, severe, and extremely painful, and it is all of those things." Sander was nearly on the receiving end of one subway rider's frustration when Stephen Millies, an Amtrak worker, stood up to testify during the public hearing. Millies called the MTA "a collection agency for the biggest banks and insurance companies" and demanded to know where Sander was, as he reached for his shoe and yelled, "You made $300,000 last year, and this shoe is for you!" Here's video:
Police arrested Millies and gave him a summons for disorderly conduct. Millies told the Daily News, "I was simply showing the sole of my shoes as a sign of contempt ... "
A floating timeline (also known as a sliding timescale) is a device used in fiction, particularly in comics and animation, to explain why characters age little or not at all over a period of time – despite real-world markers like notable events, people and technology appearing in the works and correlating with the real world. A floating timeline is a subtle form of retroactive continuity. This is seen most clearly in the case of comic book characters who debuted as teens in the 1940s or the 1960s but who are still relatively young in current comics. Events from the characters' pasts are alluded to, but they are changed from having taken place years ago to having taken place more recently.
Overview [ edit ]
For an example taken from television animation, in The Simpsons, episode "I Married Marge", which was broadcast in 1991, Homer and Marge are shown in flashback to have conceived their son Bart in 1980, after watching The Empire Strikes Back in the cinema. In an episode that was broadcast in 2008, "That '90s Show", however, another flashback shows Homer and Marge in an earlier stage of their relationship, but instead sets similar scenes in the mid- to late-1990s. In both sets of present-day scenes, the characters are shown to be the same age—for example, Bart is still 10 years old in 1991 and 2008.
For comic book examples, any dates given within the comic are not relative to the publishing date of the comic (i.e. "10 years ago" means ten years before the reader read the story). This device enables publishing companies to continue to use their characters for as long as they wish without changing them significantly.[citation needed]
A floating timeline is usually abstracted from that of actual historical events, but may contain subtle references to the real world timelines. There may also be attempts made to maintain certain characters' historic timelines if it is felt to be essential to the character's personality, while allowing the rest of the world's timelines to continue to develop. For example, in the 2000s comic book miniseries The Punisher and its subsequent continuation, the title character is shown to be a Vietnam War veteran, just as he was in his earliest appearances in the Marvel comics of the 1970s. However, the stories place him in contemporary New York, where he meets fellow Marvel characters such as Spider-Man, who is barely much older than he was when introduced in 1962.[citation needed]
An example taken from novels is the case of mystery writer Rex Stout, who created a floating timeline for master detective Nero Wolfe and other principal characters in the corpus, while the stories take place contemporaneously with their writing and depict a changing landscape and society. Nero Wolfe's age is 56. "Those stories have ignored time for thirty-nine years," Stout told his authorized biographer John McAleer. "Any reader who can't or won't do the same should skip them. I didn't age the characters because I didn't want to. That would have made it cumbersome and would seem to have centered attention on the characters rather than the stories."[1] In the early novels, Wolfe dated himself somewhat by discussing his life before World War I and his combat service in that war, but in later stories he was less explicit about his past.[citation needed]

Kamaiyah's debut mixtape Good Night in the Ghetto initially comes across carefree and effortless, which might seduce you into thinking it was easy to make. The songs are simple, unfussy, and full of space, with a low-key mood meant less for a raucous house party and more for a casual basement hangout. Kamaiyah's calling-card song, "How Does It Feel," is here, and it's as wistful and sunny as it was when it came out last year. But now it's joined by 15 other tracks that hit on the same energy: It feels good to be young, but it's even better to be smart enough to appreciate how fleeting that feeling is.
*Good Night in the Ghetto'*s production is the aural equivalent of watching Too $hort and TLC videos half-asleep through one of Hype Williams' custom '90s fish-eye lenses—a blur of reference points from across hip-hop's glitziest decade. Kamaiyah is 20, which means her earliest impressions of that decade's music would have come around the time the industry was locked into a death spiral and rap was vanishing from the charts. Seen through this filter, it's easy to see how a video like, say, "Ladies' Night" would seem like the peak of some lost civilization. But while she carries a brick phone around as a prop for her throwback image, she otherwise she treats the whole back-in-the-day thing lightly, a personal quirk rather than a defining mission.
Besides, Bay Area rap has been celebrating the power of silky Anita Baker and Sade keyboard patches for years. These sounds have been recreated so lovingly for so long that they've become a thread snaking through a wide range of music. Kamaiyah is part of a tradition that extends back to early-‘90s hits like Conscious Daughters' "Something to Ride to (Fonky Expedition)" (she told Pitchfork that Conscious Daughter's Karryl "Special One" Smith gave her the mixtape title) and continues today: the Trackademicks-produced "Come Back" could easily have been given to fellow East Bay artist J. Stalin, whose music often has the same plush retro-funk feel.
Kamaiyah stands out from her peers, though, with her appealingly natural presence. Her voice sounds as unaffected and assured singing as it does rap, and she writes big hooks: The chorus to "Swing My Way" is full-bodied enough to picture a shirtless male guest star belting it, but she handles it herself, her small voice giving off its own heat. The little interjection "woopty woopty woo" on "Out the Bottle" is fearsomely catchy, "I hope I don't yelp this involuntarily in a roomful of strangers" catchy. But it's a detail, a grace note on an album that never oversells anything. Restraint is a slippery virtue to enthusiastically trumpet, but it usually marks the separation between an artist who can hold down a single and one who can comfortably occupy an album.
This poise is what makes Kamaiyah someone worth spending time with. There's a great song on here in the Too $hort tradition ("Niggas") about loving sex, and severe disinterest in being obligated to have it with one person. But it's not a sexual tall-tale meant to make Kamaiyah sound superhuman: "Hit the back room come back, my dress undid/ He gon' zip it back before they notice we be fucking," she sings playfully. On "Freaky Freaks," she falls asleep in her Jeep because she's too high to drive. This is: a) not something it's easy to imagine Nicki Minaj rapping about, and b) something an affable-everyman like Devin the Dude has probably done in real life. Approachability is a cornerstone of Kamaiyah's style.
And then, of course, there's her good-life ode "How Does It Feel." Despite some stiff competition, it remains her best song, something she implicitly acknowledges by reprising it for the introductory track "I'm On." It sounds even better on Good Night without eclipsing anything around it. The emotions on the tape—joy, yearning—are never better expressed than in the two questions she poses in the chorus: "How does it feel to be rich" and "How does it feel to just live?" The underlying subtext—that these might be two versions of the same question—is present, without insisting on itself. Just like everything else on Good Night, the essential substance is just there, a cocked eyebrow and a meaningful pause from someone who's confident enough to put it all out there in her own way and allow you a minute to catch up.
On Tuesday, the National College Hockey Conference released their season-ending report. Going into their fourth season, the NCHC appears to be in good standing. According to the NCHC release, the NCHC's conference tournament produced approximately $1.2 million in revenue. Also, the two-day Frozen Faceoff drew 22,569 fans. I believe those numbers will improve in the future.
While there's room for improvement, the NCHC appears to be headed in the right direction. Here are a couple of things that caught my eye from the season-ending report.
I want to be clear, the NCHC has done things the right way, however, there are a few things that could be improved upon. And again, I am only suggesting a few tweaks. Looking the issues, I consider the location of the Frozen Four the most pressing one. For the NCHC, the Frozen Faceoff is a very big revenue stream. Improving on the conference tourney location will only improve that revenue stream.
Field of Play
From the NCHC season ending report: With the ice conditions much improved in 2016, Target Center and the NCHC feel it can make sure the ice is in good playing conditions moving forward. Target Center will continue to tweak and adjust the glass and boards to make subtle improvements. As part of a separate project, the City of Minneapolis and Target Center are taking on; a new floor will be installed, which will improve the ice conditions for the 2018 event.
The Target Center opened in October of 1990 and is, for the most part, an NBA basketball facility. There were a handful of exhibition games played there during early 1990's and the WCHA held the Final Five there from 1999-2000. During the Target Center's existence, the ice in the Target Center has never been very good. There weren't a lot of hockey games played at the Target Center from 2001-2013. In my opinion, the Target Center isn't a good fit for hockey.
During the first two seasons, the ice conditions at the Frozen Faceoff have been poor. This past season, the Target Center's ice conditions were improved over the prior two seasons. That being said, there's still a lot of room for improvement. Poor ice conditions affect the fans' viewing experience. If you improve the ice conditions the play on the ice will only get better.
Future of the Frozen Faceoff
From the NCHC season-ending report: With two years remaining on the current contract with Target Center, the NCHC has begun to have discussions with its Board of Directors, Athletic Council and Target Center regarding the future of the conference's championship weekend.
Some hockey fans have suggested that the NCHC follow the Big Ten and WCHA's lead and move the conference tourney back to on-campus sites. I think this is a very bad idea. I believe the NCHC would be taking a step backward. So far, the NCHC has no plans of moving back to on-campus sites.
“We're in a great metro market in Minneapolis-St. Paul, in the heart of the conference and in a very important hockey market,” NCHC commissioner Josh Fenton told the Grand Forks Herald.
Here's what I'd recommend to the NCHC leadership, starting in 2017-18, the Big Ten, and the Western Collegiate Hockey Conference will hold their entire conference championship on-campus. Both leagues will no longer be holding their conference semi-finals and finals at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, MN. This means that the Xcel Energy Center will once again be available.
The league needs to strike while the iron is hot. It's time for the NCHC to move to a better venue. While the Target Center has been a workable site to hold the Frozen Faceoff, the league can do much better and should. It's not even close, the Xcel Energy Center is a much better venue to hold a conference tourney. It's also an arena with a hockey first mentality. Are there any questions?
Moving the conference to a newer hockey only NHL building would probably improve the college hockey fan experience. Also, there's a good chance that attendance numbers would increase with the move. As I mentioned earlier, having more fans attending the conference championship means more revenue for the conference.
Steve Grammont, co-founder of Battlefront.com can't actually see the future. But he and his business partner Charles Moylan have come unnervingly close not just once, but twice in the last decade. Battlefront has accurately predicted the last two major international armed conflicts — the wars in Syria and Ukraine.
In 2007 Battlefront.com published Combat Mission: Shock Force, a hardcore military simulation in which a NATO force went up against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. Their game had been on sale for years before Syria was swept up by a civil war, but they essentially called it well in advance. So prescient was their scenario that Foreign Policy Magazine used it to draw conclusions about the risks of sending in U.S. troops.
"People ask us what's next... My answer is, 'You don't want to know.'"
Must-Read Turn by turn: The story of Battlefront
Now, just 7 years later, the pair have done it again. Battlefront's next game, Combat Mission: Black Sea, takes place in Ukraine. Grammont and Moylan chose this particular battlefield back in 2009, years before the protests on the Maidan led to the overthrow of Ukraine's government and sparked a war with Russia.
"People ask us," Grammont says, "only half jokingly, ‘So, what's next? Do I want to know?' And my answer is … ‘No. You don't want to know.'"
The crisis in Ukraine has actually represented a developmental hurdle for Battlefront. The rapidly changing situation in the region has caused them to reboot the plot for their game once already. They're racing through the fall and winter months, while tensions are low in the region, and trying to launch the game before Christmas.
"We started hashing out the basic plot line in 2009 and basically — unfortunately — it was exactly what happened," Grammont said. "Our timeline was basically that in 2016 there was a coup in Kiev and Russia didn't like that. So Russia went in and grabbed Crimea and then started an agitation in the Eastern and Southern parts of Ukraine, and then went in with so-called ‘peacekeepers.' And that is, pretty much, almost exactly what happened."
In-development Russian units from Combat Mission: Black Sea
Grammont plays down his own team's prescience, however. He's a historian by training, and an independent game developer by trade, but the reason he picked Ukraine was really all Russian President Vladimir Putin's fault.
"It's not because we've got crystal balls," Grammont said. "It's just because this is what that bastard has done before. The guy's not all that creative. It's the same thing that he's done about four times before, and he is copying more or less what his predecessors have done.
"So, people that give Putin a lot of credit for being smart? I think they really need to reevaluate that. He's very predictable. … I learned very early on that history doesn't exactly repeat itself, but it does tend to produce a lot fewer surprises than some people say. Really, timing is more of the unknown."
"This is what that bastard [Putin] has done before. The guy's not all that creative."
Combat Mission: Black Sea will be out before the end of the year, but that won't stop Grammont's study of the region.
"I've been following this thing every day," he said. "Sometimes three or four hours a day just because I'm a history guy. This is huge history unfolding. You don't get many opportunities to watch it in real time."
At launch, Black Sea will contain an accurately modeled representation of the current Russian Army in addition to a selection of Ukrainian and U.S. Army forces. Additional modules will be released later on as either expansion packs or stand-alone games featuring additional Ukrainian and U.S. Army forces, but also regular forces from other NATO countries as well as Ukrainian partisan fighters.
The move from previous games, like Combat Mission: Battle For Normandy, has been challenging. After years spent modeling the historical conflicts of World War II, Battlefront is now faced with an evolving set of weapons being rushed to the battlefield. Everything from precision-guided artillery rounds to squad-portable aerial drones have the potential to be fielded in Ukraine. Keeping tabs on things has proven challenging for his team, but Battlefront is keeping tabs on the situation and making changes to their product.
"So there are all kinds of new stuff on the modern battlefield," Grammont says. "And we've seen this in Ukraine. At first, before Russia started giving prolific amounts of anti-aircraft weaponry to their proxy fighters in Ukraine, Ukraine's air force was going in and just blowing the snot out of them. They'd set up a roadblock and next thing you know a Mig [jet] would come in and just boom, gone. And it would take it out. And so not surprisingly the next couple of truckloads of stuff that came into Ukraine was truckloads of [new shoulder-fired missiles] and … anti-aircraft guns and things like that, and since then the Ukrainian air force has largely been inactive."
By using the unfolding conflict in Ukraine as a model, Grammont thinks that the Combat Mission series can continue to do the important work of informing public opinion about war.
Grammont thinks that the Combat Mission series can help in informing public opinion about war.
"People think that they're more informed about things than they really are," Grammont said. "We've got people running around with the first-person shooter games thinking oh, isn't this fun! What the real serious simulations can do is show people, hopefully, how nasty all this stuff really is.
"At our level of simulation … playing this game, you've got 500 guys, and you're like, ‘Yeah! I can kick ass.' And you do something really stupid; crest a hill, or you go into an area without recon, and the next thing you know you've lost a third of your force. … I think it's important for people to get a sense of being critical, or not being so enthusiastic about going to war. Because it might be worth it."

In the wake of incidents involving immensely popular YouTubers PewDiePie and Jon “Jontron” Jafari, yet another gaming personality has faced what at first appeared to be fallout from offensive or politically incorrect remarks. The issue with the term “fallout” is that once the media headlines and associated dust has settled, you realize that unless “fallout” is code for “overwhelming love, validation, and support” from fans, then the reality of several supposed downfalls may actually be just the opposite. This has certainly proven to be the case today for Colin Moriarty.
Formerly of IGN, Moriarty formed Kinda Funny with fellow expats and developed, over several years, a substantial following of over 400,000 YouTube subscribers (across two channels) and approximately $47k in monthly income via dual Patreon accounts. This is presumably divided between all Kinda Funny members, in addition to operation costs, and the venture has largely been seen as a success. Total revenue rises further thanks to Twitch tips and other sources.
As time passed it became clear Moriarty's political leanings differed from the rest of the Kinda Funny cast, and despite being a channel about games, a heated election season and its aftermath made such differences difficult to quell or contain. This all boiled over in a tweet Moriarty sent in jest on International Women's Day, driving controversy to new heights and spurring mainstream internet media to again hoist its character-busting weaponry, most notably IBTimes headline calling Moriarty “racist.” The headline, though still critical, was later adjusted.
IBTimes original headline, before an eventual edit.
Regardless of your opinion on Moriarty's behavior, what's very apparent is the self-described “outpouring of support” he's received since his Kinda Funny departure. Of course, stating such as fact in a tweet is easy. But today Moriarty's listeners, viewers, and fans put their money where his mouth is.
In less than a single day (just a few hours, in fact), Colin's new venture “Colin's Last Stand” has amassed over $20k in monthly support on Patreon. The sum is still growing, and though it may be too soon to predict a final figure, it's feasible that Moriarty's solo effort will rival the totals achieved by Kinda Funny's main Patreon to date. Money isn't everything, but it does tell us something. I saw the headlines, so did you; why would the public support an alleged sexist in such large numbers?
Well, this is where mental dissonance forces a choice to be made, and it can tell you a lot about your own worldview. Regardless of where you stand, it's clear Moriarty's fans take more stock in their own judgment of character than the media's (both written and social), and are just fine channeling their dollars toward someone they've known to be a stand-up guy for over a decade, recent revelations be damned.
The Kinda Funny crew, Colin included. Despite disagreement, the split was amicable.
The beauty of crowdfunding is its honesty; if you agree with IBTimes, that's your choice, and your stance is a valid one. If you reckon Colin is just as much of a “normal dude” as he's traditionally been, doesn't harbour secret bigotry, and intends to produce great content well into the future, well, you're probably one of his Patreon donors. Like with most things, voting with your wallet is the best course of action.
Moriarty's success slaps a clear exclamation point on a recent politicized gaming trend; coordinated media and Twitter character assassinations, deserved or not, are ineffective in 2017. Fans don't like being told what to think about the objects or their affection, and when it's tried, they respond with support twice as fierce. Despite being called anti-semitic by The Wall Street Journal and others, PewDiePie has seen incredible backup from peers as well as continued tremendous subscriber growth since (he now sits just above 54 million subscribers). Meanwhile, though “Jontron” lost 10,000 subs after controversial comments, the same amount and then-some have since been recovered.
Judging by Patreon results so far, it seems unlikely Moriarty will regret his decision.
Trying political times undoubtedly make being a web personality (or even a fan) more difficult than usual, but if there's one thing humans don't enjoy and historically never have, it's being controlled or told what to do. If kids and teens rally behind YouTuber gags that some find offensive, it's generally not because the youth as a whole has been nefariously co-opted by the “far-right.” Instead, said enthusiasm is fueled by rebellion against the prior generation. If mom and dad say “son/daughter, I want you staying away from that PewDiePie character, he's bad news,” then surely PewDiePie's channel will be the first site visited the moment said teenager's phone leaves his or her pocket.
Moriarty's venture “Colin's Last Stand” was named, I'm guessing, in honor of the rebirth and self-discovery he's currently experiencing. What he may not also realize is that there's another last stand taking place: the last stand of outrage culture. If being vilified by the media and Twitter no longer leads to public embarrassment and slow career death but instead support, adoration, and $20k a month in income, then please, sign me up immediately. Forget politics; it's clear that candid speech, however controversial, is currently a smart business decision.

Since I seem to have designated myself the Official Billfold Political Correspondent, I'm going to keep on going with various 2016 Election Updates that are relevant to our interests. For example! Republican candidate Jeb Bush raised more money than anyone else and he's done it super fast:
Jeb Bush's presidential campaign raised more money faster than any other campaign, according to new fundraising figures released by the Republican.
In just 16 days of the latest quarter, Bush raised $11.4 million, or an average of $714,000 a day, easily topping his nearest competitor, Hillary Clinton, who raised an average of $562,000 a day.
Good for Jeb! That is an impressive haul. An admiring Politico profile calls him “the $100 million man” and points out, “the super PAC's haul is unprecedented in American politics.”
You know what's not unprecedented in American politics, though? A frontrunner putting his foot very far into his mouth when talking about the working man. This week, Jeb basically deep-throated his foot with a suggestion that Americans should “work longer hours.”
While campaigning Wednesday in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush described his plan to grow the economy to a local newspaper, stating that “people need to work longer hours.” ABC reported that the comment, provoked by a question about tax reform, took place during a live streamed interview.
Bush told reporters that his vision for a more productive economy would require workplace participation to “rise from its all-time modern lows.”
Jonathan Chait analyzed:
In economic terms, productivity means output per hours worked. That is a crucial concept for economists, because, over the long run, higher productivity is the only way a society can actually increase its standard of living. You can increase your societal wealth by increasing the amount of hours worked, up to a point, but there are only so many hours in the day. Americans enjoy higher levels of prosperity today than we did a century ago because we produce far more in the hours that we work. In his second sentence, and possibly his first as well (its meaning is more ambiguous), Bush uses productivity to mean producing more by working more — people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income.
This casual slip in usage reveals an important assumption. Bush not only prefers higher productivity in its technical meaning (higher output per hours of work), which both conservative and liberal economists consider axiomatic; he likewise considers higher levels of work implicitly preferable. Liberals do not share that assumption. And the division over this question turns out to be buried within many of the economic fights of our time.
Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton pounced:
I got annoyed because I am an English language dork, and to my mind, you can't work “longer” hours, because an hour is a standard goddamned length, you know? Sixty minutes, like it or not. Of course, certain hours can feel longer, like when you're trapped with smug politicians speaking in soundbytes, or you're at the end of a shift that's already gone from sun up to sun down. That's relativity. Right? (I never took physics.)
Anyway, I know what the man means, and it's not that he thinks “Americans aren't work hard enough,” though that's giving the ball a good spin, Team Hillary. It's that he wants us to work more. The trouble is, we already do work more. We work 'til we drop, then we get up and work again. Many of us don't get any vacation and the rest of us barely take vacation. We're nuts for work in this country. We love it in a messed up Stockholm Syndrome-y, “Thank you sir may I have another?” kind of way.
Those of us who don't work 40 hours a week or more, who piece together flimsy part-time jobs, usually do so out of necessity, not because we think it would be fun to support a family by going freelance without either security or benefits.
Here's Chait again, with the data:
Americans work many more hours than French workers, or workers anywhere in the advanced world except South Korea and Japan. Conservatives embrace that distinction, and seek to extend it further still.
Maybe Jeb honestly doesn't know that. He's a multi-millionaire former governor from an wealthy and elite family of presidents: not exactly a man of the people. Maybe he needs to be educated. Maybe he'd find it really helpful if everyone wrote their name, their age, and how many hours they work a week on a postcard and mailed it to his campaign headquarters.
The last word on this belongs to techies:
It never helps to work more. Technology helps us work better. In terms of workforce productivity, we need to figure out how to get more done in less time — and this applies to every job and every person. It crosses the political divide.
Amen.

In Fantasy MLS, it's often better to go with your gut feeling. Everyone was high on captaining our prodigal forward Will Bruin, and I was about an hour away from doing so, but the rational side of my brain screamed at me that midfielders are safer captain picks than forwards. Enter into the picture Eric Miller 's fat foot and a HUGE dose of home-field deflections, and Bruin bags another seven fantasy points against Montreal. Meanwhile, I could've picked virtually anyone else in my roster and scored better, but I thought for sure Portland's midfield was going to find their form against Mike Magee -less Chicago. Darlington Nagbe created Portland's late goal, but didn't actually get a proper assist on it, so I'm 0-for-2 on picking captains. I did claw one point back by manually subbing out injured Javi Morales for Matthew Fondy, leaving me with a decent 59:
Captain? More like Crap-tain
Round 2: Goonie Magic
Late-game heroics have almost become commonplace in San Jose, and this time it was defender Victor Bernardez providing two goals in the closing 20 minutes to secure one point for the San Jose Quakes, and more importantly, 18 points for the 2% of owners that had him on their rosters. Houston Dynamo posted its second straight shutout, and Jermaine Defoe showed all of the Toronto FC doubters that he is going to make the most of the big chances that he receives.
Here are the top scorers in Round 2 (Full fantasy stats at: MLSSoccer.com):
Round 3: A Horst, a Horst, My Kingdom for a Horst
Teams with mid-week CCL matches: LA, SKC, SJ
Teams with Byes in Week 3: HOU
Teams with Byes in Week 4: LA
Teams with Byes in Week 5: SJ
The Dynamo is on a bye this weekend, which means that a lot of fantasy teams are in dire need of a reasonably-priced defender to make up for the lack of value options of David Horst, Kofi Sarkodie, and Corey Ashe. Last week, I stressed CBIs (clearances, blocks, and interceptions), and after two weeks, we're starting to get a picture of who is going to be providing consistent defending bonuses. If we take a look at the top CBI-producing players, and factor into the equation the number of CBIs they generate per 90 minutes per million fantasy dollars, we see that there are a few budget-priced options available:
Andrew Farrell seems to be back in the starting rotation for the Revolution, and with Goncalves out injured, Farrell carried the bulk of the defensive duties. That will likely drop as Goncalves comes back from injury, but it's something to keep an eye on. Futty Danso is in a similar situation, as he is covering for the injured Pa-Modou Kah. Norberto Paparatto is cheaper than Futty at $8.0, and he is a CBI machine. He has scored a total of 11 points *despite* Portland giving up a goal in each of their first two matches. Lovel Palmer is the cheapest player to crack the top five in CBIs at $6.0, which means that every fantasy a million spent on Palmer will return 2.7 CBIs per 90 minutes. Bakary Soumare rounds out the top five for CBI value.
On the attacking side of the pitch, I'm expecting Toronto to punish a DC back line that hasn't gelled yet. FC Dallas and Chivas USA have both scored four goals and given up three totals in their first two fixtures, so I wouldn't be surprised to see a multi-goal game at Toyota Stadium.
Good luck, and be sure to pick a different captain than me!
Speaking at her weekly press conference just off the House floor moments ago, Speaker Nancy Pelosi made her most impassioned argument in weeks, for including a public option in comprehensive health care reform legislation, arguing against the idea, favored by some conservative Democrats, of mandating that people buy health insurance, and then throwing them into what she called the “lion's den” of the private insurance industry.
In so doing, Pelosi came closer than any member of the Democratic leadership has thusfar to suggesting that the individual mandate should be conditional on the inclusion of a public option. Pelosi did not elaborate, when pressed by TPMDC, on whether Congress would revisit the individual mandate if the public option can't survive the Senate. But her implication was fairly clear.
The House, she said, “will not force America's middle income families to negotiate with insurance companies.”
Health care experts agree that health insurance market reforms can not work unless everybody is in the risk pool–and that means a mandate. But privately, many activists and experts believe that a strong individual mandate is also a gift to the insurance industry, and that it should be used as a bargaining chip to secure other robust measures, such as the public option.Pelosi declined to comment on the uncertainty about the public option in the Senate, but said her goal was to make sure that the House has as much leverage as possible when House and Senate negotiators meet to iron out differences between the bills in conference.
“I want to send our conferees to the table with the most muscle for America's middle class,” she said.
This is about going into that room and coming out with the best coverage and the lowest cost for America's working families. I believe that that is best achieved by going to the table with the public option. I believe that the arguments are very convincing, public support is there, and, by the way, the dollars. The robust public option that is being considered in the House saves $110 billion. How can you ignore that?
Pelosi said that House health care leaders will make a decision about whether to endorse a Medicare-like public option in “the next few days.” In that time, the House will ask the CBO to evaluate the savings potential of three different public option proposals, and make a final determination based on the results.
Like a number of Democrats in the Senate, Pelosi jumped on the insurance industry's recent anti-reform actions, including a discredited AHIP report the industry propagated to raise unfounded doubts about the impact a health care overhaul will have on insurance premiums.
“Anyone who had any doubts about the need for such an option need only look at the…health insurance industry this week. They put out a report on health insurance reform–specifically addressed to the Senate bill–which has been totally discredited…and then later in the week, in order to change the subject I guess, they launched a more than $1,000,000 TV ad campaign to falsely tell America's seniors that they would be hurt by what happens to Medicare in the health reform bills.”
Pelosi didn't go so far as to predict that the bill President Obama signs will include a public option–and she even suggested that at points along the way the name and design of the government insurance plan might change. But she repeated, definitively, that the House's package will be strong on that score.
Alice Springs man Kevin Reid died a 'hero' protecting wife in US
Updated
The "heartbroken" wife of Alice Springs man Kevin Reid, shot dead in the US this week, has told of how he died protecting her during a robbery attempt as they walked home from dinner in the southern state of Georgia.
The Savannah-Chatham police department confirmed 54-year-old Mr Reid was shot dead after he was approached by three men while out walking with his wife on Wednesday night.
In a statement on her Facebook page, Kari Graham-Reid said her husband died a hero.
"As many of you have heard, my husband was shot and killed Wednesday night when we were walking home from dinner," Mrs Graham-Reid said.
"He moved me out of the way and more than likely saved my life. He was a hero in so many ways, and my heart is broken."
In Alice Springs, Mr Reid's friend Dale McIver said the couple were just days out from celebrating their first wedding anniversary.
"It sounds like that Kevin, as always, was the absolute true gentleman, and it looks like he sort of stood in the way and protected his wife, Kari, and very sadly got in the line of fire and unfortunately has not survived," Ms McIver said.
Mr Reid died en route to hospital and police said they were searching for the suspects.
Kevin Reid killed months after opening business
Mr Reid owned a car rental business in Alice Springs before moving to the US and setting up an Aboriginal art gallery five months ago.
According to Mr Reid's website for his business — The Australian Aboriginal Art Gallery — he spent 25 years working in communities throughout Central Australia.
In an interview filmed by a local TV station in August, Mr Reid commented how much he loved the city of Savannah, and that he and his wife had met there.
The ABC understands Mr Reid and his wife married in Savannah, Georgia in September 2015.
"Kevin was the most wonderful man I've ever known, he would give the shirt off his back to help anyone in need," Mrs Graham-Reid said.
"He was bright, funny and deeply loyal. The happiest day of my life was the day we got married. I treasure every minute we had together.
"I want to thank you all for your love for Kevin, condolences and thoughts of sympathy. He made an impact on people wherever he went and he will be missed by countless.
"Kevin, you were the love of my life and I will miss you every single day. My world will never be the same."
Ms McIver said she had known Mr Reid well and she was shocked by his death.
"He loved Central Australia, but he also loved travelling the world as well and had an absolute passion for Aboriginal art," she said.
A memorial for Mr Reid will be held at his Savannah business on September 28.

Leigh Griffiths headed Celtic's second of the night
Celtic took a giant step towards the Champions League group stage with an extraordinary play-off first-leg win over Israeli side Hapoel Beer Sheva.
Brendan Rodgers' team were utterly dominant in the opening half, scoring through Tom Rogic and a terrific double from Leigh Griffiths.
The wheels fell off suddenly early in the second half as Lucio Maranhao and Maor Melikson netted.
But Moussa Dembele headed in a fourth and Scott Brown rattled home a fifth.
The two sides meet again in Beersheba on Tuesday but that game will have to go some to match a brilliant and madcap European night at Celtic Park.
Craig Gordon's magnificent save from a Maharan Radi header preserved Celtic's lead at 4-2 and Hapoel had a penalty claim turned down shortly before Brown's goal.
A late goal by Brown (centre) restored Celtic's three-goal advantage
One half, three goals
For Celtic, it had been so easy for so long.
Griffiths was so involved in the first half it was difficult to keep a check on how many versions of himself were out on the pitch. Scott Sinclair's pace troubled Beer Sheva, Rogic had a field day and Brown led the side well.
Celtic were ahead when Griffiths dinked a beautiful ball over the visiting defence to Sinclair, who was promptly taken out by goalkeeper David Goresh. It would have been a penalty had it not been for Rogic following up to drive Celtic into the lead.
Soon after, Sinclair went down in the box but a big shout for a spot-kick was waved away. It hardly seemed to matter because in Celtic's performance there was always the promise of more goals. And they came.
Kolo Toure strode out of defence and found Sinclair, who put James Forrest away down the right. His cross was nutted home brilliantly by Griffiths.
The third was even better, a sumptuous Griffiths free-kick from wide to the right of the Hapoel penalty area. The striker curled into the top corner. Total class.
Second-half scare
Melikson (centre) brought Hapoel back to 3-2
Hapoel had no shots on goal and, seemingly, no hope of turning it around, but they did.
From a counter-attack, Lucio struck from close range to make it 3-1. From another advance down the left two minutes later, Melikson drove home from a central position and suddenly it was 3-2.
Celtic were in shock, but gathered themselves to score a fourth. Griffiths was involved again, swinging in a corner for Dembele to head home.
Gordon's superb save from Radi was as impressive as it was critical.
And then Brown added the dramatic flourish, his first shot fluffed, his second rifled into the Hapoel net to send Celtic Park back into a blissful state.
To call it a classic does not quite cover it.
Judicial Crisis Network chief counsel Carrie Severino praises her organization's last-minute television attack advertisement against Michigan Supreme Court candidate Bridget McCormack for assisting in the representation of Guantanamo detainees. But Severino's article, which appeared in the National Review Online, failed to mention that the right to counsel for the detainees, such as the one McCormack represented, has been defended by prominent conservative lawyers and the federal courts.
The ad in question began running the week before the election and has been heavily criticized both locally and nationally for attacking McCormack's participation in the legal proceedings for accused detainees at Guantanamo. The 30-second ad features a mother whose son was killed while serving in the military in Afghanistan, who asks "how could" McCormack "help free a terrorist"? In fact, McCormack was part of a Bush-era legal system set up to represent Guantanamo detainees, many of whom were found to be improperly detained. In defense of the ad, Severino writes that the Judicial Crisis Network was "proud of the service we performed by exercising our constitutional rights and bringing these facts to the people of Michigan." But this attack on the provision of attorneys for detainees - regardless of their guilt - is not new and has been repeatedly discredited by prominent conservatives.
For example, Severino recycles the argument that the detainees should not have access to counsel based on their status as "foreign enemy combatants." As conservative Professor of Law Orin Kerr has noted, this argument is "simply incorrect," as evidenced by the Bush administration's abandonment of such a claim and Supreme Court and subsequent rulings that established the constitutional right of detainees to "go to federal court to challenge their continued detention," a right not contingent on citizenship.
Kerr offered this analysis in the wake of similar attacks on Justice Department attorneys who - like McCormack - had provided representation for detainees prior to entering government service, describing the attacks as "ridiculous." Also in response to this earlier incarnation of the current smear, a "group of prominent lawyers, many of them conservatives and former Bush administration officials, signed a letter denouncing the attack as a 'shameful' effort." From the 2010 letter, which included prominent conservative attorneys David Rivkin, Lee Casey, Kenneth Starr, and Viet Dinh, among others:
The past several days have seen a shameful series of attacks on attorneys in the Department of Justice who, in previous legal practice, either represented Guantánamo detainees or advocated for changes to detention policy. As attorneys, former officials, and policy specialists who have worked on detention issues, we consider these attacks both unjust to the individuals in question and destructive of any attempt to build lasting mechanisms for counterterrorism adjudications. The American tradition of zealous representation of unpopular clients is at least as old as John Adams's representation of the British soldiers charged in the Boston massacre. [...] Such attacks also undermine the Justice system more broadly. In terrorism detentions and trials alike, defense lawyers are playing, and will continue to play, a key role. Whether one believes in trial by military commission or in federal court, detainees will have access to counsel. Guantánamo detainees likewise have access to lawyers for purposes of habeas review, and the reach of that habeas corpus could eventually extend beyond this population. Good defense counsel is thus key to ensuring that military commissions, federal juries, and federal judges have access to the best arguments and most rigorous factual presentations before making crucial decisions that affect both national security and paramount liberty interests. To delegitimize the role detainee counsel play is to demand adjudications and policymaking stripped of a full record. Whatever systems America develops to handle difficult detention questions will rely on, at least some of the time, on an aggressive defense bar; those who take up that function do a service to the system.
The right to counsel has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the courts. Most recently, the respected Chief U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan and is in charge of Guantanamo proceedings, reminded the government in September that the constitutional right to access to the courts for detainees "means nothing without access to counsel" because they "are inseparable concepts and must run together." In fact, this fundamental constitutional concept is the exact point of the op-ed penned by McCormack in 2005 that the Judicial Crisis Network mischaracterized in their ad campaign against her as "an opinion piece in the Detroit News where she encouraged other attorneys to represent suspected terrorists." From McCormack's June 16, 2005, Detroit News op-ed (via Nexis):
Town in Massachusetts, United States
Foxborough is a town in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States, about 22 miles (35 km) southwest of Boston, 18 miles (29 km) northeast of Providence, Rhode Island and about 73 miles (117 km) northwest of Cape Cod. Foxborough is part of the Boston metropolitan statistical area. The population was 16,865 at the 2010 census.
"Foxborough" is the official spelling of the town name,[2] although the alternative spelling "Foxboro" is also frequently used. This alternative spelling is used by the United States Postal Service as the correct form by which to address mail to recipients in the town[citation needed] although both can be processed by their system. The sign on the post office reads "Foxboro".
The town is best known as the site of Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots of the National Football League and the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.
History [ edit ]
Main Street c. 1906
Settled in 1704 and incorporated in 1778, the town of Foxborough was named for Charles James Fox, a Whig member of Parliament and a staunch supporter of the Colonies in the years leading up to the American Revolution.
The town was once home to the world's largest straw hat factory. Founded by local businessman E.P. Carpenter, the Union Straw Works burned to the ground in the early 20th century. The town post office now stands on the site.
Foxborough was composed of small neighborhood communities until the early 1900s. These included Foxvale/Paineburgh, which remained semi-independent until the early twentieth century; Quaker Hill in South Foxborough; and Lakeview/Donkeyville in West Foxborough.
Schaefer Stadium (later known as Sullivan Stadium, then Foxboro Stadium) opened in 1971 as the home of the New England Patriots, after the football team spent its first eleven seasons playing at various stadiums in Boston. The family of Billy Sullivan owned both the Patriots and the stadium until they sold the team in 1988. The stadium, however, lapsed into bankruptcy and was then bought by paper magnate Robert Kraft. With Kraft in control of Foxboro Stadium, he prevented the Patriots from relocating to St. Louis in 1994 by refusing to let the team break their lease, then bought the Patriots outright. Kraft then founded the New England Revolution, one of the charter clubs of Major League Soccer, in 1996.
Gillette Stadium opened in 2002 as a replacement for Foxboro Stadium. The Patriot Place shopping plaza, built on land surrounding the stadium bought by Kraft, completed construction in 2009. The plaza includes a variety of restaurants, clothing stores, and other retailers.
Geography [ edit ]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 20.9 sq mi (54.1 km2), of which 20.1 sq mi (52.0 km2) is land and 0.81 sq mi (2.1 km2) (3.88%) is water.
Foxborough is located at (42.065248, -71.247856).[3]
For the purposes of the United States Census Bureau, the built-up central area of Foxborough known as the Foxborough Census Designated Place (CDP) has a total area of 7.6 km² (3.0 mi²). 7.5 km² (2.9 mi²) of it is land and 0.1 km² (0.1 mi²) of it (1.69%) is water.

Foxborough's climate is humid continental (Köppen: Dfa) with four distinct seasons, which is the predominant climate for Massachusetts and New England.[4] Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Spring and fall are usually mild, but conditions are widely varied, depending on wind direction and jet stream positioning. The warmest month is July, with an average high temperature of 83 °F and an average low temperature of 62 °F. The coldest month is January, with an average high temperature of 36 °F and an average low temperature of 18 °F. Periods exceeding 90 °F in summer and below 10 °F in winter are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 14 days per year seeing the former extreme. Because of the town's relatively short distance from the Atlantic Ocean, temperatures tend to remain warmer than locations further inland. Like the rest of the northeastern seaboard, precipitation is distributed fairly evenly throughout the entire year, with the winter months receiving slightly more precipitation than the summer months. Powerful storm systems known as Nor'easters can produce heavy amounts of rain and snow at any time of the year, but these storms most often strike during the winter months, causing significant snowfall amounts and blizzard conditions. Thunderstorms occur somewhat frequently in the summer, occasionally bringing heavy downpours, damaging winds, and hail. Tornado activity is relatively low in the area, although there have been a fair share of tornado warnings issued over the years. Due to its location along the United States eastern seaboard, Foxborough is somewhat vulnerable to Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms that threaten the region from late summer into early autumn.

As of the census[17] of 2000, there were 5,509 people, 2,486 households, and 1,372 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 730.9/km² (1,895.7/mi²). There were 2,576 housing units at an average density of 341.8/km² (886.4/mi²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.57% White, 1.42% Black or African American, 0.13% Native American, 1.07% Asian, 0.29% from other races, and 0.53% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.60% of the population.
There were 2,486 households out of which 25.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.9% were married couples living together, 9.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 44.8% were non-families. 37.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.95.
In the CDP, the population was spread out with 21.7% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 35.0% from 25 to 44, 21.6% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.6 males.
The median income for a household in the CDP was $50,431, and the median income for a family was $58,924. Males had a median income of $42,030 versus $35,370 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $31,245. About 4.1% of families and 5.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.4% of those under age 18 and 8.7% of those age 65 or over.

Public schools [ edit ]
Foxborough has a public school system. The Foxborough Public Schools (FPS) district currently has an enrollment of over 3,000 children in grades from pre-school to grade 12.
Foxborough public schools:
Foxborough High School offers a wide variety of sports including: golf, track and field, football, soccer, cross-country, volleyball, swim, basketball, wrestling, hockey, indoor track, cheerleading, lacrosse, baseball, tennis, and softball.
The mascot of the high school is the Warriors, whose colors are blue and gold.
The football team has won the Hockomock League title and also won the Division 2 Super Bowl various times, most recently in 2007 with a 21–10 victory over Burlington. Coincidentally, the Super Bowl win also gave coach Jack Martinelli his 200th win. During the 1987 and 1988 seasons, the Warriors won back to back Division 3 Super Bowls and went undefeated in 1988. This team featured 5 players that went on to play Division 1 college football (Chris Cady, Eric Matckie, Tom Nalen, Dan Sullivan, Rob Turenne). The cheerleading team has also earned recognition, making it to nationals for the first time in 2004 and then again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The golf team has produced many all-scholastic players and even state champions, as has the wrestling team. The boys' indoor track team were the Hockomock Champions in the 2006/2007 season. The field hockey team have been the Hockomock Champions several times in recent years.
Foxborough High School is also known for its music program, which includes a string orchestra, symphony orchestra, chorus, marching band, concert band, symphonic winds, winds ensemble and jazz band/choir. Many of these groups regularly place in competitions, but the Jazz Ensemble has been recognized in several Essentially Ellington competitions. The top 15 Jazz bands in the country send in recordings of themselves and judges the bands. Foxborough is known for being in the top 15 for several years.
Private schools [ edit ]

Finalizing the disengagement of fighting forces in Ukraine and keeping Kiev from renewing hostilities are the priorities for tackling the crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has told his American counterpart, John Kerry, in Beijing.
Lavrov met the Secretary of State on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which will bring President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Barack Obama, together to discuss Ukraine for the first time since their informal conversation in Normandy, France, at D-Day anniversary commemorations in June.
“We believe it necessary to complete as soon as possible the settlement of the disengagement line so that the ceasefire and terms of the armistice could be monitored,” Lavrov said after his meeting with Kerry.
The disengagement is part of the so-called Minsk agreement, a semi-formal deal signed in early September that set out a roadmap for de-escalating the hostilities in eastern Ukraine, but failed to produce a full end to violence.
Lavrov said both the Minsk agreement and the earlier Geneva agreement, signed in April, which provides for Ukraine to hold profound constitutional reforms to address the grievances of its rebel provinces, must be implemented.
“John Kerry and I agreed today that this task is still relevant and probably even more acute than it was back in April, when the process was supposed to be launched,” he said.

Moscow also asked Washington to put pressure on Ukrainian authorities in Kiev to prevent a possible resumption of its military crackdown on the rebels.
“The most important thing is not to indulge the ideas floating around in Kiev that they need to gather strength and go back to the use of force as a solution to the crisis, to talk hotheads out of such ideas and to make sure that the authorities in Kiev deliver on the promises they made, that is to pursue the path of political resolution,” Lavrov said.
The two also discussed the latest claims by Ukraine, which accused Russia of sending dozens of tanks and other military hardware to the rebel-controlled areas. The reports were not substantiated by any proof, while both the US and NATO said they had no evidence of such an incursion.

"Suffice it to say that we do have some disagreements about some of the facts on the ground with respect to Ukraine. We have agreed to exchange some information between us regarding that. We have also agreed this is a dialogue between us that will continue," Kerry said.
Kerry also seemed to suggest that new Western sanctions against Russia were not imminent.
"The choices Russia makes will decide what happens with respect to sanctions in the long run here," Kerry said.
Earlier, Washington had threatened to impose a new round of sanctions, if Moscow acknowledged the election in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics held last week. Russia declared its respect for the voice of the people the ballots represented, but stopped short of formally acknowledging them.
Lavrov and Kerry discussed other issues of interest to the US and Russia apart from the Ukrainian debacle, including the crisis in Syria and nuclear talks with Iran.
Given the critical and commercial success of Game of Thrones , the HBO television adaptation of the spectacular Song of Ice and Fire series of medieval fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, it seemed like only a matter of time before a comic book tie-in was announced, particularly after Bantam Books acquired the rights earlier this year.
Now the first issue of a Game of Thrones monthly comic has been officially announced for September, to be published in single issues by Dynamite, and collected in book editions by Bantam. The comic will be scripted by Daniel Abraham with interior art by Tommy Patterson, and the cover artists may also be of particular interest to comics fans, as they include not only Mike S. Miller but noted painter Alex Ross .While Ross may be the bigger name, Miller most accurately captures our own feelings about the series in his quote from the press release:
George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones is the best book series I've ever read. Not just in the fantasy genre, but in ANY genre. Just as I hear people saying Game of Thrones is the best series on TV, I'm sure they'll be saying the same about the comic book. You can't find a better writer anywhere than George, and I was very excited to get the opportunity to draw covers for the comic book adaptation.
While September is still a ways away, previously released sketches by Patterson of both Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister offer a glimpse into what readers can expect from two of the most beloved characters in the series:
To the Editor:
A note to Neil Genzlinger (“The ‘R' Word: Really, Really Overused,” Arts pages, Oct. 2):
Your Critic's Notebook column about the overuse of the term “Really?” was so deeply vacuous that I couldn't help but feel that you have stepped into my area of expertise.
Really, Neil? Really? You're upset about too many people saying, “Really?”? I mean, really.
O.K., fine, when it's used in scripted media, it is a little lazy. But comedy writers are lazy. You're not fixing that.
So, here's the bottom line.
If you're a writer, fine, don't use it. But in conversation it is fun to say.
I did a “Saturday Night Live Weekend Update” segment titled “Really!?!” with Seth Meyers a few years ago. It was a blast and the audience loved it.

Your example with the girl in the office and the bad clothes? It is definitely much more fun to look at her and just say, “Really?” than to actually talk about the stupid outfit. Really, it is.

The launch of Venezuela's state cryptocurrency El Petro should take place within a few days.
Everything is ready for the launch of El Petro, the Venezuelan oil-backed cryptocurrency, the state authorities said.
"It is a matter of days before we announce the first issuance of the ‘petro' cryptocurrency," said Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez.
It is expected that El Petro will help Venezuela cope with economic difficulties, the state suffers due to the US economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. The state cryptocurrency will differ from bitcoin, as it will be backed by real assets of oil and gold. On 27 December, President Nicolas Maduro approved El Petro's financial support by 5 billion barrels of oil from the oil reserves of Venezuela. According to the Ministry of Finance, the value of these assets is equivalent to $267 billion, which exceeds the current capitalization of bitcoin, standing now at $242.7 billion.
In the past few months, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, have become a popular means of preserving and multiplying assets in countries with a troubled economy and absence of a viable financial system. The record prices for bitcoin are constantly demonstrated by the Golix exchange, which is available only for citizens of Zimbabwe. According to current data, the rate of bitcoin on par to the US dollar on Golix exceeds ​​$23,000, while its average rate according to Coinmarketcap is $14,472.
Jolla, the Finnish startup that carried the MeeGo torch out of Nokia in order to light a fire under its own smartphone OS: Sailfish, has taken the next step in its platform play, launching SDK installers to encourage developers to get building native Sailfish apps.
It's offering graphical installers for Windows, OS X and Linux (in 32 bit and 64 bit flavours). The SDK itself was released back in February, during the Mobile World Congress tradeshow — where Jolla made a big sales pitch to carriers.
Jolla's plans for Sailfish include licensing the OS to other device makers and creating customised, branded versions of the software for third parties. But it also intends to create its own Jolla-branded phone hardware running Sailfish. Although Sailfish will support Android, Qt and HTML5 apps, Jolla wants native apps to be part of the mix — to fully take advantage of the Sailfish UI features and properly bring the platform to life as it seeks to build a fully fledged ecosystem.
The Sailfish UI was demoed at the Slush startup event in Finland last November. The software has a big focus is on usability, with pulling and pushing gestures used to navigate and select/view content, allowing a lot to be achieved with one-handed interaction. The platform also supports true multitasking — to allow currently running apps to appear as interactive tiles on the homescreen. These tiles then support app interactions — giving developers scope to customise how users can interact with their apps when they are sitting as tiles on the Sailfish homescreen.
The first Jolla-branded Sailfish handset is due in the second half of this year — likely in time to capture the Christmas market. Jolla CEO Marc Dillon wouldn't be drawn into predictions of how many native Sailfish apps the OS will have when the first Jolla device launches when TechCrunch spoke to him back in February, saying only that: “We're getting a lot of interest from developers.”
So here's the news: Microsoft is forcing game developers and game developing companies through the hoop of their app store, encroaching on their revenue and putting itself in the way of dealing directly with the customers. Why am I not in the least bit surprised?
This happens when you put all your eggs into one basket, a basket held by a hulking, monopolistic company. When Thomas Edison became too greedy with his patented cinematography technology, the people who wanted to make films made the perilous crossing of the American continent to escape his shakedowns. But where do game developers go from here? There is no landmass, or ocean for that matter, that Microsoft and their platform do not reach. They can threaten to gate you out of their platform on a global scale, which is exactly what they are doing with Epic. And as Windows is the only game in town, the digital entertainment industry is mightily and royally screwed.
Hands up those of you who didn't see that coming.
Here's a thought: If the industry had diversified the platforms they targeted earlier on, say in the mid-2000s, when Linux was starting to come into its own, maybe this situation could've been avoided. Yes, marketshare, library support, drivers, hardware support, and so one, were not ideal on Linux back in the day. But we have seen how things can be turned around, right? We have an example in living memory of how, how by unilaterally nurturing a rich ecosystem of apps, you can get users to adopt a new platform. And with a healthy amount of users, developing for the new guys, even developing drivers, suddenly becomes a sound business strategy for third parties. Yes, it is circular reasoning: more apps attract more users and more users attract more apps (which attract more users), but that is how Android became top dog in the mobile app arena.
If just a handful of PC game companies had stopped for a second and analysed where their market was going back then, they would have still been in time to jump start a viable gaming platform using Linux.
It's a bit late now, though. In fact, probably way too late. As we have seen, efforts like those of Valve porting Steam to Linux have clearly not been successful. Two years down the line and this month's survey reveals that the percentage of Steam users on Linux is noew below 1%. Although these figures do not take into account users of SteamOS itself or, indeed, users who are forced to dual-boot to play their favourite games, they would make any company executive balk at the idea of porting their games to Linux.
Notwithstanding, my gut feeling is that only by cutting Microsoft out completely, by boycotting their platforms, and then migrating games to another, friendlier and more open platform (hint, hint) would developers be able to reverse Microsoft's stranglehold on the PC gaming industry.
However, I am not delusional and I realise that it is unlikely that any company is going to take such an enormous risk at this stage of play. It would give too much of an advantage to competitors who are willing to jump through Microsoft's hoops. As for the gamers: they don't care, at least they don't care enough. The whole gaming industry, users included, have slithered down the conformity slope way too far to turn back it would seem.
So they had it coming. All those game companies which never freed a line of code in their lives and hang on to decade-old titles just to try and squeeze a few more bucks out of the users with pointless, crappy anniversary editions? All those developers that ignored Linux and its users? They built this market and the market is as they are: lazy, greedy, pitiless and cut-throat.
In other gaming news, MAME, the emulation engine that allows you to play classical arcade and console videogames, is now open source. Now distributed under mostly GPL licenses, Linux distributions will be able to start packaging all its bits and pieces for their users right away.
And that's how it should be done.

The boy was seen entering the canal yesterday evening
An 11-year-old boy pulled dead from a canal had been jumping into the waterway with friends, firefighters have confirmed.
Officers received a report on Thursday evening that the boy had been seen entering the canal in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, but had disappeared soon afterwards.
South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue and the Ambulance Service attended the scene and the boy was found in the water at around 11pm.
Gary Willoughby, from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, said: "This 11-year-old boy was actually taking part in a pastime that boys of his age call tombstoning.
"Unfortunately it's aptly named. It's jumping from unknown heights into unknown depths of water.
"They tend to jump straight into the water. They don't assess the water temperature, they don't see if there are any dangers hidden under the water - shopping trolleys, cars, anything like that, any reeds they might get tangled in.
"They don't even assess how deep the water is before they jump."
Mr Willoughby added: "It's a very dangerous pastime. Unfortunately this boy lost his life. I have heard of other people that end up in wheelchairs for the rest of their life."
"I'd like to send my condolences to his family at this time.
Mr Willoughby said he was campaigning for line boards to be placed along dangerous watercourses with combination locks that can be unlocked by ringing 999.
There was no sign of police activity on Friday morning at the scene, which is behind the large Parkgate retail park.
It is understood the rescue operation took place in a stretch of the South Yorkshire Navigation close to a path which crosses the canal over a metal bridge.
The path connects the retail park with the Eastwood area of Rotherham, but there are no houses or other buildings in the immediate area.
The bridge over the canal is one of three next to each other also taking the track across the River Don and the main Doncaster to Sheffield railway line, which all run parallel to each other.
CLOSE Indonesia's air transportation chief confirmed that the Trigana Air Service plane was found by villagers in the country's largest province, Papua. USA TODAY

A search plane early Monday spotted the wreckage of an airliner that vanished Sunday in a remote, mountainous region of Indonesia with 54 people aboard.
Officials said the wreckage was spotted about seven miles from its destination. Henry Bambang Soelistyo, chief of the National Search and Rescue Agency, said search and rescue teams were preparing to try to reach the crash site by air and foot.
"Smoke was still billowing from the wreckage when it was spotted by a plane search," said Soelistyo who is leading the rescue operation from Sentani Airport in Jayapura, adding that bad weather and rugged terrain were hampering efforts to reach the wreckage located in a mountainous area at an altitude of about 8,500 feet.
He said elite forces from the Air Force and Army will build a helipad for evacuation purposes near the crash site.
Indonesian Air Transportation Director General Suprasetyo said the plane was found Sunday by villagers who said it crashed into a mountain in Papua, the nation's largest and most eastern province. The fate of the 49 passengers — including five children — and crew of five was not immediately known, he said.
"Residents provided information that the aircraft crashed into Tangok mountain," Suprasetyo said.
The crash was the third catastrophe for the Southeast Asian nation's beleaguered air transportation system in less than a year.
The Transportation Ministry said the Trigana Air Service flight lost contact 33 minutes into a 42-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura bound for the city of Oksibil. There was no indication of a distress call from the French-built ATR 42-300 twin turboprop plane, the ministry said.
Heavy rain, high winds and some fog were reported in the area around the time the plane disappeared. Papua is home to miles-high mountains, sheer cliffs and dense rain forests.
The National Search and Rescue Agency tweeted at about 7 a.m. ET Sunday — 8 p.m. local time — that the search had been suspended because of limited visibility and will resume early Monday. A short time later Suprasetyo confirmed that villagers had found the crash site.
Because it was night & visibility is limited we suspend search Trigana Air and we continue the search tomorrow morning at 06.00 LT — BASARNAS (@SAR_NASIONAL) August 16, 2015
"We are now working closely with the National Search and Rescue Agency to find the plane," Transport Minister Ignasius Jonan told the Associated Press.
The agency tweeted that it had not arrived at the site and could confirm no details. "We pray for the best for the passengers and crew," the agency tweeted.
Trigana, one of many Indonesian airlines banned from flying to Europe because of safety concerns, is a local airline founded in 1991. It has had 14 "accidents and incidents" since 1992, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.
"It's mountainous, very remote and the airfield runways are sometimes on the side of a hill, so it is not really an area for the faint-hearted to fly," aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman told The Guardian. "There are bound to be accidents."
Aviation analyst Dudi Sudibyo told the AP that the rapidly changing weather patterns add to the difficulty pilots face.
"I can say that a pilot who is capable of flying there will be able to fly an aircraft in any part of the world," he said.
Indonesia has made international headlines for two other deadly crashes. In June, more than 100 people died when a military plane crashed into a residential neighborhood in Medan, Indonesia's third-largest city. In December, an AirAsia plane crashed in the Java Sea en route from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, killing all 162 people aboard.
That tragedy spurred Indonesia to impose new regulations aimed at improving safety. The 17,000-island nation of 250 million people, the world's fourth-largest country by population, has seen rapid growth in the aviation industry. But the industry has struggled to provide enough pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety.

IN 1924, speaking on St George's Day, the then prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, gave thanks that for once he could refer to England “without some fellow at the back of the room shouting out: ‘Britain!'” Even then, the tendency of the English to forget the other nations of the United Kingdom irritated the politically correct.
The distinction between Britain and England continues to confuse tourists; the natives furrow their brows, too. Filling in their census forms in 2011, some 60% of people in England gave their national identity as “English” only, whereas 19% gave it as “British” only. (The remainder were from another part of Britain, foreign nationals or claimed multiple national identities.) But, as data released on May 16th showed, there is great variation. Whether a person considers himself English first or British first is a powerful predictor of class, race and political persuasion.

Blacks and Asians are far more likely to consider themselves British: just 8% of ethnic Bangladeshis in England identify straightforwardly as English, for example. The old are more likely to describe themselves as English as the young. And among white Britons there is a geographical divide. In central London and other wealthy places, Britishness is popular: just 57.5% of white Britons in Cambridge call themselves English. In poorer spots along the Thames Estuary, in the West Midlands and in many northern cities, Englishness is the default identity (see map).
As Britain and Britishness have become more ethnically diverse, and as Scottish and Welsh nationalists have asserted themselves, many white Britons have turned to Englishness as an alternative identity. A poll by IPPR, a think-tank, finds that people who consider themselves English rather than British tend to be more hostile to immigration and more likely to vote for right-wing parties such as the UK Independence Party. For some, the flag of St George is too closely associated with far-right groups such as the English Defence League.
That repels ethnic minorities and wealthy white liberals. Yet there are reasons for optimism. Mixed-race people are far more likely to claim an English identity: some 46% identified themselves that way in the census. People with mixed black Caribbean and white parentage identify as English almost as often as whites do. And in some places where Englishness in general is more common, such as the West Midlands, ethnic minorities as well as whites are embracing it. That suggests that Englishness is becoming less exclusive.
Some would like that process to speed up. Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, another think-tank, reckons that the government should do more to create a more civic English identity. Though white Britons are broadly tolerant of other races, a survey in 2008 found that over half would not consider a non-white person to be English even if he was born in England. Still, few questions the Englishness of the England football team—which contains several black players. If that bunch of serial losers can unite the nation, developing a few other sources of English pride ought not to be too difficult.
The Tories have more than doubled their lead over Labour to 19 points since Theresa May called a snap general election last Tuesday, according to a new poll that suggests the Conservatives are heading for a landslide victory on 8 June.
The survey by Opinium for the Observer, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, puts the Tories on 45% (up seven points compared with the previous week), while Labour is down three points on 26%.
The leap in backing for the Tories, and Labour's fall, mean the gap between the two main parties has widened from nine points to 19 points in a matter of days – levels of support which, if replicated on polling day, could secure a Commons majority for May of around 100 seats.
The poll also shows support growing for the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats, who are up four points on 11%, and a dramatic fall in backing for Ukip, which is down five points to 9%, from 14% the week before. Backing for the Lib Dems suggests that the party's clear anti-Brexit strategy is appealing to hardcore Remain voters.
Separate analysis by Opinium, which has been tracking the same 2,000 voters throughout this parliament, found that only 53% of those who had said they intended to vote Ukip in February are still planning to do so in the 8 June election, with 30% of them saying they will transfer allegiance to the Tories.
The crumbling of backing for Ukip appears to be the main reason for the dramatic surge in enthusiasm for May's party. Labour's fall may be the result of voters who were strongly in favour of Remain in the Brexit referendum last June deserting the party for the anti-Brexit Lib Dems.
When those who now choose the Lib Dems were asked to give the main reason they are deciding to back Tim Farron's party, 50% said that it was because of its stance on Brexit. Just 6% of Labour voters said Jeremy Corbyn's stance on Brexit was their main reason for backing Labour.
The poll suggests opinions are hardening in favour of May and the Tories, and against Corbyn, across a range of indicators. More than two-thirds of UK voters (66%) now expect May to remain as prime minister after the election, while 7% think Corbyn will replace her in Downing Street. On the issue normally regarded as most important in determining voter behaviour – management of the economy – May and chancellor Philip Hammond are now trusted by more voters (49%) to run the nation's finances well than those who trusted David Cameron and George Osborne to do so ahead of the 2015 election (42%). Trust in Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell to run the economy well is at 15% lower than it was for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls ahead of the 2015 election (21%).
On almost every count, May wins. Some 49% of all voters now approve of the way she is running the country, against just 18% who express approval for Corbyn's leadership.
The only cause for concern in Tory circles is the growing sense that the Conservatives are heading for a comfortable victory at Labour's expense. Tory strategists fear this might tempt some floating voters to lose their “fear of Corbyn” and to choose other parties to ensure a more equal distribution of MPs in the Commons.
The Tories are trusted by almost three times as many voters (38%) to handle Brexit negotiations most effectively, compared with 13% for Labour. Even among Remain voters, there is support from many for the way May is handling Brexit. Among Remainers, 36% think she is handling Brexit well, while 66% of Leave voters say she is doing a good job. Corbyn beats May when voters are asked who sticks to their principles most: 47% say Corbyn and 46% May. But 55% say May is a strong leader, against 17% for Corbyn.
James Crouch of Opinium said: “The inevitable focus on Brexit in the coming months seems likely to scupper Labour's chances of making any significant headway, with the election being fought on the topics that the Conservatives have strong leads on.”
Opinium Research carried out an online survey of 2,003 UK adults aged 18+ from 19 to 20 April 2017. Results have been weighted to representative criteria.

A family in Noble is now wondering what they'll do if a tornado heads their way.Grace Bouziden says she installed her shelter in August of 2014. Last night, she looked out her window and thought the ground was sinking... but in fact, it was the ground above the shelter rising... and rising... and well... rising."The water from all the rain has caused it to basically float as if it were a balloon," Bouziden said. "It's water tight. The air inside caused it to become buoyant.""Not good at all. I have no where to go if a storm comes, and I have a hazard in my yard."The company that installed it was supposed to anchor it into the ground, but apparently didn't. "I couldn't believe it. I said that's not real," she said.They're now out of business, leaving Grace, and her shelter belly up.Andrew Zagorski of Oz Shelters sells above ground safe rooms. He says this is just one problem with underground shelters. He says installers sometimes ignore warnings from FEMA."Don't put an underground shelter in clay expansive soil or in a flood zone because they know what happens when it starts flooding," Zagorski said.Back in Noble, it's a scary prospect to be with an unusable shelter with severe weather looming."The wind could fling that out and it could be worse the way it is now than before," Bouziden said.
Sunday brought the latest terrorist attack in America, the largest mass shooting in U.S. history, with all its attendant tragedy. Words cannot adequately describe the horror that engulfed the scene of this massacre, caused by one Omar Mir Seddique Mateen.
Beyond the human cost, however, also lies the tragedy that Barack Obama, speaking even as it became clear that the murderer was a radical Islamic terrorist, is still unable or unwilling to draw the appropriate conclusions. The president's remarks omitted any linkages between the cold-blooded murders, the terrorist's ideology, and the broader international threat that motivated the Orlando killer and perhaps others yet unknown.
We will, in the coming days, doubtless hear that the terrorist was a lone wolf, that he did not belong to any known terrorist organization, that there are no wider threats. In particular, those who are blind to the terrorist threat will downplay even the incontrovertible fact that Mateen pledged loyalty to ISIS as he committed his murders.
Two critical conclusions follow immediately from Sunday's tragic reality, one with immediate implications for our domestic safety, and one for conducting the broader international war against terrorism.
The United States must urgently discard the fiction that we pay no price for not pursuing international terrorists vigorously and relentlessly.
First, the number of true “lone wolf” terrorists is infinitesimal. The implications of that phrase, namely that terrorism is not a widespread and still-growing phenomenon, are profoundly impairing our ability to protect innocent civilians. Terrorists like Mateen are not “one offs” who emerge randomly, unexpectedly and inexplicably, perhaps victims of mental disorders. The evidence is now indisputable that we are confronting a far larger threat, albeit not one organized conveniently for our understanding. This threat is unmistakably ideological, as Sunday's Orlando attack and the apparently thwarted attack in Santa Monica demonstrate.
We simply must start acknowledging that terrorists -- whether ISIS, Al Qaeda, or others -- are not structured like governments or corporations. They are not staffed with desk-bound bureaucrats in grey suits, arranged pursuant to a complex, hierarchical organization chart. They do not send memoranda to each other through a complex clearance process, with copies distributed far and wide.
Nor do they function like spy networks and subversive political movements of days gone by. They do not carry party identification cards. They do not communicate through dead drops, brush passes, invisible ink and microdots. This is not an age where FBI agents have the capacity to infiltrate the “cells” that do not exist or shadow the agents who are running the actual terrorists.
Instead, it is not just the West that has mastered digital communications and Internet social networks. The terrorists are just as good at it, for their purposes better than we are at understanding their techniques and their success. Actors like Mateen are not rigorously following a critical path chart in ISIS headquarters. Instead, it is precisely the disconnected, unpredictable timing of the terrorist attacks, not necessarily staged in advance, that adds to their devastating effect.
Second, the United States must urgently discard the fiction that we pay no price for not pursuing international terrorists vigorously and relentlessly. President Obama's strategy against terrorist bases of operation, when it is evident at all, has been lackadaisical and offhanded. There is a clear rationale to this casualness. Obama manifestly believes that, as bad as terrorist attacks are, American “overreaction” is worse. In his view, the use of U.S. forces risks increasing the problem rather than reducing it, making us much a part of the problem as the terrorist threat itself.
This is, of course, utter nonsense. We are obviously defending ourselves from attack, not initiating it. And it is palpably our failure to defend ourselves that provides incentives for the terrorist to strike even harder. Here is where Obama's failure to pursue the campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq is so damaging. A slow, casual offensive against ISIS gives the terrorists time and opportunity to encourage strikes like the one we have just seen.
There is a cost -- and a very human cost -- to allowing ISIS any respite from the full force of U.S. and allied military power. It is not cost-free to slow roll the anti-ISIS campaign, not in the Middle East, not in North Africa, and most certainly not in the United States.
While the foreign political and military complexities of obliterating ISIS are real enough, presidential resolve and determination can overcome much. Obama's resolve and determination are AWOL.
I have long argued that the central issue of the 2016 elections should be national security. The Orlando massacre has tragically underlined that point. President Obama may not be able to acknowledge the grim reality endangering us, but the rest of us must do so. Fortunately, we will pick a new president this November, and that choice must, at all costs, be someone who does not share Obama's failings. The winning presidential candidate will be the one whose anti-terrorism policies are the most distinguishable from Obama's.
After days of insisting that he never committed sexual harassment, Mr. Cain on Friday sought to move past the controversy. At a gathering of conservatives in Washington, he received thunderous applause for his forceful stump speech while his chief of staff declared on television that the campaign would no longer answer questions about the matter.
“We look forward to focusing our attention on the real issues impacting this country — like fixing this broken economy and putting Americans back to work through our ‘9-9-9' plan, as well as strengthening national security,” said J. D. Gordon, a spokesman for Mr. Cain.
The first scandal of the 2012 campaign has consumed the entire week and distracted the Republican Party from its ultimate goal of defeating President Obama. It has led to finger-pointing and fierce exchanges among the Republican rivals but could prove to be a clarifying moment in the still-unsettled race.
“If you're sharp enough to make it through this gantlet to the nomination, you're going to be competitive in November,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader. “I think we're going to have a really close, hard-fought campaign.”
One early snapshot of public opinion would suggest that Mr. Cain's candidacy has not been diminished in the eyes of voters. A Washington Post/ABC News poll on Friday found that 7 in 10 Republicans say the allegations do not matter when it comes to selecting a presidential candidate.

The controversy around Mr. Cain, which intensified as the week wore on, is not likely to subside as long as differing accounts keep emerging. In a radio interview Thursday, Mr. Cain said, “How many more ways can I say this stuff is totally fabricated?”
His response to the allegations, first reported on Sunday by Politico, has provided the biggest test yet for an unorthodox campaign and a candidate whose popularity has been rooted in his unconventional style and outsider appeal to voters.
But his denials — he said repeatedly that his only crime had been telling a woman that she was as tall as his wife — have also fueled a sense of outrage among his accusers and their friends that he was using his national platform as a presidential candidate to rewrite history and diminish the seriousness of his actions.

As the week ended, Mr. Cain faced a continued stream of allegations, including new details about a different accuser, who, according to people familiar with the events, has said that he persistently propositioned her during a work event, and that the environment at the restaurant association turned hostile after she complained about it. That woman received a negotiated severance of $35,000 that included a confidentiality clause, people familiar with the agreement said. But it remains an open question how long the spectacle will hang over the presidential race. The candidates gather Wednesday in Michigan for a debate on the economy.
In Washington, Mr. Cain was met with a standing ovation by the crowd at an event hosted by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group; some in the crowd even danced to his campaign theme song, “I Am America,” by Krista Branch. Mr. Cain once worked as a spokesman and promoter for the group, founded with support from the conservative billionaire industrialists Charles and David H. Koch.
Those ties were outlined in an article in The New York Times on Friday. Referring to that article, Mr. Cain declared: “I am the Koch brothers' brother from another mother. Yes, I'm their brother from another mother, and proud of it.” As he said so, David Koch, beaming, stood up and pumped his fists in the air.
Mr. Cain's network of supporters around the country appeared to remain largely behind their candidate.
Maurice Atkinson, a former Republican committeeman from Macon, Ga., who is backing Mr. Cain for the nomination said, “I'm sticking with Herman,” adding: “Herman is a decent guy, rock solid. What you're seeing is the gutter side of politics and life.”
A co-chairman of his campaign in Florida, State Representative Scott Plakon, said the criticism of how the campaign had handled the accusations was “fair enough.” But, he said, “given the choice of an inspiring candidate with an imperfect campaign apparatus and an uninspiring candidate with a perfect campaign apparatus, I'll take the first one every time.”
If you're not picky, it's a great time to look at century-old US Generic Gold coins
Oops! No results, try changing your search!
By Jeff Garrett for Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) ……
In recent months, the value of the United States generic gold coins has fallen to historic lows in relation to spot gold prices. Generic gold coins are defined as common-date United States gold coins that can be found in quantity. Most commonly seen are Double Eagles from the late 1870s to 1928.
The category also includes other denominations: Gold Dollars, Quarter Eagles, Half Eagles and Eagles. The lower denominations are more difficult to find in quantity, but common dates of the series trade as “generic” issues. The term “generic” generally refers to the most common dates of the type.
The reason these United States generic gold coins can be found in quantity has its foundation in the early monetary history of the country. Over a century ago, the United States began shipping large quantities of gold coins to Europe and other countries as part of international trade. One only needs to check the mintages of the United States gold coins from this era to understand the number of coins that circulated here and abroad. We are talking about millions of coins.
In 1933, the United States famously went off the gold standard and made ownership of gold illegal. This included all gold coins with the exception of collectible coins. Luckily, the Secretary of the Treasury, William Woodin, was a coin collector and understood the importance of this exemption. Regardless, vast quantities of the United States gold coins were surrendered and melted (including over 450,000 1933 Double Eagles).
It took several years to melt everything, and this is the gold that is now stored at Fort Knox. Many rare coins were turned in as well and were rescued at banks around the country. There is a fascinating article about this subject in the latest edition of The Numismatist.
Vast quantities of the United States generic gold coins that had been sent overseas did not meet the same fate. Banks and other institutions around the world kept these coins secured as a store of wealth. Keep in mind that citizens of many European countries view gold favorably for its hard asset appeal. Some have memories of sharply depreciating currencies or, worse, the overthrow or invasion of the country itself. Unlike in the United States, many banks in Europe sell vintage gold coins from around the world, including United States Double Eagles.
Starting in the 1950s, coin dealers from the United States started making trips to Europe to buy gold coins to sell back home. Many rare dates of Double Eagles were discovered over the years, and many issues were radically adjusted in terms of rarity. The 1926-S is a classic example. At one time, it was considered a major rarity, and the 1948 issue of the Red Book lists these coins for $900 (the 1927-D was listed at $550). By 1966, the coin had fallen to $375.
Over the next several decades, United States gold coins were repatriated back home at a regular pace. The pace was steady, but not overwhelming enough to disrupt prices radically. The premium for common-date Double Eagles has fluctuated over the years, with the occasional spike for one reason or another. The Y2K scare of 1999 created a rush to hard assets, and Double Eagle prices soared. Similar scenarios have played out over the years, but in general price premiums have remained steady.
For decades, Double Eagles have been the leading denomination investors and collectors have purchased as an alternative to modern bullion coins. Other than in the case of extraordinary increases, the premiums have fluctuated over the years based on supply and demand. Below are some recent historical wholesale prices for some of the most commonly seen NGC-graded United States gold coins:
September 2009 (Spot gold $1,000)
June 2013 (Spot gold $1,500)
June 2017 (Spot gold $1,250)
As can be seen from the above, the most recent premium for the United States gold coins are at historic lows. For the last couple of years, the supply of United States gold coins coming from Europe has far exceeded the demand. Many have speculated on the reason for this occurring. Perhaps the European banks need the capital, or they no longer view gold as the safety net of generations past. Regardless of the reason, current prices represent an important opportunity for anyone who loves vintage United States gold coins.
Double Eagles represent the large majority of gold coins that have flowed back to the United States in recent years. The price drops for these have put enormous downward pressure on the price of other common date United States gold coins. I can assure you that very few Gold Dollars and Quarter Eagles are in European gold shipments.
Unfortunately, these have seen their prices slashed in recent years as well. It's sort of like “throwing out the baby with the bath water.”
In my opinion, these coins are raging bargains at these prices. There has never been a better time to find some attractive examples for your collection or as an investment. One idea that I would suggest: Buy as many different dates of these issues at or near the current generic prices. This would be a great start for a serious collection of any of these issues.
Remember, the prices listed above are wholesale indications, and your cost will vary depending on source and quality. As usual, my advice is to buy the best you can afford.

A bill that would divest Pennsylvania of its state-run liquor stores passed the House on its way to the Senate.
House Bill 1690 would give beer distributors the first opportunity to obtain permits to sell wine and liquor following the closing of the state stores before opening them up to public bid. It would also allow grocery stores to sell wine and provide a wine and liquor-to-go license for restaurants and hotels.
Many officials have said the bill, which passed the house in a largely party-line 110-86 vote, serves as a placeholder for an eventual compromise struck as part of budget negotiations between Gov. Tom Wolf and Republican leadership in the House and Senate. It will next go to the Senate.
Wolf vetoed a similar bill, also sponsored by House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, earlier this year
http://www.pennlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/02/liquor_privatization_vs_modern.html
Wolf has backed a plan to seek a third-party manager for the state system. Another compromise plan by Rep. Paul Costa, D-Allegheny, would expand state store hours and expand the quantities and types of alcohol sold at private businesses.
"The governor has made clear that his proposal is already a significant compromise, but the administration will continue working with the legislature to iron out details," said Wolf spokesman Jeff Sheridan, in a written statement.
Turzai, in a written statement, said the bill would lead the state into the 21st century.
"This bill would responsibly and completely divest the state from both the wholesale and retail sale of wine and spirits and remove government from an archaic system that burdens taxpayers," he said.
This article has been updated to include statements by Wolf spokesman Jeff Sheridan and Rep. Mike Turzai.

Without a fully authorized budget in Illinois the economic ripple effect is hitting hard at Western Illinois University.
The cuts they feared are now coming to Western Illinois University.
WIU's budget director Matt Bierman says significant cuts will be made, "We`re put in this situation because of the state and because of enrollment. So the state's involvement in this process right now has to do with no budget and the uncertainty of that and trying to figure that out. The enrollment piece has been happening for us over several years."
Starting with a reduction in staff, Western has offered a retirement incentive to get senior staff to retire sooner. So far more than 50 employees have taken advantage of it and at least 50 more will be laid off.
"We`ve taken a look at it and said there are some areas where we have more staff than we need based upon enrollment and so we`re pulling back on that," said Bierman.
In the last nine years, WIU has lost more than 1,800 students, now the university plans to lower the tuition rate to reverse that trend.
"We will hopefully argue that we are the choice for the middle class we still are affordable. We hear that college is too expensive," said Bierman.
Administrators say they hope more than $7 million in cuts will be good enough for now.
"How do we deliver education? What are we going to look like in the future and that's the question I think we have to go to next," said Bierman.
For the staff retiring some of the positions will have to be replaced but will be offered at a lower salary. WIU is also looking at possibly cutting programs with low enrollment. The cuts will take effect next fiscal year starting on July 1st.
I've been reading through the feminist 101 posts and, while I agree with the majority of points made in them, found issue with the subject of misogynistic language.
I love words and I love using them. I've never had a problem with swearing because I've always believed that context is what matters; not the words themselves.
If the argument against using these words is that, even if the context is harmless, it slowly but surely reinforces a negative mentality about women … then I would agree.
…Cunt began as a misogynist term; popular usage evolved it into an ordinary insult.
I'll be the first to say that popular usage doesn't erase the original meaning of a word, but popular usage does change the majority of peoples' own meaning of a word; this means that using the word cunt and bitch nowadays doesn't actually reinforce a negative mentality about women at all.
…I'd like to know what you think. If I've missed something or haven't made my point clear, please let me know.
[Content Note: Misogynist slurs; reference to racist slur; Oppression Olympics.]From an email that arrived in my inbox last night, authored by a self-described "young guy who has only just started researching all of this stuff about discrimination and equality":What has been edited out and replaced with ellipses is a bunch of Oppression Olympics about how the n-word is still real bad and stuff. Unlike misogynist slurs. Which are just "ordinary insults," allegedly.What I find most remarkable about this email, like all the others from men (always men) who feel entitled to email me and demand personal private education, is that its author fails utterly to make even the most cursory attempt to empathize with women who are the targets of misogynist slurs, deployed specifically to remind us that we areHe speaks about context as if "cunt" and "bitch" exist in a void. There is no context in which a word that is predicated on devaluing the feminine is "harmless." Not for women.(And not for men from marginalized populations defined by gender and sexuality who are demeaned with misogynist slurs.)"Nowadays," he says, misogynist slurs don't "actually reinforce a negative mentality about women at all." Even were it true (it is not) that men (and other women) who call women cunts and bitches are using the words in some sort of magical history-free context that isn't explicitly designed to demean women, and explicitly designed to demean men by comparing them to women,matters.Even if it were true (it is not) that misogynist slurs do not maintain institutional sexism that marginalizes women, that such slurs don't "reinforce a negative mentality about women" among the people who use them, we know—because multiple studies and millions of public statements by women about their lived experiences confirm this fact—that being repeatedly exposed to oppressive slurs negatively affects the people targeted by them.Even if it were true (it is not) that misogynist slurs don't negatively affect the slur-users' opinions about women,There are certainly women who don't even bat an eye at being called a cunt or a bitch, myself among them. But it's not because the words don't have the capacity to harm—it's because I'm inured to them after a lifetime of pervasive exposure.That misogynist slurs have lost their capacity to harm (some women) because of their ubiquity isn't evidence of their neutrality. It's evidence of humans' capacity to normalize abuse in order to survive.What a luxury, what privilege, that's something my correspondent has never had to consider.
Vietnam on Monday punished two editors of a major newspaper which had earlier been fined for publishing what authorities said were false reports on toxic fish sauce. Vietnam is no stranger to toxic food.
Deputy chief editor of Thanh Nien newspaper Dang Ngoc Hoa, and senior executive Vo Van Khoi had their press cards revoked, Vietnam's information and communication ministry said.
Communist Vietnam heavily restricts the media, which is all state-owned, meaning authorities rarely have to sanction an industry already under its thumb.
No reason was given for the order. But it comes after Thanh Nien was fined for reporting on a food scare that received widespread coverage mid-October.
In Vietnam, fish sauce or nuoc mam (nam pla in Thai) is consumed daily by most of the country's population of 93 million — as a dipping sauce, marinade or in soups.
A total of 50 news organisations were fined in November for running reports about high arsenic levels found in fish sauce, causing widespread panic.
Thanh Nien newspaper received the highest fine.
Authorities said the reports were misleading or incorrect because they failed to differentiate between highly toxic inorganic arsenic, and the less dangerous organic variety found commonly in seafood.
Food scares have been a regular source of anxiety in Vietnam, often leading to public anger.
The country's communist leadership tends to crack down on any expression of dissatisfaction or criticism of their handling of crises.

White supremacist William Scott Planer (Photo: Facebook)
William Scott Planer is the latest in the growing list of white supremacists who are vandalizing and attacking Jewish places of worship, cemeteries or schools across the United States.
The Anti-Defamation League revealed that Planer was arrested July 14, 2017, after posting a sticker reading “Fight Terror, Nuke Israel” on the door of the Chabad Lubavitch Jewish Center in Colorado Springs.
The Denver man is being held in the El Paso County Sheriff's Department on a $500,000 bond for felony charges he faces in California. There, he's accused of assault with a deadly weapon and participation in a riot. The alleged attacks were on a protester during a white supremacist march in June 2016 in Sacramento.
Activists claimed that he is the man seen in a recording of the protest violence who clubs a woman over the head with a pole.
The ADL notes that Planer has been on their radar for years for his known association with white supremacist groups such as the Golden State Skinheads and the Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP).
Prior to the march in Sacramento in 2016, TWP leader Matthew Heimbach posted an image on Twitter, saying, “Just some of our brave comrades preparing to march today in California. Hail the TWP and GSS. United, we will win!”
The event ended with a bloody fight between racists and a counter-demonstration of approximately 10 left-wing activists.
Planer was also involved in an April 29, 2017, white supremacist rally in Pikeville, Kentucky that was also organized by the TWP as well as the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. There, Planer wore a shirt with the TWP icon and was seen frequently giving the Nazi salute.
This year he's been in Boulder, Colorado with the Proud Boys, an alt-lite group that espouses racism, xenophobia and misogyny while preaching against “political correctness” and liberals. At that rally, he wore a T-shirt with a neo-Nazi symbol and the words “Proud to be fascist, anti-Antifa.” A week later he was seen wearing the TWP T-shirt at an anti-Muslim “March Against Sharia” rally in Denver.
He is one of many white supremacists who have been linked to threats and attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions.

The weekend after Memorial Day, Rep. Joaquín Castro is leading a delegation of Democrats across the border into Mexico to meet with deported U.S. veterans.
The visit is intended to focus attention on the estimated more than 230 military veterans deported from the U.S. and on the need for a more rigorous process to ensure legal residents recruited with promises of citizenship are naturalized.
The lawmakers, all members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, plan to meet the veterans at Deported Veterans Support House, the “Bunker,” in Tijuana, Mexico.
The shelter was started by Hector Barajas, a U.S. Army veteran who served three years in prison, a punishment granted in a plea deal for shooting at a car, and was deported. California Gov. Jerry Brown has since pardoned him for the crime and Barajas now has hopes of returning to the U.S.
RELATED: Having Served in U.S. Military, Immigrants Fight Deportation Orders
“Many of us believe that they should be allowed to become citizens,” Castro told NBC Latino in a telephone interview Friday.
“Many, if not most, were legal permanent residents, who were eligible to become citizens and perhaps never applied - they stood up for their country and put their lives on the line,” he said.

Castro acknowledged that getting laws changed to stop the deportation of veterans who are legal residents would be tougher under a Trump administration. But Castro said he thinks “there is strong bipartisan support among Americans to do right by these veterans.”
“We would ask the administration to consider the service these veterans have rendered for the country and the fact they did put their lives on the line,” he said.
Legal permanent residents can be deported if they commit certain crimes, including ones that occurred many years in their past.
Castro said the trip came about in part from discussions with members of the Edgewood District Veterans Inc., a group of Vietnam Veterans. The San Antonio group each Memorial Day honors alumni of Edgewood High School who served in Vietnam and alumni who died in the war.
Mario Longoria, president of the Edgewood veterans group, said the group has a member facing deportation, but also had been contacted by another veterans' group about the issue. The group raised it with Castro while meeting with him on another issue.
RELATED: Group Wants Veterans' Deportations Addressed in Presidential Debate
Longoria acknowledged some of the veterans knew they had to get their naturalization process done to become citizens. But he said some mistakenly believed, or were told, that their service automatically makes them citizens.
Noncitizen veterans have to initiate and go through the usual citizenship process, but their path to citizenship is expedited.
According to Castro's office, 10,644 non-citizens were serving in the U.S. military as of last January and another 11,524 non-citizens were in the Reserves.
Most legal permanent residents in the military are from the Philippines, Mexico, Jamaica, South Korea and the Dominican Republic, Castro's office said.
Whatever the reason for failing to become citizens, Longoria said he opposes deportation of any veterans, although he supports any who have committed crimes serving their sentences.
“They should not ever deport veterans,” he said.

Conditioning, or “engine” is a fundamental aspect of fitness, for both the serious competitor and the person competing only against themselves. The MetCons or WODs encountered in most CrossFit boxes provide considerable conditioning benefit for the untrained person, but an avid participant will quickly approach a point of diminishing returns to their conditioning from this style of training alone. Improving beyond this point requires a dedicated effort outside the constraints of class.
A well designed conditioning program should target both anaerobic and aerobic energy systems. Measurement of power output (watts, calories, distance) is imperative for comparison across training sessions. Because our training is intended to develop broad, general fitness, multiple modalities should be included if possible. Common conditioning modalities include running, rowing, bike and swimming. If you incorporate swimming, you should be comfortable with the idea of being utterly exhausted in the water.
Anaerobic conditioning
Training anaerobic power is actually rather simple, though not easy. Anaerobic training should feature short, high intensity intervals. Rest between work intervals should be about 4-5 times the length of the work-interval. Any of the modalities (bike, run, swim, row) noted above are useful for anaerobic conditioning. One may perform different modalities within the same training session, but this can complicate performance measurement. Due to the high intensity of the intervals, athletes should also warm up thoroughly for any modality used in a training session. A sample anaerobic conditioning workout would be something like
5 rounds
Row 400m at 90-95% intensity
Rest 5 minutes
For most athletes, we suggest limiting anaerobic training to once per week. Despite the short work-duration, anaerobic conditioning is very taxing. The data points we rely on for anaerobic conditioning are (a) average work rate per interval and (b) difference between highest and lowest work rate in an interval. Effective anaerobic training increases the work rate while minimizing the difference between the work rate in each interval.
Aerobic conditioning
It is desirable for fitness athletes to devote the majority of conditioning time to aerobic power. Reasons for this include: (1) Most MetCons are fueled principally by aerobic power (2) Endurance is a key training parameter for aerobic capacity development, and developing endurance demands longer sessions and (3) Increasing aerobic power will decrease reliance on anaerobic power in most metcons; the reverse is not true
Aerobic conditioning is a little more complicated than anaerobic. A comprehensive aerobic program develops aerobic endurance (ability to sustain power for time) and aerobic power (the actual power produced, regardless of time). Collectively, we refer to these as aerobic capacity. At a minimum, an aerobic conditioning program should include, every week:
One endurance session. Novice athletes should start at modest durations (15-20 minutes) and build from there. More experienced athletes can go longer. For the novice, duration is paramount. Less experienced athletes must train their bodies to “go long”. We define the upper limit of duration training as 60 minutes. This is defined by the realities of the sport of fitness rather than any physiological limitation.
One speed / threshold session. This refers to a short duration aerobic-dominant workout at high intensity, sometimes called a "time trial". We prefer to start with at least 10 minutes, to minimize the relative contribution of the anaerobic system. Again, more experienced athletes will require longer sessions. Although the longer-term goal is to increase the duration of speed sessions, power output in speed sessions must remain consistent before duration increases.
One max-aerobic-power session. These sessions usually consist of short intervals with a 1:1 work to rest ratio. For example, in a 10-minute period, complete 10 intervals of work 30 seconds at high intensity and then rest 30 seconds. As conditioning levels increase, the number of intervals should increase, topping out at about 20-25 working intervals. To increase the stress of the max-aerobic power session, reduce the rest and lengthen the work period. However, refrain from this adjustment until the athlete can complete 20-25 intervals with no substantial power loss.
These three sessions, once per week, are minimum requirements for a good aerobic conditioning program. An aerobic program can incorporate more volume, based on athlete experience and fitness levels. An intermediate athlete can handle 4 training sessions per week, and work up to 5. Additional sessions beyond the three noted can be speed, interval or duration, depending on athlete tolerance. In general, we prefer not to add a second max-aerobic-power session, especially if the athlete is also including anaerobic conditioning as part of their training regime. Furthermore, each session should increase in duration and intensity as conditioning improves. As with anaerobic training, multiple modalities should be used if possible.
Implementation and management
As a general rule, there is no easily reached upper limit for aerobic endurance. Ironman, anyone? The one-hour limit is practical, not physiological. Over the very long term, the work rate of the speed sessions and duration sessions will converge at this one-hour upper limit. This means that the athlete will be able to sustain high power output (say, their rate of power output in a 10 or 15-minute session) for the entire hour. This idea of convergence introduces the The Gains Lab's conditioning framework and the data points we use to implement it.
The three data points we use to measure aerobic capacity are endurance work rate, the speed work rate, and most importantly, the difference between them. For example, we recently tested an athlete's endurance work rate (432 rowing cals in 30 mins, 14.4 cals/min), their speed work rate (171 rowing cals in 10 minutes; 17.1 cals/min). The difference between the two is 2.7 cals/min. Using only these data points, we can then gradually increase the duration of the speed training and endurance training, while monitoring the difference between them. The relationship among the data points allows us to easily adjust training and maximize gains with minimal guesswork.
Integration, testing and conclusions
By using the guidelines of (a) one anaerobic session per week and (b) one session each of duration work, speed work and max-aerobic power work, athletes at all levels should be able to manage a conditioning program (outside their traditional CrossFit program) suitable to their fitness level. Effective use of the three aerobic parameters simplifies performance management guides athletes and coaches toward their goals.
The most common mistake is doing too much too soon, especially regarding anaerobic conditioning. The idea that "strength training takes years but conditioning takes months" is absurd. In either discipline, it will require substantial time to achieve excellence. Be patient. The plan works if you do.
The efficacy of conditioning can and should be tested by not only session-to-session comparisons, but in benchmark MetCons and competitions to ensure carryover. Good luck and happy training.

On a press conference held on the second rest day of the Tour de France, Omega Pharma-Quick Step have announced that the team will continue with ist current structure and under the Etixx-Quick Step name until the end of the 2017 season. Tony Martin has extended his contract for two years and will continue to be a key part of the roster.
At a time when several teams have a hard time finding new sponsors, Omega Pharma-Quick Step have broken the trend. Today the team have confirmed that they will continue with its current structure at least until the end of the 2017 season.
Main sponsor Omega Pharma will stay committed to the team for the next three seasons but will use the cycling sponsorship to promote the Etixx brand. Hence, the team will be known as Etixx-Quick Step from 2015 onwards.
This is not an unprecented strategy for Omega Pharma who once shared sponsorship duties with Lotto of the current Lotto Belisol team. Back then, they used the cycling sponsorship to promote brands like Silence and Predictor and so the team's name underwent changes several times.
At the same press conference, the team announced that Tony Martin has extended his contract for two years. The German was rumoured to be in negotiations with Garmin-Sharp and Sky and was looking for a team that would fully support him in his quest to win the time trial at the 2016 Olympics. Furthermore, he was looking for more support in weeklong stage races after he lost this year's Tour de Suisse due to being isolated in the mountain stages.
Apparently, team manager Patrick Lefevere has provided him with the required guarantees and so Martin will stay with the Belgian team. Mark Cavendish, Tom Boonen, Niki Terpstra, Michal Kwiatkowski and Rigoberto Uran all have contract for the 2015 season as well.
Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats have been on a roll as of late. Their recently released fourth album is an excellent addition to their discography, with plenty of stand-out songs. The band just started a lengthy U.S. tour along with Philadelphia-local bands Ruby the Hatchet and Ecstatic Vision. I couldn't be more excited when I heard this line-up announced at Philly's own Union Transfer (hometown show!). The crowd slowly came in when the doors opened, but plenty were there when the first opener, Ecstatic Vision, took the stage.
I saw Ecstatic Vision in the Summer of 2014 along with Mount Salem. The band had only recently started at the time, but left quite an impression on me. Their fast-paced Hawkwind-esque psychedelia was entrancing. Since then, they have unleashed their debut record, Sonic Praise, and have gained quite a following.
They started the show with a bang, playing the first track off their record, “Journey”. The band had some serious energy, playing rapid, hallucinating acid rock. The frontman looks like Lemmy, sounds like Rob Zombie and was relentless with his shredding. The drummer had a workout, banging out those tribal-like beats for “Astral Plane”. The bassist kept it simple and they had a fourth member playing all kinds of instruments: the sax, keys, flute, and… cowbell? All of the members worked in sync with each other to deliver some intense trippiness. Good psych rock makes you feel like you're high even if you haven't had a toke of weed. And that's what Ecstatic Vision did. With the addition of crazy lights from above and below, it was a visual and auditory onslaught. Nothing short of great.
Ecstatic Vision Setlist:
1. Journey
2. Astral Plane
3. Don't Kill the Vibe
This is the third time I've seen Ruby the Hatchet this year, and they only keep getting better. Their sophomore album, Valley of the Snake, is my favorite album of the year. The group gave an electrifying performance, playing most of their latest album as well as new song, “The Fool”. I can't get enough of the band's heavy psych, which evokes a bit of Sabbath and Uncle Acid, though they are very distinct in their own way. Their riffs and melodies are all killer. Singer Jillian Taylor has some excellent pipes, and drummer Owen Stewart adds some vocal harmonies to the mix. They ended their set perfectly with “Tomorrow Never Comes”, a stand out doom track. It sounds so malevolent and apocalyptic, I can't help but instinctively bang my head in a mantra-like way to it.
Ruby the Hatchet Setlist:
1. Intro
2. Heavy Blanket
3. Demons
4. The Fool
5. Vast Acid
6. The Unholy Behemoth
7. Tomorrow Never Comes
I've been writing too much about Uncle Acid recently. If you haven't heard them, change that. The stage was set up with street lights and a brick wall background to add to the mood. The elusive Uncle Acid and his deadbeats strolled onto the stage with only the street lamps illuminating them. They kicked off with the opener of the new record, “Waiting for Blood”. The crowd was going nuts, and for good reason. The band kicked so much ass, with killer riff after killer riff. They have quickly become one of my favorite bands with their brand of creepy, occult doom metal. Their setlist included material from all four of their albums, with five tracks from The Night Creeper and the best of Blood Lust. A mosh pit started with the song “Pusher Man”, fittingly enough. frontman Kevin Starrs‘ long hair kept obscuring his face, adding to his magnetism.
They had an encore, though oddly the quality dropped. They started with “Melody Lane”, my favorite track from the new album. It was comparatively pretty weak to the studio version due to an underlying issue: the vocals were too quiet. This happens way too often at shows. I didn't mind it much until this track because the refrain is very vocal-based. “Ritual Knife” was next and is another of my favorites from the band, but it was also sub-par. It did not make me want to ritualistically sacrifice someone like the album version does. Luckily, they ended with “Withered Hand of Evil” which picked up the quality.
I really enjoyed this show. Every band brought their A-game. I came to really appreciate Ecstatic Vision, Ruby the Hatchet continued to shine and Uncle Acid performed an exemplary setlist with grit. It further proved to me that heavy metal concerts are the closest thing I feel to a religious experience. I can't wait to see all three of these bands again in the future.
Uncle Acid Setlist:
1. Waiting for Blood
2. Murder Nights
3. Mind Crawler
4. Death's Door
5. Poison Apple
6. 13 Candles
7. Pusher Man
8. I'll Cut You Down

The new Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial… THE star of Baselworld 2014, a truly inspired watch with its superb vintage design, a great horological content, and the introduction of a fully anti-magnetic movement! We've covered it multiple times already on Monochrome (here and here). After all the noise created around this timepiece, it was clearly time for us to use it, to feel it, to show it. Well, we've been testing the Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial in titanium over the space of a whole summer.
Omega surprised us just before Baselworld 2014, with a teaser showing a new dive watch. You know us here at Monochrome-Watches, we can't resist opening our photo-editing software and to imagine the future novelties. So, we've predicted this new watch. The impatience was great before the annual watch fair, as we knew Omega was cooking something cool. The result was beyond our expectations, with a superbly designed watch which had been inspired by one of the brand's greatest diving tools and not only that, but a movement to match too. We played for a while with it during Baselworld, but it was not enough. The full review was necessary. We picked up the watch from Omega just before the summer-break and brought the Seamaster 300 right to the place it belongs to: seaside. Before giving you our impressions, we need to get back in the past and see the lineage of this timepiece.
The old Seamaster 300m CK2913 vs. the new Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial This image made by Omega is perfect to see how similar these two watches actually are, but it also helps to show the multiple differences between them. The original was introduced in 1957 (alongside 2 other watches, the Speedmaster CK2915 and the Railmaster CK2914, as part of a professionally-oriented collection). It was Omega's answer to Blancpain with its Fifty Fathoms and Rolex with its Submariner (both introduced in 1953). Omega however presented a watch able to resist to 300m, with a superb design and a reasonable size. When comparing the two editions, we can see all the similarities and how Omega wanted to re-edit this great watch: Same triangular indices and minutes markers
Same broad-arrow hands
Same black grained dial
(Almost) same rotating bezel, with a metallic inner-ring, a black outer-ring with 60-minute inscriptions
Same ‘straight-lugs' case
Same metallic bracelet with 3-link construction
Omega could have stopped here, by just reinterpreting the design and then cased a simple movement inside. They could have also used the same recipe as as they did with the Speedmaster Mark II, by modernizing an iconic design. Instead, Omega went one better: using the classical codes of the old Seamaster 300m, modernizing its appearance and cased inside a very innovative movement. The Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial is not just another re-issue; it is the modern icon.
This new edition of the Seamaster 300 is available in a large choice of metals and colours:
Stainless steel with a black dial
Titanium with a blue dial
Stainless steel and Sedna Gold (Omega's own alloy) with a black dial
Titanium and Sedna Gold with a blue dial
Full Sedna Gold with a black dial
Platinum with a blue dial (limited to 357 pieces)
Features
For this review, we chose to go for the Titanium edition, with its blue dial; a combination less usual than the classical steel/black version, but one that delivers quite some advantages: lighter case, great resistance to corrosion and scratches and added exclusivity with this cool dial (the blue dial is only available with titanium). All of this was truly welcome, as we've worn the watch throughout the summertime and used it as a diver watch should be used.
The overall partition is extremely simple: the Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial is a dive watch. No need of useless features here, just the required one: hours, minutes and seconds for the indications (no date window that pollutes the dial), 300m water-resistance, screw-down crown, unidirectional rotating bezel and bracelet with easy fine-adjustment. Putting aside the specifications of the movement, that's all you'll have. And clearly, that's more than enough. The Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial might have a vintage design; it remains a practical tool and a modern diving watch. It can be used unrestrainedly as a tool watch – and we can guarantee that to you, as the watch has been used to swim, to dive, to sail and to lie down on the beach. Of course, using the SM300 as a daily watch with your business suit won't be seen as an act of treason.
Case and bracelet
If the PR photos and a quick look at the case might give you the idea of a simple re-edition of the vintage watch, the reality is different. For sure, the design is similar, as well as the diameter, that remains reasonable at 41mm. But the quality (based on 2014 standards) and the proportions are slightly different though. First, we chose to go for titanium. Not only because of the blue dial but it also has several advantages compared to stainless steel. The first one is of course the weight, with a reduction, which is close to 30%. Whilst the watch may come on a bracelet it remains extremely light and so, comfortable too.
The use of grade 5 titanium allows the watch to have some mirror polished surfaces (something that is not possible with grade 2 titanium, always sandblasted or brushed) and a very bright colour (not so different from steel, just a little darker). Titanium is also extremely resistant: it scratches less easily than steel – which is appreciable with polished parts – and is extremely resistant to corrosion. Thus, the Seamaster 300 in titanium is stronger together with being more comfortable. A choice that we clearly appreciate here – the only issue is the price, as the titanium edition is 1,800 euros more expensive than the steel edition.
The case is thus reasonably sized in terms of diameter, as was the vintage edition. However, the main difference with the old Seamaster 300 is the thickness. The case itself is not thick. As you can see, the casebands are quite thin. However, the bezel is thicker. 2 consequences to this design choice: the practical aspect is improved, as the bezel will be easier to grab, even with diving gloves. However, the visual aspect does not benefit from this increased thickness – nothing alarming though, but a bit of thinness is always welcome, especially for vintage-inspired watches. Talking about the bezel, we have to recognize its quality. The clicks are strong but pleasant and the adjustments are precise. The blue part is made of (virtually) unalterable ceramic. The colour will remain strong forever and without scratches. The surface is smooth and flat. The numbers are made of liquidmetal, a unique alloy that bonds seamlessly with ceramics.
The rest of the case uses several techniques: the casebands are brushed, the edges of the lugs come with a shiny but beautiful bevelled angle and the horizontal parts are mirror polished. The execution is clean, precise and coherent with the price.
The bracelet, also made of titanium, presents the same specifications as the case: extremely well made, perfectly adjusted, comfortable and smooth. It even comes with a very intuitive and simple fine-adjustment mechanism (only press a pusher inside the clasp to adjust the length). But this qualitative feeling is linked to an issue, the same as the case: thickness. The bracelet and the clasp are quite massive and could afford to loose 1mm or 2mm. Once again, nothing dramatic but the elegance might have been greater.
The bracelet was also at the centre of a debate around this watch: in particular the mirror polished central link. To be very honest, we can see it from two angles. If we look at the Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial as a pure tool watch, a fully brushed finish would have been more appropriate. However, the vintage feeling and design-oriented intention of this piece justified this mirror-polished centre link. And titanium helps to keep it clean.
Dial and hands
The dial – in black or blue – is also quite a piece of attraction. It uses the design codes of the previous Seamaster 300m CK2913. The base plate is textured and matte, which helps to have a great legibility, especially in sunlight (the anti-reflective treatment of the domed crystal is also extremely efficient). The hands and indices are always easy to read due to the contrast of this matte finish. The hands are typically Omega, with the broad-arrow shape: a sword minute hand and an arrow hour hand. Both are made of polished steel, with luminous material. The second hand might seem out of place however, with its diamond shape and its colour. On an historical basis, this hand is not relevant, as the SM300 CK2913 originally came with a simple baton hand in steel, without luminous material. This type of hand came later, on the second generation of SM300. The white lacquer might also be intrusive in this context, but I get used to it and found it nice after a while. It gives echo to the numbers and logo on the dial.
The indices are quite particular. At first, we thought the dial had a sandwich-construction. However, the dial is cut by laser to remove some material and create some cavities, which are filled with luminous paste. This creates a nice depth effect and prevents the dial from being too flat. The luminous material has a faux-patina aspect, with a yellow / brown colour to recreate the effect of the age on tritium (the radioactive material used in vintage watches and that tends to turn brown when aging). The dial is lively, legible and clean – Omega had the good idea to limit the amount of inscriptions on the dial.
Movement
If the shape of the Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial is clearly influenced by a vintage edition, the movement is far from being stuck in the past. Inside the SM300 ticks Omega's finest and most innovative calibre, the 8400. We already covered it in March, just after Baselworld, but another piece of news came recently: the METAS Certification. We'll get back on this later.
First, we have to understand what the Calibre 8400 Master Co-Axial is. This in-house movement comes with all the innovations made by Omega during the last years. It has the Co-Axial escapement created during the 1970s by Georges Daniels. It is supposed to have reduced frictions, to have better chronometric performances and to require less service operations. Then, it comes with truly antimagnetic properties – it is not an external protection against these fields as the movement itself is resistant to magnetic fields up to 15,000 gauss. The escapement, balance wheel and spiral are made of silicon, the steel plates have been replaced with non-magnetic plates and the spring of the shock absorber has been crafted from an an-amorphous material. All the parts that should definitely stay clear of magnetism have been replaced by anti-magnetic materials. Impressive! Omega is so confident in its movements that it comes with a 4-year warranty.
The Calibre 8400, when presented during Baselworld, was said to be certified by COSC. Something has changed in the last few days, as Omega just introduced a brand-new certification, together with METAS, the Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology. METAS will test and certify the testing procedures and machineries, which will be used to perform the tests in-house by Omega. It means that the certification will be done on assembled watches and not just on the movements (thus also including water-resistance and antimagnetic properties tests into the process). Omega and METAS announced that movement will only receive the Chronometer Certificate, if they perform between 0 and +5 seconds deviation per day (vs. -4s / +6s for the COSC).
All together, these specifications create an impressive movement: reliable, precise, resistant and highly innovative. The finish is also pleasant with (machined) anglages on the bridges and Geneva Stripes in Arabesque. The power reserve is also comfortable, with 60 hours of energy.
On the Wrist
Putting aside the (minor) issue of the thickness (case and bracelet), the Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial is really pleasant on the wrist. As we told you, the choice of titanium is really something we would encourage here, as the comfort is really improved. This is not the same with a stainless steel edition, which is far from being unpleasant but still, heavier. (We are not even talking about the platinum edition that weights more than 400 grams).
The shape and size of the case are also great. It remains reasonable enough for small wrists (like mine) and the lack of crown protection is elegant and allows reducing the perceived size. We also tried the SM300 on a Nato strap (something that the future owners will certainly do as well) and it really changes the style of this watch. It really gives the watch a vintage look. The official Omega Nato straps will be right in place here (one minor issue however, as the bracelet measures 21mm and Nato straps usually measure 20mm).
Conclusion
Pros
The design, both vintage and sporty
The dial, the hands and the indices, all very pleasant
The overall quality
The movement, innovative, precise and resistant
The comfort of titanium
The price
Cons
The thickness of the case and bracelet
The central polished link on the bracelet that some don't like
The Omega Seamaster 300 Master Co-Axial was much anticipated by collectors. Omega was clearly not allowed to do a single mistake with this watch. Not only did they manage to do this, Omega pleased us with a superb and inspired design, with very cool details (hands and indices) and a high quality construction, but they pushed the concept still further with this truly amazing movement. Now, we have to compare the SM300 to its largest competitor, another icon of the dive watches, the Rolex Submariner. The latter is clearly not playing on the vintage trend and goes for rigor. Both are equally well finished, both have an in-house calibre, both can be used as proper diving tools. The Omega however clearly stands out with its antimagnetic movement (Rolex cannot compete here, even with the Milgauss). The specs are clearly on Omega's side. Design-wise, it is certainly more a matter of tastes than an objective choice.
The price however is another story. The Rolex Submariner no-date Ref. 114060 is priced at 6,000 euros. The SM300 in steel is priced at 4,950 euros (6,750 euros in titanium). And here, in all objectivity, we have to admit that Omega has a clear advantage considering the technical package.
Word seems to be getting out about Chaga as a natural remedy.
Chaga (pronounced ‘SHA-gah') is a wild mushroom that can be found anywhere there are birch trees, and it's gaining popularity in Hay River, N.W.T.
“What it looks like is kind of a large, black, wart-like growth, usually on the trunk of the tree and sometimes on the branches,” says Bruce Green, who collects Chaga near Hay River, then chops and grinds and strains it to make tea.
Green says a piece of Chaga about the size of a golf ball will make about a coffee pot full of tea, and you can re-use the grounds that settle at the bottom.
"A surprising number of people know about it and use it but I think only in recent years, it's become known,” Green says.
There are no scientific studies that prove whether or not Chaga can prevent disease, but advocates for the wild mushroom say it can be a "traditional remedy" for everything from cancer to the common cold.
Green recently gave a talk at the Hay River library about the mushroom's properties.
"If I'm exposed to anyone that's got a cold or if I feel a cold coming on, I'll make a batch of tea right away,” Green says.
Shannon Patterson, another Chaga enthusiast, works as a logger and drinks Chaga tea every day.

"I take vitamins and that so I figure I might as well try this," he says.
Patterson collects it when he's harvesting wood, and even sells a bit on the side, for about $25 a pound.
Patterson says many people seek out the mushroom.
"Some people looking to fight cancer, prevent cancer, some people looking for an elixir for their health."
In 2011, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York said Chaga has demonstrated some anti-cancer properties in mice. However, it warned against using the mushroom, especially in combination with other drugs, because “no clinical trials have been conducted to assess Chaga's safety and efficacy for disease prevention or for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes.”
Both Green and Patterson are quick to say they're not making a medical recommendation, but they're still hopeful Chaga is doing them some good.
Green says there's another side effect of Chaga tea: it's quite pleasant to drink.

Other variants of calculator spelling alphabets consider "0" to be a capital "D" instead of "O", "6" (not used in the standard beghilos) as a lowercase "g" (as opposed to uppercase represented by 9) and "9" as either a reversed lowercase "a" or an at sign (@), both of which represent the letter A. You can spell words and names with the numbers, such as : 0.1134 when read upside down, it reads hEllO.
Extending the available alphabet to hexadecimal notation (generally available on lower-end scientific calculators, though not on basic models), "b" and "d" correspond to "q" and "p" respectively. "F" transforms to a mixture between a "J" and a "t". A and C do not transform readily to recognizable letters. E transforms to 3. C transforms to an open O or right parenthesis. Upside-down A is the # sign.
Using leet, additional letters can be represented by combinations of letters (11/II or 2 ["Z" being very rare in English] representing "two" or "to", 111/III representing "three", 15/SI, 935/SEa or 335/SEE for "C", etc.). This is generally rare and, especially in the last case (using a spelling-out of a letter) severely limits readability.
Only certain calculators are capable of being used for beghilos calculator spelling. LCD, VFD, LED, and Panaplex displays are best for spelling words. The ability of dot-matrix displays, fourteen-segment and sixteen-segment displays to render most characters defeats the purpose of spelling with a limited alphabet.
If the calculator is instead rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from upright to create a vertical display, a different, but less useful, set of letters can be reproduced, including:
Digit 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F Letter O, 0 - N M, m J u b c, r 8, oo a a Q u 70 W, w u
If the calculator is instead rotated 90 degrees clockwise from upright to create a vertical display, still a different, but similarly less useful, set of letters can be reproduced, including:
Digit 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F Letter O, 0 - N W, w c u a, J 8, oo b D a n a M, m n
Placing a calculator in front of a mirror produces the following character set, including:

Applications [ edit ]
Aside from novelty and amusement, calculator spelling has limited utility. The popularity of pagers in the 1990s gave rise to a form of leetspeak called pagerspeak.[3] Students, in particular, experimented with calculators to discover new words.
English [ edit ]
The 'original' attributed example of calculator spelling, which dates from the 1970s,[4] is 5318008, which when turned over spells "BOOBIES". Another early example of calculator spelling offered the sequence 0.7734, which becomes "hELLO".[5] Other words possible with the traditional "BEghILOSZ" set include "LOOSE", "ShELL", "BEIgE", "gOBBLE", "gOOgLE", and very many others. Among the longest are "gLOSSOLOgIES" and "BIBLIOLOgIES" at 12 letters, and "hILLBILLIES" and "SLEIghBELLS" at 11 (these require 12-digit displays, such as those used in adding machines). Hip hop slang applications include the sequence 3722145 which spells "ShIZZLE". On certain 10 digit calculators the number 5304577351 spells "I SELL ShOES", the number 77151345 spells "ShE IS ILL", or the number 7715134 spells "hE IS ILL". Another common number, 7734206, spells "gO 2 hELL". 8008 is special in that it can spell "BOOB" upside-down or right-side up. 71077345 spells "SHELLOIL", which can be separated into two individual words ("shell" and "oil").
Scientific and programmer calculators [ edit ]
Scientific calculators that feature hexadecimal readout using the letters A through F offer more flexibility. Using a scientific calculator with hex capability, the earlier "5318008" example can be improved with the A–F keys to spell "B00B1E5", without needing to rotate the display (a practice known as hexspeak).
Students often use this capability and the improved "alpha" feature that use the letters "A" through "Z" to write messages, separating words by using the minus sign ("-") or other punctuation. In the "B00B1E5" example above, for instance, a factorial product sign ("!") can be added to create "B00B1E5!" Most of these calculators do not use seven-segment displays, instead using dot matrix displays for greater versatility.
Programmable devices [ edit ]
When accessed through programming, calculator spelling can provide a form of textual feedback in devices with limited output ability. A programmer creates a wider set of letters, which does not require a reader to turn the device upside-down.[5] Many consumer devices including digital cameras resort to variants of calculator spelling in order to display diagnostic or status information in non-alphanumeric displays. For example, many Minolta cameras display "Err" or "HELP" to indicate various problems.

Donald Trump is not a perfect human being or an ideal candidate. There are aspects of his personality and his past that are repellent. He is, however, America's last best hope for peace and freedom at this critical moment in the nation's history.
A corrupt gang of Establishment thugs is engaged in a coordinated campaign to destroy Trump and maintain control of official Washington. All mass media outlets have been deployed in the effort. Only the bipartisan coordination of the effort remains hidden from public view.
Active participants include Hillary Clinton and her campaign apparatus; Barack Obama, every agency of his administration (including the Justice Department, the FBI, and the Defense and State Departments); the entire national leadership of the Democrat Party; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, the entire national leadership of the Republican Party; and all national media outlets including the broadcast networks, FOX News, CNN, The New York Times, the Washington Post, and the remaining print “newspapers” of the nation's largest urban centers.
The Rest…HERE
Share. "I don't believe in the superhero genre." "I don't believe in the superhero genre."
Superhero movies have been getting some shade recently from high profile directors, with Steven Spielberg predicting the genre will go "way of the Western" and Zack Snyder responding by saying "Batman and Superman are transcendent of superhero movies" versus "the flavor of the week Ant-Man." When I caught up with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige at an event promoting the Avengers: Age of Ultron Blu-ray release, I asked him for his take on the comments.
"People have been asking me that for 15 years," he told me of whether he thinks superhero movies are going out of style. "In 2001, 2002, 2003 there were two Marvel movies, three Marvel movies, and I still believe the same thing, which is as long as the ones that we can control are as good as they can be, that's all that I care about. I think we've been doing pretty well. I'm very confident in the films we've announced that we have coming forward that they're going to be surprising and different and unique. I've said a lot: I don't believe in the comic book genre. I don't believe in the superhero genre. I believe that each of our films can be very different."
Exit Theatre Mode
When prompted specifically about Spielberg's "way of the Western" quote, Feige didn't seem to consider the prediction a negative implication. "It could, but the Western lasted 40-50 years, and they still pop up occasionally," he said. "It's been, what, eight years since Iron Man 1 if we count that, which I do, as the beginning of our MCU? Maybe [the superhero genre] will only last another 42 years."
In reference to Snyder's comments, Feige defended the unique qualities of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, saying, "Those are all very different movies. They all happen to be based on Marvel characters and Marvel comics, but from a genre and a cinematic perspective, they're all very unique. Civil War may as well be a different genre from Age of Ultron."
Exit Theatre Mode
"The way Winter Soldier was a political thriller, I think there is a more emotional and more geopolitical and real world through line through Civil War than there was in the broader Age of Ultron with the killer AI Tony Stark invention," he continued. "I think it's the same thing as saying, 'I don't know how many more movies can be made from novels. I think people are going to be bored with novels being turned into movies. I don't know how long it's going to last.'"
Reflecting back on the time between Age of Ultron's release in May and its home video release on October 2nd, Feige said, "The year went very well for us, the way we wanted it to: big giant movie with huge expectations that met those expectations with Age of Ultron, and a crazy movie that no one had heard of with a character that people were dubious of that also became a big hit with Ant-Man. That had happened the year before with Winter Soldier and Guardians, so for us that very much is in keeping. Next year, we hope the same thing for Civil War and Doctor Strange. It is, as it often is with us, sticking to the plan and continuing to follow through on what we've laid out."

Hillary Clinton‘s campaign dropped a new ad this morning pretty mocking Bernie Sanders for invoking Wall Street and the billionaire class in his answers to everything.
At this week's Democratic debate, Clinton said in her closing statement, “I am not a single-issue candidate and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.” She said that while she agrees with Sanders about reforming Wall Street, there are too many other important issues that need addressing.
And the Clinton ad out today makes the same point.
The ad shows how––in his answers to a variety of issues––Sanders brought things back to Wall Street and how the rich are getting richer, an issue he gets particularly passionate about on the campaign trail.

Mobile is key for any organization that wants to capture the attention of Americans -- even for an institution that seems as antiquated as the public library system.
The number of Americans using mobile devices to access library Web sites has more than doubled in the last three years, according to a Pew Research Center report released today.
Based on a survey of 2,300 people in October and November, Pew determined that 13 percent of Americans ages 16 and older go to a library Web site using a mobile device. That's substantially more than the meager number of people who used mobile devices to view library sites three years ago. A survey conducted in 2009 found that 6 percent of Americans had contributed to library mobile traffic.
While a good chunk of Americans still own, and use, their library cards to borrow materials, the Pew study shows that only 25 percent of Americans ages 16 or older visited a library Web site in the last year. Most visitors -- 82 percent -- searched the site's catalog for materials. (This includes audio books, e-books, CDs, and DVDs.)
Other popular library services accessed included:
 72 percent looked for basic information like hours of operation, branch location, or directions;
 62 percent reserved materials;
 51 percent, particularly members aged 30 to 40 and those with young children, renewed materials;
 51 percent, particularly members aged 18 to 29, used an online database.
What Is Swaraj? The concept of swaraj, or self-rule, was developed during the Indian freedom struggle. In his book Hind Swaraj (1909), Gandhi sought to clarify that the meaning behind swaraj was much more than simply "wanting [systems of] English rule without the Englishman; the tiger's nature but not the tiger." The crux of his argument centered on the belief that the socio-spiritual underpinnings of British political, economic, bureaucratic, legal, military, and educational institutions were inherently unjust, exploitative and alienating. As Pinto explicates, "The principal theme of Hind Swaraj is the moral inadequacy of western civilization, especially its industrialism, as the model for free India." Gandhi was particularly critical of the deeply embedded principles of 'might is right' and 'survival of the fittest'. On another level, the call for swaraj represents a genuine attempt to regain control of the 'self' - our self-respect, self-responsibility, and capacities for self-realization - from institutions of dehumanization. As Gandhi states, "It is swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves." The real goal of the freedom struggle was not only to secure political azadi (independence) from Britain, but rather to gain true swaraj (liberation and self-rule). Gandhi wanted all those who believed in swaraj: (1) to reject and wholly uproot the British raj (rule) from within themselves and their communities; and, (2) to regenerate new reference points, systems, and structures that enable individual and collective self-development. This regeneration was to grow from the strengths, perspectives, wisdom and experiences of people living in village India, rather than from cities in Britain, America, and even in India for that matter. Understanding the real 'Self', and its relation to communities and society, is critical to the project of attaining swaraj. How is this relevant for us today? We feel that South Asia (along with the rest of the world) is experiencing a tremendous crisis, one overwhelming in its scale and pace of growth. While it is easy to get caught up in the symptoms of this crisis (the brutal violence, the enormous inequities, the extinction of cultures and languages, the degradation of the environment), it is equally, if not more, important to understand its roots. We must creatively analyze the content and the consequences of our current economic, political, social, and educational systems, without reverting to a romanticized past of so-called untouched or pristine traditions. From these critical reflections, we must generate new spaces, systems, and processes - based on moral and holistic visions of human potential and human progress - which can lead us out of the global self-destruction which engulfs us. Throughout it all, we must consider and negotiate our own roles, while asking ourselves how we are either working for solutions or contributing to making the crisis worse. Thus, today, we recognize Gandhi's concept of swaraj integral to three parallel action-reflection agendas for the 21st century: Decolonization of the Mind: Understanding the Roots of the Crisis Before Us Revaluation and Critical Traditionalism: We Have to Learn from the Past, but We Can't Go Back Creative Regeneration: Growing New Ways Forward
A new version of the Windows 10 technical preview leaked onto the internet today, days after Microsoft detailed a delay in delivering a fresh update to its preview program. The new build, numbered 10036, has been made available unofficially on torrent file sharing sites, and includes a number of UI improvements and some feature changes. The Start Menu is now transparent, and Microsoft is testing a new UI for Wi-Fi connectivity, alongside some improvements to the new task view virtual desktop feature that allows Windows 10 users to drag and drop apps between desktops.
Microsoft is speeding up its Windows 10 preview updates
Many of Microsoft's Windows 10 testers had expected the company to deliver more regular updates as originally promised in January, but the software maker has been struggling to release a new build publicly due to bugs. "We've probably been too conservative about pushing builds to the Fast ring for Windows Insiders," admitted Microsoft's Gabe Aul earlier this week. Microsoft is now planning to alter its fast ring for the Windows 10 preview to speed its pace up and deliver updates more regularly. This will inevitably lead to more bugs and issues with builds, but a quicker pace that will please Microsoft enthusiasts who want to test the latest and greatest.
The latest leaked build doesn't have a huge amount of changes, but it also includes the icons that Microsoft is testing, including that the odd new recycle bin icon. Microsoft is planning to deliver an official release very soon with a preview of its new Internet Explorer replacement, codenamed Project Spartan. The leaked 10036 build includes a number of bugs, and as such it's worth waiting on Microsoft to release a new updated preview build in the coming weeks.
PRISTINA (Reuters) - Demonstrators in Kosovo fought running battles with police and set fire to the government's headquarters on Saturday as anger simmers in the young Balkan country over an accord with its former ruler, Serbia.
The seat of government in the capital, Pristina, briefly caught fire after it came under a hail of petrol bombs. Firefighters quickly doused the flames and police used tear gas to drive back several thousand opposition demonstrators.
They were protesting against a European Union-brokered deal to give Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority greater local government powers and the possibility of financing from Belgrade. Opposition leaders say the government should resign over the accord and call an early election.
Police said 28 people were hurt, including 24 police officers and two journalists. Around 40 protesters were arrested and police confiscated knives and petrol bombs.
Earlier, demonstrators hurled petrol bombs, stones and bottles and set light to several armored police cars.
Kosovo's government has accused opposition party leaders of organizing the violence and attempting to drag the country into “crime and anarchy.”
“The aim of this protest was to overthrow the government with violence and leave the country in the hands of the incriminated people that today set on fire the (government) building and police,” it said in a statement.
Opposition parties said they will organize more protests until the government resigns.
Kosovo, which is majority Albanian, declared independence from Serbia with Western support in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian security forces accused of killing and expelling civilians from the ethnic Albanian majority during a counter-insurgency war.
Serbia does not recognize its former southern province as independent, but both are under pressure from the EU to normalize their relations if they are to progress toward membership of the bloc.

Many Kosovo Albanians believe the accord with Serbia represents a threat to Kosovo's hard-won sovereignty, now recognized by more than 100 countries including the major Western powers.
Protests against the deal have frequently turned violent over the past year and opposition MPs have repeatedly disrupted the work of parliament by releasing tear gas in the chamber.
U.S. ambassador to Kosovo Greg Delawie, whose country is the biggest supporter of Kosovo's independence, wrote on Twitter. “Political violence threatens democracy and all that Kosovo has achieved since independence.”
NORRISTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania judge on Tuesday ordered comedian Bill Cosby to stand trial on accusations of sexual assault, the most serious setback so far for a man who epitomized the all-American dad on the 1980s sitcom “The Cosby Show.”
Judge Elizabeth McHugh found that prosecutors presented enough evidence to support allegations that he drugged and assaulted a woman in 2004. The judge rejected arguments from Cosby's defense lawyers that the case should be thrown out.
As the hearing concluded, McHugh wished Cosby luck, to which the 78-year-old entertainer responded, “Thank you.”
The decision followed a 3-1/2 hour preliminary hearing in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, where prosecutors introduced statements that Cosby and the woman, Andrea Constand, separately gave to police in 2005.
Constand herself was not called to testify, although prosecutors said she is prepared to appear as a trial witness.
She told police in 2005 she was attacked as she lay on a sofa at Cosby's Philadelphia-area home “paralyzed” by drugs the entertainer had given her, according to police.
Constand, a former basketball coach at Cosby's Temple University alma mater, is the only woman whose accusations of sexual assault have resulted in criminal charges against Cosby.
But Cosby has been hit by sexual assault allegations from more than 50 women. He has denied assaulting anyone. Most of the cases are too old to be prosecuted, but the entertainer faces civil lawsuits from his accusers.
A trial date in the Pennsylvania criminal case has not yet been set. Cosby faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge against him, aggravated indecent assault.

In his own 2005 interview with police from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, Cosby confirmed some details of Constand's account.
He acknowledged giving Constand 1-1/2 pills of the antihistamine Benadryl to relax her and said the two engaged in heavy “petting,” including fondling each other's genitals, Cheltenham Police Chief John Norris testified.
According to Constand's statements, Cosby told her the pills would help “take the edge off.” She swallowed the pills, added a sip of wine and told the comedian, “I trust you,” the detective said.
Cosby told police Constand was conscious during the incident, never told him to stop and did not mention any ill effects from the pills, Norris said.
COSBY NOT GUILTY, LAWYER SAYS
Brian McMonagle, Cosby's lawyer, said after the hearing that prosecutors relied on an 11-year-old “hearsay” statement rather than present a live witness because their case was weak. He expressed confidence Cosby would be absolved.
“Mr. Cosby is not guilty of any crime and not one single fact presented by (prosecutors) rebuts this truth,” McMonagle said.
The judge said McHugh said state law permits prosecutors to introduce hearsay evidence at a preliminary hearing.
Cosby's lawyers repeatedly questioned the accuracy of Constand's account, in what is likely a preview of their trial strategy.
Slideshow (11 Images)
McMonagle pointed to discrepancies between Constand's initial interview with a detective and her later written statement, including her inability to recall precisely when the incident occurred.
He also said she had consensual sexual encounters with Cosby on other occasions, had dinner with Cosby after the alleged assault and later took her family to see his show in Toronto, Canada.
A stand-up comedian, Cosby landed a breakthrough role on the 1960s TV show “I Spy,” becoming a rare black actor with a leading part on a network television series. He went on to other shows and became a pitchman for Jell-O pudding while also stirring controversy with critical comments about black youth culture.
Twice-yearly meetings closed to media, except for the Rightwing media members, like Glenn Beck, who attend the meetings...
Brad Friedman Byon 10/20/2010, 3:10pm PT
Think Progress has a great report today on the billionaire industry titans, U.S. Supreme Court Justices (including Scalia and Thomas), infamous front-group astroturfers and Rightwing media scammers who meet in secret twice a year --- as they did last year in Aspen and will again this January in Palm Springs --- to plot how they will spend their billions to keep "liberty" and "freedom" available to all (of them) and to plot the 2010 and 2012 elections for Republicans.
The story includes the actual invitation letter [PDF] to the upcoming Palm Springs event, from Vast Rightwing Conspiracy funder, billionaire Charles G. Koch of Koch Industries Inc., along with the agenda and participants of last year's Aspen meeting attached to it.
The letter begins creepily enough: "If not us, who? If not now, when?", but my favorite part is this part from the reprint of the agenda of last year's meeting...
So, "the meetings are closed to the public, including media," except for all the Rightwing media actually inside the meetings giving presentations and participating with the billionaire tycoons and scammers "who are dedicated to defending our free society" and planning to "combat what is now the greatest assault on American freedom and prosperity in our lifetimes."
While Breitbart, Fox and friends made much of the non-troversy, a few months ago, over the names of the participants of the "Journolist" e-mail listsever --- where leftish and center-leftish journalists and activists shared questions, thoughts, sources and random bullshit --- I suspect they'll go out of their way, today, to not notice TP's story, since it includes the participation of all manner of "fair and balanced" "journalists" and "consultants" from Murdoch's Newscorp-owned Fox "News" and Wall Street Journal such as Glenn Beck, Charles Krauthammer, Michael Barone, Stephen Moore and others.
By the way, have the words "Freedom", "Liberty" and "Prosperity" always been Republican dog-whistle code-words for corporate totalitarianism in this country? Or is that a relatively new developement in the Palin-era? In any case, go read the creepy story and the even creepier invitation letter [PDF] from Koch.
Since Bong Eats, our YouTube channel on Calcutta food, started uploading videos last November, we have have received a spectacular response from viewers everywhere. We try to do seasonal, time-relevant recipes. Last fortnight, with Durga Pujo approaching, we decided to recreate Calcutta's somewhat iconic street food, the egg roll.
Within a week, the video crossed 100,000 views. We got hundreds of comments from viewers . Some complained about the missing chicken in the roll, some rued the absence of kasundi. But overall people were happy since it chimed with their Durga Pujo mood –
you know, pujo shopping, pandal hopping, interjected by egg roll eating.
And then out of nowhere we started getting hateful comments.
Most of the comments harped on how godless Bengalis eat eggs and meat during Durga Pujo, and how it hurts their Hindu sentiments. Others were just casually racist in their remarks about Bengalis. Some comments were so vile we had to delete them. Here are some samples.
These are just a handful.

On our other videos that use beef, such as the haleem recipe, the malice is scary.
Most of this hatred is targeted towards Bengalis and Bengal. We, as well as other people in India who do not speak Hindi and have religious rituals and culture different from the mainstream North Indian Hindus, have always been looked at with a mixture of suspicion and contempt. But now, with the government seemingly intent of foregrounding one particular brand of militant Hinduism, these people are becoming the voice of the nation.
As anyone who has spent even a few years in Calcutta could tell you, though, Durga Pujo is not a puja: It is a carnival. It is much, much closer in spirit to New Orleans' Mardi Gras than to Navratri. It is a time when a whole metropolis comes to a stop to celebrate with friends and family. Absolutely mind-boggling art is put up on display for everyone to look at and be awed by only to be dismantled after four days. Food is eaten. Drinks are drunk. Songs are sung.
One can only guess that some people hear the word “puja” in Durga Puja and assume that this must comply with their rules of a puja – piety, havan, mantras, fasting, abstinence , the works.
In their minds they must imagine the Goddess surveying this debauchery from the heavens and fuming at the blasphemy of it all.

Our Goddess
But Durga is our Goddess. We believe (and even an agnostic like me has no difficulty) that Durga is Bengal's daughter who is coming home for the holidays to her mother's house with her four children. The children are of course coming to their mama bari. Every Bengali child has fond feelings for their mama bari – where their mother's strict rule ends, where their most outrageous wishes are pandered to, where they don't have to study, they can play in the sun as long as they like, and eat what they want to, whenever they want to. Our childhoods were lived between one mama bari visit and the next.
Durga, like all Bengali mothers looks at this as a mixed blessing. On the one hand, she does not have to worry about the children – the grandparents and mama-mami (that is us!) will look after them. On the other hand, she knows that it will be an ordeal to bring the kids back to the rule of law after her imminent return. She spends time at her baper bari (paternal house) hanging out with relatives and old friends who are also back for the holidays.
Do you see how self-referential this is?
Durga is back for a holiday that celebrates her homecoming. And this is not where it ends. All Bengalis are also coming home or waiting for friends and family to come home during this time. That is how close we are to Durga – we practically have the same lives.
On the day of the Dashami, when Durga is returning, every person in Calcutta feels an all-engulfing sadness – a sadness so deep the god fearing will never feel for a Goddess. Because only when you love someone so truly can you feel so sad at her going away. Unlike you, we don't fear Durga. She is one of our own.

Peas be nice
My lengthy journey to veganism began when I met my first vegetarian nine years ago. As our enchanting friendship blossomed, she explained how books, documentaries, and videos on PETA.com pushed her towards her dietary conversion. Listening to her speak about her lifestyle was both intriguing and novel. Her gusto for vegetarianism was emphatic, and perhaps too rigid, but I didn't care—I was inspired. I finally got off MySpace (yeah, I know) long enough to check out PETA's website, and what I found was nauseating. Undercover videos featured the marrow-chilling sights and sounds of slaughterhouses as seen by workers. Captions damned ‘Big Ag' for crimes against animals and named specific fast food brands as those responsible for the heinous abuse I watched. Deeply disturbed, I began searching the website for ways to become a vegetarian. I was hooked, but I had no idea where to begin.
During my search of PETA's help guide, I discovered veganism. I remember thinking vegans must be utterly insane granola-munching hippies. How on earth could someone subsist on plants alone? Dismissing it as ludicrous, I focused on becoming a vegetarian, believing this was enough to help the animals. Armed with new knowledge about the meat industry, I ditched the bacon and ardently argued with anyone who questioned my choice.
Ultimately, I failed. After a mere four years of my vegetarian diet, I began eating meat again. There were several reasons I failed. First, I stopped reminding myself of why I was not eating meat, especially since I never re-watched those videos. Second, I lacked a support system. With everyone else around me eating meat, I caved. Finally, my dietary health was complicated by the development of severe lactose-intolerance.
Cognitive dissonance
For five years, I resumed eating meat and eggs in place of my precious dairy. I secretly hated that I was not strong enough to stop. I tried various methods of coping, but mostly I lied to myself through irrational justifications. I told myself things like “this chicken probably died really quickly,” or “this cow was raised eating grass!” or even “If I just eat meat once a day, that will save plenty of animals.” At the end of the day, however, I never felt right about eating meat. All of this discomfort was kept quiet in the back of my mind until one fateful day in social psychology when our professor explained the concept of cognitive dissonance. He explained that cognitive dissonance occurs when a person has inconsistent thoughts or beliefs in relation to their actions or behaviors. “I want you all to think,” he intoned, “about something you believe, on a moral level, and how you disobey that in your actions.” Before I even realized what I was saying, I muttered, “eating meat.” Frightened by my slip up, I sat back and looked around to see if anyone had heard. Most people were closing their eyes and tilting their heads to one side, deep in thought. I pushed down my feelings and tried to think of another example.
I decided then to eat less meat. In my mind, this would help satiate my cognitive dissonance. I started eating more vegetables, buying more microwavable vegan dishes, and researching vegan recipes on Pinterest. Three months later, I landed a job at a national chain health food store. This job opened up a plethora of opportunities for my vegan-curious lifestyle. I tried as much meat and dairy alternatives as possible. Over time, my diet shifted, but I still could not fully commit to veganism—not until two customers showed me truths I would not admit to myself.
Good cop bad cop
The first customer who helped me realize what I needed to do was the more aggressive of the two. He appeared close to me in age and was skeletal thin. His scraggly beard and “I woke up like this” vibe screamed hipster in a most off-putting manner. One night, when the store was particularly slow, we started talking about his vegan lifestyle. He was more aggressively adamant about animal rights than myself, and we got into a slightly heated discussion about humanely raised farm animals. It ended with him angrily saying that killing an animal in any way is inhumane, and even my beloved health food store was guilty of injustice. He grabbed his reusable bags and turned to walk away before spinning his head partly around and calling back, “You should do more research. You don't even know what this store has done in the past.” Anxious and aggravated, I watched him walk out of the store. Our paths did not cross again for months. Though his statements left me agitated, I could not ignore the question floating around in my head. What if he's right?
The second customer who helped lead me down the leafy green path to veganism was Mike. He was a regular who had a penchant for massive quantities of Field Roast sausages and Beanito chips. Helplessly curious, I asked him one day if he had a large family. He laughed genially and told me about the nonprofit he worked for called the Gentle Barn, and he and the volunteers were vegans. He explained that one of the Gentle Barn's main missions was to help educate others in the community by giving tours of the sanctuary.
Yet, what intrigued me most was the man himself. Many vegans I had encountered were on the slimmer side, with messy hair and an unkempt way about them. Mike was the complete opposite, both in height and physique. He had the weather worn face of a farmer, deep laugh lines, and the build of a lineman. We had several more conversations after this encounter, and I began to recognize his face rather than his work clothes. Mike was the first vegan I met who did not strike me as a cause-driven person. He was obviously well-fed, hardworking, and did not outwardly judge me for eating meat. Instead, he invited my husband and I to his sanctuary.
Conversion
A few months later, my husband and I visited the Gentle Barn on our way to a romantic weekend in Gatlinburg, TN. In the weeks leading up to our visit, I had been able to eat vegan for almost a week. Proud and excited, we pulled up to the barn one chilly Saturday morning in February. The barn and surrounding pastures looked and smelled just like my hometown and were brimming with a small crowd buzzing with excitement. The tour began with an explanation of how and why the Gentle Barn got started in Tennessee. A video about their local mascot, the cow Dudley, followed. The powerful narration elicited tears of compassion from the audience, and the story developed from one of a simple rescue to the building of a larger facility in western Knox County. As the group collectively dried our eyes, the videos ended and we all stood to walk outside and meet Dudley's gang.
That visit to the Gentle Barn is etched forever in my mind because it was my turning point. Every moment before that was an evolution leading to a larger lifestyle change, but this event was lighting. There is something remarkable about petting a giant pasture-dog as it closes its eyes lazily and leans into you, and there was something earth shattering about having a five hundred pound pig waddle up to me and flop over on his back, waiting for belly rubs. As a paradigm shift occurred in my heart, I scratched Horton the pig's soft belly and wondered how dreadful it would be to have to work at a slaughter house. Did all pigs act this way?
After we left the Gentle Barn for our mini vacation, I vowed in my heart to never again eat animal byproducts. I knew I would hate myself. I felt compelled to be strong for them. I have to be strong for the beings without voices. People need to know that pigs and cows are like giant dogs, and I needed to know that I could live a life minimizing any harm, whether to other humans or to the animals that pass through my life. On that cold February morning, Mike and his volunteers showed me that I could be vegan and look well-fed. I could subsist on plants alone and lead a normal life. Effecting change did not require me standing on a street corner and screaming “Meat is murder!” at passers-by. As Mike illustrated, living by example was the simplest and most effective way for me to demonstrate the normalcy of veganism.
A group representing transit riders hopes the city and its transit union will sign off on an agreement before the cold season sets in for good.
“It's definitely a concern for riders,” said Mairi Anderson, spokeswoman for neutral transit-user group Bus Riders of Saskatoon, calling the winter season “crunch time.”
“More people depend on the busses in the winter because it's more difficult to get around by foot and by bike,” she said.
The City of Saskatoon and the Amalgamated Transit Union 615 (ATU 615) will be back at the negotiation table Tuesday and Bus Riders of Saskatoon hopes the parties can come to an agreement to ensure riders aren't left in limbo.
“We hope the ATU and the city are able to come to an agreement as quickly as possible so that riders aren't left in the dark as to when the busses are going to run and when they're not going to be working,” said Anderson.
“But we also understand that it needs to be a fair agreement, so we don't run into these sorts of negotiations on-and-off again.”
Negotiations last month saw both parties return to the table, but on Sept. 25, 92.4 per cent of ATU members voted they didn't want to put the city's latest offer to a vote. The primary sticking point remains proposed pension changes.
In a release issued that day, Catherine Gryba, general manager of corporate performance with the city said the vote was “extremely disappointing news.”
Late last week, a city spokesman declined an opportunity to comment on Tuesday's meeting, but said Gryba's remarks in September — which indicate the city is “always willing to get back to the bargaining table” — still stand.
A 2014 breakdown in negotiations resulted in riders being without full transit service for almost a month when the City of Saskatoon locked out the union. The lockout was ruled illegal by the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board, which ended it on Oct. 18.
ATU president Jim Yakubowski said he's optimistic the two parties can come to an agreement.
“If there was no interest from either party to want to sit down and talk, that would be the worst-case scenario,” he said, saying the fact that both parties are still willing to talk is “a positive thing.”
The ATU 615 has been without a contract since December 2012.

OREM — A Utah County woman bought more than $500 worth of shirts because she said they were inappropriate and she wanted to get them off display.
Judy Cox said she was concerned with the messages and images printed on T-shirts on display in the PacSun store window at University Mall Saturday. Cox said they included scantily-dressed models in provocative poses, and she thought they should be taken down.
"These shirts clearly cross a boundary that is continually being pushed on our children in images on the Internet, television and when our families shop in the mall," she said in a statement.
Cox said she talked to the store manager about it, and other people apparently had complained, as well. But the store manager claimed corporate wouldn't allow the display to come down until the promotion ended on Wednesday, according to the Daily Herald.
So, Cox bought all the t-shirts — $567 worth — to get rid of them, she confirmed. She said she plans to return them on day 59 of the 60-day return policy and let corporate figure it out.
"Hopefully the message will be clear that this is not acceptable for public display in our communities," Cox said.
She also questions whether the display was against the mall lease and Orem City code, if not Utah state law. Cox met with the city attorney and decided to return the shirts after the display promotion is over.
Cox said she hoped her efforts would inspire others to speak up.
"You don't have to purchase $600 worth of T-shirts, but you can express your concerns to businesses and corporations who promote the display of pornography to children," she said.
PacSun CEO, Gary Schoenfeld, released the following statement:
"PacSun is proud to be a retailer that supports a unique collective of brands, all of which deliver on the California lifestyle through their individual personalities. Our brands take inspiration from a variety of influences including music, art, fashion and action sports. The result is a creative and diverse expression both in product and marketing.
"While customer feedback is important to us, we remain committed to the selection of brands and apparel available in our stores."
The display is still in the windows at the Gateway Mall store location, but the Herald reports it is not at the Provo Towne Center.
In comments made on April 25, Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) both said they were saddened gun control didn't pass on April 17 but assured reporters the measures would be brought up for another vote some time this year.
“I think we will bring the bill back before the end of the year… lots of Senators who thought it was safe to vote against it [on April 17] because of the intensity [pro-gun groups] are not so sure anymore,” Schumer said.
Schumer said the intensity for gun control has increased since the failed vote for gun control legislation, and he thinks Americans are now “intense” in their desire for more gun control.
McCain concurred, saying, “I… agree with Chuck that I think the issue will come back.” McCain supported the Manchin/Toomey gun control “compromise” the first time around; he said the toughest part of pushing it is that “Second Amendment defenders” are very active.
Contrary to claims that momentum has shifted in favor of more gun control, national polls show an ever-increasing drop in public support for gun laws. A recent USA Today poll showed that support for stricter gun control fell from 61% in February to 49% by April 21.
Moreover, Democrat Senators in red states running for re-election in 2014 know their political well-being depends on defending the 2nd Amendment.
Remember Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron? They're the Christian owners of Sweet Cakes by Melissa, a bakery in Portland, Oregon, who refused to bake a cake for a lesbian wedding, then releasing the couple's information to the public. Their illegal actions ultimately cost them $135,000 in fines, an amount that was more-than-covered by the $515,000 in donations they received from online supporters. They finally paid that fine (with interest) a few days ago.
But how do you spin a story of bigots who make bank into a tale of Christian Persecution?
Simple. You just leave out the part about people raising more than half-a-million dollars on your behalf.
That's what Professional Christian Liar Todd Starnes did, suggesting to his ignorant audience that the Kleins are now broke because of their devout faith:
Melissa Klein was checking her bank accounts just a few weeks before Christmas when her face turned ashen. The money was gone — every single penny. confiscated all the cash in Mrs. Klein's checking account and savings account as well as a special account set aside for their church tithe. … It was the price the Kleins had to pay for following the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Either the Kleins are *really* bad with money, or Starnes left a vital detail out of his story in order to dupe his God-lovin' followers. Because lying is entirely justified when you're doing it in the name of the Lord.
Even if they didn't have a donation windfall, though, it wouldn't matter. The Kleins broke the law, and they were rightly punished for it. If money was such a big concern for them, maybe they should've accepted the cash that a lesbian couple wanted to give them for their services. Instead, the Kleins refused to complete their end of the deal — and they still have hundreds of thousands of dollars to show for it, no matter what various Christian publications tell you.

I think many of us in the stem cell field still find it fairly easy to recall the time when we first heard about iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells). For me, it was at a Keystone meeting back at the end of March 2006, when Shinya Yamanaka presented his and Kazu Takahashi's work showing that they could reprogram mouse somatic cells back to a pluripotent state using just four transcription factors.
One of my most vivid memories from that meeting is not actually of the talk itself—although that was also quite memorable—instead, it's of sitting in the ski rental shop trying on ski boots when Shinya walked past and told me he had decided he would submit the paper to Cell. That choice came on the back of a conversation we'd had the day before, after his talk. Many in the audience were amazed and excited about what they'd heard, and, as you might expect, Shinya was somewhat mobbed by eager questioners, one of whom was me. The next day, he made my afternoon with that short sentence.
By the time we got to the ISSCR (International Society for Stem Cell Research) annual meeting in June, the 2006 paper was already well on its way toward being accepted for publication. This meeting is the largest annual gathering of stem cell scientists, so the audience was quite a lot larger than at the Keystone symposium, and the excitement was palpable. Although some people said they could see all of the implications even then, I think for most in the audience there were still some questions about how robust and reproducible the process would really be, and whether it would also work for human cells. Of course, all those questions were answered in the following year, and after that the iPSC phenomenon was up and running.
When Shinya gives talks about the discovery process, he is always very careful to give appropriate credit to people who had worked before on other cell fate conversions, including transcription factor-based switches, such as Harold Weintraub's work with MyoD, plus, of course, John Gurdon's work in Xenopus, which showed that reprogramming to pluripotency was possible at all, in any system.
Some commentators argue that this previous work was the real breakthrough and that iPSCs were more like an adaptation. I don't agree. From my perspective, iPSCs changed everyone's view of what would actually be possible with reprogramming—if we can get mammalian cells to do THAT with just four factors, what else can we get them to do?—and opened up many doors for new avenues of study and application. There's a reason why the whole field took off so quickly from 2007 onward, and I'd argue it was because so many people could see the potential, plus they also felt (and then found) that it was something that they themselves could do.
Hans Schöler made a similar point in the excellent Conversation article in Cell earlier this year (which I would encourage you to read if you want some more historical perspective on how the field reacted at the time). As Hans said,
"The publication of the 2006 and 2007 Yamanaka papers has opened the minds of many researchers to see if they could find cocktails that would be able to convert somatic cells into other different cells and to understand the barriers that need to be overcome in order to obtain stem cells."
This Conversation article was part of a broader series of articles that the Cell and Cell Stem Cell teams have proudly collaborated on over the course of this year, put together to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the groundbreaking 2006 paper. You can find all of the articles gathered together on this special commemorative page. I hope you've enjoyed all of the various reviews, commentaries, and discussions that have come together to make up our feature.
Some of you also chose to join us at a special Cell Symposium in Berkeley in September, where a broad range of speakers covered iPSC-related topics that ranged from basic insights into reprogramming mechanisms to challenges related to clinical application. We were able to squeeze in some fun, too, with early morning exercise and an elegant dinner, and some of us, including yours truly, are still enjoying our souvenir OSKM T-shirts!

Of course, even as we look back and think, "Wow," we also look forward and think, "What's next?" Some of the most rapid periods of advances in science come from the development of new techniques that allow us to ask questions in ways we couldn't before (right now, think of single-cell technology and CRISPR/Cas9 and the way they're opening up new avenues of research).
The discovery of iPSCs was different in that it was a conceptual as well as a technical breakthrough, but it, too, led us to a whole new world of discovery, particularly for human cells. Just think how much we have managed to learn already about human disease using iPSCs, and how much more we'll be able to find out once we've perfected the techniques even further and combined them with other approaches like GWAS and systems-level analysis. Then, of course, there's also the possibility of using the cells themselves directly in therapeutic settings, something that's already a major focus of research and clinical effort, particularly in Japan. The possibilities are enormous, and I can pretty much guarantee that even people working at the forefront still haven't thought of them all.
Probably because I'm an editor, I often get asked to break out my crystal ball and predict the future, or give some idea of where the field is going. In some ways, I wish I knew (it might make my job quite a bit easier…), but overall I am very glad I don't. Just like that first talk on iPSCs, the discoveries that excite me the most are the ones that come out of the blue and really make me think differently about what is and is not possible. Those types of findings don't come along all that often, but when they do they shape the field.
So rather than try to act as a soothsayer, I am happy to watch and wait—somebody out there has something cooking! And in anticipation, here's to the next discovery that has as much of an impact as iPSCs, whatever that turns out to be.

Aw yeah, a new Chrome Experiment game just in time for summer. Roll It, Google's latest multiplayer fun, lets you relive the old days of Skee-Ball on the boardwalk arcade right in your own room.
Much like previous Chrome Experiment games, users can log in with a computer and smartphone, utilizing the latter as the controller. On the smartphone, you'll get a special code to enter in order to sync the device with your computer. Google naturally recommends that you use a Chrome browser to control the game although any “modern Web browsers” should work. While we were able to use our Samsung Galaxy S2's pre-installed Internet app for Super Sync Sports and World Wide Maze, our luck ran out with Roll It and we were forced to run the game from Chrome.
After the sync, the smartphone is now set up for up to three players. You can tilt left or right to determine the number of players, or to restart, end, or continue to the next levels. During the game, tap the arrow to aim, and flick the phone upward to toss the ball. You can swing your phone back to gain momentum if you want to recreate the feeling of playing real Skee-Ball, but we recommend you just flick your wrist to prevent accidentally throwing your phone into the computer screen. By utilizing your phone's accelerometer, the faster you flick the phone upward, the higher the ball flies.
It took us several turns to get the speed adjustments right, and we got a few lucky tosses here and there. The graphics ran smoothly during our quick game, though you should expect slow loads and glitches if your Internet connection is poor. Otherwise, Roll It is sure to keep you entertained for a bit especially thanks to multiple levels with different Skee-Ball cup layouts. The game also introduces power-ups like the Fireball to turn any cup into 100 points as long as you make the shot.
Our verdict: No matter how good you are at video games, Chrome Skee-Ball and real life Skee-Ball are equally difficult to master. Roll It also forces you to share just one smartphone for all three players so you can't play remotely or simultaneously. Don't accidentally press the back button on your smartphone either! If you lose the synced webpage, you won't be able to retrieve the code to continue the game session – unless, of course, you had it written down.
Try Roll It today if you're itching for some arcade games, and get right with the season.
Bikers for Trump are arriving in Washington, D.C. to help protect the 45th U.S. president and those supporting him, thanks to the anti-Trump activists vowing havoc and violence.
“In the event we are needed, we certainly will form a wall of meat,” said Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers for Trump, during a Fox News interview. “We'll be shoulder-to-shoulder with our brothers and toe-to-toe with anyone that is going to break through and police barriers.”
The efforts of the Bikers for Trump group should not be needed during the swearing-in ceremony, but it is becoming more and more apparent that President-Elect Trump and the hundreds of thousands of patriots expected to attend his inauguration need them.
Bikers for Trump has garnered the necessary government permit to assemble on the inauguration grounds on Friday. Cox's group, comprised largely of former military and law enforcement officers, is predicted to be the largest pro-Donald Trump group at the oath of office ceremony.
Chris Cox also said he has extreme confidence in the DC Metro Police, but he and his group will be there to lend a hand in any way possible should the need arise. We all know the police can't be everywhere, so the efforts by Bikers for Trump to maintain order both now and throughout the 2016 presidential race are extremely appreciated.
Americans should not be afraid to show up at a public event for their chosen candidate, especially after said candidate WON and is taking the oath of office. Being attacked, both verbally and physically, by liberal anti-Trump rioters cannot be tolerated.
Liberals obviously cannot be expected to behave themselves and respect the results of a free and fair election. Hillary Clinton LOST, and Donald Trump won. It's as simple as that – deal with it!
Patriots were forced to endure eight long years of the Barack Obama regime. We were equally displeased and worried when the far-left politician won the presidency and began enacting his policies.
We did not riot, burn, or destroy public property, accost Obama supporters, or threaten to engage in anything up to and including violence on inauguration day. Nope, we sucked it up and accepted the results of the election like adults.
People are pouring into Washington in record numbers. Bikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017
We were too busy getting up and going to work to spend countless days walking the streets, blocking the path of emergency vehicles, and chanting inane rhyming slogans. Working class Americans everywhere and middle class Americans in fly-over country did not disrespect the office of the presidency even though we held zero respect for the current Oval Office occupant.
Since our opposites cannot do the same this time around, it makes Bikers for Trump all the more patriotic for going the extra mile to protect our new commander-in-chief.
What do you think about Bikers for Trump going to Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony to help protect him and We the People? Share this story on Facebook and let us know what YOU think!
When all hope is lost, sometimes all you need is a sign.
On November 12, thousands of people marched through Los Angeles to protest the election of Donald Trump, according to the LA Times. Since the march, pictures of 3-year-old Kaio Pinho boasting a big message have been popping up on social media:
"If he builds a wall, I'll grow up and tear it DOWN"
Protest against Donald Trump, Los Angeles, November 12, 2016. pic.twitter.com/8Ix4qA61DA — Nouph. (@Noufabalkhail) November 14, 2016
“I was drawn to this little boy because he was marching amongst mostly adults, but looked equally determined,” Abigail Gorden, the photographer who stopped to snap a picture of Kaio, told The Huffington Post. “He seemed anxious but strong, which I feel you can see by the expression on his face.”
Kaio's mother, Brisa Pinho, a Brazilian-American with dual citizenship made the sign. “I thought it was a good idea to create a bold sign as if it was my son saying it,” Pinho told The Huffington Post. “The wall I speak of in the sign is figurative. [It's] a wall of hate, racism, and xenophobia that if built in the years ahead, will be torn down by my son and his generation.”
Brisa Pinho Kaio getting all kinds of attention.
Though Kaio is only 3, Pinho felt it would be safe to take her son, who likes crowds and music, to the protest she described as “extremely peaceful.”
Plus she felt that it was an experience her son should have.
“I think it's important for children to learn from an early age to stand up for what's right, for others who can't stand up for themselves and to know that they have the power to make their voices heard.”
The Cell Games (セルゲーム, Seru Gēmu) is a tournament organized and hosted by Cell in order to show his power to the world. One of Cell's other reasons for creating the Cell Games is so that he can recreate the World Martial Arts Tournament.

Biography
Background
Cell gives an international announcement for the games on May 17, Age 767 during a televised broadcast on WHN in ZTV Studios, and gives the fighters who want to participate 10 days to prepare. He also explains that new fighters can follow earlier participants. If the fighter were to give up or touch the outside of the ring, they automatically lose, and if the fighter is killed, they will be disqualified. In contrast with the World Martial Arts Tournament, killing was effectively permitted.
The Earth's Military had attempted to attack Cell prior to the start of the tournament, but the attack completely failed. That same day, Mr. Satan announces on television that he will defeat Cell at the Cell Games.
The tournament begins
Nine days later, on May 26, the Z-Fighters have done as much training as they can possibly do, except for Goku and Gohan, who are convinced they can beat Cell without the extra days of training. When the tournament commences, Goku decides he will be the first one to fight Cell.
However, the first challenger to arrive at the Cell Games is Mr. Satan (winner of the 24th World Martial Arts Tournament which the Z-Fighters did not enter). He challenges the bio-mechanical android himself along with his students, Pirozhki and Caroni. Cell proves to be far superior to them as expected, and they are quickly disposed of, with Mr. Satan claiming that he slipped out of the ring. Vegeta is the first of the Z-Fighters to arrive, and is soon followed by the rest.
Goku is the first Z-Fighter to challenge Cell, and after a bit of sparring as a warm-up, Goku increases his ki to maximum, which shocks the rest of the Z-Fighters. However, surprisingly, Goku's son Gohan expects more power from his father. After another bit of sparring, Cell forms a Kamehameha which threatens to destroy the Earth, until Goku diverts it away from the Earth and then returns to the ring using his Instant Transmission, only to surprise Cell with an attack. Cell then attacks with a flurry of Ki Blasts. After much fighting, Goku reaches his limit and nearly falls from the ring. Cell, tired of being confined to a small area, destroys the ring, and announces that the entire Earth is the ring now. Goku, desperate to end the conflict, forms a Super Kamehameha while in the sky, and makes Cell believe that Goku will fire the Super Kamehameha and risk the existence of the Earth in order to defeat him. Everyone is concerned that Goku will actually destroy the Earth, when Goku teleports at the last moment to a close proximity to Cell, and shoots the Kamehameha, blowing off Cell's head and upper body. Although Cell is able to regenerate from the attack due to having Piccolo's regenerative ability, it leaves both him and Goku significantly weakened. Goku, with his power dropping fast from the massive blast, announces that he is forfeiting the match, and then asks Gohan to take his place, because he knows that Gohan had no trouble following the fight between him and Cell. As the Z-Fighters watch in awe, Goku reveals to everyone that Gohan is the only one able to beat Cell. Wanting the fight to be fair, he arrogantly gives Cell a Senzu Bean in order to recover from his energy loss, with the other Z-Fighters being vehemently against the idea.
Gohan challenges Cell, increasing his ki to a point that rivals even Goku's. Cell quickly launches a series of attacks on the young Super Saiyan, but Gohan is surprisingly fast. Cell eventually launches him into a mountain. Believing that he has finished Gohan when he had launched him through that mountain; Cell calls on Goku to fight him once more. Goku points Gohan out to Cell, who emerges from the destroyed mountain practically unscathed. Gohan asks Cell to end the killing and tells him about his seemingly limitless dormant power that reveals itself whenever he goes berserk from rage. Cell is amused by this statement and decides to test it, attacking Gohan ruthlessly. When Cell fails to get Gohan angry, he then decides to provoke Gohan by attacking the other Z-Fighters, and quickly swipes the Senzu Beans. Goku had not taken one before, leaving him weak and vulnerable to Cell. Android 16 launches a surprise attack on Cell, grabbing him and attempting self-destruction. Unfortunately, Krillin informs Android 16 that his self-destruction device was removed by Bulma when she and her father repaired him. Cell escapes from 16's grasp and proceeds to obliterate him with a single blast.
Gohan's challenge
Cell then returns his attention to Gohan's friends and, instead of wasting energy and risking defeat by fighting them directly, he creates seven miniature versions of himself, which he calls the Cell Juniors. The Cell Juniors, each nearly as strong as Cell himself, attack the Z-Fighters, effortlessly beating all but Vegeta, Future Trunks and Piccolo. At this point, it is revealed that even though 16 was destroyed by Cell, his head was still operational and happened to land where Mr. Satan and his pupils were hiding. Satan surprisingly proves his worth by tossing 16's head over to Gohan. 16 reassures Gohan that sometimes words cannot reach people like Cell, and tells him to release his power to protect the Earth. Cell then crushes 16's head under his foot, killing him. Finally pushed beyond his emotional limit, Gohan's inner power awakens, causing him to transform into the first Super Saiyan 2.
Gohan snatches the stolen Senzu Beans from Cell, who could not see how Gohan had managed to do so. Gohan then effortlessly annihilates the seven Cell Juniors. It is then revealed that Goku was aware of Gohan's superior abilities all along, and Piccolo realizes that Goku used his own fight with Cell to give Gohan a preview of Cell's abilities; he never intended to beat Cell himself.
With the Z-Fighters out of harm's way, Gohan returns the Senzu Beans and then utterly dominates the evil bio-android, severely injuring him with two simple hits, even after Cell increases his ki to maximum. All the Z-Fighters (except Goku) are in awe of Gohan's immense power, especially Vegeta, who has had his pride hurt even more (it took him his entire life to become that strong while it only took Gohan a couple of years). Attempting to make sense of this child's power that far exceeds his own, Cell fires a massive Kamehameha, knowing that if Gohan dodges it, it would destroy the Earth; to his surprise, Gohan easily counters it with a larger and stronger Kamehameha, pushing the blast back and destroying a significant portion of Cell's body. Goku tells Gohan to finish Cell off, but Gohan, still in a rage from his awakened power, declares that he will make Cell suffer for what he has done. As Goku predicted, Cell regenerates, and out of frustration and rage, transforms into a state that maximizes his power, just like the Super Saiyan Third Grade form. Future Trunks makes note that it was the same mistake that Cell mocked him for when he had fought him as a 3rd Grade Super Saiyan. Gohan beats Cell so hard that he is forced to regurgitate Android 18, which reverts him back to his Semi-Perfect form. Left with no other options, Cell initiates his self-destruction sequence, pumping his body up with enough ki to destroy the Earth. Gohan is unable to do anything, and Goku steps in as he chooses to sacrifice himself in order to save the Earth as he bids Gohan and the others farewell. He teleports Cell to King Kai's Planet where Cell explodes, destroying the planet along with all life on it.
Cell's downfall
After regenerating from a single cell that had survived his self-destruction, the now-Super Perfect Cell uses Instant Transmission to return to Earth just moments after his apparent death, announcing his presence by killing Future Trunks with a single Full Power Death Beam through the chest. Vegeta, enraged by the death of his son, launches a furious assault on Cell; it is in vain, though, as Cell is unaffected by the attack and quickly slams Vegeta aside. Cell then attempts to finish Vegeta off with a second ki blast, but Gohan intervenes and takes the full force of it himself, breaking his left arm as a result. Cell wastes no time after this and fires a massive Kamehameha at Gohan, proclaiming that it will not only destroy the Earth, but the entire Solar System as well. Gohan, with spiritual assistance from Goku, launches a counter Kamehameha with his right arm. The two blasts meet in the middle, and a power struggle between Gohan and Cell ensues. Cell has the upper hand when the Z-Fighters jump in. Their attacks do not affect Cell, though, and he maintains his blast. The only attack that affects Cell at all is a powerful blast from Vegeta which throws Cell off, and allows Gohan to destroy him once and for all, thus ending the Cell Games.
Aftermath
Though Gohan is effectively the winner of the tournament, the "official" winner is Mr. Satan, since Gohan and the Z-Fighters fly off almost immediately after Cell's defeat and Mr. Satan claims that he defeated Cell single-handedly after Cell beat the other fighters. Despite the impossibility of this story's validity, Mr. Satan is easily believed by the populace and considered the true winner of the Cell Games (thus saving the Z-Fighters from media pressure). Following the Cell Games, the Dragon Balls are used to revive Future Trunks, Android 17 and most of Cell's victims, save for Goku, King Kai, Bubbles and Gregory, who remain in Other World, as Goku suggests that the Earth would be safer if he didn't come back this time.

Disruption is a part of progress. All communities of research and development go through cycles in which (a) the established mainstream and its insiders become slow and ineffective, (b) outsiders become frustrated given the unrealized potential for faster progress and better outcomes, (c) some of these outsiders succeed in developing a vastly better path forward, despite being opposed at every turn by the mainstream, (d) the new path forward displaces the existing mainstream, and the outsiders become the new leaders and insiders, (e) with time, this new mainstream becomes slow and ineffective. So the cycle repeats.
In the matter of medicine, aging, and longevity, we are presently somewhere in the midst of step (c). The mainstream of ineffective, expensive approaches to the treatment of age-related conditions is ineffective and expensive because it fails to consider or address the root causes of aging. Try making any damaged machine work better and longer while not actually repairing the damage - it isn't easy. The typical approach to research is to start with the end stage disease state and work slowly and painfully backwards through a very complex dysfunctional metabolism. At the first proximate cause, stop and try to build a treatment that can manipulate the diseased metabolic state so as to make the proximate cause less onerous to the patient. Then return to tracing the disease backwards towards root causes. There are so many layers of proximate causes in most diseases that this type of approach can continue - and has continued - for decades without ever getting close to the cell and tissue damage that is the root cause of aging, and thus the root cause of all age-related disease.
This, however, is the mainstream, the default approach. It is an established culture, reinforced by regulation and tradition, and will change but little without disruption. The most important outsiders attempting to disrupt aging research in favor of effective progress towards treatment of aging are those of the small community that built and supported the Methuselah Foundation and SENS Research Foundation, pulling in philanthropic funding and gathering allies in support of a repair-based approach to the treatment of aging. The fundamental, root causes of aging are well cataloged, forms of cell and tissue damage caused by the normal operation of metabolism, so why wade through the mud of how exactly aging progresses in detail from these causes, and why start at the end and work backwards? Just fix the known causes using any of the envisaged and planned potential classes of repair therapy and see what happens. The potential for cures first, full understanding later: too many people are dying to indulge the mainstream's preferred approach.
We are far enough into this process of disruption that some outsiders have become scientists and some scientists have joined the insurrection. There are thousands of supporters of rejuvenation research, there is respectful and informed press attention, and tens of millions of dollars have been deployed to advancing this cause. The first rejuvenation therapies are under development in startup companies. We're almost at the stage where the people who at the beginning carried out the hard, thankless work of spreading new ideas, obtaining support, and kicking shins - telling the scientific community that they were going about everything the wrong way - start to be buried by the second wave. It is the fate of all pioneers to be forgotten and trodden upon by a collaboration between later newcomers, those with more resources to claim the mantle of leadership, and those of the former mainstream who decide to pretend that they agreed all along. Such is life. It is frustrating, but the important thing is not the credit, but that the job will be done, that repair-based therapies for aging will become the new mainstream on the basis of obtaining far better results than the present approaches to aging. Life and health before pride.
The article linked below struck me as exhibiting a nice mix of many of the agendas that come to the fore during the disruption of an industry, ranging from the several factions intent on burying the original disruptors to individuals with the mainstream attempting to present a slight adjustment of their methods as an alternative to the still vastly better disruptive technology. I'm not sure I agree with all of the core thesis. Some of those presented as outsiders, such as Larry Ellison and Paul Glenn, were almost immediately co-opted by the mainstream of the time. There isn't enough of a distinction made between for-profit and philanthropic funding, as the latter has been vastly more influential and important over the years in which I've been observing progress in aging research. But see what you think.
It is worth noting that all too few of the people and funding sources mentioned in the article are in fact backing the repair-based approaches to rejuvenation that are, to my eyes, the most likely to realize a future of greatly extended healthy lives, and to accomplish these gains soon enough to matter to you and me. Many of those involved are either already or on their way to being captured by the present ineffective mainstream, just like Ellison and Glenn. Nonetheless, disruption is underway, and threads of meaningful work will continue to grow. It is still early enough in this process that ordinary folk like you and I can make a mark: our philanthropy and support for the SENS Research Foundation and similar organizations in past years has produced meaningful change in the status quo, and that change is spreading.
North Carolina's chapter of the NAACP, under its inspiring leader Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, has long been at the forefront of the fight for minority voting rights here in the Tarheel State, most recently by filing a lawsuit in federal courts seeking to overturn the state's (and Gov. McCrory's) worst-in-the-nation voter ID and voter suppression law, the Voter Information Verification Act. And so it should come as no surprise that NC-NAACP sprang into action as soon as it was alerted to this breaking story, rapidly coordinating with other voting rights organizations at both the state and national level to respond forcefully to these revelations. Those efforts resulted, on May 8th (just one day after the story broke here), in a coalition of groups including Demos, Project Vote, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and Southern Coalition for Social Justice, with an able assist by Democracy NC, submitting a warning letter to the North Carolina State Board of Elections and the NC Dept. of Health and Human Services informing them that North Carolina was in violation of the National Voter Registration Act, and threatening the state with possible legal action.
The coalition's letter included a stunning summary of evidence its members have been collecting, via face-to-face interviews at state public assistance offices, since October of last year, documenting that 75% of visitors to state public assistance offices are never asked if they would like to register to vote (in violation of the National Voter Registration Act), as well as that many North Carolina public assistance offices don't even stock voter registration application forms - evidence which both validates and offers an explanation for the registration collapse I reported here at Daily Kos.
That letter, in turn, elevated the story's prominence to a level attracting the attention of mainstream media, and in just four days the number of reports published by the state's major newspapers and TV stations has become too great for me to track (but a partial list can be found here).
Next, just yesterday (four days following this story's initial publication) NC-NAACP's Rev. Barber and a small army of civil rights attorneys appeared at Gov. McCrory's office in Raleigh and presented the governor's assistant with a dossier summarizing all of the evidence that has emerged to date, plus a sweeping public records request for all paper and electronic records related to National Voter Rights Act compliance. Following that submission Rev. Barber, NAACP's Al McSurely, and Democracy NC's Bob Hall held an 'emergency news conference' outside Gov. McCrory's office, outlining the story and NC-NAACP's response (including a possible request for an investigation by the U.S. Dept. of Justice). I was there, merely as a Gumpish witness to history. It was awe-inspiring, and believe me: these folks are as serious as a heart attack:
Events continue to evolve rapidly in this story, and new revelations keep coming. Just last night, Raleigh's WRAL TV reported the initial results of its own public records request in this matter:
When a group of voting rights advocates notified the state Department of Health and Human Services recently that North Carolina may not be living up to federal requirements that social services agencies help their clients register to vote, a spokeswoman indicated the department was surprised [....] That profession of surprise is a much different response than WRAL News received from the North Carolina State Board of Elections on Friday, where officials indicated that they were not only aware of the problem but said they had been prodding DHHS for years to address the issue. In response to a public records request by WRAL News, the State Board of Elections provided more than 60 emails and calendar entries dating to 2012 indicating there have been meetings and emails exchanged between DHHS' Division of Social Services and elections officials that focused on the problem.
WRAL News asked Lefebvre and DHHS Communications Director Kendra Gerlach to clarify the Friday statement. After 8 p.m. Monday, Gerlach responded that NC FAST makes links to voter registration available from its home screen.
That latter weak-kneed defense by DHHS - that it's new online public assistance application site, NC FAST, includes a link to a voter registration page - won't make this problem go away for McCrory. Poverty-level citizens are well-understood to have much more limited access to the internet than do other citizens, and the National Voter Registration Act specifically requires that public assistance agencies provide paper voter registration applications, and prescribes specific speech public assistance personnel must use to ask if applicants wish to register - requirements which have now been documented to have been ignored by the state Department of Health and Human Services for at least two years now.
Next up: look for Gov. McCrory to throw his Secretary of Health and Human Services, the controversial Dr. Aldona Wos, under the bus.

Activate the boost section before the rat section and drive the rat into awesome fuzz territory! Use the boost section to add that pure clean boost or drive your tubes harder!
With 11 teams owning either eight or nine wins as December arrives -- plus the eventual NFC South winner -- it's easy to presume this season's 12-team playoff field is largely in place as the season's final four weeks begin. But don't forget about all those 7-5 contenders, even if they are clumped in a very precarious position with the math not in their favor as the postseason push ratchets up to full throttle this month.
• NFL Week 13 Coverage Hub | NFL playoff picture entering Week 14
Baltimore linebacker Terrell Suggs had it exactly right on Monday; at 7-5, you're in must-win mode from here on out, with little or no margin for error. But that's not always a bad thing, is it? Four times already in this still-young century we've seen teams scratch their way to Super Bowl titles despite being no better than two games over .500 in December. That honor roll includes:
-- The 2001 Patriots were 7-5 after 12 games, but already in the midst of a nine-game season-ending winning streak that was capped by that Super Bowl upset of the Rams.
-- The 2005 Steelers were 7-5 and on the cusp of playoff-race elimination, then they won their final eight games to earn that long-awaited fifth ring.
-- The 2010 Packers were 8-6 in mid-December and on a two-game losing streak, but went on to win their next six games to capture another Lombardi Trophy.
-- And those stealthy 2011 Giants were a middling 6-6 and seemingly going nowhere after the 13th week of the season, and you know how that ended. With another parade down the Canyon of Heroes.
This season, there are a whopping seven still-believing teams that will take a 7-5 mark into Week 14, with six of them hailing from the jam-packed AFC, where 12 of the 16 teams are at .500 or better. Of those seven, most are in pretty rough shape, but they're not dead yet, even though only Miami would qualify (as the AFC's No. 6 seed) if the playoffs started today.
It's an interesting group of on-the-bubble 7-5 contenders. In Baltimore, San Francisco and Pittsburgh, there are three recent Super Bowl teams with first-hand knowledge of what it's like to make a meaningful late-season run. And then there are four other clubs that haven't tasted either the playoffs or a postseason victory in forever: Buffalo, Cleveland, Miami and Kansas City. Of that bunch, the Dolphins were the last team to win a playoff game, and that came in 2000.
Four weeks from now, who might emerge from this pack to make some playoff noise in January? Here's our assessment of the seven striving 7-5's, and who might be better or worse off after the close of Week 17:
• Miami -- Current position: AFC's 6th seed -- The Dolphins' gritty 16-13 comeback road win against the feeble Jets on Monday night was literally a season-saver. Miami would have been toast at 6-6, but the victory vaulted it all the way from the 11th seed in the AFC to the lucky No. 6 spot, where, thanks to the intricacies of the NFL's three-way tiebreaker rules, they somehow replaced a Chiefs team that soundly beat the Dolphins in South Florida in Week 3. Go figure.
The good news is Miami is starting to break new ground, with five wins in its past seven games, and its first winning mark at the start of December since 2008, when the Dolphins were also 7-5 en route to an 11-5, AFC East-winning season -- their most recent playoff trip. The bad news is, with a home game against fellow 7-5 Baltimore on tap this week, then a trip to top-seeded New England in Week 15, the Dolphins haven't accomplished anything yet. If they can at least split their next two games, then beat both the Vikings (5-7) and Jets (2-10) at home in Weeks 16-17, Miami should be alive in January. Then again, losing to inferior opponents in December is a trend with which Dolphins fans are familiar.
-- Projection: In the playoffs at 10-6, as the AFC's No. 5 seed.
• Kansas City -- Current position: AFC's 7th seed -- Can a team lose to the calamity known as the 2014 Raiders and still qualify for the playoffs? I checked with the league and am still waiting to hear back on that one. Come to think of it, can a team go without a touchdown pass to a wide receiver all season and still make the playoffs? Taken in tandem, those two “distinctions'' would seem to eliminate Kansas City from any further postseason consideration.
In reality, the Chiefs' fortunes shifted dramatically for the worse in the span of just a few hours in Week 13. At the start of the day, Kansas City was just a home win over struggling Denver away from being 8-4 and tied for first place in the AFC West. By the end of Sunday night, once the Chargers (8-4) had come back dramatically to win 34-33 at Baltimore and the Chiefs lost 29-16 to the Broncos (9-3), Kansas City was all but out of the division race, suddenly looking up at both San Diego and Denver. With tough games at Arizona (9-3) and at Pittsburgh (7-5) still remaining, plus a Week 17 home finale with San Diego, the Chiefs' playoff chances look like they're on life support. The streak of K.C. not making the postseason in consecutive years since 1993-94 is a great bet to continue.
-- Projection: 8-8 and misses the playoffs.
• Buffalo -- Current position: AFC's 8th seed -- Just by having a winning record and being in playoff contention, the Bills are already in strange and almost virgin territory by recent Buffalo standards. They haven't combined those two factors entering December since 2000, the final season of the team's Wade Phillips coaching era, and the year after their most recent playoff berth. So it's been a while and there might be the impulse to prematurely feel a little good about themselves. That is what coach Doug Marrone seemed to be pushing back against on Monday when he refused to look past this week's challenging trip to Denver: “You're way ahead of me,” he said. “I'm not looking at the last quarter [of the season] right now. I'm just looking at this upcoming game.”
I don't blame Marrone for keeping the blinders on. If the Bills look up right now, they may get dizzy from both their unaccustomed lofty heights, and the fact that Buffalo faces Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady in three of their final four games (as well as Oakland rookie Derek Carr). That's a tall task for any team, especially since three of those games are on the road. But the Bills' plight is made even tougher by their poor AFC record (4-5) and head-to-head losses to fellow wild-card contenders San Diego and Kansas City. The win over the Browns on Sunday helped, but for a Bills team that has been hanging around on the fringes of playoff contention all year -- never having a losing month or dropping below .500 -- it'll be a long and painful December.
-- Projection: 8-8 and misses the playoffs.

• San Francisco -- Current position: NFC's 8th seed -- The playoff picture is bleak in 49ers-ville, but the situation is not impossible if Jim Harbaugh's club gets some help. What San Francisco absolutely has to have is a collapse by a couple teams ahead of it in the race, be it Dallas, Detroit or even the suddenly vulnerable Arizona Cardinals. If two of those clubs go on a season-ending slide -- and I'd rate the Cowboys as most likely, then the Cardinals and Lions -- the 49ers could survive to make the postseason by winning at least three of their four remaining games. Possibly a 2-2 finish will even get San Francisco to January if the Cowboys went 0-4 or 1-3, because the 49ers win the head-to-head tiebreaker with Dallas on the strength of their Week 1 win in Arlington.
But with a trip to Seattle, plus home games against San Diego and Arizona still on the schedule, San Francisco's path to a fourth straight playoff berth is very narrow. The 49ers are just 1-3 in the NFC West, only 3-3 at home, and this is their worst 12-game record since 2010, the final year of the Mike Singletary coaching era. Tellingly, I think, Harbaugh's 12-game record has actually worsened each year, from 10-2 in 2011, to 8-3-1 in ‘12, to 8-4 in ‘13, and now 7-5. That's yet another sign that his time in San Francisco is probably at an end.
-- Projection: 9-7 and misses the playoffs.
• Baltimore -- Current position: AFC's 9th seed -- How critical was Week 13 in the AFC North? First-place Cincinnati barely survived at Tampa Bay and stayed as the AFC's No. 3 seed position, while the Ravens, Steelers and Browns all lost, sliding to a discouraging and desperate 9th, 10th and 11th in the conference. Baltimore had as many pangs of regret as anyone, somehow scoring 33 points at home but still losing to a Chargers team that put 21 fourth-quarter points on the scoreboard. That's why Suggs correctly noted that the Ravens have officially exhausted their room for error, with the home loss to San Diego negating the good Baltimore did itself with that road win at New Orleans in Week 12.
At this point of the year in the NFL, your outlook can change dramatically in a week, and that means the Ravens have every reason to believe they might be riding high again if they can go to Miami this week and pull the upset against the 6th-seeded Dolphins. Or barring that, Baltimore might still be playoff-worthy if it goes on a three-game winning streak to close the season, beating Jacksonville at home, Houston on the road, and Cleveland at home -- a feat that sounds manageable enough. With memories of 2012 still fresh in my head, I'm not remotely ready to count the Ravens out.
-- Projection: In the playoffs at 10-6, as the AFC's 6th seed.
• Pittsburgh -- Current position: AFC's 10th seed -- Having witnessed the Saints' dismantling of the Steelers at Heinz Field on Sunday -- and pay no mind to that wildly deceiving final score of 35-32 -- it's hard for me to imagine Mike Tomlin's club finding a winning sense of consistency and cohesion this late in the season. The Steelers have confounded from Week 1 on this year, blasting the Browns at home in the first half of the opener, then barely hanging on to win in the second half. And so it has gone, with Pittsburgh alternating wins and losses in its first six games, then winning three home games in a row to climb to 6-3, only to drop two of three games since, to the 1-8 Jets and the 4-7 Saints. Seven losses against teams with losing records since 2013 tells you a lot about these Steelers.
You'd like to think the franchise's winning pedigree would really help down the stretch, but that luster is starting to fade. Pittsburgh hasn't been to the playoffs since 2011, hasn't won a postseason game since beating the Jets in the 2010 AFC title game, and since their 2011 first-round playoff loss to Tim Tebow and Denver in overtime, the Steelers are a mediocre 23-22. This many gives you cause for hope if you're Pittsburgh: With two games left against the Bengals, it's still in your hands. Everything from the AFC North title to a wild-card berth is still in play. But realistically that makes this week's trip to Cincinnati do-or-die time.
-- Projection: 9-7 and misses the playoffs.
• Cleveland -- Current position: AFC's 11th seed -- There's a part of my brain that logically understands the Browns' possible quarterback switch from veteran Brian Hoyer to rookie Johnny Manziel, and then there's the part that wonders how many dreadful Cleveland teams of recent vintage would have killed to have a quarterback capable of leading them to a 7-5 record and December playoff contention? Granted, Hoyer hasn't played well the past three weeks and seems to be pressing. But what scenario offers the better odds: He rebounds and steadies himself down the stretch as the Browns take their best shot to reach the postseason, or Manziel -- who looked good on one drive against a Bills defense that had already pulled Mario Williams, Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams -- catches lightning in a bottle in the first four starts of his NFL career?
As rough as Hoyer has looked of late, the Browns might be messing with the decent amount of mojo they've had this season, in a year that no one had them fighting for a playoff spot to begin with. I'd stick with Hoyer, because I think the what-ifs will hurt even more if Manziel goes out there against the Colts and looks like a rookie quarterback for four quarters, basically ending the Browns' playoff dreams. I know what else will hurt in Cleveland this year: If it gets to Week 17 with the playoffs still a possibility, and then sees the old Browns (meaning the Ravens) eliminate the new Browns in a Week 17 loss in Baltimore.
-- Projection: 8-8 and misses the playoffs.
Molycorp, Inc. (NYSE: MCP) (“Molycorp” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000% senior secured notes due 2020 in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). The notes will be senior secured obligations of Molycorp and will be guaranteed by certain of Molycorp's subsidiaries. The gross proceeds from the offering of the senior secured notes will be placed into escrow pending the consummation of the proposed acquisition by the Company of Neo Material Technologies Inc. (“Neo”). Following release of the gross proceeds from escrow, the Company intends to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the Company's proposed acquisition of Neo, including related fees and expenses, and any remaining net proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes.
The senior secured notes and related note guarantees to be offered will not be and have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy such notes or note guarantees and is issued in accordance Rule 135c under the Securities Act.
With offices in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, Molycorp, Inc. is one of the world's leading rare earths and rare metals companies. Fully integrated across the rare earth mine-to-magnets supply chain, it currently produces rare earth oxides at its flagship rare earth mine and processing facility at Mountain Pass, California, as well as rare earth metals, rare earth alloys, and the rare metals niobium and tantalum. Through its joint venture with Daido Steel and Mitsubishi Corporation, Molycorp expects to begin manufacturing next-generation, sintered neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) permanent rare earth magnets in 2013. The rare earths and rare metals that Molycorp produces are critical inputs in existing and emerging applications including: clean energy technologies, such as hybrid and electric vehicles and wind power turbines; multiple high-tech uses, including fiber optics, lasers and hard disk drives; numerous defense applications, such as guidance and control systems and global positioning systems; advanced water treatment technology for use in industrial, military and outdoor recreation applications; and other technologies.
Every once in a while (and by that I mean at least once a week) a new piece of technology comes along that makes the older generation simply shit themselves with fear over its possible implications. And of all the crazy contraptions invented over the past 20 years, none has caused more widespread fear than the cellular telephone, or cell phone, as it is often called.
Originally conceived of as a mobile device to facilitate conversation with one's fellow man, the invention quickly evolved into a handheld computer capable of surfing the web, listening to music, and of course, making videos of our cats.
And texting. Who would have guessed that the magic of wireless phone conversation would be superseded by pinging monosyllabic phrases and icons to one another? We live in an age of wonder.
For good reason, the Iran nuclear agreement has been deeply unpopular and viewed with much skepticism since its signing in 2013.
Not only did the Obama administration negotiate the agreement without a guarantee Iran wouldn't eventually build a nuclear bomb, President Obama and his State Department approved a number of secret side deals that have been exposed in the aftermath of negotiations. One of those secret deals included $400 billion in cash sent to Tehran in the middle of the night on an airplane. When caught, the administration initially denied the transaction and then later admitted much of the untraceable cash would likely to go to terrorism. After all, Iran is the world's most prolific state-sponsor of terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah.
But now, we're learning more about the details of the Iran nuclear agreement and the threats it poses to the future of U.S. and global security. POLITICO is out with an astonishing report today detailing the terms of a last minute prisoner swap deal made by the Obama administration just days before President Obama left the White House. It included the release of terrorists previously held by the United States and worse, the administration essentially gave immunity to an Iranian operative who had smuggled parts needed to build a nuclear bomb into Iran from China. Bolding is mine:
When President Barack Obama announced the “one-time gesture” of releasing Iranian-born prisoners who “were not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses” last year, his administration presented the move as a modest trade-off for the greater good of the Iran nuclear agreement and Tehran's pledge to free five Americans. But Obama, the senior official and other administration representatives weren't telling the whole story on Jan. 17, 2016, in their highly choreographed rollout of the prisoner swap and simultaneous implementation of the six-party nuclear deal, according to a POLITICO investigation. In his Sunday morning address to the American people, Obama portrayed the seven men he freed as “civilians.” The senior official described them as businessmen convicted of or awaiting trial for mere “sanctions-related offenses, violations of the trade embargo.” In reality, some of them were accused by Obama's own Justice Department of posing threats to national security. Three allegedly were part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics with applications in surface-to-air and cruise missiles like the kind Tehran test-fired recently, prompting a still-escalating exchange of threats with the Trump administration. And in a series of unpublicized court filings, the Justice Department dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of them fugitives. Three of the fugitives allegedly sought to lease Boeing aircraft for an Iranian airline that authorities say had supported Hezbollah, the U.S.-designated terrorist organization. A fourth, Behrouz Dolatzadeh, was charged with conspiring to buy thousands of U.S.-made assault rifles and illegally import them into Iran. The biggest fish, though, was Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who had been charged with being part of a conspiracy that from 2005 to 2012 procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran via China. That included hundreds of U.S.-made sensors for the uranium enrichment centrifuges in Iran whose progress had prompted the nuclear deal talks in the first place.
Last week, the Trump State Department announced Tehran is holding up their end of the nuclear agreement and complying with requirements of the deal. However, the Trump administration is taking a hard look at the terms and plans to at least renegotiate a number of side deals and passes the Obama administration gave to the regime, particularly on the issue of terrorism.
"We're undergoing this inter-agency review. Part of this is to get the entire team to look at it as part of the next 90-days review that is required under the deal. So we will have recommendations that will be presented to the President on where the deal stands and how to act further," White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said last week about the review of the deal.
During a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in January, President Trump said the Iran deal was one of the worst he's ever seen.
"One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal. My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing -- I mean ever -- a nuclear weapon," Trump said.
As previously reported, Iran's nuclear research and ambitions continue.
The sentencing of two Hong Kong journalists by a Shenzhen court for running an illegal business has sparked new concerns for press freedom in the city.
Wang Jianmin and Guo Zhongxiao, who were behind two magazines – New-Way Monthly and Multiple Face – published in Hong Kong, were given jail sentences on Tuesday of five years and three months, and two years and three months, respectively. They were accused of sending the magazines to eight readers on the mainland – most of them friends of Wang – and making profit.
Lam Wing-kee, a Hong Kong bookseller who was detained for eight months on the mainland for the same accusation, said the case showed “the Chinese government is not only gradually restricting Hong Kong people's freedom of speech and of the press, it is destroying the One Country, Two Systems principle.”
‘Wastepaper'
“To defend our rights, Hong Kong must express its strong opposition. Otherwise, the Basic Law that protects Hong Kong people in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration would turn into wastepaper sooner or later,” he said in a statement.
Wang and Guo, both Hong Kong permanent residents, pleaded guilty at the trial last year. The magazines, published through a company only registered in Hong Kong, often reported the internal political struggles of the Chinese Communist Party.
Lam, of Causeway Bay Books, was one of the five booksellers who went missing last year before reappearing on the mainland. He was detained and “confessed” to running an illegal book posting business.
He decided to hold a surprise press conference revealing the details of his kidnapping, detention and forced confession by a Chinese special unit when he returned to Hong Kong.
‘Destructive effects'
The Independent Commentators Association and the Hong Kong Journalists Association said the case may silence vocal journalists across the border, as it was worrying that mainland authorities are selectively suppressing targeted publications and some sensitive information, striking a blow to Hong Kong's freedoms and the public's right to know.
The associations questioned what the standard was for certain publications being banned on the mainland, as many Hong Kong publications that have not been registered in China can still be circulated, some even through Chinese official channels.
They said the case of Causeway Bay Books and Hong Kong publisher Yiu Man-tin being jailed caused “destructive effects” on the publishing industry of Hong Kong.
“The mainland authorities clearly want to paralyse and block all operations of the targeted publications and their publishers,” the statement read.
The associations urged mainland authorities to respect One Country, Two Systems and the rule of law, and said that they should not use the law as an excuse to unreasonably suppress freedoms.
Yiu Man-tin, a Hong Kong publisher who had planned to publish the book China's Godfather, Xi Jinping, was arrested in Shenzhen in October 2013 for “smuggling ordinary goods.” In May 2014 he was sentenced to ten years in jail.
Johnny Lau Yui-siu, a veteran Chinese watcher, told RTHK that the case showed that a new prohibition on speech and press has been formed following the Causeway Bay Books incident and the takeover of the reformist Chinese magazine Yanhuang Chunqiu.
Wang's wife Xu Zhongyun, who helped send the magazines, was sentenced to a year in jail, suspended for two years. Liu Haitao, a freelance writer for the magazines, was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended for three years.
Story highlights Taran Killam, Jay Pharoah and Jon Rudnitsky will not return for the next season of SNL.
Killam and Pharoah had both been on the show for six seasons.

New Jersey is no stranger to geological anomaly. Most American rockhounds are familiar with the fluorescent minerals of Franklin and Sterling Hill, and thousands of people from around the globe have graced their collection cabinets with prehnite and other traprock minerals of the Watchung mountains, giving a classic “old school” scientific feel to that shelf of the display. New Jersey has also produced its fair share of paleontological specimens, including many holotypes and species completely new to science. Some of the most interesting finds include gem grade amber with insect inclusions from the Sayreville and Cliffwood Beach areas.
The amber occurs within the lignite peat layer above the deep deposits of the South Amboy Fire Clay. The New Jersey amber is the oldest in the Americas with insect inclusions. From this amber, researchers have discovered several new species of ants, including the oldest ones ever documented, giving new branches in the evolutionary line of ants. According to a paper by the American Museum of Natural History researchers, there are a dozen or more amber producing localities in and around Sayreville, but here will will focus on one. In the 1990's, this locality was monitored by the research department of the AMNH. This study accumulated hundreds of pounds of amber from the Sayreville area, including thousands of specimens with insect inclusions. This was a part of a grand study involving insects included in amber from all over the world. Through this research, many new species of insects were added to taxonomy. Did we mention there is pyrite too?

For tools, it is recommended to bring various shovels, picks, small metal rakes, and other digging and scraping apparatus. The porous, but thick and sandy clay behaves differently depending on how wet it is, so you may want to try a few different tools to figure out what works for you. Bring a small plastic vial or jar to keep your amber isolated and safe.
If you have nothing else, a nearly empty plastic water bottle with a bit of liquid left in it will keep your amber safe, and clean it up a bit too.
In my experience, most of the pyrite is found on the surface, and appears to form due to the iron and sulfur nucleating in the center of the puddles in the cracked clay mud. The pyrite is mostly unstable, and will quickly lose its luster and begin to disintegrate if special precautions are not taken. The main key is to keep it completely dry. I have heard that putting it in a cool oven can help remove all moisture. I have used 3-in1 oil to give them a day dip, and take them out to dry. After the pyrite nodule is dry, apply a few layers of spray acrylic. Unfortunately, only a few of my specimens have held up to this point, but they are unique items in our inventory. Some post-pyrite secondaries seem to be found in microcrystals on some of the pyrites as they alter in the weather. Melanterite and jarosite may be present. More research needs to be done on the pyrite alteration at this locality.
The amber can be founded in small rounded grains along the surface. If you are looking for the large pieces with insect inclusions, you'll have to dig. The lignite layer is a few feet down (I have heard anywhere from 4 to 9 feet subsurface). Lignite is the precursor to coal, and looks almost exactly like burnt wood. When you get down to this level, you are on the right track. In and around the lignite, you should be able to find evidence of amber soon enough. A nice sized piece with an insect inclusion could be the reward for your hard work.
Plant matter within the amber has been found to be in the juniper family. The lignite peat deposits were probably formed by ancient coastal cedar swamps. The age of this amber has been recorded from 90-92 million years old, in the midst of the Cretaceous Period. Amazing that something so fragile can still exist! This is one of, if not the ONLY locality that produces amber from the same time as the dinosaurs. If Jurassic Park was to happen, we would be thanking New Jersey amber for the DNA. Some of the forms are stalactitic, showing evidence of where it dripped from the tree. It is remarkable to find such objects. Some of the amber is opaque and looks like tan to brown wood opal, with similar luster and conchoidal fracture. The amber ranges from a yellow-hued honey color to a rich cherry red, and can also be brown. It is transparent when wet or polished, making for a beautiful finished product when worked. One gentleman has told me that if you have a big and stable enough piece, it can be polished with a toothbrush and toothpaste- but it takes quite a while. I have a specimen he polished this way in my personal collection. It is almost an inch tall and has a distinct and complete winged insect inclusion. It is one of the treasures of my New Jersey collection.
To get there, plug in Lakeview Drive Sayreville, NJ into your GPS. When you get on this road, you will be in an apartment complex. Keep following to the end of the road, and park in the little cul-de-sac conveniently located at the trail head. The trail may look enticing, but avoid it unless you plan on exploring for possible separate amber pits. On the left side of the path, climb up the hill right next to the parking area and cross the railroad tracks. You'll come to the other side where there is a trail. Make a left onto the trail, soon the terrain will flatten. Walk a few hundred feet down, and look for a dip in the brush on the right side. It is crude getting in to the pits, and ticks can be plentiful- use caution.
Ramble through the deer trails- a shovel or sifter can act as a shield through the thicket. Out in this stretch of bush you'll reach the mud pits, dotted with amber and pyrite to the discerning eye. You may want to check a satellite view on Google Earth for a precise look at the field.
For lunch, I recommend White Castle in Parlin- new veggie burgers are delish! Good luck, and email me if you find anything substantial! Paul Cyr- eonphader@hotmail.com – you can also find Paul and his minerals for sale on Facebook – at the Deep Seeded Trading Post

GENEVA, 31 March (UNHCR) - The UN refugee agency on Tuesday expressed increasing concern that people needing international protection were being blocked from entering the European Union, citing the deaths of two Iraqi men who were in a group of 12 Yazidi people allegedly beaten by Bulgarian border guards.
"With few legal alternatives to enter the European Union, many people fleeing conflict and persecution are undertaking increasingly dangerous journeys and using smugglers to reach safety," William Spindler, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing.
"It is deeply disturbing that people in search of international protection are being turned away, often with violence. EU member states at the external border need to ensure that these practices stop, and should conduct independent and transparent investigations into allegations of abuses and illegal practices in their border regions."
The statement followed a recent incident in which UNHCR was told 12 Iraqis belonging to the Yazidi minority were stopped by Bulgarian border guards as they tried to enter from Turkey. The Iraqis had their belongings seized and were badly beaten.
The group scattered and two of the men, suffering from severe injuries, died later of hypothermia on the Turkish side of the border. According to the reports, a third person was taken in a critical condition to a hospital in Edirne after Turkish authorities were alerted.
"UNHCR urges the authorities in Bulgaria and Turkey to investigate this grave incident," Spindler said. "We are particularly disturbed by the accounts of brutality which may have contributed to the deaths of two people who, being members of the persecuted Yazidi community, were likely to have been refugees."
Information gathered by UNHCR in 2014 indicated that people seeking international protection often attempted to cross the border into Bulgaria multiple times, but had to turn back because of bad weather, were abandoned by people smugglers paid to take them across the border, or were intercepted by Turkish authorities.
Many, however, reported being denied entry or being "pushed back" by Bulgarian border guards. "Push-backs" are not in conformity with Bulgaria's obligations to admit asylum-seekers to their territory. The use of violence has also been reported and, in many cases, people say their money and property were confiscated by border police.
Bulgaria is planning to add 82 kilometres of razor-wire fences to an existing 33-kilometre fence constructed in 2014 in response to increased irregular arrivals, the majority from Syria. Efforts to reduce the number of irregular arrivals and asylum-seekers in Bulgaria had a significant effect in 2014, with almost 50 percent less arrivals than the previous year.
According to Bulgarian authorities, over 38,500 people attempted to cross irregularly the Bulgaria-Turkey border in 2014. Some 6,000 of them - mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis - reached Bulgaria. This is a significant drop from11, 500 irregular arrivals -- out of over 16,700 attempts -- registered in 2013.
"Limited access to border posts, combined with more fences and "push-backs," are leaving asylum-seekers with very few options," Spindler said. UNHCR has received emergency calls from people, mostly Syrians, who walked for days in harsh weather in remote areas to try to reach Bulgaria.
"Erecting fences and creating more barriers instead of providing additional legal avenues to reach safety in the EU pushes people in need of international protection into increasingly dangerous situations with, sometimes, fatal consequences," he said.
Elsewhere, UNHCR has raised concerns over reports of border practices that could place refugees and migrants at risk, notably in Greece, where UNHCR has documented numerous accounts of "push-backs" at the land and sea borders with Turkey, especially in the last two years.
Spindler said UNHCR will make recommendations to the new Greek government about improving various refugee-related protection issues, including management of the country's borders that takes into account the protection needs of refugees and asylum-seekers.

Verizon Appeals FCC Imposition of 'Net Neutrality' Rules
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Verizon Communications on Friday (Sept. 30) filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of the Federal Communications Commission's December 2010 Report and Order (FCC 10-201) adopting so-called "net neutrality" rules.

BBtv -- David Byrne: Playing the Building
In today's edition of Boing Boing tv, music legend David Byrne transforms an entire NYC building into a giant musical instrument, and Xeni joins him inside for a BBtv tour.
Playing the Building is Byrne's latest sonic innovation, and morphs the century-old Battery Maritime Building into a clanging, vibrating sound sculpture. In this installation, the former Talking Heads co-founder blurs the boundaries between the creators and consumers of culture. He explains:
Devices [have been] attached to the building's structure – to the metal beams and pillars, the heating pipes, the water pipes – and are used to make these things produce sound. The activations are of three types: wind, vibration, striking. The devices cause the building elements to vibrate, resonate and oscillate so that the building itself becomes a very large musical instrument.
Byrne sees music as deeply embedded within the natural sounds that surround us every day, and believes "anyone can be a writer, artist, or musician if they want to."
Playing the Building continues through August 10, 2008 at 10 South Street, New York, NY; open every Friday through Sunday, noon - 6pm. Admission is free of charge.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The judge presiding over the Trayvon Martin shooting case on removed herself Wednesday after the attorney for defendant George Zimmerman argued she had a possible conflict of interest that related to her husband.
Judge Kenneth M. Lester Jr. will preside over the case. The next judge who would be in the court rotation, John D. Galluzzo, also cited a conflict, so Lester was selected, according to a news release from the court.
Florida Circuit Judge Jessica Recksiedler had said she would make a decision by Friday, when a bond hearing for Zimmerman had previously been set. Her husband works with Orlando attorney Mark NeJame, who was first approached by Zimmerman's family to represent the neighborhood watch volunteer.
But NeJame declined and referred them to Mark O'Mara, who is now representing Zimmerman. NeJame has since been hired by CNN to comment on the case.
Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder for the Feb. 26 shooting of the 17-year-old Martin. Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self-defense after Martin attacked him. Martin was unarmed.
Galluzzo said he had a conflict because of his personal and business relationship with O'Mara.
O'Mara said he requested that Recksiedler step down now because the case is just beginning. Recksiedler was assigned the case after Zimmerman's arrest last week.
The European Commission has indicated it will resist attempts by France to tighten EU border security, after it emerged that foreign fighters have as little as a one per cent chance of being caught when returning from overseas.
Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU Commissioner for migration, insisted that no change is necessary to the current border code that says EU passport holders should be subject to the “minimum checks” when they enter Europe from the Middle East or elsewhere.
The Paris attacks and the apparent ease with which terrorists moved to and from Syria and then from Belgium into France with weapons in their cars, has raised serious questions about the viability of the Schengen system – questions dismissed by Mr Avramopoulos.
“Schengen is not the problem. We are not intent to open a debate on Schengen's future. Schengen is the greatest achievement of European integration,” he said, “If we put Schengen into question, it is a back-track on European integration. We shall not permit it.”
France has demanded that EU passport holders are subject to the same “systematic” checks as those from outside the EU in order to halt the return of foreign fighters.
That includes cross-referencing them against the Schengen Information System, a watchlist designed to catch criminals, stolen passports and suspected terrorists. The database contains the names of 4,000 foreign fighters deemed a terrorist threat.
Every non-EU citizen must undergo an SIS check when they enter the Schengen bloc.
'If this cannot be agreed now, after what happened in Paris, then when can it be?' French diplomatic source
But under the current code, EU passport holders should not be subject to SIS checks, and instead subject to a "rapid and straightforward" check that their passport is theirs, in date and not a forgery. That can be nothing more than a cursory visual inspection.
Even when EU passports are scanned on entry, they are only randomly checked against the SIS database to avoid the checks becoming 'systematic', and therefore in breach of the code, it is understood.
The Commission's apparent rejection of French demands for all EU nationals to be fully screened on entry to the EU sets up a showdown at Friday's emergency meeting of EU home ministers in Brussels.
“We will definitely be pushing for these measures – as we were after Charlie Hebdo,” said a French diplomatic source, “If this cannot be agreed now, after what happened in Paris, then when can it be?”
The French are also demanding, by the end of the year, the EU-wide adoption of the Passenger Name Records or PNR system that allows intelligence services to track the travel-patterns of individuals through the mass collection of airline data.
The Commission has said it intends to finalise work on a new EU directive for PNR by the end of the year, but has already ruled out the its use on trains or ferries.
French diplomatic sources added that France is adamant that the system, in order to be effective, must be used inside the EU and not just on passengers entering from outside – a controversial change that will require amendment of EU legislation.
The EU's own rules render the SIS database effectively useless at halting criminals or would-be jihadists who have an an EU passport, or a sophisticated forgery.
The Telegraph revealed how the terrorists suspected of the Paris atrocity were able to travel between Syria and Belgium without being caught due to lax checks.
On average in Europe, 10-20 per cent of EU passports are cross-referenced against SIS, with some countries checking as few as one per cent, EU officials told the Telegraph.
Asked repeatedly whether he backed the French plans, Mr Avramopoulos said countries should submit more data to SIS, but indicated he saw no grounds for tightening the "minimum" regime for EU passports, claiming that systematic checks are “already” in place.
He insisted: “The Schengen Borders Code already provides all the tools for effective checks of external borders.”
The opposition is essentially ideological: some senior members of the Commission think that the right to enter and leave Europe with only a visual inspection of a passport is as much a part of free movement as the ability to travel freely between Schengen states.
Pressed again on whether he supported French demands for universal background checks to prevent the movement of foreign fighters, he said that is “up to France” – suggesting no EU-wide action.
All of the Paris gunmen identified so far are believed to have been either French or Belgian, and at least three travelled to Syria before committing mass-murder in Paris.
Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind, boasted of how he had travelled back and forth from Syria to his Belgian home several times as he plotted mass-murder.
He told an Isil magazine that a border guard failed to recognise him despite being hunted by intelligence agencies and his photograph being broadcast in the news.
Samy Amimour, the Bataclan suicide bomber, was put on the watchlist after trying to travel to Yemen in 2012. But he was still able to travel to Syria a year later, triggering an international warrant for his arrest, before sneaking back to France to commit mass murder.
Ayoub el-Khazzani, the terrorist behind the botched gun attack on a Thalys high speed train this summer, was also on the SIS list but is believed to have travelled to Syria and criss-crossed Europe with impunity.

Be careful what you write on social networking sites.
That's the recent message from a California appellate court. Those who post on MySpace cannot assert invasion of privacy claims if their words are republished in a newspaper without consent.
The case, California's first on the issue, concerns a University of California student who ranted on her MySpace account about how much she hated her hometown of Coalinga in the Central Valley. The Coalinga Record, the local newspaper, published Cynthia Moreno's "Ode." She sued the paper for invasion of privacy after members of the local community allegedly ran her family out of town and threatened to kill them.
The state appeals court, however, ruled she had no privacy rights to her internet speech.
"Here, Cynthia publicized her opinions about Coalinga by posting the Ode on MySpace.com, a hugely popular internet site," the 5th District Court of Appeal wrote. "Cynthia's affirmative act made her article available to any person with a computer and thus opened it to the public eye. Under these circumstances, no reasonable person would have had an expectation of privacy regarding the published material."
However, the court said the woman could sue for infliction of emotional distress. Those allegations target the principal of the local high school who forwarded the MySpace essay to the newspaper for publication.
Cynthia Moreno's family received death threats and a shot was fired at the family home, forcing the family to move out of Coalinga last year, according to the court. Due to severe losses, the father closed the 20-year-old family business.
The principal who forwarded the rant to the newspaper, according to court records, was Roger Campbell. Cynthia Moreno's little sister was attending the school when the letter was published.
"We believed he foresaw there would be a serious reaction to this," the Moreno family attorney, Paul Kleven, said in an interview. The principal's attorney was not immediately available for comment.
The court also ruled the local paper, which published Cynthia Moreno's diatribe in the letter's section, had a First Amendment right to publish the MySpace essay.

What was basically inevitable after the March 15 primaries, when Hillary Clinton won all five contested states, is now all but official: Bernie Sanders, progressive insurgent candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, has lost. New York was the death knell—he needed to win the state, and he lost handily. Only the die-hards are still professing belief now, and that belief has crossed the line from “optimistic” to “delusional.”
There's only one way Bernie Sanders wins this thing, and that's if one of Hillary's dozens of scandals actually materializes into something disastrous. But the Clintons have been playing damage control on scandals for their entire political lives, and the odds that they'll falter now, at the most critical hour, seem very, very small. Barring that sort of collapse, Bernie is buried—he's too far behind in the popular vote and pledged delegate counts, and it's about to get worse next week when Clinton runs the table (or comes very close) in the rest of the northeastern states.
So, there's the elegy for his campaign straight from the mouth of a fervent supporter. I felt discouraged after March 15, but knew that if he won New York, the entire picture could change. He didn't win. He didn't come close. He didn't even meet his soft target of 45 percent. Black voters destroyed him in the city, just as they destroyed him in the southeast at the start of the primary season, and Hillary's coalition of minorities and women and old people held strong, while the young people that give Sanders his edge didn't turn out in the huge numbers needed to reverse the outcome. This is an acknowledgement of defeat.
That being said, Bernie Sandersneeds to stay in the race. Even with no hope of overall victory, he must march on through California. And the reason is simple: For the first time in decades, the American people have a chance to vote for a progressive politician, and to be at the vanguard of what hopefully becomes a lasting movement. Bernie skeptics have often said that his campaign is more about an idea than a candidate, and while I believe that his success refuted that point for some time—you don't win 16 states and counting without posing a real threat to the frontrunner—it's now factually true. The Sanders campaign has ceased to be about the 2016 presidential election, and is now about the future of the progressive movement.
There have been calls in some corners for Sanders to abandon the race, endorse Hillary, and unite the Democratic party ahead of the general election. This type of demand inevitably comes from those who never understood the Sanders campaign in the first place, and vaguely resented his ideals, and who tend to say things like, “from a policy perspective, there's no difference between the two!”
Which is so agonizingly wrong. There are plenty who disagree, but for those of us who know in our hearts that Clinton is a free-trade war-hawk corporatist who co-opted enough of Bernie's views to neutralize him in the primary but who will drop them like hot garbage the minute it's expedient, this false equivalency is essentially heresy. I'm not going to get into the argument on a deeper level, since anyone who follows politics closely from either side has already been convinced, but believe me when I say that the Sanders coalition doesn't now, and won't ever, believe that the two candidates are the same.
Voters in all 50 states deserve the chance to vote for a progressive future. Sure, that vote is now symbolic. But they won't have the chance to do it in November, and as the figurehead of progressivism, Bernie owes them that chance. He owes the Democratic party, which has done its best to screw him over from the start, absolutely nothing. And even if he did, it's not within his power to unite us. His campaign has been about revealing the deep hypocrisy of the so-called people's party, and now that it's been laid bare, there is no going back. The Clintons have taken to the trenches to beat him, and he fought back (too late and too tepidly, in my opinion), and the idea of rapprochement is absurd. These people hate each other, and guess what? They should! Their policies are in diametric opposition.
After Hillary Clinton loses the general election, or wins and plods through a miserable four-year term, the time will come when progressive candidates have a real chance to win. The local and state races won't feature huge national celebrities, or identity politics, or the machinations of the party elite and a pro-establishment media. As Bernie himself has said, real change has to come from the ground up, and when looked at from this perspective, his candidacy has always been about shining a light on the alternative path. He was never going to change things from the top down, and perhaps in time his supporters will understand that a Sanders victory wouldn't have been good for the movement.
If progressivism is going to sweep the country, it has to start at the grassroots. What Bernie has done, in a candidacy that is headed toward a loss, is to paint the possibilities. The democratic-socialist ideas he's been advocating no longer seem so far-fetched, and that's a profound change of perspective for a country that has been embroiled in conservatism for 40 years. We needed to see this—we still need to see this, in all 50 states.
And that's why Bernie must press on to the bitter end. There's a famous Greek proverb that says, “a society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.” Sometimes it's hard to see a person's true purpose in the heat of battle, when everything becomes about wins and losses, but Bernie has been planting those seeds from the beginning. He may never see the fruits of his labor, but he knows what's coming, and it's his job now to spread the message to every corner of this country. His legacy, and the legacy of his ideas, belong to the future. That is a more important mission by far than uniting a broken party of the past.
Q.​The individual is asking what is your advice for brothers who wear shirts, ties and suits when they have the ability to wear thobes?
A.​ The shaykh mentioned if that person is in a society where this is the norm in the society the wearing of ties, suits, shirts etc then it is permissible for that person to do so. But if the individual wants to pray then he should beautify himself with his clothing as Allaah tabaarakta wa ta'alaa mentions in the Qur'aan: ‘O children of Aadam, beautify yourselves at the time of prayer'. So when an individual prays he should wear the best of clothing. But if the individual for example would like to wear these suits, shirts, ties and pants because it is easier for him to perform his duties then it is permissible for him to do so. But if he begins to feel that he is imitating the disbelievers and this intention becomes apparent, that the individual starts to imitate the disbelievers then it is not permissible for him to wear this type of clothing.
Q.​Yaa shaykh if the individual has the ability to wear a thobe?
A.​The shaykh mentioned (hafithahullAllaahu ta'alaa) that the person if he has the ability to wear a thobe then that is befitting. But likewise the individual should try not to be different.
Shaykh Saalih Muhammad al-Luhaydaan (May Allaah preserve him)

I set out to write this for designers building their own portfolios, but a lot of this advice could be handy for other types of websites too. Much of it is familiar material for seasoned designers but I imagine myself as a young graduate and this kind of thing might have been helpful as a checklist. So here goes.

Also, you don't need to fancy-up your work by photographing it on screens and at an angle. That makes me think you're not confident that the work can stand on its own. Just show it, full-resoluation and with live links if you can.

That makes me think you're not confident that the work can stand on its own. Just show it, full-resoluation and with live links if you can. It's not terrible to use a template. I can usually tell when you've used one, and all that means is that I focus in a little more on the work (which is a good thing). Just don't let the template design get in the way of your own designs. It should be neutral and quiet and if you've paid good money for it, it had better work on mobile!

As long as it's easy to share with colleagues and meets some of the above criteria, I'd love to see your work in whatever form you can provide.
When choosing what work to include
Show your versatility. If you can design with many different styles, show me. If you have a hidden talent for designing logos in addition to your UI chops, show me.

Show your process; write a wee bit. Show sketches. So few people do this, it shocks me, and always stands out when I see it.
Show sketches. So few people do this, it shocks me, and always stands out when I see it. I think it kind of okay to show old work if you place it in context , i.e. clearly label it from 2010 and call out what still makes it special. The reasons I say ‘kind of' is because it makes me wonder what you'd been doing between 2010 and 2015, and often the aesthetic is so out-dated that it is hard to assess generously. It's your portfolio though, and your call.

I'd say, depending on the depth to which you show them. Show more if you'd like but make sure you're proud of every piece. What about work done under NDAs? I wouldn't include them. They're awkward. If you really want to show me you can screenshare during an interview but most of the time I'd rather skip the password and look at work that's open.
About sections
Should you include one? Sure, I like to know a little more about who we may hire, but you don't have to go into a lot of detail. I definitely think you should not include a picture of yourself. It makes me deeply uncomfortable to know that seeing a photo of an applicant might bring out some kind of subconscious bias I might have. A colleague of mine and I have talked about going a step further and eliminating names from applications to make them truly blind; I'm not sure how that would work with design applicants given folks' personalized portfolios, but I'd sure love to see it happen eventually.
Blogs
Should you have one? Probably. How else do you think and share and communicate and work openly?!? Definitely not a requirement, but I like seeing the extra effort put into this when possible, even and especially if they are really short posts about things that inspire you or make you think. That said, blog because you want to blog, not because you want to back-fill an empty shell of a blog you pretended to maintain over 2014. I will find out eventually! You could probably substitute the word ‘blog' with any other social media platform. Mostly for me this is about understanding your values and how you think.

OMAHA, Neb. — The first film session of the season came Thursday morning, a group heart-to-heart about what Nuggets coach Michael Malone liked and didn't like through the first half of a one-week training camp.
It was about 20 clips of offense and 20 more of defense, Malone said.
Offensively it was “ball movement, spacing and what good offense means, and the types of shots we want in our offense,” Malone said. “As opposed to poor shot selection and poor offense.”
Defensively the focus was “reinforcing the positive things that we're doing but also addressing the things that maybe we're not comprehending that we should be,” he said.

Malone's view of the progress his team has made on both ends has ebbed and flowed a bit over the first few days. Take this assessment of the offense: “The thing that's really encouraging and we had it in the first practice – (Wednesday) night didn't have it as much, thought there were too many turnovers, too much dribbling and everyone trying to make the play. What I liked about practice one and practice No. 5, which was this morning, was making a play for your teammate, just being unselfish. I think we've had some great, great examples of unselfish offense where no one cares who is making the shot, we're just playing together.”
And of the defense: “Defensively, I think we're doing a pretty good job for early in the camp, of communicating. We have a lot of versatility that allows us to guard things in different ways, and guys are picking things up pretty quickly, so I'm happy about that as well.”
Three players were held out of practice for precautionary reasons – center Jusuf Nurkic and guards Jamal Murray and Malik Beasley. The Nuggets had just one scheduled practice Thursday, the first time this week they have not had a two-a-day.
Saracens will face Newcastle Falcons in Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) next season after Newcastle Falcons and Premiership Rugby confirmed that the fixture will take place on Saturday 16 September, at the home of Major League Soccer (MLS) side Philadelphia Union: the Talen Energy Stadium.
The fixture, which will be classed as a Newcastle Falcons ‘home' league game, will be the second time Saracens have headed Stateside for an Premiership Rugby fixture following the success of the inaugural Premiership Rugby regular season match played in the United States between London Irish and Saracens last March at New York's Red Bull Arena.
Saracens CEO Heath Harvey said: “Our recent experiences in the USA show that there's a strong appetite for our game across the Atlantic and Saracens are very keen to do what we can to continue to grow the game of rugby in the United States. The fixture at the Talen Energy Stadium also presents an opportunity for Saracens to continue to build strong links in the USA, with the Club having already played Stateside in 2016 and having a presence in the country with Seattle Saracens as one of our nine Global Network sides."
Harvey added: “We're very excited that Saracens will be at the forefront of yet another innovation to help grow our wonderful game.”
Ticket Information: Tickets for the match will go on sale on 20 June. Fans can now register for exclusive news and ticket updates at premiershiprugbyusa.com
Tim Draper Business Insider Over the weekend, billionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins caused controversy when he said that the way activists and progressives in San Francisco are starting to treat the super rich reminds him of how the Nazis treated the Jews.
His comments were met with near-universal scorn.
However, famed venture capitalist Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, tells us that Perkins is a "brilliant" man, who has identified a real problem - "schadenfreude, something that continues to be a thorn in humanity's side."
"The bitter taste of envy brings us all down," says Draper. Draper's full quote is below.
Draper is a very successful venture capitalist, perhaps best known for his firm's investments in Hotmail and Chinese search engine Baidu. Lately, he's become an activist for better government in California.
Here's the letter that Perkins wrote in the Wall Street Journal:
Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its "one percent," namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the "rich."
From the Occupy movement to the demonization of the rich embedded in virtually every word of our local newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, I perceive a rising tide of hatred of the successful one percent. There is outraged public reaction to the Google buses carrying technology workers from the city to the peninsula high-tech companies which employ them. We have outrage over the rising real-estate prices which these "techno geeks" can pay. We have, for example, libelous and cruel attacks in the Chronicle on our number-one celebrity, the author Danielle Steel, alleging that she is a "snob" despite the millions she has spent on our city's homeless and mentally ill over the past decades.
This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent "progressive" radicalism unthinkable now?
This letter upset lots of people, including those who work at the venture capital firm that bears Perkins's name, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers.
In a tweet, KPCB said: "Tom Perkins has not been involved in KPCB in years. We were shocked by his views expressed today in the WSJ and do not agree."
After the news broke, we emailed Draper to draw his attention to Perkins's comment and the subsequent fallout.
Here is what Draper said to us, in full:
On Tom Perkins, he is a brilliant man, and he is identifying schadenfreude, something that continues to be a thorn in humanity's side. The bitter taste of envy brings us all down. I like to celebrate the wealth and success of great heroes like Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Larry Ellison. I think it makes us all better to strive to be better and brighter. … and I like a good bus. If our government focused on providing the kind of service to its constituents that Google provides its employees, I wouldn't have to initiate SixCalifornias.info.
Draper is referring to his plan to split California into six states - states that he believes would be run by governments that are more responsive to the local needs of their citizens. We're posting a video on that plan later today.
Draper came into the Business Insider newsroom a couple weeks ago, and we asked him about the backlash against Silicon Valley wealth. We asked him: Why do people hate Silicon Valley?
Here's what he said:

You hear it all the time: “Cops aren't mental health professionals or doctors or social workers.”
While that might be true, technically speaking, there are a ton of officers, deputies, and troopers that manage to do things like to deliver babies, handle emotionally disturbed persons, and defuse potentially violent family disputes.
In Pennsylvania, for instance, two cops helped deliver a baby in the back of the parents' car recently.
Jayce, thanks to two officers, is the newest edition to the Diaz family.
“It just felt crazy. It was like a whirlwind. Like a movie. I just never thought this would happen to us,” Jennifer Diaz of Quakertown, Pennsylvania, said.
It was close to midnight when Jennifer knew it was time to go the hospital. The contractions were intense.
Jennifer and her husband, Matt, got in the car and headed towards Doylestown Hospital. They were in the car for just five minutes when Jennifer's water broke.
“She said, ‘My water broke.' And she started to scream and I've never heard her scream like this before and she said, ‘He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.' So I called 911 and pulled over in a parking lot,” Matt said.
Enter Officer Robert Compton of Bedminster Township Police and Chief Brian Lehman of Dublin Borough.
These are the guys you hope and pray are around for this kind of thing.
“I knew it was imminent immediately when the baby was crowning. This was definitely going to happen and the ambulance wasn't going to get here,” Chief Lehman said.
“She had pushed at one point and the head then came out and then after a few minutes, then had pushed more, and the baby came out. I literally had to catch it,” Officer Compton told ABC 16 News.
“Officer Compton came out and he laid Jayce on her chest. He said, ‘Well, I guess this is a good time to introduce myself. My name is Bob. Congratulations.' So it was awesome,” Matt said.
The Diaz family couldn't be more grateful.
“Very thankful,” an understandably exhausted Jennifer said.
When Matt, Jennifer, and Jayce were loaded safely in the ambulance and off to the hospital, the two cops got a coffee. They had a minute or two to discuss the thrill of helping deliver a baby before they went back to work.
The Cleveland Cavaliers have suffered a downright horrible season in 2013-14, going from postseason hopefuls to 10th-place outsiders working through some serious organizational issues. This season hasn't gone nearly as well as planned, even if they technically retain a chance at one of the downtrodden East's final playoff berths.
Yet every cloud has a silver lining, and last week the Cavs brought us one of the coolest visual experiences seen in the NBA this year. As part of the franchise's celebration and jersey retirement ceremony for beloved center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the team unveiled a new 3D projection system for the court at Quicken Loans Arena. The result is pretty incredible (via All Ball via Deadspin):
Scroll to continue with content Ad
The display has several aspects of typical video board packages, like highlights from this year's team and days of franchise past, but the experience is totally different. The 3D projection is reminiscent of some material from the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Sochi last month, though not quite as blatantly artistic. It's a full-on show, not just an introduction to a basketball game.
Of course, given the play of the Cavs this season, that might be a good thing. Perhaps lottery participants have found a new toy to distract fans from all the sad sights usually found on the same court.

D:GameVFS is a (very) minimal virtual file system library for game development. https:// github.com/ kiith-sa/ D-GameVFS I updated D:GameVFS to work with DMD 2.066 and put it on DUB. There are no major changes, just a bunch of small features I added over time as I use it. Note that at this point this isn't hugely useful. The only VFS backend that is implemented is... plain FS (I expect to implement a zip backend once I need it), the main useful feature is directory stacking (i.e. treating files in multiple directories as if they were one directory, where files from directories up the stack override those from directories below). As always, the API is not stable.

Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola says the city will be shutting down Power Ultra Lounge following a mass shooting that left 28 people injured. (KATV photo)
Little Rock city leaders gathered at a press conference Saturday following a mass shooting at a downtown club that left 28 people injured.
A barrage of gunfire broke out around 2:30 a.m. inside Power Ultra Lounge on 6th Street during a performance by rapper Finese 2Tymes. Authorities say all 28 victims will survive.
"We will be shutting [Power Ultra Lounge] down, absolutely," Mayor Mark Stodola told the media. "This activity downtown is going to cease."
Little Rock City Manager Bruce Moore said Power Ultra Lounge is actually zoned as a restaurant and doesn't have a permit to operate as a special events center.
Mayor Stodola also said the manager of the property where Power Ultra Lounge operates says he will be issuing an eviction notice to the operators of the business.
Alcoholic Beverage Control has suspended the mixed drink permit for Power Ultra Lounge, effective Saturday.
According to officials, alcohol is not supposed to be served at Power Ultra Lounge past 2 a.m.
"We felt the emergency action was required to preserve public health and safety," ABC officials told Channel 7.
Power Ultra Lounge has been cited for 14 violations and action against them was taken seven times since 2012.
Out of those 14 violations, some were for underage drinking, according to the ABC.
Channel 7 reached out to Power Ultra Lounge's owner by phone. The owner's mother tells KATV her son is "shook up" and no statements will be given.
ABC has released the following statement:
We will exercise the authority granted us under the law to preserve and safeguard the public safety. We feel the events which are alleged to have occurred warrant our decision to suspend liquor sales at this location pending further action by the board.
The director of ABC has cited the following potential violations:
Section 1- "Failure to be a good neighbor"
Section 1- "Allowing Possession of Weapons on the Premises"
Section 3- "Disorderly Conduct"
According to the DFA the Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforcement is investigating the events and says additional citations may be issued.

When you look up at the night sky, what do you see? If you're reading this post from a city, chances are you don't see very much. Whereas more than half of the UK enjoyed truly dark sky in the 1950s, only 10% do today. And it's a similar situation across the urbanised world. The culprit? Light pollution from poorly designed and excessive lighting.
Though lighting cities has economic and social benefits, poorly designed lighting comes at a cost. In addition to tainting our view of the milky way, light pollution has a negative impact on wildlife, affecting the migration of birds and the breeding patterns of nocturnal animals and insects. There are more downsides for us humans too – inefficient lighting costs the UK £1bn a year as well disrupting our sleeping patterns (I'm not sure which is worse!)
So what can be done? Truthfully, reducing light pollution is a pretty straightforward task:
1. Install motion sensitive lighting
If a tree falls in the forest and there's no one around to hear it, does it… ok, let's not go there. But when there's no one in the street, do we need street lighting? Motion sensitive street lighting is a pretty self explanatory idea, and one that has become reality on this Barcelona street. Lights come on as people and moving objects approach, illuminating an area in advance, therefore reducing the amount of wasted light emitted from the street. Deployed across an entire city, the results could be impressive.
2. Ensure bulbs are covered and lighting faces downwards
Good street lighting should feature a bulb which is encased above and to the sides. These channels light downwards – where it is needed – and reduces the amount of wasted light. Known as ‘cutting off light at the horizontal', this ensures that light is used to illuminate the ground, not the sky.
3. Use a different kind of light
Switching to low watt bulbs is a straightforward way of reducing light pollution, albeit one that could not be deployed across every piece of outdoor lighting in a city. Moving away from bluish-white lighting could be a bigger contributor to reduced light pollution on an urban scale. LED outdoor lighting, whilst energy-efficient, often emits a blue light which creates more light pollution. This can be avoided with warm-white lighting. The Spanish market city of Vélez-Málaga (seems the Spanish are big on lighting innovation) recently adopted a dimmable warm-white light system for its streets, giving it lower watt lighting on demand and better illuminating its historic streets in the process.
4. Minimise light loss from your home
Reducing light pollution is not just a task for your municipal government. Outdoor lighting on buildings and in gardens contributes to light pollution, as does lighting emitted from inside buildings. Obviously, some lighting is more critical than others (see above), but by following the above three steps on outdoor lighting, and doing a better job of minimising the amount of light lost from the inside of your home, everyone can play a part in reducing urban light pollution.

I've heard the idea before that the only thing worse than a person who calls himself “religious” is a person who calls himself “spiritual,” and I agree with it to a great extent, even though if given a choice between those two options, I would definitely have to go with “spiritual” to describe myself.
I occasionally hear about someone going somewhere like the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, pressing their hands against the stone, and then talking about the sacred feeling that they get of being connected to the billions of people who have been there before them, but that always leaves me wondering. I understand the feeling completely, but the thing is, I get it all the time – when I'm stuck in traffic, waiting in a doctor's office, or wandering around a festival with my adopted Juggalo family... even when I'm exploring an abandoned building, knowing that it was once full of life. That is an essential feature of humanity to me… the shared experiences, both mundane and exceptional, that make up our lives and give them their flavor. I don't understand why people need a religious monument to bring it out of them. It's everywhere, all of the time. That's a core part of the spirituality that I feel in my life.

“Africa lacks a theater distribution network to support our forces,” the command said in a statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in March, noting it has about 1,000 troops operating across a nine-nation region of West Africa. “This capability gap forces our personnel to revert to costly and ineffective ad hoc solutions.”
American commandos deployed to the region have joked darkly that their command's inability to get them out of harm's way has boiled down to one directive: Do not get hurt. A Special Operations Force member who had deployed to Central Africa recently and oversaw planning for medical evacuation procedures for his unit said that if anyone on his team was wounded, they could ideally count on being evacuated in 10 hours. Other military officials said that the reality was that the waits for help were “multiples” of the one-hour goal in active war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan.
General Bolduc said that when he took command more than two years ago, many American troops on the continent were operating in such remote locations that they fell well outside even that expanded time frame for emergency medical evacuation, calling the military's evacuation capabilities at the time “immature.”
Some troops, however, argue that the golden hour is unrealistic for elite forces deployed far afield and in some cases prevents them from carrying out more risky, but important, missions.
“You're never going to have the golden hour in Africa; it's not possible,” General Bolduc said in a telephone interview. “But you have an acceptable amount of time that commanders have agreed on.”
For security reasons, he would not disclose the time frame in Africa.
In the past, Africa Command has said that it relies heavily on contract search-and-rescue aircraft and that African partners “lack the capability and capacity to assist with personnel recovery missions.”
Working closely with his higher headquarters at Africa Command as well as with the Air Force and such foreign partners as the French, General Bolduc said he was able to increase air and ground medical resources, including available aircraft, and left an “acceptable” emergency evacuation response in place by the time he departed over the summer.
Two years ago, we launched the Android Security Rewards program. In its second year, we've seen great progress. We received over 450 qualifying vulnerability reports from researchers and the average pay per researcher jumped by 52.3%. On top of that, the total Android Security Rewards payout doubled to $1.1 million dollars. Since it launched, we've rewarded researchers over $1.5 million dollars.
Here are some of the highlights from the Android Security Rewards program's second year:
There were no payouts for the top reward for a complete remote exploit chain leading to TrustZone or Verified Boot compromise, our highest award amount possible.
We paid 115 individuals with an average of $2,150 per reward and $10,209 per researcher.
We paid our top research team, C0RE Team, over $300,000 for 118 vulnerability reports.
We paid 31 researchers $10,000 or more.
Thank you to all the amazing researchers who submitted complete vulnerability reports to us last year.
Improvements to Android Security Rewards program
We're constantly working to improve the Android Security Rewards program and today we're making a few changes to all vulnerability reports filed after June 1, 2017.
Because every Android release includes more security protections and no researcher has claimed the top reward for an exploit chains in 2 years, we're excited to increase our top-line payouts for these exploits.
Rewards for a remote exploit chain or exploit leading to TrustZone or Verified Boot compromise increase from $50,000 to $200,000.
Rewards for a remote kernel exploit increase from $30,000 to $150,000.
In addition to rewarding for vulnerabilities, we continue to work with the broad and diverse Android ecosystem to protect users from issues reported through our program. We collaborate with manufacturers to ensure that these issues are fixed on their devices through monthly security updates. Over 100 device models have a majority of their deployed devices running a security update from the last 90 days. This table shows the models with a majority of deployed devices running a security update from the last two months:
Manufacturer Device BlackBerry PRIV Fujitsu F-01J General Mobile GM5 Plus d, GM5 Plus, General Mobile 4G Dual, General Mobile 4G Gionee A1 Google Pixel XL, Pixel, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9 LGE LG G6, V20, Stylo 2 V, GPAD 7.0 LTE Motorola Moto Z, Moto Z Droid Oppo CPH1613, CPH1605 Samsung Galaxy S8+, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S7 Active, Galaxy S6 Active, Galaxy S5 Dual SIM, Galaxy C9 Pro, Galaxy C7, Galaxy J7, Galaxy On7 Pro, Galaxy J2, Galaxy A8, Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 Sharp Android One S1, 507SH Sony Xperia XA1, Xperia X Vivo Vivo 1609, Vivo 1601, Vivo Y55

A year ago, when a 90-member caste panchayat in Rateu village, 100-km from Barmer, issued a diktat to ostracise a family, it was the two young sisters who refuse to cow down. Their two older siblings, accused of murdering their cousin, were sent to jail and their parents forced to leave the village so that they could earn a living and give them an education. So the two sisters, aged 18 and 20, never missed a class, making the 5-km trek across fields and dunes on foot and another 15-km ride to reach school regularly.

Their spirit agitated the villagers, who considered it a blatant show of disrespect for the caste panchayat's diktat. The deceased cousin's father, Ramji Ram, could not bear to see the sisters walk across his fields on their way to school and often threatened. One morning in March this year, when the girls were heading to school, Ramji allegedly beat them up. The girls approached the local police but were turned away with clear instructions not to approach higher authority.
Days passed and the girls once again got busy with their books. However, when they were on their way back after attending the Independence Day celebrations in school, the girls were beaten up again. The next day they registered a case against their uncle at the Gida police station and while they were walking back at around 8.30 pm, three youths allegedly raped them on a sand dune near the village. While they sank their teeth on the victims' flesh and shoved sticks into their private parts, the three youths — two from the same village Punion ki Dhani in Rateu where the girls live and the other from an adjacent village — told them this was their punishment for roaming around freely despite being ostracised.
That night when their father, who had incidentally come to the village to oversee their fields, went out to look for them, found them on the dune allegedly pinned down by the three accused — Birda Ram, Chatura Ram and Kanha Ram. When they went to file a complaint the next day, several villagers menacingly stood outside the police station, threatening them not to report the incident. “Even the police constable said do not write rape in the complaint but mention attempt to rape. There was so much pressure that we cracked. The caste panchayat members offered to call off the social boycott if we did not register a case and paid them Rs 20 lakh,” the 20-year-old victim told The Indian Express.
A case of attempt to rape was registered on August 17. “The next day when the police came to investigate, they asked for Rs 3,000 to hire a vehicle to conduct the inquiry. We obliged because we were desperate for help. Police constable Kalla Ram said he will come back but did not show up for the next three days. So we approached the superintendent of police, who finally registered a case of rape and promised us speedy action,” the victim added.
Barmer SP Hemant Sharma denied the allegations and maintained that the victims' did not make any such complaint before him. “If there is any truth in the allegations, we will investigate it and take due action.”
In severe pain, the girls have been unable to make the long trek to school but insist they will soon go back to finish Class XII. Their mother, who rears cattle, is yet to be told about the incident as they fear she will not be able to bear the shock.
“We have fallen on very bad times. First our siblings were arrested for murder, then our marriages fell apart and now this,” the older sister said.

The caste panchayat comprising senior members of the dominant Jat community had decreed that the family be ostracised after it was alleged that their older siblings had killed their school-going cousin when he found them in a comprising position.
Besides recently acquiring Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati, German auto manufacturer Audi has recently announced a new electric bicycle dubbed the “Wörthersee”.
As you can see from the photos, the Wörthersee features a prodigious amount of carbon fiber construction and also features disc brakes and Acros hydraulic shifting (with the cables run internally). It also features a lithium-ion battery located between the down tube and the seat tube. Charging is said to be in the neighborhood of 5 hours for a full charge.
The Audi e-bike can also link up to the rider's smartphone via WLAN and record tricks performed, routes taken, speed, distance, and more. Audi is entertaining the idea of integrating social networking in to the smart phones data capture as well.
From the manufacturer:
“One of the highlights on the Audi stand is the bicycle technology concept known as the Audi e-bike Wörthersee — a sport bike that does not fit into any of the usual categories. It is neither a pedelec nor a conventional bike, but is best described as a high-end pedelec made by Audi for sport, fun and tricks. The Audi e-bike Wörthersee combines the Audi brand's principal competences — design, ultra, connect and e-tron — and explores the limits of what is technically feasible in terms of design, lightweight construction, networking and electric mobility.”
Given the high output of this ebike (50mph!) it is doubtful that this will ever reach American shores as a anything other than a cool prool-of-concept bike. The Wörthersee weighs in at about 46 lbs.
Here is a short video of French trials rider/Superstar Julien Dupont taking the new Audi e-Bike for a spin.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, (2nd R) the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks, addresses the judge during the third day of pre-trial hearings in the 9/11 war crimes prosecution as depicted in this Pentagon-approved courtroom sketch at the U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, October 17, 2012. REUTERS/Janet Hamlin
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Court officials canceled a two-day pretrial hearing for suspects in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on Monday at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a U.S. Army spokesman said.
The hearing, intended to examine allegations the FBI tried to infiltrate legal defense teams, according to a docket on a Pentagon website. It would have been the first such proceeding since a U.S. Senate report on CIA torture was released last week.
No reason was given for the cancellation.
Judge James Pohl, an Army colonel, ruled in July that no conflict of interest arose for defense attorneys from the FBI approaching a security officer for a defense team. The allegations surfaced in April, further delaying a complex, slow-moving case.
Lawyers for accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other suspects want Pohl to determine the extent of FBI contact with defense team members.
Mohammed and fellow Sept. 11 suspect Ramzi Binalshibh were among prisoners who underwent torture by the Central Intelligence Agency, according to the report by the Senate Intelligence Committee released on Tuesday.
The report on the CIA interrogation program implemented after the Sept. 11 attacks said Mohammed was subjected to waterboarding, or simulated drowning, “rectal hydration” and sleep deprivation.
The 2001 attacks using hijacked airliners killed almost 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. The defendants face possible death penalties if convicted.
A week since the last part was posted... no part today. However, I'm still working on the restructuring, it's just taking longer than I expected, as all worthwhile things tend to do. I'm determined to post a new part tomorrow at the latest, so we shall see!
In any case, this post is about writing tips. I'm not going to pretend that I'm the greatest writer in the world, or even a foremost authority on writing in general, but I'm pretty okay at it and I have an improving grasp on the fundamentals every time that I write.
In reading through my story all the way from the beginning for the first time in months, I've caught many small mistakes that have added up quickly, but none have been so awful as the dreaded Tensing Missteaks. For those who don't know, a 'tense' is when a character is talking about or referred to in the past/present/future, but you then refer to them in one of the other two manners shortly after, or you might wibble-wobble between future and past without clarifying which tense your story actually takes place in.
Here is an example.
-----------------------
John walks though the park, having noted as he will always tend to do that the birds are very active this time of year.
-----------------------
That hurt to type. Noting the bold words above, we start off in the present tense, jump to the past tense, leap into the future tense, jump back to the present tense, and stay in the present tense. Also, at the very end, the final few words are a narrative shift from third-person narrator to something of a second-person narrator... rather awkward.
So why mention tensing at all? Because the early parts of Cryopod are absolutely littered with awful Tensing Missteaks, notably anything from a first person point of view.
Let's look at an example from your own favorite story!
From Part 266... in the middle of that part. (SPOILERS!)
-----------------------
I cock an eyebrow. "I thought you had made a confident prediction last year that you had a special technology that would quickly create lots of Trifrancium once we'd manufactured the first batch?"
His smile faltered. "Ah, yeah. Unfortunately it required too much... energy. The, erm, technology works... but it's so slow that we might as well just manufacture it the normal way. Turns out Earth had many of the deposits we needed, it's just painfully hard to mine and refine the stuff."
I shrug back at him. "Can't be helped, I suppose. If it were that easy to create the stuff, the Volgrim would be launching yearly assaults on Earth."
Judicator itched his chin as he chuckled. "Yeah.. heh, I suppose so." He paused for a second as his head cocked slightly upwards, as if he was thinking about something. "Oh, yes, how much longer until this area's EPS is online? We need to go global before we launch our initial assault on Volgarius."
-----------------------
In this part, Benjamin Brown is the narrator, and we're looking from his point of view. A common mistake that I used to make was that I would always write the 'main' character in the scene as a present tense, while the others would all be written in past tense. I stopped doing this right around Part 320 or so, but I'm going off memory. Someone mentioned it to me in PM and I've been meaning to go back and make notes, but unfortunately I made the error SO often that literally only the rewrite will fix these endless minor grammatical mistakes.
But for fun, let's rewrite the entire thing in past tense, then we'll do it again in present tense. It's only a few minor edits!
-----------------------
I cocked an eyebrow. "I thought you had made a confident prediction last year that you had a special technology that would quickly create lots of Trifrancium once we'd manufactured the first batch?"

-----------------------
Cryopod is littered with many many small errors. Again, they aren't major, but re-reading has opened my eyes to all the little flaws that I so gleefully ignored the first time around. As a writer, if you, the reader, can notice Tensing Missteaks (I never tire of that meme), your writing will improve greatly. I wouldn't need to worry about these anymore, because ever since they were brought to my attention, I notice them all the time now and I make sure to not make those errors anymore!
In any case, sorry this isn't a new part, but I'm working on it. It'll arrive soon, guys! Thanks for being readers!

For months, the real estate market—and markets in general—have suffered a lack of security. From the Brexit aftermath to the U.S. election, political wildcards as well as structural market shifts have made prognostication and predictions difficult.
But there are still fundamental changes at play and, amid the ups-and-downs, the United States has emerged as a safe haven and investment opportunity. According to the Urban Land Institute's annual Emerging Trends in Real Estate Report, which was just released this morning at their annual meeting in Dallas, real estate in the United States shows a more favorable outlook than much of the rest of the world. Of course, this attention carries plenty of risks and challenges.
Here's a breakdown of the big topics that analysts at the Urban Land Institute and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, as well as hundreds of industry experts, believe will shape the real estate landscape for the years to come.
A kinder, gentler real estate market?
After cataclysmic economic disruption triggered by the foreclosure crisis, it seems the real estate market has entered a prolonged period of calm. According to the report, this current business cycle—which at 85 months has been much longer than average—has entered a “mature” phase. It's been smooth waters for a while, and seems poised to stay level.
Real GDP growth has hit an unremarkable but steady 2 percent per year and the Federal Reserve doesn't want to “take away the punchbowl” and raise interest rates. But, there are signs of a development slowdown, due to difficulties securing construction financing, and the amount of capital looking to pick up core properties means pricing has dramatically risen. Overall, investors are looking to avoid risk, even more than normal. While this has led to calmer seas, one investor quoted in the report said they're at the “white knuckle phase” of the cycle.
Optionality is in
With the market flocking to safe bets, it makes sense that developers and investors are seeking flexible, multi-use projects. Buildings that can be adjusted to satisfy multiple tenants and changing neighborhoods lets owners maximize rent and seek the highest and best use.
The report cited a Fortune 500 company that entered into a flexible lease akin to coworking to house many of its staff. The owner now gets solid cash flow, and can backfill space when the opportunity arises. It's an example of the coworking trend writ large, and the potential of those type of arrangements to turn aging buildings into productive office space is incredibly tempting.
Keeping open to the shifting winds of the market, as well as the societal changes wrought by the sharing economy seems like sound investment, especially in the residential sector. As one investor said: “Jobs are no longer careers, and millennials are not yet looking for the commitment of owning a home. They are footloose in the job market, and footloose as to roots in the community.”
Transformation through location choice
In pursuit of a “triple bottom line” of financial, social, and environmental success, some developers have seen the benefits of doing good for the community (as long as, of course, there's a chance it does well for them as well).
A current wave of downtown redevelopment, which feeds the current urban revival across the country, not only helps catalyze urban cores, but also create live/work/play locations that show impressive growth possibilities. Planting a seed and positioning a project as something that can help bring back a city has both a positive PR spin and great potential for growth, since walkable urban centers have been a sure bet in recent years.
Examples exist nationwide, from Cleveland and Oakland to San Diego and Raleigh. The report points to downtown Las Vegas, where investment in City Hall, the Downtown Container Park, Airstream Village, as well as startups, has turned a moribund part of town into a vital part of the city. The report suggests that investing in vacant urban land, creating land trusts, and working with local government can spur similarly beneficial developments in other cities.
Recognizing the role of the small entrepreneurial developer
The amount of risk-averse capital, noted earlier in this article, suggests tough times for smaller to mid-size developers. And while numerous challenges exist, ULI researchers and industry sources believe now is an ideal time for experimentation and growth for these firms. Without the profit expectations of big cities or starchitect-led developments, these firms can zero-in on growth opportunities in urban infill and smaller markets, and take advantage of “contextual zoning” outside of core CBDs to try out new ideas.
Labor scarcity in construction costs
Bigger shifts in workforce participation and the job market have put pressure on the labor force and the construction industry, and a growing shortage of laborers is impacting development and real estate. As of April 2016, there were over 200,000 unfilled job openings in building construction, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS).
Many of the sources consulted for the ULI report have felt the impact, with labor availability and labor shortages seen as a fact of life for the foreseeable future. Development time has been growing due to worker demand, and delays are deluding returns. As costs increase, it also puts pressure on developers to go high-end to try and recoup some of their lost time and money.
What's causing the shortage? Many issues are at play: clampdown on Mexican immigration, retirement of skilled craftsman, a dearth of project managers, and a boom in the oil and gas sectors, which has siphoned away talent. Proposed solutions, such as immigration reform, infrastructure spending that develops entry-level skills, and more support for vocational and technical education, could help staff up our construction sites.
Housing affordability: Local governments step up
In addition to affordability concerns for low-income renters and buyers, markets across the country are seeing more and more middle-income households become “housing stressed.” Home prices are rising at a 5 percent annual rate, double the rise in income, and homebuilders just aren't responding with new, mid-priced options: An August 2016 report from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) noted that just 62 percent of all new and existing homes sold in the second quarter were “affordable”
Cities aren't waiting for developers to act, pushing more and more inclusionary zoning policies, as well as rent control measures and development impact fees. New York City's plan may get the biggest headlines, but similar proposals and policies are being discussed in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Nashville, Portland, and Los Angeles. Renovation projects are also being asked to hit certain affordability targets.
Expanding the pool of affordable housing may make for a more long-term investment strategy: growing the market and community and reaping incremental profits, rather than going for high-priced residential projects with larger initial windfalls. Population growth, rising land and building costs, and wage stagnation suggests this issue isn't going away anytime soon.
Gaining entry beyond the velvet rope
The popularity of urban development and walkable neighborhoods has created great income inequality in cities, a source of considerable tension in many areas. As the report suggests, “exclusionary forces are equally alive in suburbs and cities.” Urban redevelopment has gentrified neighborhoods, harmed affordability, and pushed out long-time residents, and the cycle is continuing in the suburbs.
As more millennials move outside the city, they still demand density, walkability, and transit accessibility, which puts pressure on select parcels of land. The report notes that opposition to this so-called “velvet rope” of development is showing up in local government meetings and social media.
Cities are also experiencing issues with new development, as established residents and tenants push back against affordable developments and zoning changes (the traditional NIMBY debate). As President Obama's recent release of a housing toolkit meant to spur development of affordable units suggests, wealthy neighborhoods have “pulled up the ladder of opportunity” from lower-income residents.
New building design can either ignore history and context, or reflect it while meeting the changes in the city's makeup. Inclusivity is replacing exclusivity as a selling point, according to the ULI report, and zoning and development needs to keep pace.
The connectedness of cities
The boom in smart city technology and the Internet of Things has important implications for real estate. First, a new network of sensors can play a huge role in increasing energy efficiency and building control operations, and also help connect residents to the city, in the form of networked transportation systems and online parking availability.
Second, and perhaps just as impactful, cities that master these new technologies, and invest in research, education, and implementation, become hotbeds for startups and jobs, making them much more attractive for investors. Cities need to be on the right side of the digital divide to succeed, and this kind of metrics should figure into any future planning.
Ready for augmented reality?
Call it the Pokémon effect. While brokers have been talking up the impact of virtual reality on sales and showings for quite some time, the impact of augmented reality may be just as large. The residential and commercial real estate worlds may discover this technological lure makes site visits much more powerful, and retail, motivated by the potential of “bricks-and-clicks” virtual sales and gamification in commerce, may find it to be a key part of promotions and marketing.
AR could also become a key part of the construction and design industry, leading to closer, high-tech collaborations that reduce errors. These changes may seem far-fetched, but industry analysts believe they're coming fast: experts expect $2.6 billion in real estate applications by the year 2025
Blockchain for 21st-Century real estate
This is, admittedly, more of a long-term technological development, but one that developers working on large-scale projects should keep an eye on. Blockchain, the encrypted digital data technology behind Bitcoin, the virtual currency, is on the radar of major banks and exchanges. Sine it offers a high degree of security and encryption, many think this may become part of the future of high-end real estate transactions. The report's writers suggest developers keep an eye on the development of this technology, in case it begins to become more mainstream.
Right now there are two unfilled positions on the seven member Federal Reserve Board . If nothing is done to fill those positions, the number will increase to three in June of this year when Governor and Vice-Chairman Don Kohn retires
One open Board position should not go unfilled for this long, two is worse -- two positions have been open since president Obama took office -- and three open slots should not be allowed to happen.
It's not exactly clear what has taken the administration so long to propose people to fill the open Board seats except fear of obstructionism from the other side. But there is a very legitimate argument that filling the open positions is important if we want to maximize our chances of recovering from the economic downturn, so obstructionism could backfire in this instance. The administration should have tried to fill the positions in any case, obstructionism or not, given the importance of doing all we can to recover from the recession and the importance of trying to prevent this from happening again (there are many problems that the Fed needs to resolve, and having additional Board members to serve in leadership roles on initiatives to address the many and varied issues the Fed faces could be very helpful right now).
For whatever reason, the administration has not taken full advantage of its chance to shape monetary policy during the downturn. The number of open positions is a large fraction of the Federal Reserve Board, and it skews the balance of power on the Federal Open Market Committee (where monetary policy is decided) toward the regional banks. Many of the regional bank presidents are inflation hawks, more so than the Governors, so this may have affected the Fed's policy choices.
By filling the open positions, president Obama could have given the current Board a better chance of dealing with the many complex problems it needs to address, and it could have shaped the types of policies that have been enacted. For example, many economists have been urging the Fed to be more aggressive in its efforts to stimulate output and employment. Assuming that the administration shares this view, appointing two Board members as soon as they were able to after inauguration could have tilted the policies currently in place in this direction.
Finally, there has been some speculation recently about potential candidates for the unfilled positions, and the list is skewed toward academics who are specialists in the conduct of monetary policy. The Board does need academic specialists. But the Board also needs experts in financial markets, people with a thorough understanding of all facets of financial markets and the assets that are traded on them, and it needs experts in financial market regulation as well. Those areas are already fairly well covered by Governors Warsh, Duke, and Tarullo, while at present the only academic on the Board is Ben Bernanke.
I still wonder if the Board has sufficient expertise in financial markets and institutions, so perhaps one of the three open positions could be devoted to filling needs in that area. However, Ben Bernanke could use the help of more macroeconomists on the Board, and I'd like to see the other two of the positions, if not all three, go to experts in monetary policy. There was a time I might have pushed harder for all three positions to go to academic experts, but the financial market crash has highlighted the need for a broad range of expertise on the Board.

It took an hour last Friday afternoon for Bern Force One to traverse a lonely stretch of the Great Basin Desert from tiny Elko, Nev., to Reno. Through the windows of Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) chartered Boeing 737, the snowcapped mountains of northern Nevada, pocked with gold and silver mines, morphed into an arid desert northeast of Lake Tahoe and the Sierras.
The jet — partially filled with 64 campaign staffers, Secret Service agents, journalists, crew members and a presidential candidate — hit an updraft as it approached Reno-Tahoe International Airport and began to shudder and shake. A flight attendant, who had been collecting the remnants of the turkey club sandwiches served for lunch, stumbled in the aisle and took a seat where he was to ride out the turbulence.

Bern Force One on the tarmac in Elko, Nevada
"Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name," recited a staffer who was slumming it with reporters near the back of the plane. "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven."
He was joking. I think.
As the wings of the plane flexed alarmingly, the captain finally turned on the seatbelt signs.
"Oh, now?!" a CNN producer exclaimed. "Are you fucking kidding me?"
Over the PA, the captain explained that he would have to take another pass at the runway from the opposite direction because the wind had shifted. When the plane finally touched down a few minutes later, the press section let out a collective sigh of relief.
As Bern Force One taxied across the airfield, half a dozen Secret Service agents — seated in the middle of the plane between the press and campaign staff — hopped to their feet and hustled toward the rear exit. They were met on the tarmac by yet more agents and local law enforcement, who pulled up to the plane in a nine-vehicle motorcade.
Eventually, the 22 reporters, photographers and producers accompanying Sanders on a 900-mile air journey across Nevada filtered out the rear door and onto a waiting bus.

Sen. Sanders' traveling press corps board a bus at Reno-Tahoe International Airport
A few photographers cut away from the group to document the senator's descent from the front of the blue and white plane, emblazoned with Eastern Air Lines' retro logo. Their shutters whirred as a familiar mop of white hair made its way down a mobile staircase and into a black Ford Expedition. After a Secret Service agent closed the door behind Sanders, the motorcade sped off toward a nearby casino.
It wasn't always like this.
When I first followed Sanders on an exploratory trip to Iowa in September 2014, he made his way through the cornfields in a rented Toyota Camry with an entourage of two: longtime state director Phil Fiermonte and spokesman Michael Briggs. There were no advance teams or camera risers or security cordons — just three guys and a car.
Back then, Sanders hadn't yet decided whether to seek the presidency — and few reporters seemed to care if he would. That weekend, 200 journalists showed up in Indianola for Hillary Clinton's first appearance in the state since the 2008 election. Only a handful dropped by Sanders' town hall meetings in Dubuque, Waterloo and Des Moines.
Fast-forward 16 months to mid-January. As polls showed Sanders gaining on Clinton in Iowa and running away with New Hampshire, the campaign unveiled a big blue bus branded with its logo. Four days before the Iowa caucuses, I arrived in the Mississippi River town of Davenport and tossed my duffel bag on the chartered coach that trailed the Bernie Bus, carting reporters from rally to rally.

Sen. Sanders' bus last month in Davenport, Iowa
Aboard the press bus was a trio of journalists who had been following Sanders since his campaign took off the summer before: the Washington Post's John Wagner, ABC's MaryAlice Parks and BuzzFeed News' Evan McMorris-Santoro. They were now joined by a dozen more reporters from the New York Times, the Associated Press and even the Italian daily La Repubblica, among others.
Conducting the orchestra was Sanders' new director of traveling press, René Spellman, an Obama campaign veteran who serves as den mother to the reporters — making sure they are fed, housed and, most important of all, on time. She made clear that at the end of each event, we were to race back to the bus as soon as the senator breathed the words "thank you" to his audience.
The arrangement was an improvement over my three previous trips to Iowa, during which I would often drive a rental car six hours a day, speeding from event to event, only to stumble into a motel room at night to write. Now I could transcribe my recordings and file stories from the back of a Windstar Lines charter as we chugged along I-80.
Spellman ran a tight ship, but some things were out of her control. The morning after I boarded the bus, its battery died in the Hampton Inn Dubuque parking lot, briefly stranding us.
And with the convenience of the bus came new limitations on our movement. Later that day, Sanders delivered short pep talks for volunteers in Charles City and Waverly. But due to space limitations at the venues, Spellman told us, only a small pool of reporters would be allowed to attend. The rest of us were deposited for the next four hours at a shopping mall in a Cedar Rapids suburb.
McMorris-Santoro, a bear of a man with a beard resembling that of an Appalachian Trail thru-hiker, convinced a few of us to pass the time at HuHot Mongolian Grill, a chain restaurant with the charm of a Red Lobster. After fetching our food from a buffet line and watching black-clad chefs sauté it on a circular grill, we sat together at a corner table, chatting occasionally about a forthcoming Des Moines Register poll and other news of the day.
But work on the campaign trail — especially for those hoping to break the next scooplet on Politico or BuzzFeed — never really stops. Even as we ostensibly socialized, we all had at least one eye on our inbox or Twitter feed.
"There's such a weird set of small talk traveling reporters have," McMorris-Santoro later told me. "No. 1 is: What's your hotel points system, and what level of points do you have? No. 2 is: When was the last time you were home, and are you going home soon?"
For McMorris-Santoro, the answers to the second set of questions seemed to be "ages ago" and "no." Three weeks later in Nevada, I overheard him telling another reporter that it'd been "several weeks" since he'd last seen his wife.
"I think I still have friends back in the city," he told me, referring to his home in Washington, D.C. "I don't know. I haven't heard from them in a while."
The morning after our Lindale Mall excursion, a television producer showed off to her fellow passengers the red Eddie Bauer jacket she'd bought after leaving HuHot. As we motored from Iowa City to Waterloo, Spellman told us we would likely have more time to kill after the next rally.
"And then, I don't know, maybe we'll find another mall," she said.
"Is that a threat?" a reporter asked.
"That was definitely a threat," Spellman responded.

Secret Service agents deplane Bern Force One in Reno, Nevada
A week after Sanders nearly tied Clinton at the Iowa caucuses, I met up with the traveling press corps again — this time in Bow, N.H. In the interim, the Sanders campaign had requested Secret Service protection for a reason it declined to reveal.
Things had changed again.
Inside the Hampton Inn Bow, agents rifled through our baggage and scanned us with metal detecting wands. They led us in a group to our new ride: one of two luxury buses in an 11-vehicle convoy. The seats were leather and spacious — a step up from the Windstar — and a kitchenette in back was stocked with snacks and a Keurig coffee machine.
For security reasons, our movements were now even more restricted. As we raced down I-93 toward Nashua's Daniel Webster College, Spellman informed us that we would not be allowed to leave the secure press zones at each of the day's rallies to talk to voters, take a phone call or even take a piss — unless we asked permission. If we dawdled on our way back to the motorcade, we would be jettisoned from the bus for the rest of the day.
That night, I glimpsed another aspect of campaign-trail life. As we drove through a light blizzard to Sanders' final Granite State event — a concert featuring Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros — an AP reporter sitting in front of me video-chatted with her two-year-old daughter. A McClatchy reporter sitting across the aisle from me frantically tried to track down a babysitter upon learning that her child's Washington, D.C., school would be closed the next day.
After Sanders' big win in New Hampshire, he upgraded modes of transport once again. Within the next week, his traveling press corps was flying in the chartered 737 to Minnesota, Nevada, Colorado, Michigan, South Carolina and Georgia.
McMorris-Santoro, who attended Sanders' hastily arranged campaign announcement last April in Washington, D.C., said the evolution has been "just wild" to witness.
"There's all this structure around him now: the Secret Service, the planes, the advance teams," he said. "But it doesn't really feel like a new campaign. It feels like the same campaign in this whole new wrapping paper."
He added: "One of the things that's stayed the same throughout this whole process is, really, fundamentally, Bernie."
That can be a problem for reporters looking for a new story to tell. From rally to rally, Sanders delivers a remarkably consistent stump speech. Only in the first few minutes of his hourlong presentation does he occasionally toss out a tasty tidbit, such as a new critique of Clinton.
For reporters trapped on the bus or plane and unable to pee without permission, it can be a challenge to get the flavor of a city or even talk to a real voter. As Sanders takes fewer questions from his audiences and holds fewer press conferences, spontaneity has become a scarce commodity.

So the traveling press corps seemed relieved last Friday in Nevada when his motorcade took an unexpected detour on its way to Elko Regional Airport and pulled up to the Coffee Mug Family Restaurant. Spellman let the photographers out of the bus first so that they could catch the candidate's arrival. Then she told the rest of us that we would have to wait outside the establishment while he dined with his wife, Jane, stepdaughter Heather Titus and her husband, Marc Titus.
Grumbling ensued.
After a few minutes, Sanders sent word to Spellman that the unwashed journalistic masses could be permitted entry after all, so long as we left our cameras on the bus. Inside, the reporters took seats in the middle of the diner and pretended to ignore Sanders and his family, seated at a booth in back.
I sidled up to a mustachioed man at the counter, who was sipping a cup of coffee, and asked him what he made of the scene.
"To be sittin' here, eating breakfast and seeing the Secret Service and a candidate come in," said Scott Crandall, a maintenance foreman at a local gold mine. "A little bit of a surprise. It's usually a little quieter."
After quizzing Crandall about his political preferences — he did not sound likely to vote for Sanders — I noticed a commotion behind me. Spellman had given the traveling press corps the go-ahead to briefly photograph Sanders at his table. They swooped in like vultures to snag a morsel of something that at least appeared unscripted. I excused myself from the counter and joined the mob.
Sanders played it cool — as if it was perfectly normal for nearly two dozen adults to document one's tea drinking — and offered a quick wave of acknowledgment. Spellman hustled us out of the Coffee Mug.
We got another taste of pseudo-spontaneity that night after Bern Force One landed at McCarran International Airport, barely a mile from the Las Vegas strip. On the way to Sanders' now-traditional caucus-eve concert, the motorcade pulled into a parking garage in the bowels of Caesars Palace.
Spellman led us through a back entrance, down an escalator and through a hallway lined with hanging uniforms. We entered an employee cafeteria, where casino workers ate by themselves and in small groups. Our den mother instructed us to hang back in one corner as Sanders worked the room. We would be permitted to approach him, a few at a time, to take photos and capture the conversation.
There wasn't much of it.
"Ha-lohhh," Sanders said as he worked his way though the cafeteria. "Ha-lohhh."
The senator has never excelled at glad-handing, but he has learned over the course of the campaign to smile when posing for a selfie.
Despite Spellman's admonitions, we soon surrounded Sanders as he made his way across the room. We held up our iPhones and tape recorders in search of a video or sound bite. When we got back to the bus, Spellman scolded us, gently, for overstepping our bounds.
The next afternoon, Sanders lost the Nevada caucuses. His concession speech, delivered ahead of schedule in a sparsely filled pavilion 10 miles from Vegas, was the shortest I've seen since he joined the race last spring. It lasted just seven minutes.
As he said the words "thank you," I watched the traveling press corps dutifully close their laptops and follow Spellman out of the venue. They were on their way, via Bern Force One, to South Carolina, Massachusetts, Virginia and beyond. I flew home on a commercial plane.
When I spoke to McMorris-Santoro two days later, he said the mood on the plane had shifted.
"Nevada was the first bad day," he said. "It seems like people on the campaign — I'm not sure about the candidate himself — are taking it pretty hard."
For the past eight months, he noted, Sanders had enjoyed a steady upward trajectory.
"There is a sense now that we can have bad days," the reporter said. "I think that's a different thought than people had even three or four days ago."
Local police in the city of Mildura, Australia, have been forced to warn motorists of the inaccuracies contained within Apple's Maps app for iOS 6. Map lists Mildura in the middle of Murray-Sunset National Park, about 70km away from where it should be, and the police have had to rescue motorists that ended up in the wrong place — some stranded without food or water for 24 hours. Others were forced to walk "long distances through dangerous terrain" in order to get phone reception; since temperatures can reach up to 46° Celsius (115° Fahrenheit), the police have called it a "potentially life-threatening issue."
The shortcomings of Apple Maps are well-documented, and it's certainly not the first time mapping solutions have caused problems for hapless drivers. Still, the incident highlights that Apple's botched rollout could have more serious consequences than a mangled 3D model of the Brooklyn Bridge, particularly outside the US where data is even less comprehensive and accurate. Tim Cook recently said he's putting "the weight of the company behind" fixing the Maps app; Victoria Police are happy to help, too, and have notified Apple of the Mildura matter.
Update: According to The Guardian, Apple's map data has been updated to provide the correct location of Mildura. We have verified that the new information is in place, which will hopefully prevent any more reports of lost travellers. Apple has yet to issue a statement regarding the incident.
The United States men's national team is around two weeks from returning to World Cup qualification. With that in mind, we thought it'd be interesting to evaluate how some of the team's top players are doing this season. While all the MLS guys are just beginning their seasons, the players playing abroad have been hard a work. In this series, we'll be talking to writers who cover the teams these players play for to get a good sense of how they are doing headed into the return of the Hex.
In previous installments, we've caught up with Christian Pulisic and DeAndre Yedlin. For this post we got in touch with Hertha Berlin USA (@HerthaBerlinUSA on Twitter), which is a must-follow for any Americans hoping to keep tabs on John Brooks and/or Hertha Berlin in English. We asked them to give us some insight on Brooks and here's what they had to say:
1. Give us an idea of what John Brooks' current form is as of writing this
John Brooks has been very reliable thus for this season. While Hertha has hit a bit of a slump recently, Brooks is the one defender you can always count on. His hashtag #WallOfBrooks is well deserved. He comes up with a crucial interception or tackle at least once a game. Furthermore, he's hardly ever injured and doesn't shy away from tackles, which is just what you need from a CB.
2. Comparing his performances this season to previous ones, how would you say he's improved? Have any key facets of his game gotten significantly better?
He has become much more consistent and reliable. He used to be a guy who you wouldn't trust 100% because you knew he'd slip up once or twice a game. Now, that's gone. I can't remember the last time he made a truly terrible mistake. Furthermore, he has become much more dominant in the air, winning pretty much every header in our half. If he can translate that talent into being a threat in the opponents box, he'll be even more valuable. He definitely has a lot of potential.
3. What do Hertha fan think of his international responsibilities? From past reports, the club doesn't seem too happy with him playing for the USMNT.
Well I can't speak for all Hertha fans, but I believe playing for your country is an extremely valuable experience for any player, especially young ones. In addition, Brooks usually starts for the USMNT so it helps his leadership qualities and overall development. I think people are concerned with the long trips, possible injuries and tiredness after international trips to America. However, that's all part of being a professional athlete so it shouldn't matter too much. I'm convinced that an athlete like Brooks knows how to deal with these scenarios.
4. Pretend you're Professor Berlin and give us a grade for his performance so far this season.
Flight Sim Labs, Ltd. announces the immediate availability of FSLSpotlights v2.0, a revolutionary new product for Prepar3D v4.1 and above, that allows the simmer to import and control up to 60 different fully three-dimensional dynamic spotlights in any existing aircraft virtual cockpit.
Each light can be used individually as a single lamp or put together in groups with a single on/off switch and a brightness regulator control.
Light attributes (beam position, pitch, heading, angle, range, attenuation, color) can be modified and parameterized to provide the correct look and feel depending on desired light type: This way, the user can add narrow focused lights to shine on map holders or tray tables, series of smaller lamps for main panel flood lighting or wide dome lamps for turning a dark cockpit into a lit area. Each lamp holds its own attributes which can be tweaked using a configuration manager that runs as a separate process and communicates continuously with Prepar3D, giving the simmer an unlimited number of lighting configurations and setups.
Queensland weather: South-east residents swelter as heatwave continues
Updated
Much of south-east Queensland is sweltering as residents endure another day of heatwave conditions.
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said temperatures were expected to reach up to 40 degrees Celsius in a band from Esk, south to Gatton and down to Beaudesert.
Forecaster Andrew Bufalino said high overnight temperature were making conditions more uncomfortable.
"We're seeing temperatures around 24 or 25 over a broad area of south-east Queensland and this is because of the combination of both the hot air mass and the very high moisture levels," he said.
"In fact we're actually seeing temperatures [that] feel like around that 30 degree mark overnight."
Mr Bufalino said it would be a little cooler on the coast due to the sea breeze.
"The strip from around Esk down to Gatton and through to Beaudesert are expecting the hottest temperatures around about 38 to 40 degree mark," he said.
"Currently the hottest temperature we're going for is Gatton with 40 degrees."
Tai Van, who has worked in his Brisbane dry cleaning business at Corinda for 30 years, said it could often be 45C working in his shop on a hot day.
"The secret is to drink a lot of cold water — I drink about seven, eight litres a day, not to mention after work," he said.
"Every now and then we have a sip of water, wash our face, have a mini-shower wherever you go — that keeps us alive.
"You feel like a punching bag the next morning, your body's sort of aching.
"[But] the minute I arrive [back] here, everything's back to normal and you just do it — we're well conditioned — just like any other job you get used to it."
The bureau cancelled its severe thunderstorm warning for Queensland just before midday yesterday, saying the immediate threat of severe thunderstorms had passed.
It said the situation would continue to be monitored and further warnings would be issued if necessary.

Ismail Khan abruptly gets up from his armchair. "I understood the question," he says. "So you want to know whether now, 12 years after Western troops arrived, every village finally has electricity." Afghanistan's minister of water and energy walks over to a map on the wall on which rebuilt hydroelectric power plants, new solar plants and modern wind turbines are marked.
Khan grabs a pointer, taps it onto an area west of Herat and says: "This is where I came across the border from Iran with 17,000 men in 1996, during the Taliban era. Then we continued through Faryab and Mazar to Faizabad and back to Herat." He drags the pointer to the north and then to the east, sweeping it across all the wind turbines and power plants, as if they were nothing but hindrances. "My militias fought bravely everywhere," says Khan.
This minister doesn't want to talk about water and electricity, or about what his ministry has been up to since the Taliban was ousted. All he wants to talk about is the past, about fighting the Soviets, about the regime of former President Mohammad Najibullah and about the Islamists after they assumed power in Afghanistan.
But when he mentions the Taliban, he is also talking about the future. He foresees a return of the fundamentalist Taliban, the collapse of the government in Kabul and the eruption of a new war between ethnic groups. He sees a future in which power is divided between the clans as it was in the past, and in which the mujahedeen, the tribal militias seasoned by battles against the Soviets and later the Taliban, remain the sole governing force.
Khan's advisors sit at a respectful distance from the minister. Some have dozed off -- it's afternoon during Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, and their strength is waning. But now they are nodding their approval. Filled with reverence, they gaze at their boss, a diminutive Tajik with a magnificent white beard, who always wears an equally white pajama-like outfit known as a Perahan Tunban, together with a black turban.
The 'Lion of Herat'
In truth, the 65-year-old minister is still what he was 30 years ago: a mujahed, or warlord, although he doesn't like the latter term. "The Americans and English tried to discredit us with that word, until they realized that they couldn't do without us in their fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban," Khan, now an older, more peaceful man, says with a smile.
But he is also a man who had entire armies march across the Hindu Kush Mountains in the 1980s to fight the Soviets. He was one of the commanders in the ensuing civil war, in which Afghanistan's ethnic groups -- the Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbeks and Pashtuns -- massacred one another and laid waste to the capital Kabul.
Khan, governor of the most important province in western Afghanistan until 2004, was known as the "Lion of Herat." He still prefers to be addressed by his former title of Emir. But then he became too powerful for the Americans and President Hamid Karzai, so they removed Khan from office and brought him to Kabul to keep a closer eye on him. He was finally given the somewhat laughable position of water and energy minister, despite his feeling that he should have been offered the job of defense or interior minister instead. "I didn't join this cabinet voluntarily," says Khan.
His office is now in a dilapidated building on the street leading to the Darul Aman Palace on the outskirts of Kabul, a stately building that once housed the parliament and was reduced to a ruin in the country's civil war. Khan, who has been water and energy minister for eight years, dedicates power plants, solicits bids for the construction of power lines and attends cabinet meetings. His ministry is not important in Kabul, and yet both the Americans and Karzai are afraid of him -- especially Karzai.
The year 2014 is approaching, and with it the withdrawal of NATO troops. When Khan appears in public today, it is with the demeanor of the mujahed. "We cannot allow Afghanistan to be destroyed once again," he said publicly late last year. He has also said that government forces are powerless in large parts of the country, that Afghans should arm themselves once again, new recruits should enlist and the command structures of the former militias ought to be reestablished.
The international coalition "has taken away our artillery and tanks and turned them into scrap metal. Instead, they have brought Dutch, German, American and French girls to our country, along with white soldiers from Europe and black soldiers from Africa, who were supposed to bring security to Afghanistan. They have failed," Khan said in a speech at a rally in Herat.
Mujahedeen Comeback?
After the speech, President Karzai announced that the minister's words had "nothing to do with the government's policies." An Afghan senator said that people like Khan smell blood, and that they see the withdrawal of Western troops as "the opportunity to launch another civil war and eliminate local rivals." American four-star General John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) troops in Afghanistan until February, expressed his concerns in a letter to Karzai.
Khan laughs. "One letter? There were two. Karzai showed them to me. And I said to him: It's a good thing that someone like Allen realizes what kinds of people we have here."
"So you believe that the Taliban will return as soon as NATO is gone?"
"The arrogant Americans drove the most important Taliban out of Kabul, bombed the rest from the air and then ended the war," says the minister. "So far, 2013 has been the bloodiest year yet in Afghanistan. The Taliban are in all the villages once again. They want all the power. Our army won't be able to stop them."
"And you could stop them?"
"We have 20 years of combat experience, and we defeated a superpower. We can deal with the Taliban too," says Khan, leaning back in his chair. "But not this army," he adds, waving his hand in the direction of the defense ministry. The Afghan army, trained by the West, has lost 63,000 men, or one in three soldiers, to desertion in the last three years.
Rarely have officials in Afghan government ministries spoken as frankly as they do today, now that the Western troop withdrawals have begun. And Ismail Khan is by no means an eccentric maverick. Marshal Mohammed Fahim, a former warlord and Afghanistan's first vice president, speaks of a comeback by the mujahedeen. And Ahmad Zia Massoud, brother of legendary mujahedeen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, has even said publicly that his followers are arming themselves once again.
"Before the West leaves this place, it should give us back our planes and artillery, or the equivalent," Khan says before going to pray.
The Trust of the People
The town where Khan gave a speech last November is called Shahrak Shuhoda, or Town of Martyrs. The road to Shahrak Shuhoda leads from Herat toward the Iranian border. It is a village of 130 families, who live in houses with covered inner courtyards, built less than a decade ago with German money. The residents of Shahrak Shuhoda are all former mujahedeen and their families, as well as the widows of fallen fighters. The school, also built with German funds, is called the "Ismail Khan School."
Jalil Ahmad, a slim 25-year-old man, teaches at the school and is also a student of literature in Herat. His father and uncle died in the struggle against the communist government in 1990. He earns a monthly salary of 93 ($126), enough to buy a sack of rice, cooking oil and gasoline for his motorcycle. It isn't much, and yet he is convinced that the Taliban would deprive him of even that small income if it returned to the region. It's one of the reasons he attended the celebrated rally with Ismail Khan.
"There were 15,000 people there," he says. "But what the government is saying about Ismail Khan isn't true. He didn't talk about rearmament or about the formation of new militias. He called for unity. He said that we shouldn't be afraid of 2014, but that we should be well-prepared."
Ahmad adds that people trust Khan, and that the mujahedeen leader has a good reputation in Herat. "They assumed power here twice: In 1992, when they overthrew Najibullah, and in 2001, after the fall of the Taliban. The region blossomed each time."
But fear has become pervasive in all provinces as the Americans transport their containers across the Khyber Pass and the Germans fly their military equipment to Turkey. In Herat, the largest city in western Afghanistan, the fear isn't immediately apparent. The population has swelled to one million, with four million people living in the surrounding area. Herat, which benefits from trade with Iran and Turkmenistan, seems cleaner and more orderly than other Afghan cities. The Taliban has never enjoyed any support in the region.
That must have changed at some point, though. In mid-September, a truck loaded with explosives blew up in front of the US consulate in Herat. A bomb destroyed a motorized rickshaw in the Obe District, causing 19 deaths, almost all of them women and children, say police. In the town of Karukh, Taliban militants recently killed Wali Jaan, a public prosecutor and the brother of National Security Advisor Rangin Dadfar Spanta.
Holidays are hard for a lot of people. In my case, it was because of family, otherness, and income. But young people everywhere have trouble in December for many different reasons, including, but not limited to: lack of income, insecure housing, unpopular political views, sexual orientation, gender, and religion. When you are young, when you lack a support system, and when the world tells you there is only one way to be happy, finding a way out of negativity and isolation seems impossible. It often feels like there's no other acceptable way to have family, no alternative way to celebrate. And, as a result: you don't.
Homogenous representations of family, normalized rhetoric surrounding family, and even governmental policies that were written for and enshrine the traditional nuclear family further isolate those who are forced to rely on alternative support systems. Dated and non-inclusive American policies, reaching from marriage and tax policy to employment leave policies, fortify the nuclear family while neglecting diverse families of not just blood, but also love and choice. By restricting the definition of family socially and politically, we also restrict the informal social support systems people can conceptualize for themselves and rely on in times of need as well as in times of celebration. If families of choice aren't represented in formal and informal structures throughout politics, media, and rhetoric, then so many people will go on believing they really are alone.
Despite my efforts to avoid holiday cheer, it knocked on my door earlier and earlier every year. I couldn't escape the normative language that frequently escapes the sweetest, most caring mouths.
“Are you going home to your parents this break?”
I will definitely be leaving student housing!
“Don't you just love shopping for your family?”
Shopping is boring, hey have you heard Michael Buble's Christmas album?
Each holiday season would come and go, and I said nothing to anyone about how I felt. I skirted the questions with fierce voracity and just enough saccharine to avoid being nicknamed The Grinch.
I wish I could say that in one night the Ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future visited me in my sleep and changed my mind about the holidays through the glory of song. But, the truth is it took me a few years and a bunch of uncomfortable conversations with acquaintances, friends, and eventually family to explain and pinpoint why I just didn't love Christmas anymore. It felt like I couldn't cross off anything on the “Christmas Nostalgia” checklist - no presents, no traditions, no childhood room to return to like in the movies, no mom and dad and Buddy the golden retriever in reindeer ears.
So when I told the people I love about the immense pressure I felt to conform to the narratives of traditional, often white, families in commercials, conversations, and Christmas movies, I braced myself for pity reactions and uncomfortable hugs. Instead, they asked me the single most important question I never knew I needed to hear, the question that changed my mind about the holidays, about family, about love, community, and support systems.
“Can we be your family?”
Story highlights Farai Sevenzo: "I have witnessed ... the slow deterioration of people's hopes in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe"
Zimbabweans have found their voice again, Harare-born Sevenzo writes
Farai Sevenzo is a filmmaker and journalist. Born in Zimbabwe, he has covered Sub-Saharan Africa for more than 20 years as a documentary filmmaker and broadcaster in radio and television. Farai lives between London -- where he has two children -- and Nairobi, where he is the CNN correspondent.
Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) I woke on Saturday, the day of the planned solidarity march, feeling a sense of anticipation about the hours ahead. Since my arrival in Harare, the complete lack of police presence on the streets had been the most striking thing to see since the apparent coup.
I grew up in this city, and as a journalist working here in my later life, I have witnessed with my camera the slow deterioration of people's hopes in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. That a march called for by war veterans to force their former leader out of office could be joined by so many ordinary Zimbabweans seemed an exciting prospect.
Farai Sevenzo is a CNN correspondent based in Nairobi.
I wondered, though, if it would even happen.
After all, this is not supposed to happen here, this is supposed to be Mugabe's capital.

TENNIS fans love to argue about the greatest player of all time. When the conversation is limited to the men's game on clay courts, the debate has long been over. Rafael Nadal, who won his tenth French Open title on Sunday by defeating Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka, has dominated the surface like no other player in the history of the game. No other man or woman has won a single tournament—major or not—ten times, and only Bjorn Borg holds as many as six titles at Roland Garros. Mr Nadal has now done so at three different clay-court events, recording his tenth title—dubbed “La Décima”—at both Monte Carlo and Barcelona in April.
Like Roger Federer, his longtime rival, who skipped this year's clay season and returns this week on the grass courts in Stuttgart, Mr Nadal appears to be immune to ageing. During the tournament, the Spaniard celebrated his 31st birthday, an age by which many former greats have retired. Instead, he played as well as ever, losing only 35 games in his seven matches in Paris. That was just short of Mr Borg's 1978 record of 32, and set a new personal best: his previous low mark was 41, in 2008. (Mr Nadal's figure was somewhat artificially aided by the fact that his compatriot Pablo Carreño Busta suffered an injury and retired in the middle of their quarter-final match.) It was the third time that Mr Nadal has navigated all the way through the French Open draw without losing a single set.

For Mr Nadal to claim a Roland Garros trophy at age 31 is, in some ways, even more impressive than Mr Federer's surprise run to this year's Australian Open title at age 35. Compared with Mr Federer's brand of first-strike tennis, which served him well at this year's fast-playing courts in Melbourne, the Spaniard's game—like those of most clay-court specialists—is extremely physically demanding. Mr Borg played his last major final at age 25, and Gustavo Kuerten, a previous three-time champion in Paris, won his last Roland Garros match at age 27. To reach this point, Mr Nadal needed to bounce back from a recent bout of injury troubles, which forced him to miss the second half of the 2014 season and to withdraw from last year's French Open after the first two rounds.
Mr Nadal could be forgiven if he elects to borrow from Mr Federer's playbook and sit out a couple of months while the tour moves to his less-preferred surfaces, hard and grass courts. Over the course of his career, his preference for clay has been significantly stronger than Mr Federer's liking for anything but clay. According to Elo ratings—an algorithm that evaluates players based on their performances and the quality of their opponents, and can be limited to matches played on a single surface—the gap between Mr Nadal's clay-court and hard-court performances is about twice as large as Mr Federer's.
In 2009, just before that year's French Open, Mr Nadal recorded the highest-ever clay-court Elo score, at 2,543. That exceeded his hard-court Elo mark at the time by 273 points—a differential as big as the chasm between the current world number one by Elo, Novak Djokovic, and Alexander Zverev, ranked tenth. It suggests that the clay-court version of Mr Nadal at his best would beat the hard-court form of the same player 83% of the time.
Mr Nadal's penchant for clay has remained nearly as strong for most of his career: the gap between his clay- and hard-court Elo scores briefly dipped below 200 points in 2014, but has rebounded to 267 points today. His career-average surface preference is more extreme than that of any other player currently ranked in the top 50. Where you place Mr Nadal in the overall pantheon of tennis greats depends largely on whether you think he should be rewarded or penalised for deriving such a disproportionate share of his value from just one of the sport's three environments.
By contrast, surfaces have had a much smaller impact on Mr Federer's game. His Elo scores on hard courts have usually been less than 150 points higher than his marks on clay. And after he won the 2009 French Open—one of only three times since 2005 that the trophy did not go to Mr Nadal— Mr Federer's clay rating actually surpassed his hard-court number. Of course, that did not make him a better clay-court player than Mr Nadal: the Spaniard's clay-court Elo mark was still over 200 points higher than Mr Federer's, implying that Mr Nadal would have a 77% chance of winning a match between them on clay at that point. But it does show that Mr Federer was a more well-rounded player.
It would be unfair to dismiss Mr Nadal as a one-trick clay pony. In the past, single-surface specialists went to great lengths to maximise the share of their matches played on their preferred court type. Guillermo Vilas, the previous record-holder for most titles on clay, played a whopping 60% of his career on that surface. Today, however, scheduling is more rigid: three of the four grand-slam tournaments are played on hard or grass courts, as are six of the nine events in the second tier of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tour, the Masters 1000 series. And Mr Nadal cannot be accused of selectively skipping events to pad his win rate. Clay-court events represent just a third of his total.
Moreover, Mr Nadal has proven that he is still an all-time great during the majority of his matches that occur on hard or grass courts. He has won five majors on other surfaces. Taking the average ratings from the eight-year span when their rivalry was at its peak, from 2006 to 2013, Mr Federer led Mr Nadal in hard-court Elo by a respectable 141 points (2,320 to 2,179), while Mr Nadal led in the clay-court category by a much larger 227 points (2,496 to 2,269). Those ratings imply odds of 69% for the Swiss on hard courts, but 79% for the Spaniard on clay. Mr Nadal outperformed those probabilities on both surfaces—he won seven of twelve matches on hard courts and twelve of fourteen on clay—but the ratio is about right.
Now that Mr Nadal is over 30, it is tempting to assume that his days of contending for titles in non-clay events are over. However, his hard-court Elo score still ranks fourth in the world, behind Mr Djokovic, Mr Federer and Andy Murray, the defending Wimbledon champion. And although grass-specific ratings are less reliable, because relatively few events are played on turf, Mr Nadal did go on to win Wimbledon in each of the past two years that he claimed victory at Roland Garros without dropping a set. The clay-court master may not have to wait until next spring to improve his case to be considered the greatest of all time—on any surface.
Missing out: New Zealand referee Henry Perenara will not be heading to England for the Four Nations. Credit:Brendon Thorne London calling? 2. An interesting proposal from within an NRL club to revitalise the World Club Series fell off the back of a truck outside Set of Six Towers over the weekend. Rather than playing the second-placed Super League team from the previous year, the NRL runners-up would travel to England to play the NRL premiers in a season-opening spectacular at a major London venue such as Wembley Stadium. Not only that, the match would be a double-header with a round-four Super League game in which the previous year's grand finalists would meet for the first time since. Positives: exposing Super League to London-based antipodean expats, bringing a crowd from the north, creating a new occasion. Negatives: detracting from the actual WCC, the NRL being currently hidden away on Premier Sports and lead-in time required seemingly being beyond the current NRL administration.
Neutrality neutralised 3. Match officials from neutral countries are a given in many sports – but since rugby league only has two full-time professional competitions, it gave up such altruism a few years ago. However, in Four Nations tournaments it has at least been possible to have a referee in the middle from a neutral country for each game … until now. New Zealand will not be sending a referee to England, which basically means Henry Perenara misses out. That, in turn, means when England play Australia, we'll have a referee from one of those countries, perpetuating a handy little yarn reporters covering these things have been writing for almost a generation now. World famous in Serbia 4. Prop David Andjelic is getting used to being an internationally recognisable reality TV star as he returns to the country he and his family fled when he was just a one-year-old. Andjelic, who starred in The NRL Rookie, is playing in World Cup qualifiers for Serbia and was approached by star-struck fans after playing in the 50-0 loss to Wales in Llanelli at the weekend.
"It was a war-struck country, we left as refugees and immigrants," he told Set of Six. "All my family is in Serbia … it's me and my mum against the world in Australia." The NRL Rookie was popular on Sky Sports, which no longer shows NRL matches. Frizell a World Cup certainty 5. Tyson Frizell can pretty much block off two months at the the end of next year. It seems, one way or another, he's playing in the World Cup. After five caps for Wales, the St George Illawarra star made his Australia debut on Saturday. And although Wales coach John Kear isn't a fan of the new rule allowing tier two nations to pick the top three's leftovers, in the case of Frizell he says he'll happily use it.
"He sends us a good luck message before our game, which indicates how much he likes the guys he plays with here and that he cares about us," said Kear. 'I'm not so sure it's a rule that I like but I'm a coach, aren't I? You ask any coach and what they want is the best players on the football field. If Tyson isn't required by Australia I'll shake Mal Meninga's hand and we'll give him the No.11 shirt."

England officials will naturally prefer there aren't too many personal questions when their new coach, Wayne Bennett, faces the media during the Four Nations.

Waterproof garden labels are the best thing since sliced bread! They allow me to record details of plantings right on site including variety, planting date and even instructions on care for others. Most importantly they can handle the rain and constant watering with a hose. They are AWESOME!
If you are serious about you garden crops then waterproof garden labels are a must!
Why are waterproof garden labels so great?
1. Unlike many other signs we use (like popsicle sticks or rocks) there is no painting and no hassle.
2. You can use just a standard pencil to write on the. Mind you, I confess that I like to use a 2B pencil rather than the normal 2H pencil – just cause 2B is softer and darker (and easier on my aging eyes).
3. You can ADD information to them as you go. This is really the magic of these – you can have information right in your garden.
4. They last for almost FOREVER! You can erase the pencil with a good soft eraser and start a fresh.

What is sensation play? It's basically light bondage. Don't be scared by “light bondage.” Those two words can seem very intimidating for beginners, but it doesn't have to be. Did you know that it could be hard and rough or slow and gentle? If you are a beginner, you can enjoy play that relies on surprises and stimulation.
Here are some suggestions of luxurious light bondage gear and how to introduce sensation play:
Cold
Ice=goose bumps, right? Cold can be very exciting and painful at the same time. Run an ice cube down your partner's neck, on their back, or between their legs. Cooling personal lubricant is another way to add cold excitement in the bedroom.
Hot
Hot wax or a hot stone massage can also be thrilling and a fun way to experiment. Just be careful that you use specially designed massage candles or the wax might be too hot and burn. (Massage candles are designed to burn at a lower temperature than a regular candle and are usually made of soy wax. Soy wax is also biodegradable and easy to clean up.) Although warming lubricant is not hot, it is still a fun and different sensation when experimenting with temperature.
Stimulants
Sexual stimulants provide extra sensation. This can be used on the nipples, clitoris or other parts of the body. Sensation balms usually tingle and are ideal for partner participation.
Deprivation
Sensation play not only includes adding sensations, it can also include taking away a sensation. This results in heightening the remaining senses. This is referred to as sensory deprivation. Blindfolds and wrist cuffs work best for sensory deprivation.
Tickle
Laughter is sexy. Feather ticklers are a great way to inspire laughter (or torture)!
Flogging
Many people enjoy impact play because they find it fun and erotic. Erotic spanking is done with an open hand, a paddle or a flogger. There are many different types of floggers that deliver a variety of sensations:
Super Light: silk or satin
Light: deerskin or lightweight suede
Medium: elk hide, moose or heavier suede
Hard: braided, buffalo hide, bull hide or rubber
The length of the tassels, as well as the thickness of the tassels can affect the impact of a flogging. The location on the body where you land will also determine how much a flogging will sting.
Paddling
Have you been naughty? A proper spanking can cure those who are naughty. A paddling is usually done over their knees. If the paddle is heavy, then the wollup will be more painful. For beginners, leather paddles deliver less of a blow.
Prickly
A Wartenberg Wheel was originally designed as a medical device to test nerve response. Many people like to use these pinwheels as a sensation instrument over their partner's flesh. It delivers a prickly sensation but does not hurt or break the skin.
So, what are you waiting for? A little bit of cold, hot or spanking never hurt anyone. Whether you use luxurious light bondage gear or high-end sex toys, remember to HAVE FUN!!
It's often presented as an either-or proposition: If you want to conserve water, replace your lawn with drought-tolerant plants or replant some of that turf with a vegetable garden.
But if you've ever attempted to keep thirsty food crops alive in a dry, hot California summer—a summer like the one we're experiencing, one of the driest and hottest on record—it doesn't take much time holding a running hose to realize that a vegetable garden sucks up plenty of water too. Picking the right varieties of beans, tomatoes, watermelon, and other plants can help cut down on how much you're sprinkling on the beds. Similarly, working drought-tolerant native plants into the design of your food garden can help conserve even more water—and make your yard more productive. Instead of either-or, why not both?
Related Why You Should Remember to Stop and Plant More Flowers
The edges of my backyard are dominated by plants that I rarely, if ever, have to water—perennials such as white sage and annual wildflowers such as the California poppy, our state flower. The passive maintenance and plentiful blooms make these plants an easy, beautiful addition to my yard, and they draw a lot of bees and other pollinators. But after reading Dan Barber's new book, The Third Plate, in which he spends an almost inordinate amount of time talking about how crop rotations create healthy soil, I became mildly obsessed with figuring out ways to create a more harmonious, beneficial relationship with my vegetable garden and native landscaping.
Barber writes about a farmer in upstate New York, Klaas Martens, who plants a series of soil-enriching crops in advance of the heirloom wheat that drew Barber, the chef at the farm-to-table restaurant Blue Hill, to his farm. Buckwheat and clover are two of those crops, as are other legumes, which have the unique ability to transfer nitrogen—vital to plant growth—from the air into the soil.
It just so happens that perennial buckwheat, a cousin of the annual crop grown for its grain-like seed, is one of the dominant plants in the Southern California landscape. A native clover grows here too, as well as plenty of other nitrogen-fixing perennials—plants that not only add fertility to the soil but attract a host of bees, moths, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Instead of trying to re-create the intricate series of crop rotations Martens practices on a far smaller scale, why not reimagine them in a more stationary, California-centric manner?
After a wildfire leaves an area cleared out, some of the first plants to emerge from the charred earth are lupines, which are legumes (think beans and peas) that, in addition to having beautiful spikes of pale-blue flowers, help encourage more plants to grow with the nitrogen they add to the soil. Annual arroyo lupine could be similarly employed in a garden, used as a soil-enriching cover crop in late winter and spring, preparing a plot for summer's tomatoes or other warm-season vegetables. Not only does it add fertility, but lupine has deep roots that break up compacted soil, improving drainage and water retention.
There are perennial lupine species too, such as silver bush lupine, which add nitrogen, attract pollinators, and send roots farther into the dirt year after year. Planted in between fruit trees or next to garden beds that won't be receiving too much water in the dry summer months—if watered like you water thirsty lettuce, they won't only fail to thrive but will likely die—a plant like silver bush lupine can contribute to your garden both above and below ground.
For buckwheat, the prospects are somewhat different, as the cover crop only pays off when the plant is turned back into the soil, releasing nutrients such as phosphorus as it decomposes. For slower-growing, long-living perennial varieties, it doesn't make sense to grow them from seed and turn them back into the dirt over the course of a few months. That's not to say they can't help support a vegetable garden. The popcorn-like clusters of flowers, varying from white to pinkish-red depending on the variety of buckwheat, bloom in the summer months, long after the wildflower explosion of wetter spring. Not only do they help draw in native pollinators once the rains go away, but the flowers last, staying on the plant throughout the summer and into the fall, turning a dark red-brown as the weather cools. They can pull in bugs to help pollinate an entire growing season's worth of crops and need little water to do so. The same can't be said for a border planting of marigolds or nasturtiums.
‘Scott Walker thinks that the Capitol is some sort of palace and he has his own palace guards'
A Wisconsin lawmaker who was tackled by police while trying to get into the Capitol Thursday says the blame lies squarely with Gov. Scott Walker (R).
Wisconsin state Rep. Nick Milroy (D) told Raw Story that while police “overstepped” by tackling him, ultimately Walker was to blame for creating “chaos in the state.”
A judge had ruled Thursday that the Capitol must be cleared for 48 hours while it was cleaned. Protesters had been occupying the building for weeks, demanding Walker drop his effort to bust union bargaining rights.
Milroy told Raw Story that he was merely returning from dinner when officers had set about clearing the building of protesters.
“Upon returning to the Capitol, I was initially told by an officer that I was not going to be allowed entry into the building,” he said. “I walked passed her and up to the door and flashed my ID and another officer opened the door to allow me in.”
“As I was entering the building, the first officer yelled that I wasn't going to be allowed access, and that's when an altercation broke out.”
A WISH-TV video shows a gang of Capitol police tackling the congressman.
“I don't blame the officer. I think he probably did overstep his bounds but I think there was a miscommunication,” Milroy added. “These are the sort of things that happen when you have a leader that creates chaos in the state.”
“I put all the blame on Scott Walker for all of the ridiculous things that have been happening in Wisconsin, and this is just another example of poor leadership by Scott Walker, you know, shutting down the Capitol to the public, denying legislators the right to enter the building to collect their personal belongings.”
“I'm a veteran. I've had many veterans come up to me. I had a veteran come up to me the other day and tell me how disgusted he was that the building was not open to the people of Wisconsin. I mean, people have fought and died for their freedoms. And one of those freedoms is that the state Capitol has always been open for business during business hours,” the South Range Democrat said.
“It's very disturbing that Scott Walker thinks that the Capitol is some sort of palace and he has his own palace guards every entrance.”

Sources tell ABC 33/40 Gov. Robert Bentley is expected to appoint Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange to the U.S. Senate following the resignation of Jeff Sessions to become U.S. Attorney General.
The U.S. Senate confirmed Sessions' appointment Wednesday evening.
Strange practiced law in Birmingham before becoming Alabama Attorney General.
He's currently the Chairman-Elect of the Republican Attorneys General Association.
Strange was one of six on the governor's short list for the position. He declared his interest in the Senate seat early on and has already begun raising money for the election in 2018.
Once Strange assumes the role as U.S Senator, Bentley will be responsible for naming a new Alabama Attorney General.
This is a developing story and ABC 33/40 will update this story as more information becomes available.
Obama exploits Iraq crisis as pretext for war against Syria
By Patrick Martin and Joseph Kishore
20 June 2014
The Obama administration is utilizing the crisis in Iraq as an opportunity to escalate the US war drive throughout the Middle East, with Syria in the crosshairs.
On Thursday, President Obama held an afternoon press conference in which he announced that the US would send 300 military advisers to Iraq as part of a military deployment that includes plans for a bombing campaign ostensibly targeting an insurgency led by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Following this announcement, a conference call was held with three unnamed administration officials. When a reporter asked whether US attacks on ISIS would be limited to Iraq, given that ISIS operates on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border and controls significant territory in eastern Syria, one official responded that “we don't restrict potential US action to a specific geographic space.”
“The president has made clear time and again that we will take action as necessary including direct US military action if it's necessary to defend the United States against an imminent threat,” the official added. ISIS “operates broadly, and we would not restrict our ability to take action that is necessary to protect the United States.” The official also included “our homeland” among the regions threatened by ISIS.
Citing “senior administration officials,” the Washington Post reported that the administration “has begun to consider the conflicts in Syria and Iraq as a single challenge.” The situation in Iraq could “force the administration to reconsider its calculations in Syria”—including military strikes and more advanced weaponry to the US-backed opposition.
As the WSWS warned, the American ruling class has “no shortage of foul and bloody tricks up its sleeve” in response to the debacle in Iraq, a debacle created by a brutal and bloody war and occupation. The US is now seizing on the crisis it created to reverse its failure to launch air strikes against Syria last August, a retreat now widely viewed as disastrous within US ruling circles.
The diplomatic and military shift to target Syria was prepared the day before Obama's press conference in an op-ed column published Wednesday in the New York Times, written by Anne-Marie Slaughter, a leading member of the Democratic foreign policy establishment who served as director of policy planning for the State Department under Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2011.
Slaughter's commentary criticizes Obama's failure to act in Syria. “Why is the threat of ISIS in Iraq a sufficiently vital interest, but not the rise of ISIS in Syria?” Slaughter asks, before concluding, “The answer … may well involve the use of force on a limited but immediate basis, in both countries.”
Slaughter's former boss, Hillary Clinton, has in recent days given a number of interviews in which she states that she favored bombing Syria, a position that she also outlines in her newly published memoir.
With no public discussion, and in the face of widespread popular opposition, the Obama administration is now preparing to drag the country into an open-ended conflict that threatens to engulf the entire Middle East, involving Syria, Iran, Turkey and the Gulf monarchies.
Nor is the conflict confined to the Middle East. The war drive against Syria is inextricably tied to the US and European-backed campaign against Russia, a major Syrian ally. Opposition from Russia was a significant factor in the decision by the Obama administration to temporarily pull back from war against Syria last year. This was followed by the operation in Ukraine to unseat a pro-Russian government and provoke a confrontation with Russia itself.
In its reckless war fever, the foreign policy of the United States is riven by contradictions. While the operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan are supposedly aimed at targeting Islamic militants, the US and its allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar have in fact financed these forces—including ISIS—as part of the campaign against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad. While the ISIS-led insurgency in Iraq is the pretext for bombing Syria, it is in fact the Syrian government, not ISIS, that would be the target.
Moreover, the civil war in Syria is a direct consequence of the civil war in neighboring Iraq deliberately instigated by the US occupation regime, which sought to crush resistance in the Sunni community by encouraging Kurdish separatism and mobilizing Shiite militias in a war of extermination in 2006-2007.
After deliberately fomenting sectarian conflict, the US is now denouncing the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for failing to unite the ethnicities and religions of Iraq.
The crisis in Iraq is also seen as an opportunity to effect a certain restructuring of Iraqi politics, in particular by removing Maliki. At Thursday's press conference, Obama confined himself to pro forma declarations that it was up to the Iraqi people, not the US government, to decide who should govern Iraq. But the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the administration “is signaling that it wants a new government in Iraq without Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.”
The fact is, Maliki was installed in office after the US military conquered Iraq, and he was a puppet of the occupation regime. Should Washington decide he has become too much of an obstacle, Maliki will be terminated as soon as a suitable replacement can be found.
All of this is being carried out in complete violation of international law. At Thursday's press conference, not a single reporter thought to ask Obama what was the legal justification for the announced troop deployments. It is the position of the Obama administration that the president has the right to wage war against anyone, anywhere, without even the pretense of a congressional, let alone popular, mandate.
Obama met with the top congressional leaders of both parties at the White House Wednesday, and according to press reports, none raised any constitutional objection to US military intervention in Iraq or the broader Middle East.
“We had a good discussion,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said, adding that Obama “indicated he didn't feel he had any need for authority from us for steps that he might take.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, added that she did “not believe the president needs any further legislative authority to pursue the particular options for increased security assistance discussed today.”
The vast majority of the American people oppose any reentry of US military forces into the cauldron of Iraq, let alone US intervention in Syria, but this intense antiwar feeling finds no expression within the US political establishment and its twin parties of imperialist war.

Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro has been awarded the Confucius Peace Prize, China's alternative to the Nobel. Castro was praised for “important contributions on eliminating nuclear war after his retirement,” and will get US$15,000.
The 88-year-old icon was selected from 14 individuals, including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and two organizations, to win China's peace prize, state newspaper the Global Times reported on Thursday.
"While in office, Castro didn't resort to violence or force to settle disputes in international relations, especially with the United States," the report said.
"After his retirement, he has been actively meeting with leaders and groups from all over the world and has made important contributions to emphasizing the need to eliminate nuclear war."
Castro stepped down due to health concerns in 2008 after 49 years in power, and did not travel to Beijing to receive the prize. The award in the form of a gold statuette and $15,000 was received by a Cuban student who will pass it on to Castro.

The Cuban leader follows in the steps of prior recipients such as former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and then Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin which also failed to attend the Chinese ceremonies.
The Confucius prize was proposed by businessman Lui Zhiqin and was first awarded in 2010 as an eastern alternative to the Nobel Peace Prize. In was created following the Norwegian Nobel committee's decision to honor imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.
On Wednesday, the Norwegian committee awarded 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo. The Pakistani girl, who survived a shot in the head by a Taliban gunman for speaking up in favor of women's education, is the youngest laureate. She shared the award with Kailash Satyarthi, Indian children's rights advocate and an activist against child labor.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City police boost security at synagogues during the holiday season because nearly half the plots to attack the city in the past 20 years were aimed at Jewish targets, law enforcement sources said on Thursday.
Since al Qaeda militants flew hijacked airliner attacks into New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the city considers itself a prime target and authorities traditionally increase security during the busy holiday season.
While law enforcement sources said there was no information to indicate New York would be targeted this holiday season, authorities are still wary after a Nigerian man tried to bring down a Detroit-bound passenger plane on Christmas Day in 2009 with a bomb hidden in his underpants.
New analyses from the New York Police Department (NYPD) Intelligence Division showed that since 1992, eight of 18 plots to attack the city targeted Jewish institutions or Jewish people in New York, law enforcement sources said.
The intelligence analyses also found that New York City had at some point been home to 44 extremist militants since 2002.
Of those, 43 were captured, while Samir Khan, editor of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine, was killed by a CIA drone strike in Yemen in September.
In the past decade New York City has developed extensive intelligence and counterterrorism divisions. In response to the new intelligence reports, New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said: “Fortunately the NYPD has gotten close to (the extremists) without their knowledge.”
It's not an exaggeration to say podcasting just had its best year ever. From President Barack Obama appearing on “WTF With Marc Maron” to “Serial” getting its own Pandora station, the rising audio medium cemented its place among the most popular methods of media consumption in 2015.
But in 2016, everything about podcasting is going to change. Thanks to a number of rapidly evolving technologies and changes in listener behavior, a lot of the seismic shifts that have swept across other digital media will shake up podcasting, too, making its ads more easily targeted and its shows easier to discover and share.
Below are a few of the forces that will turn the podcasting industry on its head next year.
People Aren't Downloading Audio Anymore
If you listened to any well-known podcast in 2015, you likely heard the show's host read the ads. Those spots were designed that way out of necessity; unlike most other kinds of digital media content, which can be loaded up with ads that target people based on things like their gender, physical location and age in real time, it is technologically difficult to change the contents of a downloaded file.
“The downloaded, disconnected listener or listening experience is challenging [for advertisers],” said John Rosso, the president of market development at Triton Digital, a digital audio advertising firm.
Changes in user behavior are starting to eliminate that challenge. As audio content has become a mobile-first medium, the share of people streaming, rather than downloading, podcasts and other digital audio content has changed dramatically. According to Rosso, Triton's publisher partners now see that more than half of the listens initiated are started as streams rather than downloads. In some cases, the share of streamed listens is as high as 70 percent, and that number is poised to grow.
With that shift underway, publishers have seized the opportunity to change the way ads are inserted into shows. Acast, a Swedish company that both develops shows and helps producers monetize their podcasts with dynamic ad insertion, closed funding rounds totaling $10 million just months after setting up shop in the United States. In August, Panoply, a leading podcast publisher owned by the Slate Group, announced it had acquired Audiometric, an Australian company that dynamically inserts ads into audio shows.
“The ad market for podcasts is evolving very fast,” said Måns Ulvestam, Acast's co-founder and CEO.
In 2016, host-read ads will continue to be part of a podcast fan's listening experience. But they will be joined, or in some cases supplemented, by ads that are inserted into your shows based on where and when you're listening to them.
Tweetable Highlights
One thing podcasters are hoping will drive more of these streaming listens is a much-improved slate of recommendation and discovery tools.
For all the positive numbers that podcast enthusiasts point to, the reality is that podcasting has stalled in its cross-over to the mainstream. Awareness of podcasts as a medium has been flat for the past couple years, according to Edison Research, and until recently, the medium has lacked tools that make it possible to easily spread podcast content around.
The problem, again, was one of form rather than function. “When it comes to new content, audio's the wrong unit size,” said Parviz Parvizi, the co-founder of Clammr, a tool that allows people to share small pieces of longer podcasts on social media. “It's not browsable. You can't swing by and get an impression.”
Parvizi and his co-founder, David Silverman, expect that making it easier to embed smaller chunks of episodes on social platforms like Twitter and Facebook will solve that problem. Early signs indicate they may be right. Parvizi and Silverman note that an episode that's been widely shared on social media using tools like theirs gathers 10 times more plays than one that doesn't, and their sales pitch has resonated. Since relaunching as a platform tool in December, publishers including BuzzFeed, the Financial Times, Midroll and Podcast One have signed on as launch partners.
Creating something that can be experienced within the flow of a visit to Facebook, Twitter or something else makes a big difference too. “Audio needs to be part of a native experience,” Parvizi said.

Podcast Archives Will Get More Searchable
Unlike for most other digital media, search engines do not crawl and index podcast content. While a Google search might yield a YouTube video or a tweet, finding podcasts that focus on specific topics via search is a challenge. An avid New York Knicks fan might assume that the sports radio world is talking about rookie phenom Kristaps Porzingis, but up until recently, he would have had a hard time finding specific episodes of "The Dan Patrick Show" or "The Bill Simmons Podcast" where he's discussed.
A number of companies, including Pop Up Archive, have made it easier for both podcast listeners and producers to index and archive their shows, so users can surface older episodes that are relevant. Pop Up Archive, which started out serving public media companies, transcribes shows, adding tags and keywords, then makes it searchable, either internally or for the general public at Audiosear.ch.
“Just think about how much evergreen content there is that's untapped,” Pop Up Archive co-founder Anne Wootton said.
Instead, let's try a different approach in creating a Product Backlog for Quire, with Quire
We first put down the core values that drive the development of our product:
Although these “epics” are too large to be estimated with any reliable accuracy, they do paint a better picture of what values this product would bring.
We then expand on each epic, specifying more stories, or even more epics, that would build on top of these foundations toward our product:
Notice this tree-like structure fits naturally with how we had developed our ideas.
If we make the analogy that the product is a tree, then the the epics would be the main branches of the tree. With the conventional Product Backlog, we are picking up a leaf here and there at the ends, stacking them up without seeing what the whole tree looks like.
With Quire's tree structure, we can nest stories within other stories(or epics) so we're always made aware of their context and not lose focus on what value we wish to bring forth in the product.
But we are supposed to prioritize the Product Backlog Items?
The convention dictates that we put the Product Backlog Item with the highest priority on the top of the list; but there are other alternatives to highlight our immediate concerns than a sorted list.
We can define priority level tags such as PL1, PL2, and so on; upon the Product Owner gets all the necessary information to prioritize the tasks, he or she can assign these tags to tasks that are in considerations for the upcoming Sprints:
Although it's best to estimate efforts on tasks as a group in a meeting room, with team members often reside on different continents, Quire's live chat feature is a good alternative
During the Spring Planning Meeting, when it comes to picking the items to commit to the next Sprint, team can then use Quire's filter function to display only the items that are of immediate concern:
OPINION:
HAVE you ever been labelled a criminal and had a police operation trying to bring you down?
It's the horrible feeling I deal with every day of my life. No, I'm not a drug dealer, I have never committed assault and stealing cars seems a little too dangerous for my liking.
My crime is being a cyclist in the city of Sydney.
Yes, I am one of those vile citizens who cares for the environment and likes to keep fit by using a bicycle as my main method of transport.
I'm almost certain that even though I don't wear lycra, the NSW government would like to lock me up and throw away the key for my disgusting crimes against humanity.
The constant police crackdowns on cyclists combined with some of the world's most expensive fines highlight Sydney's backwards attitude towards something that should be encouraged.
In addition to the whopping $319 fine riders face for wearing no helmet — despite studies showing it doesn't improve safety — the horrific crime of riding on a footpath is also the subject of the constant police operations.
The law stipulates that children under 12 years of age can ride on a footpath and an adult rider supervising a cyclist under 12 can also do the same. For everyone else there is a $106 fine for the act.
Currently NSW and Victoria are the only states that do not allow riding on the footpath with care, but now two peak cycling bodies have launched a campaign to change this.
media_camera Look at these disgusting criminals getting fit and saving the environment.
Bicycle NSW has joined peak cycling body Bicycle Network's call to lift bans on cyclists on footpaths, which would bring the state up to speed with the rest of country — Western Australia and South Australia both overturned the ban in the past two years.
“There needs to be a change in the current cycling environment in NSW. Children are being forced to ride on the road at the age of 12, ” Bicycle NSW chief executive Craig Meagher said in a statement.
“Adults who are rediscovering bike riding are being left with no option but to battle the roads. This is not an environment that encourages bike riding.”
To help convince the government to make the changes, Bicycle NSW has created a petition for legalising footpath riding.
And while I am more than happy to sign the petition, it's worth noting that I am going to continue riding on the footpath regardless of whether the law changes or not.
Sure I might be risking multiple $106 fines, but if you have ever commuted into the city on bicycle, you will understand why.
I would be more than happy to use the bicycle paths provided for the daily commute from my home to the office, if they existed.
The problem is Australia's largest city has failed to future-proof infrastructure to cater for those using alternative forms of transport, which means bike paths only exist sporadically throughout my commute.
In moments where there are not bike lanes, I have the option to ride on the road or along the footpath.
media_camera Don't worry, I will be sensible when riding on the footpath.
I am not sure if you have ever cycled on the road next to vehicles in the middle of Sydney, but I can attest it's a very uncomfortable feeling for both myself and my mother who worries her lovely son will end up under the wheel of a truck while riding to work.
With police more worried about cyclists not having a bell than enforcing the law which requires motorists to leave one metre of space when passing a cyclist in speed zones of 60km/h or less and 1.5 metres in higher speed zones, is it any wonder I ride on the footpath.
Why would I want to physically feel a car pass me on the road when I could happily ride on a footpath wide enough to fit a 15-piece marching band?
And close calls aside, there is the also small fact that the minuscule area of gutter I am supposed to ride has more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese.
For those outraged by my willingness to ride on the footpath, have a think about how you would feel paying thousands of dollars on a road cycle only to have it constantly damaged because the government doesn't want to provide you with sufficent infrastructure.
And for those worried about getting cleaned up when I am riding on the footpath, I would just like to clarify that I am not going all Cadel Evans and cycling at 60km/h, I understand I am sharing the space and act accordingly.
If you have read my point of view and can't agree with my logic not riding on the road, all I can say is sucked in because I am not going to damage my bike or put my life at risk when there is a perfectly safe footpath to ride on.
Don't like me doing it? Build better infrastrucure for cyclists and it won't be an issue. Simple.

In a nondescript building in San Francisco's Potrero Hill, a diverse group of entrepreneurs, doctors, financiers and artists gather for the monthly Bronze Party -- an event where couples dance, drink and, if they're up for it, have sex with other partners.
The Bronze Party is referred to as a "lifestyle party," a modernized term for what many refer to as swinger's parties.
Downstairs at the party, women wear stilettos and fishnet stockings and mingle with their significant others. Many take off garments as the hours pass. Upstairs, there's what's referred to as a "play room," full of mattresses covered in red sheets, where couples tend to gravitate later in the evening. They may have sex with each other. They may switch partners. Some just watch.
These types of events are nothing new, but what makes this one different is its high-tech nature. Ben Fuller, who started throwing the Bronze Party in 2011, is a former tech entrepreneur who sold his first company in 2000 for just less than $5 million. He said there are 1,300 active profiles for people who attend the Bronze Party.
Fuller and a colleague also run Modern Lifestyle, an online platform that connects about 50 sex clubs around the country. Their software gives people the ability see who's attending events and purchase tickets. They sold $3 million in tickets last year.
Fuller also capitalizes on some of the tech-oriented members in his own backyard. He says there are several tech entrepreneurs who attend events and provide valuable feedback.
"They often have great ideas about technology ... that I can apply here at Bronze Party, " he says, citing an iPhone developer who helped manage contact information, email experts who've helped get around Gmail filters, and a user experience designer who helped redesign the website and mobile app.
"We are in Silicon Valley," says Stella, an engineer who attends. "People here don't have a very high tolerance for bad websites."

Stella has been with her husband, Greg, both engineers, for 10 years. They've been swapping partners for two of them.
"Whereas you might go to a bar, pick up somebody and take them home for the evening if you're single, here it wouldn't be unheard of to do that even if you're married," says Greg.
Members are also discovering the Bronze Party through apps like Secret, which allows users to post anonymously, Fuller says.
"We just heard from a threesome -- two women and a man -- who said 'Oh, we heard about it on Secret.'"
In the '70s, swinging was often random. "Key parties," as they were called, refer to events couples attended. At the end of the night, men would put their keys in a bowl, women would pick a key and go home with the guy who owned it.
Those communities still exist, but tech is now making it easier for people to find one another, Fuller says.
"In the old days, you never knew where you were going," Fuller says. "Now you get a really good sense. The event details ...even the pictures of the people that are going to be attending the party."
In preparation for events, many Bronze Club members use a feature called, "Auto Date," Fuller says.
"[It] allows you into the party itself, to choose the people that you're interested in, and if you choose and they choose, you get a notification," he says.
A 21st century take on the key.

The criterion for "human-competitiveness" is that an automatically created result is considered "human-competitive" if it satisfies at least one of the following eight criteria.
The first annual "Humies" competition was held at the 2004 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2004) in Seattle. Entries were solicited for cash awards for human-competitive results that were produced by any form of genetic and evolutionary computation and that were published in the open literature during previous year (i.e., between July 1, 2003 and the deadline for submissions of June 23, 2004). The publication can be a conference paper (e.g., a regular paper, poster, or late-breaking paper) or any work published elsewhere in the open literature (e.g., a journal article, technical report, thesis, book, book chapter) or other paper that has received final unconditional acceptance and not subject to further editing (that is, is "in press").
THE enormous stress of the night of the bank guarantee may have caused Brian Lenihan's pancreatic cancer, his aunt Mary O'Rourke believes.
THE enormous stress of the night of the bank guarantee may have caused Brian Lenihan's pancreatic cancer, his aunt Mary O'Rourke believes.
She says that Brian, then Minister for Finance, was under tremendous pressure when the bank executives came into Government Buildings on the historic night in September 2008 to beg for help to stop them going bust. It ended with them getting a state guarantee.
"On a human level I believe that that night of huge burdens on Brian and all the many stresses of the time which followed took a massive toll on his health, and may even have sown the seeds of his pancreatic cancer," Mrs O'Rourke writes in her new book.
"I do not think I am being fanciful when I say this because there is a clear link between physical illness and emotional stress. . . the burden placed on him that night was enormous and in some important senses he was alone in taking the decisions he had to take."
She says Brian had a "wonderful adviser" in economist Alan Ahearne and a "worthy comrade" in Taoiseach Brian Cowen.
"But the enormous scale and and the import of the choices he was confronted with, along with the very poor, patchy and inconsistent advice from the Department of Finance advisers -- all of this added up to a huge cauldron of worry and concern for Brian," she writes
"In the end, a decision had to be taken by him on whom the crown had been laid, which now had become a crown of thorns."
The autobiography, 'Just Mary -- A Memoir', is published by Gill & Macmillan and was launched last night with former President Mary McAleese.
It also says that the roots of the financial crisis go back to the flawed budgetary policy in the early years of the boom. She blames Charlie McCreevy and Mary Harney for this, which was a result of their obsession with low taxes and stoking up the economy.
"Despite never joining the PDs, Charlie McCreevy remained a neo-liberal at heart. During the time they worked in Cabinet together, he and Mary Harney were essentially the nexus of much that happened there.
"It was in essence they who decided budgetary policy. . . they would only allow the Taoiseach in at the end of such deliberations," she writes.
"The parameters and small print of the Budget were often worked out between Charlie McCreevy and Mary Harney. . . Bertie Ahern was sometimes peripheral."
O'Rourke goes on to say that the economic policies that were followed at the time "would ultimately work to compound the problems associated with the construction boom".
She says the neo-liberal philosophy shared by McCreevy and Harney meant a hands-off approach to the economy. "Regulation of the banks -- or the lack of it -- is where so many of our difficulties lay," she writes.
The consensus at the Cabinet table was that "the lighter the touch a government could have in terms of financial regulation, the better".
O'Rourke says that the troubles in the Irish banks arose because everyone wanted to copy Anglo Irish Bank, which was giving out "stupendous business loans and 100pc mortgages to anyone who asked".
She says that the head of Anglo, Sean FitzPatrick, was "like a god whose toga people wanted to touch and clutch on to".
But she says he was a "false god" -- and when someone tried to introduce them at a function during the boom, she refused to meet him.
O'Rourke is also critical of the Croke Park Agreement, which, she says, has its roots in the benchmarking system that became a "ridiculous giant beyond our control".
"Initially, you had to show that you had increased your productivity. But of course that was soon forgotten."
She says this system "very quickly got out of hand and many of the work targets set for each sector of workers is just never achieved. . . the public sector grew out of control".

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Some 29 people, 20 of them women, were killed on Saturday evening in an apartment building in eastern Baghdad by gunmen wearing a mix of plain clothes and camouflage, a police officer and a hospital official said.
The police officer told Reuters that he had witnessed a gruesome scene at the building in the neighborhood of Zayouna:
“When we walked up the stairs, we saw a couple of women's bodies and blood streaming down the stairs. We entered a flat and found bodies everywhere, some lying on the sofa, some on the ground, and one woman who apparently had tried to hide in a cupboard in the kitchen shot to death there.”
Shi'ite militias have been accused by locals of carrying out killings of women branded as prostitutes in that district of the capital, though there was no way to immediately confirm who was responsible for the attack.
Dell's built quite a reputation for delivering solid monitors at reasonable prices, and it's now expanded its offerings in a fairly big way with no less than five new S Series models, some of which boast edge-to-edge glass and/or IPS panels. On the top end is the 27-inch S2740L, which has the most connectivity options of the lot (DVI, VGA, HDMI and a pair of USB ports) and, of course, the highest price tag at $400. From there, things drop to $300 with the 24-inch S2440L (the only non-IPS model of the lot), and go all the way down to $200 for the 21.5-inch S2240M -- the three lower-end models ditch the edge-to-edge glass but still retain minimal bezels. Unlike some of the company's higher-end UltraSharp models, though, all five monitors have a 16:9 aspect ratio instead of 16:10, and you'll get a standard 1920 x 1080 resolution regardless of the size you choose. Complete specs for each can be found at the links below.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Richard Galpin reports on the Tripoli clashes
Lebanon has sent troops to the port city of Tripoli after at least 10 people were killed in clashes linked to unrest across the border in Syria.
Security forces were deployed after the country's Prime Minister Najib Mikati visited to try and stem the violence.
The clashes came after UN peace envoy Kofi Annan warned sectarian violence in Syria could spread across borders.
Recent weeks have seen increased clashes between armed Alawite groups and Sunni fighters in the city.
"The Lebanese army and internal security forces need to take all measures to stop the clashes in the city of Tripoli, without discrimination," a statement from Mr Mikati's office said.
Armoured vehicles were seen on the streets of the city but no shots were fired, a Reuters report said.
Spilling over
Fighting was concentrated in Tripoli's Bab al-Tebbaneh district, a mostly Sunni Muslim community, and the pro-Damascus Alawite Jabal Mohsen neighbourhood.
Although there have been on-off clashes between gunmen in neighbouring Tripoli districts, Saturday's death toll is believed to be the highest in a single day.
The BBC's Jim Muir, in Beirut, says that the fighting pits Sunni gunmen - who support the uprising in Syria - against Alawites, who back President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite-dominated regime in Damascus.
These sectarian fault-lines run through the region and connect in Syria, fuelling the fear that the possibility of an all-out civil war in Syria could have dangerous repercussions for its neighbours.
"We are being targeted because we support the Syrian people," one Sunni gunman told Associated Press Television. "We are with you [Syrian people] and will not abandon you," he added.
On 14 May, five people were killed in similar clashes after a Sunni cleric, Shadi al-Moulawi, was arrested on terrorism charges. His supporters say he was held because he helped Syrian refugees.
In February, two died when supporters and opponents of Mr Assad clashed.
Community leaders in Lebanon have repeatedly warned of the possibility that the violence in Syria would spill over the border. Lebanon is already hosting thousands of Syrian refugees.
Last month, 11 Lebanese Shia Muslim pilgrims were abducted, reportedly by a Sunni rebel splinter group, in Syria.
On Friday, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, called for their release.
The September issue of Square Enix's G Fantasy magazine revealed on Tuesday that manga creator Samako Natsu will launch a manga for the Dance with Devils project in the magazine's next issue on September 18. The manga is titled Dance with Devils -Blight- .
The magazine notes that the manga will tell an original story, different from that of the upcoming anime. Anime scriptwriter Rika Nakase ( Rocket Girls , Junjō Romantica ) is credited for story composition. Game developer Rejet's Hirotaka Maeda provided the original character designs.
The anime's official website previously streamed a promotional video for the anime.
The anime will premiere in October. Game developer Rejet, music production studio Elements Garden, and music production company Avex announced the project in February.
The story revolves around Ritsuka Tachibana, a female second-year high school student who attends Shiko Academy in Shiko Town. She enjoyed her school life while living with her mother Maria, but one day, that balance fell into ruin. The anime is a story of Ritsuka being loved and being attracted to demons.
The voice cast for the anime includes:
Himika Akaneya as 16-year-old second-year high school student Ritsuka Tachibana. She is an utterly ordinary girl who lives with her mother.
Sōma Saitō (Mysterious Joker, Haikyu!!) as Rem Kaginuki, a young man who is the president of Shikō Academy, but is in fact a devil. He has a hard-working personality, but also has a cool personality.
Wataru Hatano (Hamatora, Yumeria) as Lind Tachibana, a third-year in high school and the heroine Rikka's elder brother. He is an exorcist who hunts devils, and has a cool and stoic personality.
Takashi Kondo (Black Cat, Pretty Rhythm Aurora Dream) as Urie Sogami, a devil and the vice president of Shikō Academy. He is an elite dream devil who is known by people all throughout the devil world, and is very popular with the ladies.
Subaru Kimura (Penguindrum, Doraemon) as Mage Nanashiro, a devil and the secretary of the Shikō Academy student council. A confident and self-centered young man, he lives impulsively.
Daisuke Hirakawa (Blue Spring Ride, Hiiro no Kakera - The Tamayori Princess Saga) as Shiki Natsumezaka, a fallen angel and the treasurer of the Shikō Academy student council. He is a strange person even within the academy, and is always aloof.
Ai Yoshimura (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Blue Spring Ride) is directing the anime at Brains Base (Natsume's Book of Friends, One Week Friends). Tomoko Konparu (Uta no Prince-sama - Maji Love 1000%,Blue Spring Ride) is in charge of the series scripts based on the original concept by Rejet's Daisuke Iwasaki and the original story by Grimoire Henshūshitsu. Elements Garden is composing the music, and Elements Garden's Junpei Fujita and DIVE II Entertainment are producing the music. Rejet's Hirotaka Maeda provided the original character designs, and Yuka Takashina is adapting those designs for the anime.
Wataru Hatano performs the anime's opening theme song "Kakusei no Air," while Pentacle★, a unit composed of the main voice actors Sōma Saitō, Hatano, Takashi Kondo, Subaru Kimura, and Daisuke Hirakawa, is performing the ending theme song "Mademo★iselle."

Question: Which is worse? Screaming shrill, partisan questions in a sacred place or being told to kiss an ass for doing so?
Less than a hundred yards from Poland's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and in obvious coordination with one another, the media conspired to fabricate a gaffe to feed their insatiable anti-Romney narrative about his overseas trip.
What we're seeing now is that in order to justify their screaming of shrill, partisan questions within throwing distance of a sacred place (talk about epitomizing the Ugly American stereotype), the media is now lying through an act omission by fabricating the idea that this was all Romney's fault because he refused to make himself available to the media.
Over at Politico, Jonathan Martin repeats the media talking points we're now reading and seeing everywhere:
Romney has not held a media availability for his traveling press corps since taking three questions outside 10 Downing Street in London last Thursday.
The trick the corrupt media is playing here is in what they don't tell you, which is that Romney has probably answered over a HUNDRED questions during his overseas trip.
Yes, that's right, Romney sat down with Greta, Brian Williams, Piers Morgan and Wolf Blitzer at different times DURING this trip and answered every question thrown at him.
So the media's nonsense narrative to justify their appalling behavior is a bald-faced lie.
I repeat the question: which is worse? Screaming like Ugly Americans in a sacred place or being told to kiss an ass for doing so?

As the manager of The Killers, Robert Reynolds is one of the best-known behind-the-scenes players on the Vegas music scene. We caught up with him during the band's current tour to get his thoughts on continued success and future change.
How do you think the perception of Las Vegas as a music city has changed since The Killers first broke? I think Las Vegas has always been a music city, with residencies from Sinatra to Wayne Newton to Elton John. And great bands have toured here ever since I was a kid. If there's been a change, I think it's the idea that Las Vegas has a local music scene and is capable of breaking new artists. Since The Killers, our city has done this a couple of times.
You're part of the Emerge Impact + Music Conference, set for April in Las Vegas. Why did you want to get involved? It's harder now for bands to break than ever. My heart goes out to those who are struggling to cut through the noise, talented artists fighting impossible odds to make a living doing what they love. Above all, Emerge is designed for them. I love the mission. I also love our partners.
The Killers' first album in five years is also their first No. 1 in America and worldwide. Wonderful Wonderful was also our fifth consecutive No. 1 in the U.K. and received our highest Metacritic score ever. ... This is all great, but you have to take industry stats with a grain of salt. Hot Fuss and Sam's Town ought to have been No. 1 albums and received similar acclaim. The Killers consistently make the best albums they can and are proud of the results. All we can do is hope that our fans agree. Thankfully, this time around it seems like they do.
The Killers have two shows coming up in Las Vegas. After all these years and so much success, what does it mean for the band to come back and play for the hometown crowd? I remember some of the earliest shows at Cafe Roma, Tramps and the Huntridge [Theatre]. At first, breaking in Vegas seemed almost insurmountable. Now, it's become a celebration. Everyone's family and friends come out. Our guest list is through the roof. The band was thrilled to open the T-Mobile Arena, and it's been a collective dream to play the MGM Grand. For me, being part of all this, particularly in your own hometown, is exciting, emotional and humbling.
Managing changes to APIs is hard. That is no surprise to anyone who has ever maintained an API of any sort. Web services, being a special case of API, are susceptible to many of the difficulties around versioning as other types of APIs. For HTTP based REST style web services the combination of resources and content negotiation can be used to mitigate most of the issues surrounding API versioning.
Let's assume you have a REST/HTTP web service that has some account resources. Say you can make a request like this:
===> GET /accounts/3 HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml <=== HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml <account> <name>Inigo Montoya</name> </account>
First, you probably noticed that my example uses a vendor MIME media type to describe the representation. Using a more generic MIME media type like application/xml is much more common, at least in my experience. Using generic media types is perfectly legal but a bit silly. You are not really asking for any old XML document, but rather an XML document that has a quite specific schema. Aside from my idealistic rantings, using a specific media type has some strong practical benefits which are at the core of this post.
Backwards compatible changes
Often changes will need to be made to expose new behavior of the system that do not negatively impact correctly implemented clients. Say, for example, you want to start tracking email address for accounts. If the application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml format documentation is clear that elements that are not recognized should be ignored you can simply add a email element to the account representation.
<account> <name>Inigo Montoya</name> <email-address>mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example</email-address> </account>
Any client that was created before the addition of the email element will simply ignore it's presence. Problem solved.
Incompatible changes
Unfortunately, not all changes can be implemented in a way that is backwards compatible. For example, a couple of months after adding email to account the sales team sign a deal for 1 bazillion dollars. But the new customer demands that each account be allowed to have more than one email address. After thinking for a while, you decide that the best way to expose that is by changing the account representation as follows.
<account> <name>Inigo Montoya</name> <email-addresses> <email-address priority='1'>mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example</email-address> <email-address priority='2'>mailto:vengeance@youkilledmyfather.example</email-address> <email-address> </account>
That, of course, will break any clients that are expecting the old format – so pretty much all of them. This is a place where we can bring content negotiation to bear. You can simply define a new media type – say application/vnd.mycompany.myapp-v2+xml – and associate new multi-email format with it. Clients can then request whichever format they want. Older clients don't know the new media type so they get served the older single email format.
===> GET /accounts/3 HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml <=== HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml <account> <name>Inigo Montoya</name> <email-address>mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example</email-address> </account>
Newer clients do know the new media type so they can have access to the new functionality.
===> GET /accounts/3 HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/vnd.mycompany.myapp-v2+xml <=== HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/vnd.mycompany.myapp-v2+xml <account> <name>Inigo Montoya</name> <email-addresses> <email-address priority='1'>mailto:prepare-to-die@youkilledmyfather.example</email-address> <email-address priority='2'>mailto:vengeance@youkilledmyfather.example</email-address> <email-address> </account>
Everyone gets what they need. Easy as pie.
Alternate approaches
The most commonly proposed approach for versioning REST/HTTP web service interfaces today seems to be to mutilate the URIs by inserting a version. For example,
http://foo.example/api/v1/accounts/3
I really hate this approach as it implies that an account in one version of the API is really a different resource than the account in a different version of the API.
It also forces clients into a nasty choice, either support multiple versions of the API simultaneously or break one of the core constrains of REST. For example, say a client exists for the v1 API that saves references (URIs that include the version indicator) to accounts. Some time later the client is updated to support the new version of the API. In this situation the The client can support both versions of the API simultaneously because all the previously stored URIs point at the old version of the API or it has to mung all the URIs it has stored to the point at the new API. Munging all the URIS breaks the HATEOAS constraint of REST and supporting multiple versions of the API is a maintenance nightmare.
Conclusion
Changes to REST/HTTP web service interfaces come it three basic flavors, changes to the properties associated with a type of resource, additions of new types of resources and deprecation of obsolete types of resources. If you are following the HATEOAS constraint of REST the approach described here can be used to safely handle all three scenarios.
This approach does lead to media types being created, but media types are cheap so we can – and should – have as many as we need. Used properly, content negotiation can be used to solve the problems related to versioning a REST/HTTP web service interface.

Three years ago Maker's Row set out to solve a problem.
“From first-time entrepreneurs to big brands, everyone faces the same problem when it comes to finding a factory in the US,” said Matthew Burnett, CEO, Maker's Row told IndustryWeek. “When your resources are limited, your options are limited and overall business suffers. Our group provides the means to which a good idea can become a great product here in the United States.”
The industry that Burnett focused on was the apparel and accessories since it is now more of a demand model. “Companies no longer have the luxury of long lead times that are necessary when sourcing overseas.” Explained Burnett.
So he and co-founder Tonya Menendez created on online matchmaking service. For each stage of production there are available sources. The six stages are ideation, pattern making, material, sample making, tooling and production. For example in the ideation stage the site offers names of factories that can help refine an idea and analyze the different components that are involved in bringing the idea to production. At the production stage information on factories in all fifty states is available.

Since the site launched in November 2012, Maker's Row has connected over 80,000 businesses with domestic manufacturers, creating over 1.5 million products.
As their marketplace for American manufacturing continued to grow, Maker's Row realized that they were in the unique position to showcase American made products and on Sept.3 they launched The General Store. “It is an immersive online experience that explores Made in America on a consumer level,” the company said.
The store is a showcase of brands that use Maker's Row factories to develop their collections here in the United States. The store features products that range from unique, one-of-a-kind pieces to everyday classics.
“We're aiming to cultivate an experience that's as welcoming as visiting your neighborhood corner store, with an array of unique products you won't see anywhere else,” said Burnett.
A University of Wisconsin-Madison event seeking to help the campus forge bonds with the Muslim community and better understand hijabs was promptly accused of cultural appropriation.
The “Hijabi for a Day” event, organized by the Muslim Student Association and Wisconsin Union Directorate Global Connections Committee, invited women to wear headscarves and also to talk with a Muslim woman about the head covering's meanings, which can vary widely.
But Farhat Bhuiyan, one of the event's organizers, said that two or three students claimed it was cultural appropriation, while four more expressed worries that participating could be offensive or “problematic.”

“I personally don't understand why some people thought it was cultural appropriation, because first of all, Islam is not a culture,” Bhuiyan tells Heat Street . “It's a religion. The religion does not associate with any one culture.”
Bhuiyan says she hoped the event would help those who view Muslim women with fear understand that “we are humans too, and normal, good people.”
“I think some people thought that this event was some sort of ‘step into hijabis' shoes and feel discrimination,' or something stupid like that,” Bhuiyan says. “But this was really focused on normalizing something our society often associates with different or dangerous people.”
Bhuiyan says that whether or not to wear a hijab is a personal religious choice. Right now, Buhiyan says, she has opted not to wear one, though she's considering whether to do so in the future.
Most of Buhiyan's family members do wear a hijab, she says, explaining that she's knowledgeable about that choice. Muslim women wear the hijab for a wide variety of reasons, she said, and she wanted her fellow students to understand some of the garment's cultural and religious significance.

Teen scientist harnesses sun power to help Navajo community
VIDEO
New Mexico teen Raquel Redshirt uses everyday materials and the sun to build solar ovens, fulfilling a Navajo community need and winning an award at the Intel ISEF competition.Growing up on New Mexico's Navajo Nation, Raquel Redshirt was well aware of the needs of her community. Many of her impoverished neighbors lacked basics such as electricity, as well as stoves and ovens to cook food.Though resources in the high desert are limited, Raquel realized one was inexhaustible: the sun. “That's where I got the idea of building a solar oven,” the teen says.She researched solar ovens and found that most incorporate mirrors or other expensive materials. Raquel wanted to create a design that anyone could easily afford and replicate, using readily available materials.She built and tested ovens made of old tires, cardboard, aluminum foil, tape, and insulating materials, including shredded paper and plain old dirt.
Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is ready for war. He told an audience today that he doesn't shy away from a fight, even a tough one like repealing the health care reform law passed in March.
“One of my heroes is a guy named Davy Crockett,” Barton said this morning. Crockett and the rest of the doomed defenders of the Alamo “fought a fight that most people thought was hopeless,” Barton added, saying that because they did, Texas eventually became the state it is today.
“One of Crockett's sayings is ‘be sure you're right, then go ahead,” Barton said, turning to the health care law. “The right thing to do is repeal this bill…and we're gonna do it.”
War on Obamacare wasn't the only one Barton declared before an audience at the Heritage Foundation today.
The ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and one of the men vying to be the next chair of the powerful panel when Republicans take over the House next year, Barton laid out his plan for, essentially, undoing most of what President Obama and Democrats accomplished in the past two years. He laid out the central fronts: the battle to repeal what he calls Obamacare, the fight against the EPA, backing the growing insurgency opposed to net neutrality regulations, taking on “environmental radicalism” and — of course — defending the “traditional, incandescent light bulb” against government regulators who want to replace it with what Barton called “the little, squiggly, pig-tailed ones.”Barton's ascension to the chair of Energy and Commerce is not assured. His appearance at the Heritage this morning came on the heels of a tough campaign he launched on Capitol Hill to get the gig. Barton would need a waiver of House Republican committee term-limit rules to get the chair — though he disputes that — and the waiver could be tough to get when House Republican leaders meet to set up their team before January. Barton has at least two strikes against him. First, he ran against the likely next Speaker, John Boehner, back in 2006 when Republicans were choosing a minority leader.
Second, he became a household name when he offered a surprising public apology to BP after the Obama administration made a deal with the energy giant requiring it to pay for the damage caused by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. For a brief moment (perhaps difficult to remember in the days after the GOP's electoral sweep), Barton's apology put Republicans on the defensive and put a spring in the Democrats' step.
In short, if Republicans are excited at the prospect of still having Nancy Peolsi to kick around, Democrats are probably just as happy about the idea of Barton at the head of Energy and Commerce. Barton's plan to overcome these strikes against him, it seems, is to lay out an aggressive conservative agenda for the committee that sticks to tea party talking points.
“Within the Energy and Commerce committee we are ground zero in the effort to reestablish conservative principles in the Congress and by extension in the country,” Barton told the audience at Heritage today. Barton said the committee has primacy over health care reform, a power he intends to wield should he get control.
“I have advocated that we make Obamacare repeal House bill number one,” Barton said. “It will be the first priority of the Energy and Commerce committee.”
Barton said he planned to replace the law with fresh legislation that would “replace” the horrors of the Democratic law with bills that would ensure preexisting conditions are covered and tort reform is enforced. He also called for rules allowing insurance to be sold across state lines.
“We have to put reforms in the system so that people who want health reform can get it in a cost effective fashion,” Barton said.
But wait, Barton seemed to say, there's more. He took credit for shutting down cap and trade, claiming that if the Republicans and some Democrats on the Democratically-run Energy and Commerce committee hadn't tried to shut down the bill there (they failed and it passed the House), the Senate GOP never would have had the gumption to filibuster it.
“We began to sow the seeds of the ultimate destruction of that bill,” Barton said.
Barton intends to keep on fighting environmental fights, even ones that got him in trouble in the past. I asked him after the meeting if he intended to go after the offshore oil drilling regulations Obama put into place following the Gulf oil spill. He said that though most of that fell under the jurisdiction of the Resources Committee, he'd do what he could to fight yet another war against the president.
“To the extent that we have jurisdiction, I would like to take a look at some of that,” he told me.
The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday sued the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the government agency that operates the capital region's subway system and its primary bus network. The ACLU argues that the transit agency's policies for accepting advertisements on its subway stations, trains, and buses violate the First Amendment by discriminating against controversial and non-mainstream viewpoints.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit are ideologically diverse: the ACLU itself, an abortion provider, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and alt-right-Internet-troll-to-the-point-Twitter-actually-banned-him Milo Yiannopoulos.
The inclusion of a self-described "alt-right" figure like Yiannopoulos helps to demonstrate the ACLU's point that WMATA's policy squelches free-speech rights across the political spectrum. But Yiannopoulos' inclusion has also raised the hackles of some on the political left, who see associating with the controversial author as beyond the pale. Chase Strangio, an ACLU attorney who has represented whistleblower Chelsea Manning, posted a statement calling Yiannopoulos "vile" and attacking the ACLU for defending his First Amendment rights.
But the ACLU has a long history of defending the First Amendment rights of groups far outside the mainstream, including Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. As such, the organization hasn't backed down from its defense of Yiannopoulos. "Protecting the First Amendment rights of all of these speakers is crucial to the ability of civil rights movements to make the change we need to make," the group argued in a Wednesday blog post.
Vague and discriminatory
The controversy began in 2015, when anti-Muslim activist Pam Geller tried to place ads depicting a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad on DC subways. That put WMATA in a difficult position, because some Muslim extremists have threatened violence against anyone who publishes Muhammad cartoons.
In an apparent effort to duck the controversy, WMATA announced that it was suspending "issue oriented" advertising across the board.
Of course, the big problem here is that it's not so clear what counts as an "issue oriented" ad. For example, military contractors have long taken out lavish ads touting their latest fighter planes. Are they merely advertising commercial products or are they trying to influence policy decisions about what hardware to buy?
The ACLU believes that the "no issue ads" standard is unworkable and unconstitutional, and it assembled a group of plaintiffs to illustrate the point:
The ACLU itself sought to place ads displaying the text of the First Amendment, in English, along with translations into Spanish and Arabic. These ads were rejected because WMATA "does not take any issue oriented advertising."
The abortion provider Carafem submitted an ad to promote an FDA-approved abortion pill "for Abortion Up to 10 Weeks. $450. Fast. Private." WMATA rejected the ad, and even the agency selling the ad space on WMATA's behalf was surprised. "Quite honestly, we do not see why this was not approved, your ad doesn't appear to be in violation of any of the guidelines," the agency wrote. WMATA told Carafem that "because your ad addresses the controversial topic of abortion and promotes a particular abortion product, it is issue-oriented."
Milo Yiannopoulos is a writer who has grown famous by baiting liberals on issues like race and gender. He was uninvited from the conservative CPAC conference after video surfaced of him defending pedophilia, and he has been banned from Twitter for repeatedly encouraging followers to harass women and minorities like Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. When he published a book earlier this year, WMATA initially accepted ads for the book—ads that didn't themselves make any controversial statement about issues. But after a public outcry, WMATA backtracked and removed the ads. WMATA refused to explain to Yiannopoulos why it removed the ads.
WMATA rejected ads from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals that would have read "I'm ME, Not MEAT. See the Individual. Go Vegan." WMATA rejected the ads as impermissible issue ads. As the ACLU notes, WMATA has accepted ads that promote "eating animal-based foods, wearing clothing made from animals, and attending circus performances at which animals are made to perform in unnatural ways."
A couple of things are obvious from this list. First, while Yiannopoulos' participation in the lawsuit has gotten the most attention, the ACLU isn't only defending the rights of right-wing provocateurs like Yiannopoulos and Geller. Groups defending left-wing causes like animal rights and abortion rights have also been affected.
Second, while WMATA might have thought "issue ads" were a clear and value-neutral category, in practice it has turned out to be unworkably vague. Rules that allow companies to hawk fighter jets and hamburgers, but ban anti-war and animal rights groups from advertising, is the opposite of viewpoint-neutral. The WMATA's guidelines give the agency unfettered discretion to decide which positions are too controversial to appear in ads, and that seems hard to square with the First Amendment.
Hate speech and free speech
The ACLU is generally viewed as a liberal group, but its absolutist stance on the First Amendment doesn't fit well with everyone on the political left. A growing contingent of left-wing thinkers have come to see "hate speech" as a serious problem and free speech absolutism as an obstacle to addressing it.
Controversy has become more common over the last eight months as the ACLU has attracted a wave of new supporters alarmed by the Trump presidency. Many people donated to the ACLU in the expectation that the group would oppose Trump administration policies—and the group has done plenty of that. But not all of the ACLU's new donors understood the depths of the ACLU's commitment to free speech rights.
"Especially for many of our new members, they may be surprised by the ACLU's robust First Amendment positions," ACLU staff attorney Lee Rowland said in February. "But it's certainly not new."
Over time, defending the free speech rights of right-wing extremists has become something of a trademark for the group. For example, in 2012 the ACLU sued the state of Georgia defending the right of the KKK to "adopt a highway" in the state. In 2010, the group defended the free speech rights of Fred Phelps, the infamous pastor who pickets the funerals of LGBT soldiers with anti-gay messages.
The ACLU has been doing this kind of thing for almost 100 years now, and it's not likely to stop any time soon. Individuals who don't want their donations supporting the rights of people who engage in "hate speech" might be wise to research organizations ahead of time.
In one​​ of the more bizarre minor streaks in sports, the Bulls have won 18 consecutive games on TNT Thursdays at the United Center. Jason Patt of FanRag Sports first brought attention to the streak, and it even has its own #TNTBulls hashtag on Twitter.
The streak has spanned parts of five seasons, two head coaches, and dozens of players, from Vladmir Radmanovic to Paul Zipser.
Jimmy Butler is the only player on the roster who remains from the first game of the streak, which was a 118-111 win over the New York Knicks on April 11, 2013. Butler played 50 minutes (!!!) in that game. The rosters change, but playing Butler into the ground never will.
There are so many weird and crazy things about the #TNTBulls streak. It's not as if the Bulls are playing bad teams. TNT usually tries to schedule good matchups, and Bulls' opponents were a combined 386-258 going into those games, which included a handful of early season contests. The Bulls have won by an average of 9.1 points, which is the type of point differential that you'd roughly expect from a 66-win team.
The high scorers from some of those games have been all over the place too. The Bulls have won in so many unexpected ways and gotten the game of a lifetime from some of their role players when their stars have been out.
In the first game of the streak, the Knicks were 51-26 and winners of 13 in a row, but Nate Robinson dropped 35 points to end their winning streak. On March 13, 2014, the Houston Rockets were 44-20 but Mike Dunleavy scored a team-high 21 points to lead the Bulls to a 111-87 win. The Cleveland Cavaliers were 33-21 coming into the Feb. 12, 2015 matchup, but they didn't have an answer for Tony Snell. Yes, Tony Snell. He scored 22 points and was a plus-29 in a game the Bulls won 113-98.
Top 3 favorite moments during the streak:
There have been some fun individual moments during the streak. My favorite by far has to be E'Twaun Moore coming out of nowhere to out-duel Russell Westbrook in the Bulls' 108-105 win on March 5, 2015. Moore hit a clutch 3-pointer on a play that was originally designed for Pau Gasol. It ended up being the game-winning shot and the biggest shot to date of Moore's career.
Derrick Rose has had his share of big shots for the #TNTBulls, but the most memorable was his game-winning floater over Tyson Chandler in the second game of the streak on Oct. 31, 2013.
The shot was great, but my favorite part was seeing Spike Lee looking like he wanted to die as he watched the replay of Rose's floater on the United Center's scoreboard after the play.
Last but not least was the Bulls' win in Fred Hoiberg's first game as an NBA coach. The Bulls had championship aspirations entering last season, and they beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in their season opener thanks to Pau Gasol's block in the closing seconds on LeBron James.
Those were happier times, indeed.
A list of all of the games

Last August, “I am Rich” App was launched at Apple iPhone Store priced at $999.99 and all it did was show the image of a Gem. There is another $999.99 iPhone App this year which might actually be worth the price called BarMax.

Review includes: Constitutional Law, Contracts, Crimes, Evidence, Real Property, Torts, Remedies, Professional Responsibility, Civil Procedure, Business Associations (Corporations, Agency & Partnership), Trusts & Wills, and Community Property
Mike Ghaffary came up with the idea when he himself was preparing for the bar exam. He could not believe BarBri charged the $4,000 to send him an iPod with audio notes on it, and that there was no real competition in the space. So he got in touch with some successful iPhone app developers in Los Angeles, as well as some fellow Harvard Law graduates to create the app. Ghaffary, who is the director of business development at TrialPay by day, is serving as an advisor now to the team. How this app sells will be interesting to say the least. Ghaffary confirmed that it is the most expensive app in the App Store, surpassing a home security app that sells for $899. Many iPhone developers have complained about a race to the bottom for app prices, but a few have tried to sell more expensive applications, such as Wolfram Alpha. But that $50 app doesn't really give you anything you can't get on its website, it just dresses the data up to look nicer on the iPhone. BarMax CA, again, is attempting to save law students thousands of dollars. It's a good experiment, if nothing else. Ghaffary notes that while Apple was extra careful in checking BarExam CA out due to the high price, they had no problems getting it approved, and Apple generally seemed pleased with the idea.Source: www.techcrunch.com

This is a topic we've been thinking of covering in Stream This for a long time.
Each week, we delve into stories from the world of digital entertainment, seeing what's available on Netflix, YouTube, shomi, CraveTV, Crackle, iTunes and others. There are a lot of quality options out there. But is it time to finally ditch your cable bill?
“It seems to be the time of year for that kind of choice, because everyone's looking forward to the new school year,” says Carmi Levy, an independent technology analyst and journalist based in London, Ont. “They're considering their family budget, and they're starting to make decisions. They're changing their phones; they're changing their entertainment options. And in many cases, they're deciding, ‘The things I've had for many years, it's time to switch them up a little bit.'”
Thinking of making a change for autumn? We've reached out to some of Canada's smartest technology journalists and authors to help you weigh that decision. Here are some things to consider if you're contemplating cutting the cord:
ANALYZE YOUR INTERNET USAGE:
Since you'll be streaming video instead of watching traditional TV, you'll want to make sure that your Internet plan gives you enough gigabytes per month. Could it be time to switch to an unlimited plan? “It may cost you an extra $10 a month from your Internet provider, but make sure you have unlimited,” says Marc Saltzman, technology columnist and broadcaster. “You're not going to want to go with anything less, because the last thing you want to do is watch your data per month.”
TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR ROUTER:
This isn't something that a lot people think about, but it might be time for an upgrade. “A router that's been around for five-plus years probably isn't going to be up to the task of handling multiple video streams in your house,” says Levy. “So, newer routers are just better. They're faster, they're more robust, they're easier to set up and they're more secure.”
ASSESS YOUR DEVICES:
Do you have all of the necessary hardware in place, or do you need to purchase something new? If you've got a video game system like the PS4 or Xbox One lying around, you might be able to use that. Some cord-cutters prefer streaming set-top boxes like the Roku 3, and others like to stick with either Apple or Google products. “That's like the basics you have to have in place – either you need an iPad and an Apple TV, or a Nexus 9/Samsung Galaxy Tab plus the Chromecast,” says Daniel Bader, editor-in-chief of Canadian tech site Mobile Syrup. “You're probably in the best position to have access to everything as soon as possible with an iPad, because Apple products tend to get the newest apps first, and the quality is usually the best.”
MANAGE YOUR SERVICES:
So, which streaming service do you sign up for? This question will be even more relevant in the next little while, as shomi and CraveTV eventually become available to all Canadians – not just people who are already consumers of Rogers, Shaw or Bell. We're also assuming here that you won't be using virtual private networks to access titles from the U.S., or torrent clients to download content illegally. In terms of the above-board services, it might not hurt to sign up for a few at the same time, especially since many of them offer free trial periods. “If you're a cord-cutter, rather than getting all of your stuff in one place, like you used to do with TV, you're going to have to get it from several different sources,” says Peter Nowak, technology journalist and author of Humans 3.0: The Upgrading of the Species. “But, that said, it's still probably going to end up being cheaper than what you were paying for TV.”
PREPARE TO LOSE OUT ON SPORTS AND LIVE TV:
You have to think about how much you value watching sports or live events. Will you feel like you're missing out if you're not able to follow along with the Toronto Blue Jays, or watch the Academy Awards? While most major sports leagues offer their own streaming services, these can often be pricey and include regional blackouts. And Sling TV has been earning some praise in the U.S. – since it gives users a package of channels, including ESPN, for $20 a month – but it's not available in Canada. “You may be relaxing on a Sunday afternoon, going, ‘You know, I'd really like to watch the baseball game, it's too bad I cancelled my Rogers,'” says Saltzman. “There are certainly more options than ever before, but expect some remorse for cutting the cord.”

The U.S. economy continues to sputter along with a cloudy outlook. The Federal Reserve indicated as much last week when it decided to maintain its monthly $85 billion bond buying program to prop up economic growth. “Conditions in the job market today are still far from what all of us would like to see,” said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke at a press conference announcing the continuation of the easy-money plan.
But pockets of the U.S. are primed for growth thanks to pro-business regulatory environments, educated workforces and reasonable business costs. Leading the way is Virginia which tops Forbes' eighth annual list of the Best States for Business. Virginia has ranked second the past three years, but returns to the head of the pack for the first time since 2009.
Our study looks at six important factors for businesses: costs, labor supply, regulatory environment, current economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life. Virginia is the only state to rank in the top five in four areas—only missing on costs and growth prospects.
Virginia ranks first among the states in the regulatory category because of its business-friendly government policies and strong incentive offerings. The tort system is one of the best in the country for businesses, according to the Mercatus Center's report “Freedom in the 50 States.” Virginia is also one of 24 right-to-work states, which explains why only 4.4% of its workers are in unions — fifth lowest in the U.S.
The Old Dominion State ranks second in an annual study by Park Ridge, Ill.-based Pollina Corporate Real Estate that measures states' economic development programs and departments. “Virginia's flexible incentive programs can be adapted to meet the needs of businesses across different industries,” says the study's author Brent Pollina.
“We don't lead with incentives, but we do recognize that we can use them to level the playing field,” says Virginia Economic Development Partnership CEO Martin Briley. He says that only 15% of corporate expansion or relocation deals over the last 10 years in Virginia have included tax incentive programs, but they skew toward larger companies as these deals created 40% of the new jobs.
Technology companies have been busy expanding in Virginia to take advantage of the largest concentration of high-tech workers in the U.S. (9.8% of the state's private sector workforce is in tech, according to TechAmerica Foundation's annual Cyberstates report). Amazon.com has added roughly 2,000 jobs in the area over the past two years for two distribution centers and its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services. Microsoft has invested $1 billion to build and expand a data center in southern Virginia.
Virginia's $446 billion economy held up better than most states during the Great Recession thanks in part to spending by the federal government. But the state has a diverse economy with strengths in bioscience, logistics, manufacturing and technology. There are 31 companies (public and private) with more $3 billion in sales headquartered in Virginia, the seventh largest concentration of big companies of any state in the Union. The corporate giants based in Virginia include Altria Group, Capital One Financial and General Dynamics.
However, it is hardly all clear sailing for Virginia. It faces potentially the biggest fallout of any state from sequestration and cuts in federal spending. Roughly 30% of Virginia's economy is tied to the federal government, according to Briley, and the state is the leader in Department of Defense contracts. But Briley expects the private sector to "fill in the gaps" on any government cutbacks. “The diversity of the economy is quite huge, so we will be able to absorb anything that comes down the line,” he says.
VEDP launched a $2 million “Going Global” program last month to help defense contractors in Virginia pitch their expertise to customers overseas. Virginia-based defense firms like General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman don't need VEDP's help with foreign governments. They already have large international operations and expertise, but the program can help smaller defense players that are heavily reliant on the U.S. government.

Our Best States ranking looks at 35 data points across six main areas. Business costs, which include labor, energy and taxes, are weighted the most heavily. We relied on 10 data sources; research firm Moody's Analytics was the most-utilized resource (click here for a detailed methodology).
North Dakota finished a close second behind Virginia. North Dakota has boasted the country's most robust economy over the past five years. It is tops for job growth (3.7% annually), income growth (3.8%), gross state product growth (7.9%) and employment (3.6% average jobless rate). To provide context to North Dakota's boom, consider the second fastest growing economy over the past five years was Oregon's at 2.8% a year, versus nearly 8% for North Dakota's $66 billion economy.
With the nation's third-best economic growth forecast over the next five years, North Dakota's outlook looks strong, too. Credit the development of the Bakken oil shale fields in the western part of the state for much of that growth, as well as thriving technology and service sectors.
Last year's No. 1 state, Utah, falls from the top spot for the first time since 2009 and ranks No. 3 overall. The state still has a very pro-business climate and companies benefit from energy costs that are 29% below the national average. Utah's economy has expanded at 2% a year over the past five years—fourth best in the U.S., but job and income growth has slowed relative to the rest of the country, which knocks Utah down two notches.
The biggest gainer this year is Minnesota, which jumped 12 spots to No. 8 on the strength of an improved economic outlook. The Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area serves as the state's economic hub, with companies such as Target, U.S. Bancorp, General Mills , 3M and Medtronic headquartered there. Minnesota has the second highest percentage of adults with a high school degree at 92.5%. With its good schools, low poverty rate and healthy population, the state also scores well on quality of life measurements.
Wyoming had the biggest fall, down eight places to No. 23. The nation's least populous state ranks sixth best for business costs, but the economy has slowed and is expected to expand at just a 1.5% annual clip through 2017, worst in the U.S.
Maine ranks last for the fourth straight year. Not much has changed. It is still burdened with an aging population and a weak economic forecast. Job growth projections are the worst in the U.S and only Vermont is expected to have slower household income growth over the next five years, according to Moody's Analytics.

“There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” So says Hamlet, poking gentle fun at the science (“philosophy”) of the day. A few centuries later an increasing number of scientists, and philosophers, seem inclined to agree. The more we learn, the more mystified and wondrous we become at the impossibility of really knowing how anything works, or even what really is.
Apparently, there is just what's happening.

If we think of our industrial civilization as a patient (though it might be fairer to describe our planet as the patient and civilization as the disease), the diagnosis that has been made on these pages and elsewhere for some years now is unchanged. The writers about collapse on my right sidebar can give you the daily scorecard (eg Gail is writing about the gap between the price of oil that producers need to get and the price that consumers can afford to pay, and about the myth of renewable energy being cheap to bring on at scale; Ilargi's writing about the unaffordability of maintaining industrial civilization's essential infrastructure). But in any case the patient has less than a century to live, and its declining years are not going to be healthy.
The patient, Industrial Civilization, has three essential organs without which it dies: a perpetually growing economy (its heart); stable, affordable energy (its blood); and a diverse environment with an extremely stable climate (its body). These are now all on life-support.
The economy increasingly looks like the first organ to fail. Real economic growth for all but the 1% has ceased, while the ever-swelling population adds relentlessly to the pressure for even more. Spending is now almost completely dependent on unsustainable ever-increasing borrowing, which depends on a willingness of those with money to lend, and on insanely low interest rates that only governments, idiots and the clueless would lend at.
For two centuries, almost 100% of economic growth has been the result of ever-increasing supply and use of cheap (relative to earning power) energy, which as Gail explains is now at an end. And as we're seeing in more and more places (storm-damaged cities, inundated islands, drought-ravaged nations whose soil has turned to dust and natural resources exhausted), increasing climate instability means settlement in any one place for an extended period of time is becoming more and more foolhardy, and yet our whole civilization has been built on, and needs, settlement and stability. This ‘patient' needs constant ‘transplants', increasing in frequency.
So this is Industrial Civilization: A frail heart needing more and more blood in a body increasingly wracked with injuries and illnesses. And we're all dependent on this ‘patient' for our very survival. Betting our lives on this patient was a poor decision, but it seemed to make sense at the time. And for generations we've just doubled down on the bet, because it's the only game we remember how to play. Sad, understandable, unavoidable, and fatal. Fatal for the patient, but not for the remnants of our foolish and arrogant species, or for the at least temporarily diminished diversity of life on our suffering plant. The play of life will go on, with other, hopefully more fortunate players. After us the dragons.

Teach Your Doctor: Doctors get almost no training about the essential connection between good nutrition and health. Those that have learned, didn't learn from conferences or books. As Michael Greger explains (37 minute mark of video), when doctors explain their appreciation of this connection their story almost invariably starts with “I had a patient…” Learn to self-manage your health, starting with finding the diet that works for you. (Be careful to avoid the quacks, and beware what the food industry tells you.) And then teach your doctor.

Let's Call the Fentanyl Crisis What It Really Is: The CBC's Jeremy Allingham laudably calls upon doctors, politicians and media to call the problem of people dying from toxic and adulterated street drugs — prescription or no — what it really is: a poisoning crisis, not an ‘overdose' crisis. Their deaths weren't suicides; they were murder by unscrupulous or indifferent pushers. Let's stop blaming the victims. And let's stop depriving chronic pain sufferers of much-needed prescription opiates and demonizing them as abusers. Have we learned nothing from prohibition?
The Scourge of Salmon Farms: Massive nets in pristine Pacific waters enclose millions of caged, sickly Atlantic salmon, commercially bred and fed unnatural industrial feed for profit, damaging local ecosystems and ravaging wild populations. They infect the waters with non-native diseases, they live horrible crowded lives, and they escape and breed with local species. The corporatist Harper government lied, denied and covered up the destruction, and so far Trudeau hasn't proved any better.

Some Small Victories in the Fight Against Climate Change: It may be hopeless, but most of us are still driven to do what we can — what Joanna Macy calls “holding actions” — to delay and obstruct the worst environmental damages being wreaked in our own communities. Locally here there have been some small successes: The proposed construction of the Lelu Island LNG plant (that I wrote about in this short story) has been abandoned. Another LNG plant proposed for construction near Prince Rupert has likewise been abandoned. Here on Bowen Island we beat back a proposal for logging 28% of the island, forwarded as “non-negotiable” by a provincial crown corporation, through a massive letter-writing campaign and a planned 1000-person demonstration. And there are increasing signs that the gargantuan Site C hydro power plant may be stopped dead in its tracks — the independent consultants cite many reasons it is non-viable and wrong-headed, and the former head of BC Hydro wants it stopped. Still, as Vancouverite Bill Rees explains, these are just tiny, temporary wins: “Accelerated hydrocarbon development, better pipeline regulations and improved navigational aids for tanker traffic don't cut it as sustainable development in a world that should be abandoning fossil fuels“.

“While companies rarely say so explicitly, in practice they often want employees who can be let go easily and with little fuss, employees who do not expect long-term commitments from their employer. But, like employment, loyalty is a two-way street – making jobs short-term, commitment-free enterprises leads to workers who view temporary work contracts as also desirable. You start hiring job-quitters. A good job used to be one with a good salary, benefits, etc. Now, it's one that prepares you for your next job.”

FRANCESCO TOTTI will retire from football this summer.
GETTY Francesco Totti retirement: Roma star to hang up his boots this summer
The Italian legend, 40, has played for Roma throughout his whole career. But it's now been revealed the striker is hanging up his boots. Roma have recruited sporting director Monchi from Spanish side Sevilla.

“I already knew that there was an agreement with the club that this would be his final year as a player” Monchi on Roma star Francesco Totti's retirement And he's spilled the beans over Totti's plans to retire this summer. “In terms of Totti, I already knew that there was an agreement with the club that this would be his final year as a player, then he'd start as a director,” Monchi said. “Francesco is Roma, I want to be as close to him as possible.
The 2015 Toronto Blue Jays need their starting rotation to lead them through this season. More importantly, they need their starters healthy. This may be a bit of an issue with their 21 year old lefty. Daniel Norris had a bit of a rough start on Sunday when his Blue Jays faced the Atlanta Braves. He struggled with his command in a very short outing. His line was rather ugly. He lasted just 2.2 innings, giving up 6 hits, 2 walks and a strike out for 5 runs (4 earned).
While watching the game, it may have been clear that something was not right. Well, according to TSN's Scott MacArthur, we may have our answer.
Daniel Norris: “I'm going through a little bit of a dead-arm phase." #BlueJays #MLB — Scott MacArthur (@TSNScottyMac) April 19, 2015
Apparently, this has been bothering him since the series in Montreal. Now, watching his performance, one could see that there was something lacking. But, dead arm? If you're unfamilair with this often used term for pitchers “issues”, Norris offers an explanation.
Norris: “Dead-arm is something where you feel 100-per cent fine. It's just (the ball) doesn't come out like it usually does." #BlueJays #MLB — Scott MacArthur (@TSNScottyMac) April 19, 2015
Having dead arm may impact a pitchers ability to get the most out of their pitches. And, with the life that Norris can get on his fastball, this obviously is a concern. Now, Norris says that he has experienced this before and based on where he is right now, feels that he could be about to get over it. This would be great news for Blue Jays fans. Right now, it would appear that the starting rotation cannot handle any kind of significant loss. Already, the rotation is not looking very solid failing to go deep into games. This has put a strain on the bullpen and resulted in Jeff Francis taking the spot of Colt Hynes to provide a fresh arm that can chip in more innings.
The “dead arm” phenomenon is quite a common one with the Cubs' Jon Lester experiencing the same this spring. It happens quite often. And, in many cases it is not cause for concern. Norris himself seems to brush it off. And, while we have no reason to panic, there is some interesting thought about dead arm. Mike Sielski wrote for the Wall Street Journal back in 2011 about the “Dastardly ‘Dead Arm Syndrome”. His piece uses examples of pitchers suffering through dead arm, including former Yankees Phil Hughes and Jim Abbott. He quoted Dr Michael Hausman, then vice-chairman of orthopedics at Mount Sinai Hospital, as saying that the term “dead arm” has become a catch-all phrase for a fairly unexplained issue with pitchers as well as position players.
“Usually, Hausman said, a pitcher who has a “dead arm” has a slight injury to his labrum, the rim of cartilage that keeps the shoulder's ball-and-socket joint stable. The injury and the shoulder's resulting instability might be so subtle that the pitcher wouldn't sense any pain at all.”
Now, this is not to suggest that there is a more serious injury to Daniel Norris. If he has experienced this before, chances are he'll be just fine. If it is indeed a period of lifelessness, Blue Jays fans will hope that it ends very quickly. If the Blue Jays follow their rotation schedule and do not alter it, Norris would get the start against Tampa Bay on Saturday. Perhaps the rest will help. If the Blue Jays are going to compete this season, they'll need the best out of their young arms.
Lipsticks are one of those fun items that you don't need a ton of time to test in order to fully evaluate. Despite the fact that I don't wear them often (they're a little high-maintenance for my day-to-day tastes), I love the look of a matte lip. When I heard that Maybelline added this new Creamy Matte Lipstick formula to their Color Sensational line, I was damn excited. I actually saw them on YouTube first before seeing them in a store, on a blog, etc – Nicole Guerrero was wearing Touch of Spice in a recent video and I was like, “Yep. I need dis.” I looked around and could find no information online, not even on Maybelline's site.
A few days later, I saw other YouTubers sporting shades from the Color Sensational Creamy Matte Lipstick line and the message was clear, “go to Target.” Next time I was there, armed with a new coupon (no shame in trying something new with one, after all), I went to get Touch of Spice and Divine Wine. They were out of Touch of Spice, but I did get Divine Wine to share with you.
The caps on the Creamy Matte Lipstick shades are identical: frosted for a matte look, but this otherwise looks like many of the other Color Sensational lipsticks from the outside.
So dark! The flash makes this look not quite as dark as it is. It isn't like… Nyx Soft Matte Lip Cream in Transylvania or Nars Train Bleu dark, but it is a pretty deep wine red.
Swatched. For reference on how dark it is, Maybelline Creamy Matte Lipstick this is sitting next to a well-known shade, Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick in Beso. Should have let Beso dry, but I was rushing.
Though I will sometimes wear a bold red lip, I pretty much never wear a dark lip. In fact, I can remember the last time I did, not counting Halloween scenarios – my mom had a dark burgundy(ish)? Clinique lipstick ages and aaaages ago. I pilfered it. I was not even a teenager yet. That was all.
I am not vampy! I like sheer washes color on my lips and clean eyeliner. I am out of my comfort zone! Applying it, eeek, it is so dark. Just applied:
And I love it! Again, slightly ligther in the flash, but trust that this is very fall appropriate.
Despite being called, “Creamy Matte Lipstick,” this is definitely more of a satin-matte finish; the lighter shades are slightly more matte. I think this finish is flattering with this color, personally, but if it wants it so-matte-its-flat, this may not be the formula/color for you. It doesn't feel dry going on – some matte lipsticks can skip or tug on your lips during application, leading to mistakes or uneven-application, nearly necessitating use of a lip brush. Not these! They glide on pretty easily and have great color payoff in one pass. They aren't as unforgiving as a classic matte lipstick (I'm looking at you, MAC Retro Matte formula – I've seen what you've done to lips!) but I chose to exfoliate and treat prior just in case. So far, I haven't noticed any feathering or sass from this lipcolor, but I would probably use a liner (if I had an appropriate color) with this one just in case.
I noticed, also, during application and wear, that the scent of the Creamy Matte Lipsticks remind me of the scent of the Nyx Soft Matte Lip Creams. I'm sure they share some common ingredients, though I'm not sure what they are. I would wager that it is whatever allows them to apply easily and remain matte. I love my Nyx Soft Matte Lip creams, but I already have a strong preference for this type of lipcolor to be in a lipstick form rather than a tube with a doe-foot applicator.
I got about about 3.5 hours of wear before needing to reapply, but that includes drinking two glasses of tea and eating dinner. I heard and confirmed that it wasn't a punk about reapplying, but even the Nyx Soft Matte Lip Creams can be punks when it comes to reapplication. To be fair, I think expecting a lipstick to last through eating and drinking is entirely unrealistic – and this one does not claim to be long-wearing, so I am happy.
It is so damn new that even now, almost a week after I've purchased them, I cannot find them online anywhere. Not Amazon, not Target, not drugstore.com – but I will be sure to update you with a link as soon as I find one. In fact, I have another shade to share with you at some point – I'll hold off until I can get a dang link for you.
Are you into matte hues? Seasonally-appropriate ones? Will you try one of the new Maybelline Creamy Matte Lipsticks, or stick with something more familiar like, say, a Nyx Soft Matte Lip Cream?
Back in 2000, during the height of the Sports Illustrated-influenced character assassination of me, rumors were rampant “John Rocker Battery Day” was going to be held in New York when the Braves opened up a series with the Mets.
My return to baseball from a suspension to start the season that year was greeted by heavy boos from the Mets' fans and more than 700 police officers at the game to keep Energizer or Duracell batteries from becoming missiles aimed at my head.
Those projectiles from the stands never came (as they did the 1999 NLCS against the Mets, though the boos were deafening that night). However, I did pitch a scoreless eighth inning in the first game to help Atlanta to a 6-4 win.
Back in late 1999 to early 2000, the mainstream media turned my comments to Sports Illustrated into the equivalent of the early moments of the Darren Wilson-Michael Brown situation in Ferguson plus the reaction by the media to the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act plus the initial fury at the University of Virginia fraternity libeled by the Rolling Stone article accusing members of rape (which turned out to be a lie).
Even with all of this, there were no metal detectors placed outside Shea Stadium in New York City to ensure that “John Rocker Battery Day” didn't come to fruition.
In looking around the Web, I came across an old transcript for a CNN show called “Talkback Live,” where the subject of “John Rocker Battery Day” was being discussed. The hosts were discussing the precautions taken by the Mets to make sure nothing out of the ordinary transpired. Notice what was not placed at each gate where fans entered the stadium:
BATTISTA: By the way, Frank, are they searching people when they go into the stadium tonight? Is that part of the security precautions? BUCKLEY: They said that's one thing they might do. It's unlikely that they are going to search every single person that walks in. They are not using metal detectors. But I can tell you again, with the level of security here, it will be difficult for someone to get through and do anything too horrible. For example, in the bullpen area, which is where John Rocker will be, they've set up a special security arrangement with – put up a plywood canopy over the warm-up area. They've put up some black fencing between the bleachers and that warm-up area. I just walked out there a little while ago and noticed that one guy was still painting the fence black. So, they've put in some security. I just walked through the stadium and also saw a couple of bomb-sniffing dogs walking through. So, they are doing quite a bit here in terms of security.
For a pre-9/11 world, I'd say that's quite a lot of security measures undertaken to make sure “John Rocker Battery Day” didn't occur, but notice how no metal detectors were deployed for the game.
Read Rocker's firsthand account of his public battle with the PC thought police during his MLB career: “Scars and Strikes,” at the WND Superstore
Fifteen years later, Major League Baseball (MLB) – after conferring with the Department of Homeland Security – has issued a new mandate for all of the league's 30 stadiums to install walk-through metal detectors at every gate.
Every fan, from a young boy attending his first MLB game with his father to an octogenarian going to his 65th straight opening day game at Wrigley Field in Chicago, will now have to walk through a metal detector like some visitor to a prison.
If this isn't a sad indicator of the state of America in 2015, I'm not sure what else could convince you something is seriously wrong with the culture in our country.
Here's how Joe Abernathy, the vice president of operations for the St. Louis Cardinals, described this grotesque inconvenience, as if the storyline from the Robert de Niro/Wesley Snipes movie “The Fan” is poised to come to life soon:
“On the one hand, everybody will now have to go through a security screening,” Abernathy said Thursday. “But walking through a detector will be faster than getting scanned with a wand.” Abernathy said passing through detectors at Busch will be a lot easier than doing so at Lambert Airport. “You won't have to take off your shoes and belt, like at the airport. But you will have to take out your cellphone and your keys and set them on a table.” Cardinal fans outside Busch Stadium on Thursday accepted the enhanced security as a sensible, if depressing, development. Rob Gottlob, a lifelong Cardinals fan from North Carolina, stopped by Busch with his family Thursday on his way to visit family in his hometown of Alton. “It's sad that it has come to this, but with (terrorist) groups like ISIS out there, you have to think about safety,” Gottlob, 45, said. Karri and Tobias Thomason, of Peoria, Illinois, were sipping beer at Ballpark Village across from the stadium. The couple were visiting St. Louis to mark their fourth wedding anniversary. Karri Thomason, 23, said she felt conflicted about the detectors. “It's another intrusion in the name of security, and I wonder if it would really stop someone intent on wreaking havoc,” she said. “But I do recognize the team's need to try to protect fans.”
Nice job, Mr. Abernathy, with the attempt to rationalize the situation at a baseball game to the horror and true inconvenience of being treated like a potential terrorist by the TSA before you fly.
And Mr. Gottlob, America wouldn't face a terrorist threat from ISIS if we simply used the same type of technology used by the NSA to spy on Americans to actually screen refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants for any connection to a terrorist organization, if we just ceased allowing immigration from nations where ISIS or Islamic-inspired jihad is a threat, and, of course, if we actually allowed the Border Patrol to do its job and patrol our wide-open border with Mexico where Islamic terrorist have crossed.
Such sensible actions are, of course, an insensible suggestion to ending the terror threat to Americans, so why not sacrifice the freedoms of everyone and instead consider all Americans potential suspectsin the ongoing War on Terror?
Sacrificing freedom for security is about as un-American as considering soccer to be the national pastime.
It's my hope we all live to see the day when metal detectors are removed from MLB stadiums, so a father doesn't have to explain to his son why some stranger is patting him down and they miss the first pitch.

Pause-deniers finally get busted by mainstream media
It's been a rotten week for Pause denial
David Rose and the Daily Mail let rip, telling the world that retired NOAA insider, John Bates, was blowing the whistle on how global warming was being exaggerated by scientists to score political points. The hallowed pause-buster paper (Karl et al) broke practically every rule: it was based on misleading “unverified” data processed with a highly experimental, unstable program. There were bugs in the software, the results changed with every run, the data wasn't archived, and no one could repeat it. They tripled the previous rate of warming by using old-bad-data to adjust better but still-not-very-good-data. They ignored the much better data from ARGO buoys and the satellites (see below) which showed they were wrong. (Rose didn't even mention that the error bars on the magical adjustment were 17 times larger than the adjustment itself. Too many errors….)
It's hard oo believe it could be worse, but then the one sole computer holding the program broke, and apparently (what bad luck) none of the eight authors had their own copy either. Nor did the reviewers. The Planet is going to hell, but no one thought to back up the data.
It all got a bit much for Dr Bates when he heard melodramatic news reports that a few triggered scientists feared Trump might trash their climate data.
The NOAA scientists have nothing to hide (especially not data since it's gone) but when the subpoenas came for their emails, they refused to hand them over.
Then on Sunday Rose fired out part II: How can we trust global warming scientists if they keep twisting the truth.
The man deserves a medal. (Both men Rose and Bates).
NOAA told Obama and Congress that there was no pause in warming. If only Congress had access to Google… they could have downloaded the satellite data:
The black line of the best fit is for the same period, and shows a warming trend that is essentially zero (0.01 C per decade). That is, satellites say it didn't warm from 2000 to 2014 — the exact same period that the NOAA team refer too.
Yet here is the graph that NOAA presented to Obama and Congress, saying “the rate of global warming during the last 15 years has been as fast as or faster than that seen during the latter half of the 20th Century.” Sure.
For the record, there are two independent satellite sets, but the UAH data matches weather balloons better than RSS, and the RSS adjustments includes a likely calibration drift error that probably causes spurious warming. (And if Roy Spencer's site doesn't behave, there's a copy of all his reasoning here).
I'm guessing NOAA knows what the satellite data shows.
Here's the ARGO data, Hadley, GISS and UAH:
The Pause shows the models don't understand what drives the climate
If you can't explain the pause, you can't explain the cause.
– Hockeyschtick
Even if the rate of warming was the same in the 1950s as the 2000s, it wasn't supposed to be. CO2 emissions have risen more than expected, and all the predictions missed the side of the barn totally. Let's not forget how abject their failure was in the first assessment report in 1990, the IPCC predicted an average rate of global warming of 0.30 C per decade over the ensuing decades. Their lowest possible estimate was 0.2C and yet we didn't even get to that. (See also here.)
For the record — the full satellite temperature series shows the world warmed. It doesn't show that this had anything to do with CO2. The timing is all wrong, the correlation pathetic. The more CO2 we emit, the slower the warming.

EXCLUSIVE: Sheriff Says Murdered 19-Year Old Nicholas Hawkins Knew His Killers, But Refuses To Discuss Motive
A sheriff in rural Alabama is refusing to say whether authorities believe a bisexual teen was brutally murdered due to his sexual orientation.
Walker County Sheriff Jim Underwood initially told The New Civil Rights Movement on Friday morning that the murder of Nicholas Hawkins "wasn't a hate crime."
But later in the interview, Underwood backtracked.
"We haven't discussed that with anybody yet, about the motive," Underwood said in an exclusive interview. "If we lock ourselves in on something right at this point and that changes, attorneys will eat us alive on that.
"It depends on what you call a hate crime, but I can't go into the motive, what we think the motive might have been," Underwood added. "At this time, we're not going to go into that, because it will come out in the court process, here sometime probably in the near future. I'm not going to speculate on that right now."
Asked about Alabama's hate crimes law, Underwood said he was unsure whether it includes sexual orientation.
It does not.
Asked about the federal Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act â€” which includes sexual orientation and allows the FBI to assist local agencies with hate crime investigations â€” Underwood said, "We handled the case ourselves."
Underwood's office has arrested six people in connection with the murder of Hawkins, whose body was found wrapped in a blanket and buried under brush and debris, three days after he disappeared. Three of the suspects are charged with murder, while the other three are charged with hindering prosecution.
Underwood said Hawkins died from a gunshot wound to the chest, but declined to say how many times he'd been shot. Underwood also said Hawkins' body showed signs of head trauma, indicating he was beaten prior to being shot.
Hawkins' older brother, Jacob Hawkins, has described his brother's murder as "a horrible, horrible death."
Hawkins knew all six of the suspects, and they were "hanging out" on the night of his murder, Underwood said.
News reports have indicated Hawkins, an aspiring cosmetologist, was on his way home from a beauty pageant Feb. 13 when he called his mother and said, "Somebody is trying to kill me," before the call cut off.
But Underwood said investigators have been unable to confirm that Hawkins ever went to the pageant.
Hawkins' body was found Feb. 16, the same day the first suspect was arrested.
A representative from the Walker County District Attorney's office couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

South Sydney have opened negotiations with Cody Walker in a bid to take the rising playmaker off the open market before the beginning of the NRL season.
Walker is tipped to be one of the stars of the Auckland Nines, where his speed and support play will be showcased in front of rival clubs in the abbreviated form of the game. The tournament is the perfect platform for the 25-year-old, who is off contract at the end of the year, to launch his first-grade career.
A one-match suspension to five-eighth Luke Keary will likely give Walker his NRL debut in round one against the Roosters and a strong start to the season could result in him remaining in the top side. The long-term future of Keary, whose one-year deal expires at the end of the season, is unclear after he was involved in an argument with Russell Crowe that resulted in him leaving a training camp held at the Rabbitohs co-owner's Nana Glen property. While halfback Adam Reynolds is contracted until 2017, there is growing speculation he may be squeezed out of Redfern if he doesn't fire early.
The Rabbitohs are keen to do a deal with Walker before rival clubs get the chance to see him play.
If you ever had the misfortune of being hunted by a snake, in spite of everything, you could consider yourself lucky - at least it's not an entire nest of serpents teaming up to run you down and devour your flesh.
While scientists have never really been sure if snakes consciously coordinate their hunts - or just hunt as individuals competing for the same prey - new research suggests that coordinated snake pack-hunting is all too real.
Animal psychologist Vladimir Dinets from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville travelled to Desembarco del Granma National Park in Cuba, to observe how Cuban boas (Chilabothrus angulifer) hunt Jamaican fruit bats in sinkhole caves.
These boas have a distinctive way of hunting their prey - concealing themselves in small pit-like cavities that line the ceiling and walls near the cave's entrance.
There they lie and wait, hanging from the cave ceiling until the bats fly past on their daily commute, giving them an opportunity to strike. It would look a little something like this:
Sometimes, boas congregate at these hunting locations, and what Dinets wanted to know was whether they consciously coordinate their positions in the trap - spacing themselves to more effectively block the passageway and ensnare their prey in a hissing, snapping curtain.
Doing so would involve higher behavioural complexity in the animals than simply hunting alone, because it means they'd need to take into account each other's positions in addition to their own.
In eight days of observations that witnessed 16 different hunting events, Dinets found that whenever boas hunted at the same time in the cave, they chose positions in the same area, enabling them to be close to one another.
While this would leave other areas of the passageway clear, by teaming up next to one another, it was easier for the snakes to create a 'wall' that could snare any bats attempting to fly close to or between them.
That logic was borne out by the boa's hunting prospects. When more than one snake was present, the group hunts were always successful, whereas on the fewer occasions when only one boa turned up for the festivities, the loner sometimes left empty-handed.
According to Dinets, many of the world's 3,600 or so known snake species could coordinate their hunts in ways such as this - but scientists have yet to encounter the phenomenon, simply because we still know comparatively little about snake hunting tactics.
"It is possible that coordinated hunting is not uncommon among snakes, but it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out," he says.
Of course, many of us were captivated by something that looked very much like a snake pack hunt last year. Remember this piece of adrenaline-fuelled scrambling?
That award-winning segment of footage from the BBC's Planet Earth II sure looked like a bunch of snakes teaming up to take down that plucky (and extremely lucky) iguana, but as the team behind the documentary explained, this time, it's not a coordinated effort.
"They're not hunting in a pack," former research biologist and Planet Earth II producer Elizabeth White told Fast Company in February.
"I really stress that. There is no pack hunting element. There is no coordination. That area of the beach just has a vast number of snakes, and if one snake gets a whiff that there might be food and starts to make a move, all the others follow. They're like, 'Whoa, what's that? What's he seeing? I want it, too.'"
The Cuban boa, on the other hand, is laying out a more considered trap for its bat prey - but the sad part of the story is, it might not be pack-hunting much longer, thanks to declining numbers due to snake poachers.
"I suspect that if their numbers in a cave fall, they can't hunt in groups anymore and might die out even if some of them don't get caught by hunters," Dinets says.
"A few of these caves are in national parks, but there's a lot of poaching everywhere."
A salient reminder, in case it were needed, that snakes definitely aren't the bad guys here.
The findings are reported in Animal Behavior and Cognition.
NEWPORT BEACH, CA -- One of Orange County's largest hospitals has banned elective abortions, now that it has joined a Catholic hospital group, it was reported Saturday.
Hoag Memorial Hospital notified its doctors last week that the decision was made independently by the hospital's board, was not religiously inspired and was not imposed by the new partners, the Orange County Register reported.
But one Hoag gynecologist expressed unhappiness that his practice was under the new birth control policies of the Catholic agency.
"With this directive, we are coming under the influence of the sisters of St. Joseph," said Dr. Alberto Mendivil.
St. Joseph Health System, which is owned by a Catholic charity, has finalized a partnership with Hoag, and in the process created a health-care powerhouse in Orange County, the Register reported. It now controls about one third of the county's health care through its network of six hospitals and affiliated clinics.
St. Joseph facilities follow the Catholic Church's guidelines on health care, and generally prohibit abortions and contraceptive practices, the newspaper reported.
"This was not a religious decision for Hoag," said Robert Braithwaite, the chief executive officer for the hospital, in an interview with the Register.
"The board carefully examined all women's services at Hoag," he was quoted as saying. "We understand it's not a popular decision for some people in the community, and we think it was the right decision based on the quality-volume correlation."
But some doctors at the hospital expressed surprise and upset at the news, and said they had been promised separate policies on birth control at St. Joseph's and Hoag.

The Social Network Tactic of Pope Francis
Francis' Marketing Architect from Opus Dei
IMPORTANT NOTE from PAUL JOSEPH C.
Before we begin this study of some facets of the Pope Francis I papacy, it is our desire to clarify that the intent of this article is not to attack, insult or slander Jorge Mario Bergoglio, The Catholic Church, and/or those individuals who are currently working for Pope Francis. This page is not serving the purpose of spreading acrimony toward this 'pope' or any of the people discussed here below, but instead aspires only to impart awareness through the use of available information for everyone's good (according to our discernment and objective examination).
This page is further accompanied by Scriptural references and revelations given to Maria Divine Mercy in The Book of Truth which we find to be accurate insofar as we believe.
THE SOCIAL NETWORK TACTIC OF POPE FRANCIS
Here below are the screenshots of the photos' thumbnails within the gallery of a new Facebook group dedicated to "defending" Pope Francis. It doesn't take much commentary to notice that the object of worship is not Our Lord Jesus Christ but the man Pope Francis. The maker(s) of the page also made a comment accusing those who believe in God's Messages through the Book of Truth of being "satanists". While such accusation is of no surprise, we thought that the huge amount of images in honor of this pope – and created by the group behind this account – was shocking. In just 15 months they have come to producing an enormous photographic campaign in his favor. It is not to be dismissed that the designers of these portrayals could easily be the same ones who create slandering vignettes of Maria Divine Mercy. We wonder about the reason behind the creation of all these pages and blogs; usually, people, sports' teams, corporations, organizations, groups, or nations are only on the attack (or aggressively push their agenda) when feeling threatened by another party. Therefore, is this angry attack from the Vatican made out of fear? Is the Truth of God's messages truly becoming a cross for Pope Francis? While we do not know for sure, we do remember the words that Jesus said to Maria Divine Mercy:
~You (my daughter) will become a thorn in the side of the false prophet~
Jesus' message from March 19 2013 – The Book of Truth
As seen below, the center is once again Pope Francis rather than Jesus Christ. If and when the image of the Lord is being used, it is only in the background to always serve False Prophet Pope Francis' primary role in the Church and in the world. Let's also not forget that the constant production of images, books, holy photos, rosaries, statutes, posters, articles, clips, cups, paintings and other merchandise is typical of marketing strategies and product placements in the world of advertisement and in order to sell a good. The same is done by lobbies and corporations during a political campaign: they tirelessly push the person they are paid to support and promote while constantly attacking any one or thing they view in opposition to their cause.
FRANCIS' MARKETING ARCHITECT from OPUS DEI
Greg Burke, a fifty-three year old senior media advisor to the Vatican, worked for Fox News for about 10 years. Born in St. Louis (Missouri) and member of the controversial Opus Dei, he was hired by the Vatican in June 2012 as Pope Benedict XVI was about to be ousted by the ecclesiastic masons within the system. Pope Francis joined Twitter a few months after Burke took up the new role. Trying on a firefighter's helmet, allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass, and phoning up his followers for a chat are just a few of the ways Pope Francis has attracted headlines in the last few months. And after years of negative press, the Catholic Church is basking in the 'Francis Effect' which has been credited with a 20 percent rise in congregations in the UK and an explosive interest in the heroic acts of this vicar all over the world. But who is the PR guru working quietly behind the scenes to help push Pope Francis forward and leading the Church out of one of its darkest spells following a slew of recent scandals?
This mastermind's name is Greg Burke, the senior media advisor to the Vatican. A keen golfer, he's the author of several books – one of which is about the Italian soccer team 'Parma' ('Parma: A Year In'). Before a ten year work relationship with Fox, Mr. Burke was Time Magazine's Rome correspondent for a decade. He additionally worked as a stringer for news agency Reuters in Rome. In his previous jobs, he covered the illness and death of Pope John Paul II, the election of Pope Benedict XVI, the pedophile scandal, the VatiLeaks saga, and the crackdown on American nuns, reported The Daily Beast.
Mr Burke will regularly tweet and is credited with having encouraged the Pope to join Twitter (which Francis soon did). 'A scandal is a scandal, and I've reported on them all,' he says. 'It all had to be told, as much as things are true, it's good they've come out.'
He grew up in a Catholic family to then become a member of the controversial Catholic group Opus Dei at the age of 18 as a 'numerary' in the movement – a celibate layman. His papal politics may have developed since his earlier days when shortly before Pope Benedict was selected he reasoned that he was not in the running, reported Vice. 'He's considered too conservative' Mr Burke explained, noting that Ratzinger was called 'the 'Panzer Cardinal' because he took so many hits for Pope John Paul II.
Burke's role – a revolution in the Vatican's communications structure – is similar to that of communications advisers in the White House. He reports directly to the Vatican's deputy secretary of state, Archbishop Angelo Becciu, the third-ranking person in the Vatican hierarchy.
Pope Francis I took the time, after his weekly Papal audience in St. Peter's Square, to bless a severely disfigured man. The Pope has attracted headlines for each action, statement and appearance. These convenient (if not contrived) photo ops are just one of many ways Pope Francis has conquered the world's major magazine covers, newspapers' headlines, and the Internet's most important press websites and blogs.
Seen it all before: The teenage pilgrims show Pope Francis their technology – but it appears he is well in tune with modern life. Although he can now be credited with helping to build Pope Francis' popular image, it seems Mr Burke was not initially keen when he was first called about the position when he was dining out for his father's 90th birthday. 'I told them no twice but the more I thought about it the more it seemed like the right thing to do. I can't imagine a more exciting challenge for me at this time' Mr Burke told Reuters.
He accepted the role at a troubling time for the Catholic Church – the Vatican had been bedeviled by communications blunders ever since Pope Benedict XVI's 2005 election, and was dealing with a scandal over Vatican documents that were leaked to Italian journalists.
Mr Burke is the only person in the Vatican's communications structure with vast print and television experience from outside the sometimes insular world of Catholic media.
'I've had a lot of diverse media experience that I hope I can put to use for the Church that I love' Mr Burke said at the time.
When Mr Burke was appointed, Fr John Wauck -a professor at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome – told the Catholic Herald: 'He's a lay person, from the professional world, who understands how theologians think and shares their faith… he's well respected and genuinely liked by the journalists in Rome. He's an English-language media professional who knows Italy (the language, the culture, the mindset) and the Vatican inside out. This is important because many of the Vatican's difficulties with the media stem from things getting lost in translation. Greg can help prevent that.' Mr Burke has also guided the Vatican through the modern digital age. He told an auditorium full of reporters this year: 'I actually thought I'd leave Fox to go work for a football club' but ended up in the Vatican. No free tickets to football matches – but really good seats at Christmas and Easter.' Greg Burke is constantly on Twitter posting thousands upon thousands of tweets. One of them included a photo of pop star Jennifer Lopez in Italy alongside the caption: 'Was @JLo on a shopping spree for rosaries in Rome?'
Another post shows a photo of a convertible red Ferarri alongside the caption: 'Parked just outside #Vatican, but safe to say it's not a new car for #PopeFrancis'. It is easy to note that Greg Burke's marketing knowledge and brilliant intuitions have been the fundamental pillar of Pope Francis' global marketing triumph. The mixture of Jorge Bergolgio's doctrinally tampered approach and Burke's unceasing production of publicity wonders have proven unprecedentedly miraculous for the artificial creation of this pope's glorious status.
Mr Burke has also guided the Vatican through the modern digital age: the pope started tweeting a few months after he joined. At the time, Mr Burke said the Twitter handle @Pontifex is appropriate for a number of reasons.'The handle is a good one. It means "pope" and it also means "bridge builder",' he said. 'The Pope wants to reach out to everyone'. The Vatican, stung by communications blunders and mired in a leaks scandal, hired the American journalist in June 2012 from Fox News to help improve its relations with the media: 'We are going to get a spiritual message. The Pope is not going to be walking around with a Blackberry or an iPad and no one is going to be putting words into the Pope's mouth. He will tweet what he wants to tweet,' Mr Burke said. Last year Mr Burke said he didn't know what, if any, role his membership in Opus Dei played in getting his role.
Opus is greatly in favor in the Vatican these days, particularly as other new religious movements such as the Legion of Christ have lost credibility with their own problems.
'I'm an old-fashioned Midwestern Catholic whose mother went to Mass every day,' Burke said last year. 'Am I being hired because I'm in Opus Dei?' he asked. 'It might come into play.' Founded in 1928, Opus Dei is part of the Catholic Church and has 500 members across Britain. The stated mission of the organization – which means 'God's Work' – is to spread the Christian message and help people embrace Catholicism in their everyday work. Many experts (and for a long time) have defined the organization to be a questionable (and brainwashing) cult of secret origin and agenda.
Here is a link to Greg Burke's thirty-six minute Media Lecture:
http://vimeo.com/66629870
In this segment you will hear about the building of Mario Bergoglio's image as a media sensation as well as Mr Burke's need to underline that the pope's (now obvious) false humility is, in actuality, 'real'. It takes less than thirty-six minutes to know that Francis' publicity guru is not revealing any truth behind the game.

Today we're starting our first series looking at the redevelopment of Disney's Hollywood Studios. It's a multi-year process that will ultimately result in a new name for Walt Disney World's third gate, along with two new lands (Toy Story Land and Star Wars Land) and a possible place-making effort to retheme much of the park.
Admittedly, there isn't much work to document right now. There have been a few small closures and there will be more coming in April. So I'm submitting this update mostly as a placeholder to say. This is where things start.
There's a lot of prep work to do at Disney's Hollywood Studios to get ready for construction on either project. Here are just a few of the projects:
The water runoff plan for DHS needs serious improvements to handle rain water (it will now be directed across World Drive to a new 38-acre pond.)
Parking expansion will also include some reworking of existing conservation areas
Construction access roads and staging areas must be added.
A new fireworks staging area will be built west of World Drive.
Eventually, the main entrance will be relocated to give additional room backstage for Star Wars land.
As for timeline, Toy Story Land is expected to be completed first (sometime around November 2018) with Star Wars Land coming in late 2019 or early 2020. They want to build faster, but the prepwork is so involved that it may not be possible to rush it.
Do you think Disney will be able to rush either or both of these projects or will this be another long waiting game for fans?
An incensed Donald Trump's Twitter rage over a provocative super PAC ad featuring a nude photo of his wife, Melania — and his subsequent threat to “spill the beans” on Ted Cruz's missus — may turn out to only help the Teflon billionaire's surging campaign, experts told the Herald.
“Like so many attacks on Donald Trump, it's boomeranged,” said Thomas Whalen, a political history professor at Boston University. “A lot of women voters who are not generally sympathetic to ?Mr. Trump, they might be sympathetic now because of him defending his wife. … He'll probably benefit politically from it.”
Until Tuesday night, the GOP rivals had mostly left each ?other's wives out of the crude campaign vitriol that has included name-calling, accusations of pants-wetting and disagreements over the size of their “hands.”
But a furious Trump took Cruz to task for an ad on Facebook from the super PAC “Make America Awesome” featuring a posed, nude photo of Melania with the caption: “Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.” The ad was ?targeted at Mormons in Utah, where Cruz won easily on Tuesday night.
“Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will ?spill the beans on your wife!” Trump tweeted.
Cruz disavowed the ad and the super PAC in a tweet of his own: “Pic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more ?of a coward than I thought. #classless.”
But Trump doubled down on the allegations yesterday.
“Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!” he tweeted.
Even though no evidence has emerged connecting Cruz himself to the super PAC, Trump's Twitter-shaming, showing no distinction between the two, could ?still win over sympathizers, said an expert.
“One of the tried and true responses to a third-party attack is to blame the candidate,” said Florida-based GOP strategist Alex Patton. “If Trump says it loud enough and often ?enough, Trump supporters will believe it.”
Trump's critics have struggled to inflict actual damage on the billionaire, and the sleazy ad may be evidence of a last-ditch effort.
“It's a realization that time's running out and if they're going to do anything they have to do it now,” said Timothy Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa. “But that can backfire. A lot of times when people go after Trump, his supporters just get ?more entrenched.”
Typically, candidates' spouses have been off-limits in modern political races, as long as they stay in the background and steer clear of crafting policy or mudslinging. But that hasn't always been true.
“Andrew Jackson's wife was attacked very personally when he was running against John Quincy Adams,” said ?John Baughman, a political science professor at Bates College in Maine.
“It was less personal and less nasty, but Eleanor Roosevelt, when Franklin (Roosevelt) was running for re-election, was targeted for attacks. By historical standards, it's actually not ?that uncommon.”
A major undersea telecommunications cable that connects Australia and New Zealand to North America has been tapped to allow the United States National Security Agency and its espionage partners to comprehensively harvest Australian and New Zealand internet data.
Documents published by The Intercept website by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden show that New Zealand's electronic spy agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), worked in 2012 and 2013 to implement a mass metadata surveillance system based on covert access to the Southern Cross undersea cable network.

Founded in 1997, Southern Cross owns and operates a Trans-Pacific submarine cable network connecting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Hawaii to the internet backbone on the west coast of the United States. The network was developed to service the rapid growth of Internet traffic across the Pacific. It is owned by Telecom New Zealand with a 50 per cent share, SingTel Optus (Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider) with 40 per cent and Verizon Business with 10 per cent.
Top secret documents provided by Mr Snowden show that the GCSB, with ongoing cooperation from the US National Security Agency, implemented Phase I of a mass surveillance program code-named "Speargun" at some time in 2012 or early 2013.

In a new court filing late Friday, Robert Mueller's prosecutors say Paul Manafort heavily edited an op-ed defending his work in Ukraine that appeared Thursday in a Ukrainian English-language newspaper.
Manafort, former chair of the Trump presidential campaign, has been indicted on multiple counts in Mueller's Russia probe, and the judge has imposed a gag order on both the defense and the prosecution.
Prosecutors had argued in a filing earlier this week that Manafort's involvement in writing the op-ed piece violated the judge's gag order, citing the article in their opposition to his request to be released from house arrest on bail. Manafort's lawyers responded that he had little role in its composition, and was helping Oleg Voloshyn, a former spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, write the piece.
An court drawing of former Trump 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort appears in the U.S. Federal Court during his arraignment on twelve federal charges. Reuters
But in a document attached to Friday's filing, prosecutors say Manafort engaged in a line-by-line edit of the draft, making dozens of changes. "Manafort cannot bring himself to state that he had a role in drafting the op-ed, although that fact is established by irrefutable evidence."
Related: Manafort, Gates charged with conspiracy in Mueller investigation
It shows, the prosecutors say, that he can't be trusted. They say it's another reason why the conditions of his bail should not be relaxed.
Prosecutors also said Voloshyn was not the principal author of the piece, but that Manafort was working with Konstantin Kilimnik. In their earlier filing, prosecutors had said Manafort was working with an unnamed individual with ties to Russian intelligence. In Friday's filing, they said that Kilimnik was the man they meant. Kilimnik worked closely with Manafort in Ukraine, where Manafort earned millions as a political consultant.
Another author of the piece, according to the filing, was Rick Gates, Manafort's U.S. business partner. Gates was also indicted by Mueller and is under the same gag order.
Manafort was indicted by a federal grand jury in October on seven charges, including money laundering and failing to disclose his lobbying efforts on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. He has pleaded not guilty.
A groom-to-be became paralyzed from the neck down in a beach accident at his bachelor party, according to reports.
Brett Greenhill and fiancee Meg Alexander were celebrating at their joint bachelor/bachelorette party in Naples, Florida, earlier this month when Greenhill went for a swim, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Party-goer Kelsey Rice noticed Greenhill bobbing motionless in the water and swam out to him, People noted. Rice, a nurse, flipped him over and Greenhill told her he couldn't move.
When he was brought to shore, the engaged pair had an emotional exchange, Alexander told People.
“I can't feel anything. Meg, I love you so much and I'm so sorry. I love you so much,” Greenhill said.
“I love you,” Alexander replied. “Don't be sorry. We're going to figure out what's wrong with you.”

Greenhill, 39 was airlifted to Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. According to a GoFundMe page dedicated to his rehabilitation, surgeons removed fragments of his shattered vertebrae that got stuck in his spinal cord.
As of Wednesday morning, donations had surpassed $110,000 on the page. Greenhill has been accepted to Shepherd Center in the couple's hometown of Atlanta for spinal cord treatment, per GoFundMe.
It is believed that Greenhill dove into a sandbar. Alexander said doctors have given Greenhill a 1 percent chance at regaining mobility. “If anybody's going to be that one percent, it's going to be Brett,” friend Jaime Reints told 11 Alive.
February's wedding has been postponed but, Alexander told 11 Alive, “We are going to get married someday, and it's going to be amazing. ... Plans changed a little but we'll get there someday.”

For one thing, orange and gray are a great combination, but more importantly it has an other-worldly weirdness that I very much appreciate it. I guess the strangeness comes from being a novel (I think) way to extend everyday two-dimensional tables with one extra dimension. It's not a perfect extension–confusing and difficult to follow–but it's intriguing.
Designed by David Seah.

Earlier this year, a New York judge ruled that US search warrants applied to digital data, even if the data wasn't stored domestically. The ruling came about after Microsoft was asked to hand over the user information and contested the warrant because the info was stored on servers located in Dublin, Ireland.
In the ongoing battle to protect users's privacy, Microsoft has made their stance very clear. But so has the government with a brief filed last week.
In it, the US government countered Microsoft's endeavors to keep data abroad safe from the prying eye of government officials, noting that according to the Stored Communications Act (SCA), any content stored online does not have the same rights as physical information, as protected by the Fourth Amendment.
Specifically, the brief states:
Overseas records must be disclosed domestically when a valid subpoena, order, or warrant compels their production. The disclosure of records under such circumstances has never been considered tantamount to a physical search under Fourth Amendment principles, and Microsoft is mistaken to argue that the SCA provides for an overseas search here. As there is no overseas search or seizure, Microsoft's reliance on principles of extra-territoriality and comity falls wide of the mark.
Looking at it from both sides, the Justice Department says such a law is necessary in a time where electronic communications can be exploited by “hackers,” both domestically and abroad. This pertains to the case against Microsoft, as the individual whose information they were seeking out from the servers in Dublin was under investigation for drug-trafficking.
And while nobody reading this (we hope) is hiding drug trafficking info online, we'd bet a good number are storing their pictures online… apparently those are not protected by the Fourth Amendment the way, say, a physical photo album in your house would be.

Abstract We describe 2 fatal cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal complex 398 septicemia in persons who had no contact with livestock. Whole-genome sequencing of the isolated MRSA strains strongly suggest that both were of animal origin and that the patients had been infected through 2 independent person-to-person transmission chains.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal complex (CC) 398 is associated with livestock and can spread to humans who have contact with animals (1,2). The percentage of persons infected with MRSA CC398 is increasing rapidly. In 2014, MRSA CC398 accounted for 43% of all cases of MRSA infection in Denmark (3). MRSA CC398 has not been thought to spread easily from person to person (1,2,4) and had been regarded as less virulent than other human MRSA strains (2,5). Recent studies have showed that MRSA CC398 is an increasing cause of colonization and infection among persons with and without livestock exposure in Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark (6–8). However, the transmission route of MRSA CC398 of animal origin to persons with no reported contact with livestock is still unknown. Only a few small outbreaks of MRSA CC398 infection have been reported (9–11), but animal origin of the bacteria was not documented in those cases.
We describe 2 fatal cases of septicemia attributable to MRSA CC398 of animal origin in a hospital hemodialysis unit and a nursing home. Neither of the patients had any reported contact with livestock. The results of our investigation strongly suggest that transmission occurred through asymptomatic carriers in the 2 institutions.
The Study Transmission Chain 1 Patient 1 A 63-year-old man with diabetes and end-stage kidney failure had been receiving maintenance hemodialysis in the outpatient clinic at Odense University Hospital in Odense, Denmark, since 1997. A femoral–femoral bridge graft was used for vascular access. In November 2013, he was admitted to the hospital because of a fever he experienced during dialysis and inflammation around his bridge graft. Cultures of blood samples taken at admission grew MRSA CC398 spa type t011. The organism was also cultured from the patient's bridge graft and from a sample of joint fluid from his right shoulder. A transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral valve endocarditis. Despite relevant treatment with vancomycin and rifampin and surgical debridement of his shoulder joint, blood cultures remained positive for MRSA until he died 3 weeks later. On inquiry by the staff, the patient had reported no previous history of MRSA infection or colonization and no direct or household-related contact with pigs. Patient 2 Four months before patient 1's illness, MRSA CC398 spa type t011 had been cultivated from an infected decubitus ulcer of another patient who was receiving hemodialysis in the same outpatient clinic as patient 1. Subsequent MRSA screening revealed that patient 2 was a nasal and pharyngeal carrier. On inquiry by the staff, the patient reported no direct or household-related contact with pigs. Transmission Chain 2 Patient 3 A 74-year-old nursing home resident had hemiparesis and recurrent aspiration pneumonia after an apoplectic insult. In April 2014, he was admitted to the hospital with severe pneumonia. On admission, he had sepsis. Blood cultures grew MRSA CC398 spa type t034, and the organism was found in a tracheal aspirate and from the area around a percutaneous gastrostoma tube. Despite relevant treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and vancomycin, the patient died from respiratory failure after 1 week. On inquiry by the staff, the patient and his attending daughter reported no direct or household-related contact with pigs. Patient 4 In July 2010, MRSA CC398 spa type t034 had been isolated from a bedsore of another patient living in the same nursing home as patient 3. In November 2013, the organism was isolated once more from the patient, this time from an indwelling urine catheter. No contact with pigs were reported on inquiry of the patient and her family. Patients 3 and 4 lived in the same wing of the nursing home and shared common facilities. After hospital staff recognized the transmission chain, all residents in this wing and all attached staff were screened for MRSA, but none tested positive. All 4 of the affected patients lived in urban areas. None of them had any proximity to pig farms. Figure The MRSA CC398 isolates identified in the 2 transmission chains were spa types t011 and t034, which are common among livestock-associated MRSA strains (12). Draft whole-genome sequencing was performed on 7 isolates from the 4 patients in the 2 transmission chains, and results were compared with similar data for CC398-related MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus isolates from Denmark obtained during a previous study of the global dissemination of isolates belonging to this clonal complex (13). Sequence files for the individual isolates from patients are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena; accession no. PRJEB11281). On the basis of these data, a phylogenetic tree was constructed from single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in genome sequences of isolates from the 4 patients and from the isolates obtained during the previous study by using the S0385 complete genome sequence (GenBank accession no. AM990992.1) as reference (Figure). This analysis showed that the patient isolates within each transmission chain were closely related but that no close relation between the 2 chains existed. In addition, the isolates from both chains clustered among isolates previously found to be animal associated (clade IIa; 13). Consistent with an animal origin, all isolates carried the tet(M) and czrC determinants (similar to most MRSA strains from clade IIa) and lacked the ɸSa3 phage (typical of the human clade I) (13).
Conclusions We report 2 fatal MRSA CC398 infections after human-to-human transmission in institutional settings. Both patients had debilitating underlying diseases but were in a stable condition until the time of their infections. The sequence of events leaves no doubt that septicemia attributable to MRSA CC398 was the cause of death in both cases. The CC and spa types of the isolates causing fatal infections were typical for MRSA isolates from pigs. Phylogenetic analyses of whole-genome sequences indicated that the human isolates from the 2 transmission chains were located in different clusters that intermingled with isolates from pigs. The detection of molecular markers associated with livestock origin further confirmed animal origin. The different spa types and the clustering of the MRSA isolates from the 2 chains clearly indicate 2 separate chains of infection. None of the 4 patients described here had occupational or household contact with livestock. However, epidemiologic investigations and typing analyses strongly suggested that the 2 MRSA-infected patients could have acquired their infections from an asymptomatic carrier in the outpatient hemodialysis unit (transmission chain 1, patient 2) and the nursing home (transmission chain 2, patient 4). Transmission of MRSA CC398 in hospitals and institutions has been reported elsewhere, which underscores its potential to spread through person-to-person contact (9–11). In conclusion, the organism implicated in these 2 fatal cases was by all accounts spread from person to person. These findings suggest that this clonal complex can be of high pathogenicity and is readily transmissible among humans.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will need to raise taxes and cut spending later this year to stabilize the public finances after last week's shock vote to leave the European Union, finance minister George Osborne said on Tuesday.

Osborne said Britain would be poorer due to the public's decision to leave the EU, which he had campaigned against, and that the country now needed to deal with the economic consequences, as well as to tackle new social divisions.
Sterling plunged against the dollar to its lowest since 1985 after the vote, and two ratings agencies downgraded Britain's sovereign credit rating late on Monday.
“We need a plan as a country to get ourselves out of this, whilst respecting the verdict of the British people. That means financial stability, ending economic uncertainty and providing unity in our society,” Osborne said in a BBC radio interview.
British police say there has been a spike in racist incidents since the June 23 vote.
Hours earlier Osborne had ruled out standing to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, who said on Friday he would make way for a new leader of the Conservative Party after coming out on the losing side of a referendum he had called.
Osborne refused to be drawn on whether he had advised Cameron against the referendum, and said he himself was the wrong person to unify the Conservative Party, though another supporter of EU membership possibly could.
“I am not backing any candidate at the moment. I was full-throttled in arguing for remaining in the EU and because half my party wanted to leave the EU I don't think I can be the person who can bring the party back together at this moment.”
Osborne said the leadership contest would allow the party to decide how close Britain should stay to the EU.
“The candidate who is able now to articulate, in my view, the clearest, crispest version of what relationship we are seeking, which in my view involves the best possible terms of trade for services and goods, is the candidate I think who can lead the country,” Osborne said.
Before the referendum Osborne said Britain would need an emergency budget to impose extra austerity if the country voted to leave the EU, but on Monday he said this would have to wait until Conservative party members elected a new leader.
On Tuesday, when asked if new budget measures would involve tax rises and spending cuts, Osborne said “Yes, absolutely.”
“We are adjusting to life outside the EU and it will not be as economically rosy as life inside the EU,” he said.
A councilor of Los Baños town raised questions on a supposed ordinance that allowed the mayor to borrow P91 million from a bank to finish the construction of a new town hall, describing it as spurious.
Councilor Jay Rolusta said the council never ratified the ordinance allowing Mayor Anthony Genuino, son of former Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) chairman Efraim Genuino who faces a string of criminal charges, to enter into a loan deal with the Land Bank of the Philippines.

Rolusta said the loan deal appeared in the minutes of the March 26 session of the council “when in fact, it was never tackled.”
“It was just inserted,” said the councilor.
The loan deal, Rolusta said, was never taken up in plenary. What several councilors did was to simply sign the minutes of the March 26 meeting and the proposed ordinance. Rolusta and another councilor, Antonio Kalaw, did not sign.
Deception
According to Rolusta, the deception became obvious when he and Kalaw's names appeared as authors of the ordinance. “I requested that our names be removed because it was just insulting,” said Rolusta.
A copy of the ordinance furnished to the Philippine Daily Inquirer said the P91 million would be used to finish the construction of the new Los Baños municipal hall building along the national highway in Timugan village. The ordinance was a requirement of the bank before it releases the fund.
“Let it be known to Land Bank that if the minutes were falsified, the document is not authentic,” said Rolusta.
He said a public hearing should instead be called to discuss the loan deal.
The construction of the three-story municipal building was a project proposed under the administration of former Los Baños Mayor and now Laguna Vice Governor Caesar Perez. The first two phases of the construction were completed last year with funds from “external sources” or donations.

“If there wasn't any irregularity, why not go through a plenary or a committee hearing?” Rolusta said.
‘Formality'
In September 2010, the municipal council in a majority vote approved the loan amount of P150 million, of which P95 million would be allotted to finish the third phase of the building and the rest for other projects.
In April 2011, the council issued another resolution authorizing Mayor Genuino to enter into a P91 million loan deals for the building construction.
Councilor Lourdes Principe, one of the ordinance authors, denied any irregularity in the March 26 ordinance, saying it was only a “formality” of previous resolutions.
“How could they say that (the ordinance) was done in haste when it was already approved before,” she said.

A family waits for permission from police to walk through the three-block wide crime scene to get home. Sean Monahan
UPDATE: This story has been updated to include the identity of the victim, and further information on the shooting.
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ - The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office is once again investigating an incident where New Brunswick police fired their guns at people in the troubled Remsen Avenue neighborhood. The latest victim, a 19-year-old man, was rushed to a hospital where he is currently undergoing treatment.
News12 New Jersey's Marci Rubin posted on Twitter that the family of 19-year-old Victor Rodriguez had identified him as the victim in the shooting, adding that they fear he may be paralyzed. The tweet also said that Rodriguez's friends say he had a fake gun.
But local police say the victim "was believed to have a gun and was believed to have fired shots." A statement released by the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office was silent on the question of whether or not Rodriguez actually had a weapon.
The shooting occurred just one block from the backyard where an unarmed 46-year-old man, Barry Deloatch, was killed by police. A grand jury investigation is currently underway into Officer Brad Berdel, who fired the shots that killed Deloatch shortly after midnight on September 22.
Police radio transmissions from tonight indicate that the officers involved in this shooting were Detectives Christopher Bornheimer and Andrew "Drew" Weiss, though it is not yet clear who shot Rodriguez. Weiss filed 11 "use of force" reports in 2010, third-highest of the city's 136 sworn officers.
A statement released by the prosecutor's office says NBPD officers on routine patrol came upon an "altercation," at about 6:14pm near the intersection of Remsen Avenue and Seaman Street.
Police radio transmissions reveal the chaos that unfolded at about that time.
Within seconds of the initial "shots fired" announcement, a voice expresses concern about a vehicle preparing to leave the area: "There's a white car taking off towards Lee Avenue, a white car, that plate I called back," says one officer.
Then, another voice asks for backup: "Brunswick, get everybody over here. We're involved in it," presumably referring to the shooting.
It does not appear that the white vehicle was immediately stopped or located by the police, because five minutes later, the car's license plate number (ZLR 23T) was broadcast again over the police radio frequency, followed by "[Detective] Drew [Weiss], you lookin for anybody else involved in this?"
No response.
Another voice later remarks that there was a large crowd in the area on the unseasonably warm Tuesday evening.
"Hey New Brunswick, can you have somebody come to Remsen and Seaman please? There's like a thousand people out here with us and we need EMS here for this guy."
Neither the recordings nor the press release from the prosecutor's office were clear on how the altercation escalated into gunfire, nor does it definitively say anyone had a gun besides the officers.
"The New Brunswick Police Department further reported that one of the individuals was believed to have had a gun and was believed to have fired shots. The officers then fired shots and wounded the man, who was rushed to a hospital where he is being treated at this time," the release said.
The release also said the names of the officers were being withheld, though it did not state a reason for doing so. The prosecutor's office waited weeks to name the two officers involved in the Deloatch killing, Berdel and former Rutgers University football player Daniel Mazan.
New Brunswick Police, along with Middlesex County Sheriff's officers and North Brunswick Township police have continued to maintain the perimeter around a three-block area while investigators gather evidence well into the night.
A new spokesman for the City of New Brunswick, Russell Marchetta, referred all questions to the county prosecutor's office, which will be handling the investigation.
I was humbled to have dinner in Washington, D.C., last week with an incredible group of my co-recipients recognized in Foreign Policy magazine's 2013 list of leading global thinkers. Conspicuously absent in the category of “The Surveillance State and Its Discontents” were the discontents: Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Edward Snowden -- not because they did not want to attend but because these three American global thinkers are unwelcome in the United States.
Greenwald has been accused of being a co-conspirator to break the law. The U.S. government has regularly harassed, searched and intimidated documentary filmmaker Poitras at the border. And the U.S. government revoked Edward Snowden's passport.
Advertisement:
Greenwald, Poitras and Snowden are on a growing list of journalists, activists and whistle-blowers who are unable to travel freely because of their First Amendment-protected activities. Their fears of persecution are sadly not exaggerated. The United Kingdom detained Greenwald's husband, Brazilian David Miranda, for nine hours and charged him with violating an anti-terrorism law because he had met with Poitras and carried information (not some illegal substance or terrorist plans) for Greenwald. WikiLeaks journalist Sarah Harrison, who literally rescued whistle-blower Snowden from Hong Kong, has been advised by her attorneys not to return home to the U.K. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has long been the target of a U.S. criminal investigation, and was forced to seek asylum from Ecuador, but cannot get there.
The U.S. has promised not to torture Snowden, but such a “promise” only raises the question: Is that how low a democracy should set the bar -- at not torturing someone -- rather than providing due process and abiding by international humanitarian standards? The Obama administration's aggressive prosecution of whistle-blowers under the Espionage Act and willingness to embroil journalists in “leak” investigations and prosecutions casts doubt on the legitimacy of the criminal justice system.
Unable to attend in person, Snowden sent an eloquent statement, which I read at the celebration dinner. Unfathomably, maintaining his sense of humor amid exile and ongoing threats, Snowden began his statement with a joke: “I apologize for being unable to attend in person, but I've been having a bit of passport trouble.” Snowden's inspiring words were food for some of the world's leading thinkers:
Today we stand at the crossroads of policy, where parliaments and presidents on every continent are grappling with how to bring meaningful oversight to the darkest corners of our national security bureaucracies. The stakes are high. James Madison warned that our freedoms are most likely to be abridged by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power.
Mirroring public opinion, Snowden's statement was generally well received. But, in a stark demonstration of just how loud the U.S. government's propaganda megaphone has become, several intelligent thought-makers clung to long since debunked memes about Snowden and his whistle-blowing. One attendee speculated about the nefarious reasons Snowden might have “chosen” to flee to Russia, when, in fact, the U.S. government stranded Snowden in Russia by revoking his passport when he was en route to Latin America. Another condemned Snowden for some unknown, theoretical future “harm” resulting from his disclosures. Despite expending considerable resources looking for it, the U.S. has found no such evidence. Yet another criticized him for not using “internal channels,” either ignorant or in denial of the fact that there are no effective internal channels for intelligence community whistle-blowers, and existent “channels” serve more to entrap than to protect them.
The fact that a third of the honorees in the Surveillance State category of leading global thinkers could not travel to the U.S. to attend a dinner celebrating free thinking is a tragic irony. The restriction on travel is another form of chilling First Amendment-protected activities of speech and association, and is an anti-democratic tactic that is the stuff of dictatorships, not democracies.
Even though Snowden does not seek or want recognition, as a whistle-blower advocate, I am heartened that Foreign Policy magazine recognized his unprecedented and courageous contribution to -- indeed, enabling of -- global thinking on surveillance. Snowden wrote in his statement: “I bet my life on the idea that together, in the light of day, we can find a better balance.” The noticeably absent honorees are testament to how far we still have to go.
In Hear This, A.V. Club writers sing the praises of songs they know well. This week, in honor of all the horrors, we're picking our favorite songs about death.

In the interview for my first real job in journalism—a general-assignment beat for the features section of my college newspaper—I was asked to name the greatest pop song ever written. Imbued with the type of forthrightness and unearned confidence available only to the stupid and young, I didn't skip a beat. ‘“A Day In The Life,” by The Beatles,” I responded, before prattling on about the song's multi-movement structure and the importance of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, opinions that likely leaned on opinions formed out of old Chuck Klosterman columns and Rolling Stone record guides.
Sitting at that conference table, I couldn't have been wrong, because I was 21 and in love with rock 'n' roll (or the very small slice of rock that had shown itself to me at 21). Eight years later, however, I disagree with my former self, for the following reasons:
“A Day In The Life” can't be the best pop song of all time, because it isn't even The Beatles' best song. That's probably “Eight Days A Week” or “A Hard Day's Night” or “Yesterday” or “Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey.” (Just kidding on the last one; I meant to type “Why Don't We Do It In The Road.”)
More accurately, “A Day In The Life” is “the most mind-blowing Beatles song to hear on a sunny summer afternoon on your uncle's boat, at a time when your conception of ‘mind-blowing Beatles song' ends at ‘Paperback Writer.'” (“Paperback Writer”—with its scuzzy guitar hook, infinite chorus, and the sing-song “Frère Jacques” verse harmonies—being another contender for best Beatles song that's not “A Day In The Life.”)
And for the purposes of this Hear This theme, “A Day In The Life” isn't even the best Beatles song about death. That's “Eleanor Rigby,” an emotional gut-punch of a tune whose chamber-pop arrangement fooled countless bands in the 2000s to hire a cello player. (They didn't need it; none of them wrote “Eleanor Rigby.”)

Thoughts of mortality are confined to the few first lines of the song's A-section, but the specter of death that hangs around the whole of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, from its funereal cover to the “clues” about Paul McCartney's “demise” hidden in the record sleeve. Conspiracy theorists eventually made their way to the end of the record to “A Day In The Life,” holding up the first verse of the song as proof that McCartney fell victim to a fatal car crash before he could lend John Lennon the song's doubly suggestive refrain: “I'd love to turn you on.”
But to me, where the song really reaches out to touch the inevitable—and where it bowled me over the first time I heard it, the time I called it the greatest pop song of all time, and the few times I've listened to it for this piece—is in the symphonic swell that serves as segue between the movements. Like the “whole life passing before your eyes” sensation reported by survivors of near-death experiences, these psychedelic glissandos seemingly pack decades of information into a few swirling measures of “A Day In The Life.” The second time the strings (and percussion and the brass and the woodwinds) come in, they race toward a finale as definitive as any granted to an LP. There's a rush, a break, and then then cooling, calm release of an E-major chord struck simultaneously on three pianos and a harmonium.
In an outtake from The Beatles Anthology, engineer George Martin recalls the members of the band seeking out “a big orchestral orgasm” to bridge the gaps of “A Day In The Life.” The sustained E-major is Sgt. Pepper's not-so-petite mort. So, perhaps I misspoke when I called “A Day In The Life” the best pop song ever written. Maybe I meant to say it's “the ultimate pop song”—by which I mean I wouldn't mind my own mort sounding like those signature glissandos.
