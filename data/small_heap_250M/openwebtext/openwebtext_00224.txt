Stupid Singapore
As the Model F1 World Championship concluded its European leg and went to Singapore, the Manor Mercedes team had high hopes of extending their podium streak. Alas, it was not meant to be.
Felipe Massa and Pastor Maldonado qualified 7th and 10th, respectively. Massa entered the top 5 quickly, but his fortunes began to turn when his overtake on Ferrari's Kevin Magnussen was ruled illegal, as he passed Magnussen while bypassing the chicane to avoid a collision. On lap 43, Massa's MM2 began to emit smoke, forcing a retirement. In the garage, the team attributed the incident to an engine failure. As for Maldonado, he remained within the low top 10/high teens range, but began dropping places to Magnussen, Giedo van der Garde and Lewis Hamilton. 11 laps after Massa's retirement, Maldonado ran off the track in turns 18 and 19.
Team principal macus16 had little words to describe the weekend: ‚ÄúüòÖüòÖüòÖ‚Äù.
The full race results can be viewed here.
Next week, the Model F1 World Championship heads to Suzuka for the Japanese Grand Prix.
New Team Member
Prior to the weekend, Manor added a new member to the team: surferkev. A Computer Science student by day, the American joined the team during the week, stating that he likes the team logo and did not want to join a team that was already large in size. As of the publishing of this edition of Manor Motorsport Weekly, his role in the team has not yet been determined.

Chile hopes to extradite Sydney nanny Adriana Rivas, implicated in Pinochet-era torture allegations
Updated
The Chilean government is hoping to extradite a Sydney woman to face trial on multiple charges of violent crime allegedly committed while she was serving under military dictator Augusto Pinochet's brutal intelligence apparatus.
ABC's Foreign Correspondent has discovered the woman, Adriana Rivas, works as a part-time nanny and cleaner in Sydney's eastern suburbs.
She settled there after after fleeing Chile in 2010 while on bail awaiting trial on charges of aggravated kidnapping.
A former servant at Santiago's infamous Simon Bolivar Barracks has provided testimony and evidence to Chilean prosecutors that Rivas was involved in kidnapping and allegedly played a major role in interrogating victims during gruesome torture sessions at what many described as an "extermination centre".
The former servant, Jorgelino Vergara, was arrested and charged in relation to the disappearance and murder of Victor Diaz, Chile's most senior underground Communist leader. He cut a deal with the prosecution and became their star witness.
Prosecutors in Chile have told Foreign Correspondent the accounts of Mr Vergara - also known as 'The Little Waiter' ‚Äì are supported by others who have provided evidence in the case.
Mr Vergara was employed at Simon Bolivar during the 1970s to serve tea and sandwiches to the torture gangs while they inflicted shocking injuries on their victims, invariably killing them.
His testimony has already led to 74 arrests for aggravated kidnapping and homicide and the conviction of many former agents of the Pinochet regime.
Mr Vergara also fed the prisoners, and cleaned up the blood after torture sessions.
He told Foreign Correspondent that Rivas helped torturers exact confessions from victims and that she held a recording device close to their mouths as they were being beaten and receiving electric shocks.
"Generally Adriana Rivas, when she participated in the torture of the detainees, she beat them with sticks, she kicked them, punched them and also applied electricity to them," Mr Vergara said.
Chile's supreme court has endorsed an extradition application asking Australia to extradite Rivas, who has been living in Australia for more than 30 years.
The Attorney-General's office in Australia will not comment on the extradition process.
It is alleged Rivas worked as an intelligence agent for the so-called DINA, Chile's much-feared secret police.
Headed by General Manuel Contreras, the second most powerful man after Pinochet, DINA set up torture centres all over the country, and ordered the elimination of all three clandestine leaderships of the Chilean Communist Party.
Families say they want allegations answered
Extradition from Australia is a lengthy and complicated process involving courts and ministerial deliberation.
Seven Chilean families are encouraging Chilean authorities to bring charges of aggravated kidnapping against Rivas.
One of those families is the Ortiz family.
Their father, Fernando Ortiz, was kidnapped in 1976. He was a prominent professor from the University of Chile and he was a member of the Communist underground.
Mr Ortiz was so badly battered he was eventually killed by a lethal injection.
His daughter, Estela Ortiz, told Foreign Correspondent that Rivas needs to come home and answer the allegations.
"I believe that Adriana Rivas has to face justice... I think it's the only way for her to live relatively in peace. I believe she has to testify like any other Chilean," Ms Ortiz said.
"She has the right to a defence; she has the rights she didn't give to our people."
Chile considers Rivas a fugitive. When she returned there for a family visit in 2006 she was arrested and jailed for three months but when she was released on bail to await her trial months later, she skipped the country via Argentina and returned to Australia.
She declined Foreign Correspondent's requests for interview. In an interview granted to SBS online last year she denied she was involved in torture and kidnapping.

This is big news. This is the first large scale demonstration that the "Terrorism Tax" I speculated about back in 2004, actually works.
______________
Liz Alderman at the NYTimes reported that terrorism is squashing Europe's first glimmer of recovery since the financial crash. EU economic growth has been halved since spring, with France now at zero. Here are some details:
Tourism is sinking. For example: "In France, growth in nightly hotel room bookings after the Paris attacks fell to single digits from 20 percent. After the Brussels bombings, bookings went negative, and after Nice, bookings fell by double digits."
Daily security costs are spiking. Here's an example from a single venue, "the Paris Plage, a makeshift beach erected along the Seine, a dozen armed police officers guarded an entry checkpoint on a recent day. Army troops marched past families playing in the sand and half-empty activity points along the river. The patrols, cost taxpayers about 1 million euros, or $1.1 million, a day."
Broad spectrum economic damage. For example: retail sales are slumping due to low traffic in stores and large numbers of entertainment events are being cancelled.
The Terrorism Tax
Although Europe has suffered terrorism before, this time it's different. Instead of big and relatively infrequent terrorist attacks, these new attacks are small, numerous and geographically dispersed. This change is a big deal, because it makes it possible for terrorists to turn attacks into "a tax" that depresses economic activity by imposing new costs and changing economic behavior. Here's some of the theory from my 2004 article on it:
A terrorism tax is an accumulation of excess costs inflicted on a city's stakeholders by acts of terrorism. These include direct costs inflicted on the city by terrorists (systems sabotage) and indirect costs due to the security/insurance/policy/etc. changes needed to protect against attacks. A terrorism tax above a certain level will force the city to transition to a lower market equilibrium (aka shrink). So, what is that level? Here's what they concluded:
Singular terrorist events (black swans), like 9/11, do not impact city viability. The costs of a singular event dissipate quickly. In contrast, frequent attacks (even small ones) on a specific city can create a terrorism tax of a level necessary to shift equilibriums.
In the labor pooling model of city formation, a terrorism tax of 7% will cause a city to collapse to a lower equilibrium. Labor pooling equilibrium reflects the benefits of aggregating workers in a single location. Workers get higher wages and more choices. Firms get stable wages (no one firm can deplete the market) and more candidates.
In the core-periphery model of city formation, a terrorism tax of 6.3% will push a city to a lower equilibrium. The core-periphery model is based on transportation costs. Firms generate transportation savings by concentrating in a single location next to suppliers and customers. Customers and workers glean the benefit of lower transportation costs by locating near jobs and goods.
________
The terrorism tax is even more effective when it is combined with systems disruption (the intentional disruption of infrastructure). That combo puts in play hidden dynamics - both economic and societal - that can turn a functional society into a violent insurgency within months.
This is the question currently being pondered by physicists studying the revolutionary first detection of gravitational waves in the Summer of 2015. And, in new research, the answer could be primordial.
RELATED: Gravitational Waves to Crack Neutron Star Mystery
Generated by the cataclysmic collision of two black holes some 1.3 billion light-years away, the discovery, made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and announced on Feb. 11, confirmed Albert Einstein's 100-year-old theory of general relativity and heralded a new era of gravitational wave astronomy.
With breathtaking precision, the gravitational wave signal ‚Äî called GW150914 ‚Äî revealed two black holes, one 29 solar masses and the other 36 solar masses, get trapped in an orbital dance that ultimately resulted in their collision and merging as one. The signal wasn't only the first direct detection of gravitational waves, it was the first time astronomers "saw" the guts of one of the most energetic collisions in our universe. And, best of all, the gravitational waves LIGO detected precisely matched our theoretical predictions about what black holes are and how they act before and after a merger.
On June 14, a second announcement came about another detection of gravitational waves, confirming the first detection wasn't a fluke.
WATCH VIDEO: More Gravitational Waves Detected By LIGO!
Using laser beams, scientists have detected the physical distortions caused by passing gravitational waves. See how the LIGO observatory hunts gravitational waves in this Space.com infographic (Image: ¬© By Karl Tate, Infographics Artist)
As momentous as this landmark discovery was, a puzzle quickly presented itself.
Generally, the most common black holes found in the modern universe come in two broad categories: stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes. Stellar mass black holes are, you guessed it, formed after a massive star explodes as a supernova. Supermassive black holes, which "weigh in" at millions to billions of solar masses, are the monsters that live in the centers of galaxies. (There is currently a lot of work going into understanding how black holes evolve from stellar to supermassive and some studies have found "intermediate mass" black holes may be the "missing link", though we have some ways to go before working out if this is the case.)
In short, the two black holes that generated GW150914 were too big and can't be explained as being two stellar mass black holes colliding and merging as one. So what kind of black holes were they?
RELATED: We've Detected Gravitational Waves, So What?
Dark Matter Clues?
In two new papers published in the journal Physical Review Letters, researchers take a stab at identifying the origin of these precursor black holes, leading to the conclusion that they may have been formed when the universe was very young. In other words, LIGO could have been witness to the smashup of two primordial black holes -- the most ancient kind of black holes. What's more, future detections of similar collisions could provide tantalizing clues as to whether primordial black holes make up the majority (if not all) of the universe's missing mass. In other words, could these massive objects be the dark matter astrophysicists are looking for?
Some universal evolution models predict the rapid formation of black holes shortly after the Big Bang. The early universe was full of dense knots of matter that likely collapsed under mutual gravity forming a huge number of massive black holes. Though black holes are thought to evaporate over time (via Hawking radiation), many of these primordial black holes are thought to persist, bulking up the universe's missing mass, creating the strange observations of galaxies and galactic cluster that appear to be more massive than the visible matter they contain.
RELATED: Hawking: Gravitational Waves Could Revolutionize Astronomy
There's much debate over the range of masses these primordial black holes could form and how often LIGO (and other gravitational wave detectors in the future) will detect them, but it is clear that this new exciting era of gravitational wave astronomy is already hot on the trail of one of the biggest mysteries of modern astrophysics and cosmology.
Could primordial black holes be the answer? Only time will tell; we need to detect a lot more of these strangely-sized black hole collisions before we'll know where dark matter is hiding.

The Indus Basin aquifer shared by Northwestern India and Pakistan is the second-most ‚Äúoverstressed‚Äù underground water reserve, two new studies have found, as human activity rapidly drains about one-third of the world's largest aquifers.
The researchers said the Arabian Aquifer System, which provides water for more than 60 million people, is the world's most overstressed source. The Indus Basin aquifer was second and the Murzuk-Djado Basin in northern Africa third, they said.
The Indus Basin represents an extensive groundwater aquifer, covering an area of 16.2 million hectares and the aquifer was in a state of hydrological equilibrium before the development of a canal irrigation system by India and Pakistan, according to a 2011 report of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
"What happens when a highly stressed aquifer is located in a region with socioeconomic or political tensions that can't supplement declining water supplies fast enough?" said Alexandra Richey, the lead author for the new studies.
"We're trying to raise red flags now to pinpoint where active management today could protect future lives and livelihoods."
It is unclear how much water remains in underground reserves and huge sections of the population are using up groundwater without knowing when it will run out, researchers said in findings published in the journal Water Resources Research.
Scientists used data from special NASA satellites to measure groundwater losses.
In one paper, they looked at 37 of the world's biggest aquifers between 2003 and 2013. Eight of these were classified as "overstressed", meaning they were being sucked dry with almost no natural replenishment to offset usage.
Five other aquifers, including the Indus Basin aquifer, were classified as "extremely or highly stressed."
The US government has already identified water stress as a potential driver of regional insecurity that can contribute to regional unrest.
South Asia's three major river systems ‚Äì the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra ‚Äì sustain India and Pakistan's breadbasket areas and many of their major cities including New Delhi and Islamabad, as well as Bangladesh.
The strain on groundwater in India is most disturbing. More than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85 percent of drinking water in the country depend on it, says the World Bank. Yet in 20 years, most of its aquifers will be in a critical condition.
‚ÄúGiven how quickly we are consuming the world's groundwater reserves, we need a coordinated global effort to determine how much is left," said University of California Irvine professor Jay Famiglietti, the principal investigator in the new studies.
The scientists warned the situation will worsen with climate change and population growth. The most overburdened aquifers are in the world's driest places, where there is little natural replenishment.
The second paper concluded that the total remaining volume of the world's usable groundwater is poorly known and huge discrepancies exist in estimated "time to depletion".
"We don't actually know how much is stored in each of these aquifers. Estimates of remaining storage might vary from decades to millennia," Richey said.
"In a water-scarce society, we can no longer tolerate this level of uncertainty, especially since groundwater is disappearing so rapidly."

YOU can't overlook the deadly green ideas that contributed to the tragic Grenfell Tower fire in London.
Aluminium composite cladding was applied to the building last May, not just for its good looks but as a sustainable energy solution to achieve green ticks in the carbon-obsessed British regulatory system.
As the management company running the 24-storey tower, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, declared in its strategic report about the refurbishment: ‚ÄúAll of this will greatly enhance the energy efficiency of the building.‚Äù

The flammable insulation was designed to improve energy efficiency and all signs point to the fact that it accelerated the fire, acting as a chimney to draw vertical flames up the building trapping residents at the top.
Fears were raised in the U.K. Telegraph last week that green energy concerns to satisfy carbon emission targets were prioritised ahead of safety.
‚ÄúIt could be that this is the quest for sustainability trumping other concerns,‚Äù said Dr Jim Glockling, Technical Director of the UK Fire Protection Association.
In Australia, cheap flammable Chinese aluminium composite cladding has led to building fires.
Green ideology has given us sky high electricity prices, deadly pink batts and now flammable cladding.

What Is STEEM?
Last Updated: 1st November 2018
Created by Ned Scott and Dan Larimer, STEEM is a cryptocurrency that is used to power Steemit, an incentivized blockchain based social media platform. Steemit is very similar to Reddit, in that it allows users to make posts, write comments, and also upvote posts and comments made by other users. The difference however, is that users can be rewarded monetarily for these actions. Blockchain technology enable users on the Steemit platform to receive the cryptocurrency in exchange for participating on the platform, which can then be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and then eventually fiat currency.
Steemit also has a reputation system, where new users start with a reputation point of 25. The more upvotes a user receives on their content or comments, the higher their reputation point will increase. Conversely, a user's reputation point can also decrease if their content or comments are flagged by other users on Steemit. The reputation system is designed to incentivize good online behavior and etiquette, which is hoped will foster a positive community on the platform.
STEEM, STEEM Dollars (SD) & STEEM Power (SP)
The Steemit platform is based on and driven by three units of measure: STEEM, SD, and SP (also known as VESTS).
STEEM
STEEM is the unit that users receive for participating in Steemit; it is traded on open markets, and can be bought and sold off the Steemit platform. More importantly, it is an inflationary cryptocurrency, which means that the supply of the unit is not fixed. New units are constantly being created and distributed to reward Steemit platform participants, from content creators, to users that upvote and make post comments.
SD
SD are units that are also used to reward users that participate on Steemit. However unlike STEEM, they are pegged to the US dollar, this makes them a more stable unit to receive and sell, as users are not affected by the market fluctuations.
SP
The final unit of measure on the Steemit platform is SP. This essentially represents how much power a user has on the platform. By holding SP, a user has more influence on Steemit. He or she will get paid more for upvoting content/comments made by other people. Holding SP also represents a ‚Äòlong term investment' as it is relatively illiquid. This is because converting SP back into STEEM takes 3 months, which are paid out as 13 weekly payments. SP is illiquid because it prevents large price swings and market crashes in STEEM, as users cannot quickly convert their SP, and then sell once the market starts to dip.
STEEM Witness & Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
A witness is an individual that facilitates the operation of the Steemit platform by their work done on the blockchain itself. A witness operates a witness server, which allows them to make blocks, and then add them to the blockchain. These blocks contain Steemit related information on posts, comments, votes, and currency transfers. Witnesses are rewarded in the form of SP in exchange for their work.
Witnesses are selected using a consensus mechanism known as DPoS. The community chooses witnesses to act as the network's block producers and governance body. Using DPoS, network parameters such as fees, block intervals, and transaction sizes can be altered through these elected witnesses.
Earlier today, The Ashley posted the cast list for the upcoming 29th season of MTV's The Challenge, which will be called ‚ÄúInvasion.‚Äù ‚ÄòChallenge' fan favorite CT Tamburello will return to the show for this season, after taking a long hiatus from the spotlight following the death of his girlfriend, Diem Brown. He had previously said that he wasn't sure if he would ever do another Challenge.
CT is back, and, according to his MTV bio, there's a ‚Äúshocking‚Äù reason behind him coming back to the show‚Ä¶and The Ashley has all the details on it!
‚ÄúIn a moment that you will never see coming, CT will reveal the shocking reason he needs to win the money and leave viewers speechless,‚Äù his MTV bio reads.
According to several of The Ashley's MTV sources, as well as the web sleuths on Vevmo, who were the first to discuss the topic, CT has come back to the show to earn money because‚Ä¶he is now a father! The Ashley's sources tell her that CT is the proud dad to a nearly one-year-old son!
The Ashley's sources confirm that a Miami-area model named Lilianet gave birth to CT's son, who goes by CJ, nearly a year ago. CT was in a relationship with Lilianet during the filming of the upcoming season, although their current relationship status is not known. CT moved to Florida, where he met Lilianet, after the death of Diem.
CT has kept a very low profile in recent years and The Ashley's sources tell her that he previously did not want his relationship or the fact that he has a child going public. He changed his mind when the opportunity to go on the upcoming ‚ÄòChallenge' was presented to him. According to his MTV bio, CT has a ‚Äúnew outlook on life‚Äù which is a reference to the changes he's gone through since the birth of his son in early 2016.
‚ÄúCT makes a triumphant return to The Challenge after a three-year absence. Since going off the grid, this reformed Boston bad boy has emerged with a new outlook on life,‚Äù CT's bio reads. ‚ÄòI used to have a chip on my shoulder but I'm not that same guy anymore. Life is funny. It's up and down for sure, but right now I'm in a high point in my life and I'm excited to be back.'‚Äù
The Ashley's sources tell her that CT's cast mates on ‚ÄúInvasion‚Äù were shocked by the news that he is now a father.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday the United States would be ‚Äútweaking‚Äù its trade relationship with Canada, stopping short of calling for a major realignment in a development likely to please visit Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) linking the economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada to make the terms more favorable to Americans.
At a joint news conference with Trudeau after White House talks, Trump said his biggest concern with NAFTA was the U.S. trade relationship with Mexico, which he has frequently accused of stealing American jobs.
‚ÄúWe have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We'll be tweaking it,‚Äù Trump said.
‚ÄúIt's a much less severe situation than what's taking place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years the transaction was not fair to the United States,‚Äù he said.
Trump said the United States and Canada were stronger when they joined forces in matters of international commerce, and both countries benefited from having more jobs and trade in North America.
‚ÄúWe should coordinate closely - and we will coordinate closely - to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe,‚Äù Trump said.
Trudeau carefully steered around questions about the Canadian trade relationship with the United States in what was his first meeting with the new president. He said he expected each country to always remain each other's most essential partner.
‚ÄúThere have been times where we have differed in our approaches and that's always been done firmly and respectfully. The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,‚Äù Trudeau said.
Trump's vow to renegotiate NAFTA has unnerved Canadian officials, even though he has singled out Mexico in his criticism of the free trade deal. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States.

Canadians have become more supportive of NAFTA since Trump's election victory on Nov. 8, a poll from the Angus Reid Institute showed on Monday. Forty-four percent of the 1,508 surveyed said NAFTA had benefited Canada, up from 25 percent from a poll last June.
Trudeau, when asked about Canadian firms' concerns about possible changes to NAFTA, said: ‚ÄúIt is a real concern for many Canadians because we know our economy is very dependent on our relationship with the United States.
‚ÄúGoods and services do cross the border each day...we have to allow this free flow of goods and services and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies.‚Äù
Trudeau had a strong rapport with former Democratic President Barack Obama, prompting pundits to describe their relationship as a ‚Äúbromance.‚Äù
Soon after Trump put a hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries in an executive order on Jan. 27, citing the need to head off attacks by Islamist militants, the Canadian prime minister took to Twitter to say refugees were welcome in Canada.
‚ÄòHUGE WIN'
Analysts said Trudeau, who has strong incentives to build a relationship with Trump given rising anti-trade sentiment, is bound to be happy with the first meeting.
‚ÄúI thought it was a huge, huge win. The worst case scenario is we wound up with an Australia moment, when a relationship that should be on solid ground takes a bad turn,‚Äù said Carlo Dade, director of the Center for Trade and Investment Policy at the Canada West Foundation.
‚ÄúInstead, we actually got an endorsement of North American jobs, of Canada-U.S. jobs, working together, no ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù - just the opposite,‚Äù he added.
Details about a tense telephone call late last month between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had created wariness. The Washington Post, citing unidentified senior U.S. officials, said Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Turnbull, even though Australia has long been a staunch U.S. ally.

David Wilkins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada, said the priority of the meeting was to set a positive tone, and that was accomplished.
‚ÄúThe president's comment on the economy and creating jobs together was a very positive sign for Canadians, especially those that had been concerned about the trading relationship,‚Äù said Wilkins. ‚ÄúI think it was a win-win for both countries.‚Äù

Casting continues on the Preacher pilot at AMC, from writers/directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The potential series is an adaptation of the beloved Garth Ennis graphic novel of the same name, and fans are no doubt hoping that Rogen and Goldberg are the ones who can finally bring this property to the screen.
Per Deadline, Dominic Cooper‚Äîwho played Howard Stark in Captain America: The First Avenger as well as Marvel's Agent Carter TV series‚Äîcontinues to be in negotiations for the lead role of Jesse Custer, a conflicted Preacher in a small Texas town who merges with a creature that has escaped from heaven and develops the ability to make anyone do what he says. This would be a major starring role for the very talented Cooper, who was first rumored for the part last month.
In terms of solidified casting for Preacher, Deadline says True Blood actress Lucy Griffiths has signed on in an unspecified role. Griffiths was poised to be the female lead on NBC's Constantine before the network opted to change course and kill her character off in the pilot. No matter, that freshman series' future looks murky at best.
So far, Rogen and Goldberg have already assembled a fair amount of their ensemble. Ruth Negga (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) will play Tulip, Ian Colletti (Rake) is Arseface, and Joseph Gilgun (This Is England) recently signed on to play Irish vampire Cassidy.
Rogen and Goldberg co-wrote the pilot with Breaking Bad alum Sam Catlin, who will act as showrunner should AMC order the pilot to series. Production will get underway this summer in anticipation of a potential 2016 debut.
The original opening date for the boardwalk project has been pushed back through July, city officials said. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Katie Honan
ROCKAWAY PARK ‚Äî Construction on a section of the boardwalk that has been delayed due to crane regulations passed last month will severely limit beach access in the neighborhood this summer, according to the Parks Department.
On Memorial Day, the official start of the season, beaches from Beach 108th to Beach 109th, and Beach 115th to Beach 117th streets in Rockaway Park, will be open for swimming.
All other beaches between Beach 108th and Beach 126th streets will be closed until work on the boardwalk is completed sometime in July, officials said. Beaches where the boardwalk is completed will be open, officials said.
Officials announced late Tuesday that the initial open date of Memorial Day for Beach 108th to Beach 126th streets was delayed due to high winds, which forced crane work to be halted.
Regulations from the deadly crane collapse in Lower Manhattan in February now requires cranes to be placed in "safety modes" when winds hit 20 mph, or wing gusts are forecast to exceed 30 mph, the city said.
A spokeswoman with the mayor's office said there were at least 20 times in March and April where the cranes working on the boardwalk were put into "safety modes."

They come for the sea, sun, for peace and quiet ... and business opportunities. Taking advantage of old historical and cultural ties, more and more Russians are settling the former Yugoslav republic and EU member candidate Montenegro.
For the Russian Vadim Soendoekov every working day starts in the same way: with a cup of coffee on the beach. "The beach, the sun and the sea, what more could you want?" he asks from under his straw parasol.
The beach on which Soendoekov enjoys his morning coffee lies at the foot of the centuries-old ramparts of Budva, a picturesque town that is regarded as the heart of tourism in Montenegro. Here the sun shines three hundred days a year.
There are worse places where to start your day. That's what Soendoekov must have thought when he first arrived here at the Adriatic coast for a holiday five years ago. He decided to stay. Together with two Russian friends he runs a real estate firm in Budva.
And there is no shortage of clients. In fact, so many Russians have flocked to the Montenegrin coast in recent years that Budva is sometimes nicknamed Moscow-on-Sea. Even in the low season, the nearby airport provides three flights a day to the Russian capital.
But not only tourists are on board, as a strikingly high number of Russians, especially from the middle class, have moved for good to the Adriatic coast. They are there to serve their compatriots who overrun the coast during the peak season or have a profession that they can also practice abroad.
Like the Russians, the Montenegrins are Orthodox
In a way these Russians are following a century-old tradition, for in the 19th nineteenth century well-off Russians drifted to the Crimea or the Mediterranean, in search of warmer climes. But the weather is no longer the most important reason for their migration. It is at the Adriatic coast that they find the peace and quiet so lacking in Russia. Especially Moscow has, according to many, becoming an impossible place to live in.
The first thing that Nadja Lapteva noticed when she landed in Montenegro was the word "polako". "It means take it easy, relax, expressions that I had forgotten existed in Moscow. There, everybody is in a hurry.‚Äù Last year she made an attempt to return to Moscow. But the daily traffic jams were too much for her. She now runs one of the three Russian schools in Budva.
Escaping the hectic city life is also the main reason given by Konstantin Pandipoelovitsj, a 30-year-old programmer. "Moscow has more murders than in Mexico, only cigarettes, vodka and caviar are cheap, and as soon as you make any real money, the KGB appears at your doorstep." High-speed Internet is the only thing he misses about Moscow.
Compared with Russia, Montenegro is a normal country. Despite the widespread corruption, the country is well on its way to becoming one of the next Member States of the European Union. Membership of the NATO is also on the wish list of the government in Podgorica, the capital.
This has not tempered the Russian's love, however. Fact is that Montenegro has something that the other Mediterranean countries cannot offer: a culture that is remarkably similar to that of Russia. Like the Russians, the Montenegrins are Orthodox and, as Slavs, their languages are related. Even their coats of arms are remarkably similar. Also the fact that the Russians do not require a visa makes it just that little bit easier.

On top of this, there are the historic ties. Moscow has since the 19th century acted as the protector of Serbia, with which Montenegro formed a single country until 2006.
Thanks to Russian investments in the tourism industry, the crisis did not hit Montenegro as hard as the rest of the region. Numerous luxurious apartment buildings providing accommodation to the management of Gazprom and other energy giants have mushroomed around Budva in the past five years.
The latest project is on top of a mountain: a high-security residential district offering a breathtaking view of the bay. Carsko Selo, the town of the tzar, is its official name, but everybody calls it the Russian village. And this trend extends beyond real estate as the Russians are also gaining influence in other sectors.
Seven years ago the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska bought the aluminium plant of Podgorica, which is the largest employer of Montenegro and accounts for more than half of this small Balkan state exports. This prompted the German think tank Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik to conclude in 2010 that the Montenegrin economy is now firmly in Russian hands.
Not everyone is pleased with this development. Questions were raised last year in the European Parliament about the growing Russian influence in Montenegro.
But the Russians dismiss the criticism. One of the first inhabitants of the ‚ÄúRussian village‚Äù, a businessman from Moscow, responds angrily. "Did you hear anybody complain when the English invaded the Costa del Sol and the Germans occupied Mallorca?"
BC Ferries has confirmed it plans to commission three new vessels that will be able to operate on liquid natural gas, but there is no guarantee they will be built in B.C.
The ferry company announced three months ago it planned to build the ferries to replace the vessels currently operating on the Tsawwassen ‚Äì Southern Gulf Islands route and the Comox ‚Äì Powell River route.
On Monday the company confirmed the vessels would be built to operate using both liquid natural gas and marine diesel.
‚ÄúWe expect to operate these new intermediate class ferries with LNG, which will reduce our fuel costs, and in turn help reduce the upward pressure on fares," said vice president of engineering Mark Wilson in a statement issued Monday morning.
"In addition, we expect to reduce our environmental footprint with a cleaner fuel source.
"While other ferry operators have already adopted LNG as a fuel source, these will be the first ships in our fleet to utilize this natural resource which is abundant here in British Columbia."
BC Ferries says using LNG could cut fuel costs by 50 per cent, based on current market rates and reduce greenhouse gas emission and air pollution. The ferry company spent about $121 million on fuel last year.
Five shipbuilding companies have been shortlisted to bid on the design and construction of the ships, but only one Canadian company made the shortlist, which included:
Norway's Fiskerstrand Blrt As.
Germany's Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft mbH & Co.KG.
Poland's Remontowa Shipbuilding S.A.
Canada's Seaspan Vancouver Shipyards Co. Ltd.
Turkey's Sefine Shipyard.
BC Ferries says the new vessels are part of a plan to build future vessels to fit five classes, in order to standardize equipment, maintenance and training, and to increase flexibility within the fleet.
Smaller vessels planned
According to the earlier announcement this year, two of the ferries will be designed to carry 145 cars and 600 passengers on each of the routes.
A third smaller ferry, designed to carry 125 cars and 600 passengers, will be used to add extra sailings to the Southern Gulf Islands route during peak times, and to provide refit relief for the two larger ferries.
The two main vessels will be smaller than those they are replacing. The Queen of Burnaby and Queen of Nanaimo, which were built in 1965 and 1964, both carry 192 cars and 996 passengers and crew.
The smaller size of the two main ferries will help cut costs during the winter months, while the third ferry will provide even greater capacity on the Southern Gulf island route in the summer.
The first two larger ferries are expected to be in service in 2016, with the smaller ship arriving in 2017.
HOUSTON (Reuters) - A vessel carrying Venezuelan petroleum coke whose load caught fire set sail late on Tuesday for Colombia, allowing exports from the terminal to resume after a three-week halt while authorities decided what to do with the ship.
The Petrosanfelix terminal where the vessel was stuck accounts for more than a third of the around 150,000 tonnes of petroleum coke that Venezuela can export per month. Utilities buy the product and mix it with coal to burn at power plants.
The Top Trader, chartered by U.S. Koch Industries and carrying 22,000 metric tonnes of petroleum coke, sailed on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data.
The cargo was sailing for Cartagena, Colombia, a change from the original destination in Europe.
The vessel's crew noticed burning petroleum coke when loading the cargo last month at the terminal, which is operated by state-run oil giant PDVSA.
It was unclear if the burning coke caused any damage to the bulk carrier.
PDVSA refused to allow the ship to discharge the cargo, so its insurance company and the ship broker authorized the vessel to sail to another port to unload.
Before clearing the move, Colombian Maritime Authority requested the vessel's manager provide a contingency plan for navigation and discharge, sources said.
Petroleum coke is a product derived from upgrading Venezuelan Orinoco belt's extra heavy oil into a crude more valuable for refiners.
The coke is typically transported from production facilities to the terminals at a high temperature, but many customers do not accept loading the cargoes if they detect fire.
Frequent outages and logistics problems have created an accumulation of million of tonnes of petroleum coke at PDVSA's eastern terminals in recent years. Exports have also been affected in the past.
After the Top Trader left the Petrosanfelix terminal, loading operations resumed at that facility, while other PDVSA ports were also loading petroleum coke this week, according to an independent report.
SAN JOSE ‚Äî A man was shot and killed in South San Jose on Saturday night, marking the city's 29th homicide of the year, according to police.
Officers were called about 9:20 p.m. to Azucar Avenue and Roeder Road, off Monterey Highway, for reports of a shooting. They arrived to find a person they described only as an adult male suffering from at least one gunshot wound. He died at the scene.
Police did not release additional details late Saturday. The killing happened just blocks away from the site of a deadly Aug. 2 shooting in front of a minimart on Edenview Drive. In that case, three men were arrested in the death of 33-year-old Santrius Romel Lawrence.
The shooting Saturday was the city's 29th homicide of 2014; at the same point last year, there were 39.
It also marked a bloody week for a stretch of Monterey Highway. On Tuesday evening, there was a double homicide at Rancho Road, where a father and son were shot and killed in what relatives said was a robbery. Police have not announced a motive.

A New Mexico police officer who shot at a van loaded with children in October has been fired from his job.
According to CBS News, a spokesman for the New Mexico State Police confirmed Friday that Officer Elias Montoya was stripped of his badge on Friday after a disciplinary hearing headed by State Police Chief Pete Kassetas.
At a press conference on Friday, State Police spokesperson Lt. Emmanuel Gutierrez told reporters that Montoya's termination would be effective as of 5:00 p.m. that day. Montoya, a 12-year veteran of the force, has 30 days to appeal the firing.
In October, Montoya opened fire on a minivan at a chaotic traffic stop outside the town of Taos, NM.
On October 28, an officer stopped African-American driver Oriana Ferrell for speeding, saying that she was going 71 miles per hour in a 55 zone. During the traffic stop, Ferrell ‚Äî who was taking the kids on a family vacation from Tennessee ‚Äî panicked and drove away, fearing for the safety of her five children from the white officer.
The officer pulled Ferrell over again and attempted to physically wrest her from behind the wheel. The confrontation escalated when Ferrell's 14-year-old son got into a tussle with the arresting officer, who attempted to use a taser against the boy.
Then, just as police reinforcements arrived, Ferrell and the children attempted to flee a second time, just as one officer broke out the minivan's passenger window with his baton.
As the van pulled away with officers shouting and Ferrell and the children screaming, Officer Montoya fired three shots into the vehicle. Luckily, no one was hurt.
Police arrested Ferrell and charged her with child abuse, fleeing an officer and possession of drug paraphernalia for a pair of marijuana pipes that were found in the van. Her 14-year-old son was charged with battery and taken into juvenile custody. The other four children were handed over to New Mexico's Children, Youth and Families Department.
Ferrell has since been released on bond, but was forced to surrender custody of her children to another family pending the outcome of her case in New Mexico.
The Taos News reported that her attorney Alan Maestas objected to the inclusion of child abuse in the charges against his client.
‚ÄúShe was flat-out scared that something was going to happen to her children,‚Äù said Maestas. ‚ÄúWe ought to talk about the stupidity and recklessness of shooting at a car that has five children in it.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf someone ought to be charged with child abuse, it ought to be the New Mexico State Police,‚Äù he said.

One of the things I love about C++ is the fact that it is a strongly-typed language. An essential element of good programming is writing code that is self-documenting. The more explicit you are in your code, the less chance that you, your fellow programmers, or even the compiler will misunderstand your purpose. That said, strong typing can be taken too far.
One of the problems I noted in the first math library I worked with was excessive repetition of common operations. Vector normalization particularly seemed to be done everywhere. The library had numerous functions that took as an input parameter a 3 component vector and required that vector to be normalized. The principle consideration in the design of the library must have been ease of use, because most library functions accepted unnormalized inputs and always performed a normalization step themselves. The unfortunate downside of this approach was that vectors were frequently being renormalized unnecessarily and performance suffered.
struct Vector3 { ‚Ä¶ } ;
struct Plane { ‚Ä¶ } ; Vector3Plane // Construct a Plane object given a point on the plane and the plane's normal
Plane CreatePlane(Vector3 point, Vector3 normal)
{
normal = Normalize(normal);
‚Ä¶
}
Years later when I had an opportunity to design my own math library, I attempted to solve this problem with C++ types. I introduced a new type in my math library called NormalizedVector3. Functions like CreatePlane were modified to take NormalizedVector3 objects and consequently they no longer needed to perform possibly redundant normalizations. My first implementation of NormalizedVector3 looked something like this:
struct NormalizedVector3
{
// construction from Vector3 must normalize!
NormalizedVector3 ( Vector3 v ) ; NormalizedVector3NormalizedVector3Vector3 v // construction from scalars must normalize!
NormalizedVector3(float x, float y, float z); // cast operator allows NormalizedVector3 to be compatible with Vector3
operator Vector3() const; // can't allow non-const access to members
float X() const;
float Y() const;
float Z() const; private:
float x, y, z;
};
This worked reasonably well but there were a few problems. NormalizedVector3 allowed implicit construction from Vector3 and implicit casting to Vector3 so it could take advantage of all the built-in functionality of a Vector3. Unfortunately this also meant it introduced a lot of opportunities for implicit normalization.
NormalizedVector3 nv2 = nv0 * nv1; // implicit conversion to Vector3 and
// back to NormalizedVector3 NormalizedVector3 nv0, nv1;NormalizedVector3 nv2 = nv0 * nv1; Vector3 point, normal;
Plane p = CreatePlane(point, normal); // implicit conversion to NormalizedVector3
Since operations like vector multiplication are not length-preserving, they are handled by implicit conversions to and from Vector3. Not only is this confusing, it is exactly the sort of hidden (and likely unnecessary) cost I was trying to avoid. My second implementation made the constructor of NormalizedVector3 explicit, which added a bit more overhead to the API but also helped highlight what kind of work was going on underneath the hood.
NormalizedVector3 nv2 = NormalizedVector3 ( nv0 * nv1 ) ; NormalizedVector3 nv0, nv1;NormalizedVector3 nv2 = NormalizedVector3nv0 * nv1 Vector3 point, normal;
Plane p = CreatePlane(point, NormalizedVector3(normal) );
Of couse as soon all the hidden normalizations were brought to light, I discovered a host of undesirable ones. The math library included functions to multiply vectors and matrices, and most of the time the matrices represented orthogonal transformations. Now all of a sudden transforming a NormalizedVector3 by a matrix required renormalization!
NormalizedVector vOld;
Matrix3x3 orthogonalTransform;
NormalizedVector3 vNew =
NormalizedVector3 ( orthogonalTransform * vOld ) ; // unnecessary normalization
Luckily I already had a solution to this problem, more C++ types! I created an OrthonormalMatrix3x3 class with a relationship to Matrix3x3 much like NormalizedVector3's relationship to Vector3. I was then able to provide a function for transforming NormalizedVector3s by OrthonormalMatrix3x3s that returned NormalizedVector3s and, as if by magic, all concerns about unnecessary normalization disappeared! Okay, not really. What actually happened was I discovered lots of operations on orthonormal matrices that preserved orthonomality but were now resulting in unnecessary re-orthonormalizations. I attempted to provide overloads of those operations to remove the unnecessary conversions between Matrix3x3s and OrthonormalMatrix3x3s and hilarity ensued.
By this time it was pretty clear I was halfway to Wonderland and it was time to turn around and crawl back out of the rabbit hole. I deleted all references to OrthonormalMatrix3x3 and NormalizedVector3, which by this point constituted an unhealthy percentage of my math library's code, and made just two modifications to the original design:
// Construct a Plane object given a point on the plane and the plane's normal
// The normal vector must be unit length.
Plane CreatePlane ( Vector3 origin, Vector3 normal )
{
assert ( IsUnitLength ( normal ) ) ;
‚Ä¶
}
The lesson here is that simplicity is every bit as important in API design as correctness. You can try to make your API so clever that even an idiot can't misuse it, or you can try to make your API so simple that even an idiot can't misunderstand it. The result is usually the same‚Äìhigh performance, error-free code‚Äìbut your clients will be happier and your codebase will be much, much leaner.
In episode 55 of Kneel Before Aud, I chat with the loveliest of persons, actor Tamsen McDonough. For the last three seasons of the hit Syfy show Killjoys, Tamsen has voiced Lucy, the lovable and loyal A.I of the spaceship that carries Dutch, D'avin and John on their adventures throughout the Quad. Lucy has grown in such popularity that she is often referred to as the fourth Killjoy by fans.
When I reached out to Tamsen for this interview, she suggested we do the interview on ‚ÄòNational I Love Lucy Day' and that's exactly what we did. We, of course, talk quite a bit about Killjoys and how Tamsen developed Lucy's character. We also talk about her winding path to becoming a writer and actor. The interview was so fun and breezy that I'm sure you'll feel like you're sitting right next to us while listening!

Trump and Pence will head to the flood-ravaged area of Baton Rouge, La., according to ABC News and CNN
Trump opened his speech at a rally in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday night by remarking on the "heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana," and offered his condolences.
"We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt ‚Äì and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together," he said.
President Obama on Wednesday received a briefing from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on the deadly floods that washed over Louisiana.
About 40,000 homes had seen damage from the flooding and more than 70,000 people had registered for FEMA assistance, according to the White House.
The White House announced that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson would visit the state on Thursday to review the scene after Obama on Sunday declared it a federal disaster.
Obama, who received his briefing by phone during his vacation to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., has received criticism for not visiting the site of the severe flooding and storms, which has left 13 people dead
A Louisiana newspaper on Thursday called for Obama to cut his vacation short, saying, "A disaster this big begs for the personal presence of the President at ground zero."
The study found that a large minority of the women - 31 percent of those questioned - did not know what was happening to them the first time they menstruated. That is less likely to happen now; the proportion of women who did not know about menstruation before its onset was 39 percent among those over age 35 compared with 19 percent among those younger than 35.
Sixty-four percent of the women said they were first told about menstruation by their mothers. People less than 22 years old are more likely to have learned about it from teachers than are their elders, and only 1 percent of the respondents said they had learned about it from a health professional. Men learned about it from friends (31 percent), school authorities (21 percent) and mothers (20 percent).
Only 9 percent of the sample maintained that menstruation ought not be taught in the schools while 25 percent believed it should not be dealt with in a coeducational classroom. Feelings About Onset

Asked how they had felt about their first period, 49 percent of the women recalled either good or neutral reactions such as ''pleased, grown-up, silly, or surprised.'' ''No problem'' was the most commonly cited reaction. But more than two out of five, or 43 percent, said they had felt ''frightened, confused, panicky or ill.''
To a degree that Peter Finn, project director for the study and director of operations for Research and Forecasts called ''surprising,'' men and women shared common attitudes. For example, 89 percent of the men and 85 percent of the women said they believed that women become more emotional during menstruation. Fifty-one percent of the men and 56 percent of the women agreed that women should abstain from intercourse during menstruation.
In some areas the differences between men and women were more marked. For example, 60 percent of the women said it was impossible to become pregnant at times they are menstruating, compared with 43 percent of men who believed that. Performance on the Job
Similarly, 81 percent of the women said they could function unimpeded at work during menstruation, compared with 66 percent of the men who believed that it was no detriment to job performance. But 56 percent of the women described menstruation as generally painful, compared with 39 percent of men who said thay thought it was painful. ''There is a contradiction in male attitudes,'' Mr. Finn said. ''They considered that menstruation interferes with the activity of women, but they also grant it only a low level of pain.''
The majority of both sexes said they believed that while menstruation affected women in physical and emotional ways, it did not diminish their ability to function normally.
But a sizable group disagreed: 35 percent said they thought menstruation affected a woman's ability to think, 87 percent said that women are particulary emotional during their periods, 49 percent said they had a different scent at that time, 30 percent said that women should cut back their physical activities, 27 percent said that women looked different while menstruating and 26 percent said they could not perform as well at their jobs, 22 percent said they could be harmed by swimming and 22 percent said that menstrual discomfort had its basis in psychological and not physical causes.
Washington (CNN) Republican senators returning to Washington Monday sounded exasperated and downright deflated about their unpopular bill to overhaul the health care system.
Some are even beginning to wonder out loud what was an unthinkable prospect a year ago: the GOP could be forced to ditch its efforts to get rid of Obamacare.
"Better than 1%. Not yet above 2% in my opinion," a senior Republican source told CNN on the chances the health care bill will pass Senate at this point.
Fresh off the recess, members seemed to be unclear on how Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could bridge the divide within the conference.
"I think we have the information we would need if we're willing to use it. If we're willing to be honest about what has caused the collapse of these markets and address it forthrightly, not being concerned about the political implications, but actually fix the problem," said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin who has been vocal about his frustration with the process. "I think we have the information to address it. I'm not sure we are going to address it, and that is enormously frustrating for me."
At Tuesday's Senate GOP policy lunch, the first real indications of the week on which direction leadership is moving may emerge -- and it'll be an opportunity for leaders to take the temperature of the conference on how they're feeling after the hiatus.
Maine Sen. Susan Collins insisted that barring a "complete overhaul" of the current bill, she simply couldn't support the legislation. She too called for bipartisan dialogue.
"I don't want to see us make the same mistake and pass an overhaul of the law without a single Democratic vote," the GOP moderate said on Monday. "We get far better legislation when both parties work in good faith to reach a solution."
Arizona Sen. John McCain was characteristically blunt: The Senate bill is on its last legs, he said, and Republicans should think about joining forces with Democrats.
"My view is it's probably going to be dead," McCain said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation." "If you shut out the adversary or the opposite party, you're going to end up the same way Obamacare did when they rammed it through with 60 votes. Only guess what? We don't have 60 votes."
One aide to a Republican senator closely involved in health care negotiations said Senate Republicans were simply not "any closer" than they were before recess, and that for now, it was hard to see the path to 50 "yes" votes.
"It's easy to get to 40 or 42 yes's," the aide said. "Getting to 50? I don't know."

What conservatives want
The crux of the issue is finding a way to get moderates and conservatives on the same page. Conservatives want to repeal more Obamacare regulations. Moderates want to ensure that protections for people with pre-existing conditions remain. They also want to preserve Medicaid expansion for as long as they can.
Conservatives like Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have been pushing to try and give insurers more flexibility in the plans they offer in the health care marketplace, but moderates have concerns the amendment could gut protections for those with pre-existing conditions. And many members acknowledged that the Cruz amendment may not be the magic fix to get to 50 votes.
JUST WATCHED Kids make journey to confront lawmakers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kids make journey to confront lawmakers 03:06
"I think it picks up conservative votes and loses other votes," said Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.
Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi said he could support the Cruz amendment, but that "It's not a showstopper or a game changer."
The sagging mood among Senate Republicans marks a new low point for McConnell, who had hoped to vote on the health care bill before members leave town against for the August recess. But the week-long Independence Day break only seemed to intensify his colleagues' concerns about the health care bill, with a 10th Republican -- Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran -- coming out against it.
With 52 Republicans in the Senate, McConnell faces the daunting task of convincing most of his colleagues who are currently opposed to the bill to change their minds.
And in a Monday morning tweet, President Donald Trump laid out a suggested deadline: A bill on his desk before August recess.
"I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!" the President wrote
Working with Democrats?!?
Perhaps in an acknowledgment of the tough road ahead, McConnell himself also raised the prospect of the undesirable outcome: if Republicans fail to pass a repeal and replace legislation, they may need to work with Democrats to make fixes to Obamacare.
"If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur," McConnell said in Kentucky last week. "No action is not an alternative."
If McConnell was reluctant to delay a vote until after the July 4 recess, he will be even more unwilling to let health care drag out beyond the end of July, when lawmakers take off the full month of August until after Labor Day. Prolonging the debate further would seriously jeopardize the GOP's other legislative priorities, and leadership has made clear that some decision will have to be made in the next few weeks.
Republican Sen. John Cornyn told reporters on Monday that leadership hopes to unveil a bill as early as this week and have votes next week. According to one Senate aide, leadership hopes to unveil a revised draft legislation by Thursday and receive an updated score from the Congressional Budget Office early next week.

"I'm for getting our work done now. I don't think stringing it out longer than next week helps us with the product," Cornyn said.
Asked whether the bill would be brought up on the Senate floor knowing that it would fail, Cornyn responded: "I never go into a fight expecting to lose so I would expect to win."
Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, joked with reporters bombarding him with questions about the future of health care.
Asked Senate leaders would bring the bill to the floor if they knew it would fail, Corker joked, "I'm feeling pretty good today. I did yoga this morning."
Today marks 56 days till the start of SXSW Interactive, and the festival website has been full of big news including the announcement for the sale of music wristbands beginning on January 16th, Neil deGrasse Tyson as the keynote speaker for SXSWi on March 8 and 741 more showcasing bands were added to the official list of festival artists.
Beyond the official news, the Coachella lineup hosting the OutKast reunion made the SXSW rumor mill go into overdrive. It's a fair rule that any band with a tour gap in Texas during the fest is most likely playing a show, even if they're not included as an official artist at this point. Outside of the official added acts, SX is known for last minute pop-up shows, corporate sponsored large acts and ‚Äòsecret' artist performances,which are often left up to speculation until the week of the fest or even day of the show. Last year, MySpace pulled this tactic with Justin Timberake ‚Äì even though the rumor was out that he would most likely be a surprise guest early on ‚Äì and Samsung managed to keep their Prince performance mum until 3 days before The Purple One took the stage at La Zona Rosa.
So far, Twitter SX-expert SXSWhoa has been incredibly on it with the detective work. This list of potential artists hit our inbox this morning and SXSWhoa gave us the go ahead to share these speculations with the world. Below are most likely, possible and completely out there rumors for SX 2014 performances.
Most Likely
These artists are likely because of how close their announced tour dates line up to SXSW.
1. 2Chainz (in Dallas on March 13th, Houston on March 14th)
2. Miley Cyrus (in San Antonio on March 15th, Houston on March 16th, AustinBloggy pointed out that Miley is on tour with Icona Pop and Sky Ferreira, so all three could be likely SXSW performances)
3. Wiz Khalifa (March 15th in South Padre ‚Äì side note: it is really nuts how many tweets that exist with people debating if they're going to South Padre or SX ‚Äì college kids.)
4. Broken Bells (tour ends in NOLA on March 12th)
5. St Vincent (New album out end of Feb, March 10th Houston, March 14th Dallas ‚Äì we're hoping for an ACL Live taping if possible for this one)
6. Childish Gambino (March 7th Dallas, March 8th Houston)
Probable
Probable because these acts have played SXSW in the past or are touring stateside during music week.
1. Avicii (in Sweden March 1st then nothing till a Mexico date March 16th)
2. Bassnectar (scheduled in South Padre March 14th)
3. Cut Copy (in Nashville to kick off US tour 3/19, has no TX dates listed on tour)
4. Zedd (nothing between a Vegas show 1/18 and BUKU on March 21st in NOLA)
5. Spark Master Tape (in the process of booking spring tour)
6. Kings Of Leon (convenient break between 3/8 in Chicago and 3/19 in Phoenix)
7. Elton John (March 13th in Dallas then March 15th in Alabama)
Possible
These are bands that currently have no commitments during music week and are either touring or playing a festival (Big Day Out, Lollapalooza, Coachella, BUKU, etc) that most likely doesn't have an exclusive. These are acts that parties are probably trying to court.
1. Baauer (Lollapalooza)
2. Blur (Bid Day Out)
3. Brand New (kicks off UK tour in April)
4. Capital Cities (Lollapalooza, Coachella)
5. DeadMau5 (has a break between 3/10 and 3/14 between his Australia and India tour)
6. Deftones (Big Day Out)
7. Dillon Francis (Big Day Out)
8. Eminem (concludes over seas tour 3/1)
9. Ghost BC (Big Day Out)
10. Gnarls Barkley (announced ‚Äúnew music in 2014‚Äù Cee-Lo is available and Danger Mouse will be in town with Broken Bells)
11. Lana Del Rey (Coachella)
12. Mac Miller (Big Day Out and then in Colorado 4/19)
13. Mayday Parade (overseas tour concludes March 8th and no TX dates till August)
14. New Order (Lollapalooza)
15. Pearl Jam (Big Day Out)
16. Skrillex (concludes 4 city tour March 1st and then has no commitments)
17. Snoop Dogg (Big Day Out)
18. Soundgarden (Lollapalooza)
19. The 1975 (Has a gap in their European tour 3/11-3/24)
20. The Crystal Method (nothing scheduled past January and usually make a SXSW appearance)
21. The Lumineers (Big Day Out)
22. Phoenix (Australian tour ends March 10th then nothing scheduled till June)
23. Tokyo Police Club (Nothing scheduled between January and May)
Not Impossible but Not Likely
These acts don't have dates scheduled in Texas near the time of the festival ‚Äì and in the case of Daft Punk ‚Äì are always on the rumor list.
1. Alabama Shakes (concluded a US tour with no TX dates in December and played SXSW 2 years ago.)
2. OutKast (odds are that Coachella has exclusive reunion rights for the reunion unfortunately)
3. Daft Punk (The only place you'll probably get to see their live show this year is at the Grammy's‚Ä¶ or on the lawn of the Texas Capitol)

Investors are dumping gold in favor of Bitcoin, according to analysts in a recent interview on CNBC. One of them, Phillip Streible of RJO Futures stated boldly that ‚ÄúBitcoin has stolen a large market share of gold.‚Äù
To explain how they are tracking this shift, Larry McDonald of The Bear Traps Report, stated that generally when bond rates go down, gold goes up. However, in recent weeks, the yields on bonds have decreased, and gold has simultaneously dropped by two percent - an event that is quite rare.
Analysts think the change is the result of increasing investments in Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies. According to McDonald:
"Over the last two years, every time rates have come down, and this week rates have moved lower, you had gold go up. Almost every time, there has been an 82 percent correlation between gold and bonds. This week, for the first time, that correlation broke down, and I do think it has something to do with Bitcoin.‚Äù
While the price of gold has been traditionally stable, the recent declines show the investment pool has begun moving into cryptocurrencies. In fact, according to McDonald, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies as a fraction of liquid tradeable gold is already up two or three percent from last year, stating ‚Äúcryptocurrencies are definitely eating into the gold play.‚Äù

In the midst of turmoil in the global financial system, there is one branch of finance that aims to operate within strict moral and ethical boundaries - Islamic finance. But how will it survive in the current climate? Some say Sharia-based finance will better weather the storm Opposite London's largest mosque, in the heart of the capital's Muslim community, is a branch of the Islamic Bank of Britain. It is one of eight branches around the UK that bring Islamic finance to the high street. It looks just like any other high street bank ¬ñ but manager Abul Fozoll tells me that it offers finance with a difference. ¬ìEvery single product we offer here is all Sharia compliant. From home purchase plans to direct savings, these are all governed by Sharia principles.¬î That means there's no mention of interest ¬ñ instead, savers are offered a projected share of profits. In practice, Muslims can still get a return on their investment, but without compromising their religious principles. High street Islamic finance is just one small part of a thriving industry. [Islamic finance] has a method to show to the world that things can be done in a different way which is more ethically sound and more financially sound too
Mufti Mohammed Zubair Butt, chairman of panel of sharia scholars In London's Canary Wharf, I attended a conference of financiers assessing the prospects for Islamic finance. Talk of the credit crunch was never far away, but some delegates believe the ethical principles that underpin Sharia-based finance mean it will better weather the current financial storm. Mufti Mohammed Zubair Butt is chairman of the UK's first panel of sharia scholars, who rule on whether particular products or services meet strict Islamic criteria. He is optimistic about the sector's future: ¬ìIt has an alternative to present. It has a method to show to the world that things can be done in a different way which is more ethically sound and more financially sound too¬î. One expert on Islamic finance, Durham University professor Rodney Wilson, points out that no Islamic financial institution has yet failed in the current crisis. He contrasts ¬ìexcessive risk-taking¬î in the mainstream financial sector with ¬ìa fairly classical banking model¬î still followed by Islamic institutions. Regulation But there are challenges facing Islamic finance. One key concern is the lack of regulatory framework within the sector, meaning that Sharia scholars are free to differ over what constitutes Sharia-compliance. It can lead to inconsistency when it comes to rulings about what sort of investments is appropriate. Andy Critchlow, middle east managing editor for Dow Jones, warned that Sharia boards consulted by financial institutions may not always be as independent as they appear. ¬ìCompanies appoint their own Sharia compliancy boards. Companies pay those Sharia compliancy boards to actually structure the Sharia compliant agreement for them,¬î he says. ¬ìThe industry in many respects is a house without foundation in that it doesn't have the foundation of regulation underpinning it.¬î Of course, the value of regulation is currently hotly contested throughout the financial industry, but proponents of Islamic finance believe that its in-built adherence to Islamic law means it offers a fairer, more ethical financial system. What no one can predict is the extent to which Islamic finance's principles will mean it is better shielded from the current financial storms. Some fear that it is already so entwined with mainstream finance that its future is as risky as any other part of the global financial industry.

The largest solar storm in five years is racing toward Earth, threatening to unleash a torrent of charged particles that could disrupt power grids, GPS and airplane flights.
The sun erupted Tuesday evening, and the effects should start smacking Earth between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. EST Thursday, according to forecasters at the federal government's Space Weather Prediction Center. They say the storm, which started with a massive solar flare, is growing as it speeds outward from the sun.
"It's hitting us right in the nose," said Joe Kunches, a scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
He called it the sun's version of "Super Tuesday."
Scientists say the sun has been relatively quiet for some time.
And this storm, while strong, may seem fiercer because Earth has been lulled by several years of weak solar activity.
An image released by NASA on March 5, 2012, is a view of a X1 solar flare in a new active region on the sun, region 1429. Another solar flare, which is heading to Earth, erupted on the evening of March 6. (NASA/Associated Press)
"This is a good-size event, but not the extreme type," said Bill Murtagh, program co-ordinator for the space weather centre.
The solar storm is likely to last through Friday morning, but the region that erupted can still send more blasts our way, Kunches said. He said another set of active sunspots is ready to aim at Earth right after this.
But for now, scientists are waiting to see what happens Thursday when the charged particles hit Earth at 6.4 million kilometres per hour.
NASA solar physicist Alex Young added, "It could give us a bit of a jolt." But he said this is far from a super solar storm.
The storm is coming after an earlier and weaker solar eruption happened Sunday, Kunches said. The latest blast of particles will probably arrive slightly later than forecasters first thought.
Auroras peak Thursday evening
That means for North America the "good" part of a solar storm ‚Äî the one that creates more noticeable auroras or Northern Lights ‚Äî will peak Thursday evening. Auroras could dip as far south as the Great Lakes states or lower, Kunches said, but a full moon will make them harder to see.
Auroras are "probably the treat we get when the sun erupts," Kunches said.
But there is potential for widespread problems. Solar storms have three ways they can disrupt technology on Earth: with magnetic, radio and radiation emissions. This is an unusual situation when all three types of solar storm disruptions are likely to be strong, Kunches said.
That means "a whole host of things" could follow, he said.
The magnetic part of the storm has the potential to trip electrical power grids. Kunches said utility companies around the world have been alerted. The timing and speed of the storm determines whether it knocks off power grids, he said.
In 1989, a strong solar storm knocked out the power grid in Quebec, causing six million people to lose power.
Solar storms can also make global positioning systems less accurate, which is mostly a problem for precision drilling and other technologies, Kunches said. There also could be GPS outages.
The storm also can cause communication problems and added radiation around the north and south poles, which will probably force airlines to reroute flights. Some already have done so, Kunches said.
Satellites could be affected, too. NASA spokesman Rob Navias said the space agency isn't taking any extra precautions to protect astronauts on the International Space Station from added radiation.
A happily-married couple who celebrated their 61st anniversary together have shared their secret to a long and joyful marriage.
A happily-married couple who celebrated their 61st anniversary together have shared their secret to a long and joyful marriage.
James and Eileen Finn met at the Galway Races around 66 years ago and this week celebrated their anniversary in Belmont House Nursing Home, where they have lived together since November 2015.

Before retirement, Jim worked in export sales and enjoyed playing golf and volunteered for St. Vincent De Paul. Eileen was a housewife and mother and volunteered for the Samaritans for 26 years.
"Patience and compromise are important," Eileen (94) said.
"Compromise has a lot to do with a happy marriage, I think."
James (92) continued; "When we first met, I didn't know immediately that she was the one for me, but after a while, yes, I did.

"We have travelled around together and lived in England for a long time too."
The duo, who have a combined age of 186 years and have three grown-up children, said they had hard times in the past, but that patience and understanding have always helped them through.
"Jim was away an awful lot with work, travelling around Europe and Africa," Eileen said.
"It wasn't always easy, when the children became teenagers and Jim wasn't around, it was a bit sticky, but we got over it."
The Corkman and Dublin woman added that they love their lives together in Belmont House Nursing Home and feel like they don't have any more worries.
"There's a sense of freedom about it and there are a lot of activities and facilities," James, originally from Youghal, said.
"As well as that, I think we're the longest-married couple living here at the moment," Eileen said.
The pair hope to visit their children soon.

Department of Human Services Eliminates SNAP Asset Test
April 21, 2015
Harrisburg, PA ‚Äì The Department of Human Services (DHS) today announced that as of April 27, 2015, it is eliminating the SNAP asset test. The elimination of the SNAP asset test will save millions in state funds and better protects Pennsylvania's most vulnerable.
The case closures disproportionately impacted households with a disabled individual or an older Pennsylvanian.
The anticipated state savings from eliminating the asset test are $3.5 million annually. This will also remove unnecessary administrative burdens and costs to the commonwealth, as well as increased errors that could potentially result in federal sanctions for the state.
DHS will implement this policy change by issuing a letter of notification from the administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Services (FNS).
SNAP, previously known as food stamps, is a federal program that provides monthly benefits to approximately 1.83 million low-income Pennsylvanians in need of nutrition assistance.
F.A.Q.
What is SNAP?
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is the new name for the food stamp program. SNAP is a federal program that provides monthly benefits to approximately 1.83 million low-income Pennsylvanians in need of nutrition assistance.
These benefits are used to buy food and help eligible low-income households in Pennsylvania obtain more nutritious diets by increasing their food purchasing power at grocery stores and supermarkets. If you are eligible, you will receive a Pennsylvania Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) ACCESS Card, which is used to make food purchases at participating grocery stores, supermarkets, farmers' markets, and other authorized food sources.
Who can apply for SNAP benefits?
The following persons may apply:
The head of the household; The spouse of the head of household; Any other responsible household member; or A designated authorized representative, who can be a friend, relative, neighbor, or anyone else the applicant trusts to go food shopping for the applicant's SNAP benefits.
How do I apply?
The fastest way to find out if you qualify for SNAP is to apply online at COMPASS.state.pa.us.
Download an application below for SNAP benefits and return it to your county assistance office. Paper applications are also available at your local county assistance office.
If you need help completing the application form or need more information about benefits, trained county assistance office staff can help you.
What are the minimum and maximum monthly benefit amounts?
Family Size Maximum 1 $194 2 $357 3 $511 4 $649 5 $771 6 $925 7 $1022 8 $1169 9 $1315 10 $1461 Each Additional +$146
**The minimum benefit for eligible households is $16 per month.
**SNAP households may receive deductions from their gross income for things like housing costs, child or dependent care payments, and medical expenses over $35 for elderly or disabled people.
More information about the eligibility requirements for SNAP can be found in the SNAP Handbook.
How do SNAP benefits work?
SNAP benefits are placed in an ‚Äúelectronic‚Äù account that only the recipient or someone authorized to buy food for the recipient's household can use. This system is called Electronic Benefits Transfer or EBT. The eligible household receives a plastic card, the Pennsylvania EBT ACCESS Card. This card allows for food purchases at grocery stores and supermarkets. The store simply uses the EBT ACCESS card to ‚Äúelectronically‚Äù subtract purchases from the SNAP account. The eligible household can only spend the amount that is in the account. This is not a credit card.
What should I do if I need food right away?
You may qualify for expedited SNAP benefits (within 5 calendar days). Apply on COMPASS.state.pa.us or contact your local CAO. You can also contact your regional food bank and ask for the nearest food distribution site. For information on food banks in your area, visit feedingamerica.org.
Have questions?
If you have questions about SNAP you may call the DHS Helpline toll-free at 1-800-692-7462 (1-800-451-5886 TDD number for individuals with hearing impairments) or your local county assistance office staff.

The director of campaign group Cage has been charged under the Terrorism Act.
Muhammad Rabbani faces a charge of failing to disclose his password after being detained at Heathrow Airport under counter-terrorism stop-and-search powers, the organisation has said.
Mr Rabbani was stopped at Heathrow in November, but refused to give officers access to his phone and laptop.
Cage describes itself as an independent advocacy group "working for those impacted by the War on Terror".
The Metropolitan Police confirmed that Mr Rabbani, 36, attended an east London police station on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Cage said Mr Rabbani was charged with wilfully obstructing or seeking to frustrate a search examination under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 over the incident at the airport in November.
That law gives officers special powers to question and detain for up to six hours any individual passing through a UK port, airport, international rail terminal or border area.
Cage, whose main role is to support those who have been affected by UK counter-terrorism legislation, said Mr Rabbani had been released on bail and would be challenging the charge.
[Update: Writing in Bloomberg News today, Eli Lake comes to a similar conclusion and adds a good deal of background in a fine piece of reporting. Flynn, he concludes, was just the appetizer: the knives are now out for President Trump. The fake news media is in a feeding frenzy, including this attack on Kellyanne Conway and this bill of indictment of the Trump Administration from the Washington Post. I don't have the facts and can't evaluate the White House decision to let Flynn go, but the practical result of the decision will be to escalate attacks on the White House, not reduce them. The Establishment is a wounded beast fighting for its life. This is a take-no-prisoners, no-quarter-asked-or-given war.]
How come no-one is accusing NSA Director Michael Flynn of taking bribes from Turkey's dictator Recep Erdoƒüan? Not long ago, they did. Last November 18, Commentary Magazine's Noah Rothman called Flynn a "dubious choice" for the National Security Council because his consulting company had a Turkish client, adding that Flynn's views on Turkey raised a ‚Äúconflict of interest.‚Äù Flynn had published an article in The Hill on Nov. 8 warning that America's dalliance with the messianic Turkish Islamist and alleged coup plotter Fethullah Gulen might undermine the country's relationship with NATO, at a time when Russia was giving Turkey the full-court press.
On Dec. 2, I wrote in Asia Times that Commentary's Rothman probably was stooging for a CIA disinformation campaign against Flynn. Not only did Flynn propose to deep-six Gulen, a longstanding friend of the CIA, but he had blown the whistle on CIA incompetence in Syria. Flynn's Defense Intelligence Agency produced a now-notorious 2012 report warning that chaos in Syria's civil war enabled the rise of a new Caliphate movement, namely ISIS. For full background, see Brad Hoff's July 2016 essay in Foreign Policy Journal: Flynn humiliated the bungling CIA and exposed the incompetence and deception of the Obama administration, and got fired for it. If anyone doubts the depth of CIA incompetence in Syria, I recommend an account that appeared this month in the London Financial Times.
In November, Flynn warned that the U.S. stood to lose its Turkish ally, to the benefit of Russia--and got attacked as a Turkish agent. That doesn't square with the current round of disinformation, which paints Flynn as pro-Russian. Flynn's detractors rely on a fake-news media which forgets the story it spun a couple of months ago when it contradicts the story it is spinning today.
I don't know why Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador about the incoming Trump administration's prospective policy on sanctions, or what transpired in the White House regarding mis-statements that Flynn may or may not have made about such discussions. Senior officials speak to their counterparts in other countries all the time, and for obvious reasons do not want these conversations to become public. The intelligence community, though, was taping Flynn's discussions, and the transcripts (of whose existence we are told but whose contents we have not seen) were used to embarrass him.
A real handful: Darshan Jogia, 11, of Auckland, holding an eight-scoop icecream, gets in training for Tip Top's $1-a-scoop day on Monday.
It is the question on some people's lips - does ice cream taste better licked or eaten with a spoon?
You do not need to be a sensory scientist to have an opinion, but one who is, Massey University's Kay McMath, has put her scientific weight on the side of the lickers.
McMath, who is also chief judge for the New Zealand Icecream Awards, said the flavour in food was released when warmed inside the mouth.
Licking an ice cream meant the tongue was coated with a thin layer so it was more quickly warmed and the flavour detected by the tastebuds.
Eating icecream with a spoon tended to keep the ice cream colder for longer and delivered the sweet blob to the roof of the mouth before swallowing. A smaller surface area was therefore involved in warming the ice cream to release the flavours, she said.
McMath said that because ice cream was eaten in smaller amounts when licked, the full melt and flavour was released with every lick.
The theory has surfaced as Tip Top prepares to launch its $1 Scoop Day on Monday, when 600 dairies across the country will offer cone ice creams at $1 per scoop.
The 14-year-old Springfield boy who has spinal muscular atrophy type I and had one request for the holiday season ‚Äî send him mail ‚Äî has attracted the attention of young and old alike all around the world.
Lucas' father, Bill, said his son has received more than 7,500 pieces of mail since this newspaper wrote a story about Lucas earlier this month and word spread on social media. The family reads him about 50 to 60 letters a day, and Bill expects Lucas to reach the 10,000-letter mark by Christmas Day on Wednesday.
Lucas has received mail from China, New Zealand, Germany, Australia, England, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Puerto Rico and Russia, as well as from all over the United States.
‚ÄúIt's amazing how people have taken it to heart,‚Äù Bill said. ‚ÄúEverybody has busy schedules this time of year, and it's touching that they take that kind of time for Lucas. He definitely feels the love.‚Äù
Lucas, who is unable to talk or move, enjoys receiving letters and cards in the mail because his life completely revolves around his visual skills. He is only able to communicate by making sounds or moving his eyes.
Lucas, part of triplet sons, was diagnosed with SMA type I when he was 10 months old. Doctors told his parents, Bill and Patty, he only had months to live.
His mailing address is: 3092 Wyandot Drive, Springfield, Ohio 45502. A Letters for Lucas Facebook group has grown to nearly 4,000 members.
I've already done one of these for Queen Elsa, so I figured Anna deserved one too. These dolls you see here are based on concept art I found on Princess Anna from the Disney movie. They're not really in order, I just put them together as best as I could. Some of these were actually 3-D models of Anna when the artists and graphics designers in the studio were still figuring out what she should look like. The doll in the upper-left corner was a very early concept painting, whereas the one in the lower right is the final Anna we know today.See, the character Anna in the original fairy-tale,, was very different than we know her now. She was originally called "Gerda," and was a peasant girl living in a village with her family. She was an only child, and was a life-long friend of Kai (who later was changed to Kristoff). Hallmark Channel even made their own movie of, and Gerda had a father who owned an inn. Quite often she was either portrayed as a redhead or a blond, seeing as the story originates in Scandinavia, though I did see experiments the animators did with all known hair colors for Anna. I guess changing her into a princess made Anna more appealing to little girls (they all want to be princesses, don't they?) A lot of the concept art I saw showed Anna dressed in Sami clothing, like what people in northern Scandinavia wear. That was due, probably for 2 reasons: one, their clothes are colorful and very warm; and two, in the original fairy-tale, Gerda traveled a long way north to save her boyfriend, and relied on help from various peoples along the way.Either way, I liked Anna's final look. The colors balance each other out and make her stand out from the snow.I made this collage using Azalea's Snow Queen scene-maker www.azaleasdolls.com/snowqueen‚Ä¶ and a Photoshop program.
Japan's military plans to take defense to the heavens in 2019. According to a report by Japan's Kyodo News Agency, Japan's Self-Defense Forces plan to add a space monitoring branch, to be jointly run by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Air Self-Defence Force. The "fourth battlefield"‚Äìspace‚Äìcontains a lot of stuff that's worth protecting, and Japan is hardly the first military to consider it.
Space is big business. A 2013 report from the Satellite Industry Association says that satellites made $189.5 billion in revenue in 2012. Besides the sheer value of the business, these satellites perform valuable functions for humans on earth. Since the launch of Telstar in 1962, satellites have relayed terrestrial communications, and today both cars and smartphones rely on GPS satellites to know exactly where they are. Japan's proposed space force would monitor Earth's orbitals with radar and telescopes, looking for harmful debris that threatens satellites. This isn't an inherently apolitical, altruistic task. In 2007, regional rival China blew up one of its own satellites, proving that it can in fact destroy satellites, and creating harmful debris for other geo-stationary machines. In May, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency signed an agreement with the United States where they promised to give information on space debris to U.S. Strategic Command. NASA, together with the Department of Defense, already have progams in place monitoring space debris.
The architecture of space has always had a military underpinning. American nuclear submarines, hiding out at sea, used geo-locating satellites to calculate target trajectories, so that they could reliably hit the same points on earth from anywhere. Even as American troopers started fighting in Afghanistan, the Department of Defense was floating ideas about "Space Control" to make sure that nothing in space threatened the important American satellites already there.
This new development out of Japan does not come unheralded. In 2008, the country passed a Basic Space Law, which changed previous laws regarding space in a key way: "Non-military use" became "non-aggressive use." This allows Japan the possibility of defensive military action in space, where before the country was limited by previous law and their constitution's intensely pacifistic Article 9. While on Earth, Japan has slowly grown its military, it's unlikely that a new space force means we'll see Japanese war satellites anytime soon. Japan, like the United States, is one of 89 countries that signed the Outer Space Treaty, which formally prohibits putting and testing weapons in space.
I'm a tech and a digital media artist with technical training in product, packaging design, and an array of computer hardware. I feel I'm extremely well qualified to give a fair and educated review of a USB hub. Lately my development has mostly been with 3DR Solo. My 3DR Solo relies on the GoPro Hero5 for video input as the primary source for streaming video to pilot the drone, and additionally my Solo has two additional GoPro mounted giving a need for 3 ports after a flight. On top of the GoPro I have three hard drive that I have a consistent need for to store the videos from my GoPro and my Phantom 4 Pro. I've only got two USB 3.0 on my MacBook Pro so a USB hub is essential for use of data transfer from my GoPro cameras, hard drives, and additional usb reliant devices.
The construction of the Hootoo hub has an extremely solid aluminum shell and it's well built! It looks like the aluminum bodied MacBook Pro was the inspiration for this hub. This hub is one of the few hubs in this price category that uses USB 3.0, which is twice as fast as USB 2.0 which many ugly hubs in this price category have. The USB 3.0, unlike the 2.0, allows the port to have a fast two way data/power transfer giving the ability for devices to charge. The port closest to the cable is the port you should charge in because it's the first to draw power and data transfer from the source and each port sequentially going from the first port out gets priority data transfer. The hub has the charging port marked which makes it more user friendly. This hub is cross compatible, meaning that it will work on both Mac and PC. Mac compatability is something that I have had problems with on USB hubs in the past. I want to also point out that it has USB port that is the closest to the cord that can be used for charging and probably a faster data transfer although I plan on testing that when I have a free moment. Generally, the port or outlet closest to the cable draws the most power and fastest data transfer. Each port/outlet going out from the cable gets sequentially less power and slower transfer speeds. So far I'm impressed with the transfer speeds so this hub. It has a 6 month warranty on it, and that is definitely a bonus. You can't beat this price either. It would most likely be triple the price at a store like Best Buy. There are other USB hubs on Amazon for the same price that are made out of cheap plastic. This hub is probably the best pick in it's class for your money if your looking for a well built 4 port USB hub. I'll edit I review in a month wind I've had more time using it to make my review more thorough. I hope that I helped potential buyers in making a decision on their purchase and maybe passed on some usefull pointers for readers. Let me know if you've got any questions which I'll be happy to answer.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Less noticed in a flurry of high-profile rulings on race, voting rights and gay marriage was how the U.S. Supreme Court rounded off its term by delivering a string of victories to businesses and employers.
People walk in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, March 24, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst
Just this week, the court handed wins to generic drug manufacturers facing design-defect lawsuits, employers battling harassment and retaliation claims and landowners struggling to obtain permits for construction projects. In all four cases, the court was split 5-4 with the conservatives in the majority.
Overall, during the term that started nine months ago, the Supreme Court has delivered a series of victories for corporate defendants on class action lawsuits and arbitration, curbing the ability of consumers to file mass claims against companies over such matters as defective products and unfair practices. Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and American Express Co (AXP.N) were among the big winners in those cases.
As progressive groups have been quick to point out, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the main group representing business interests, received a favorable outcome in 14 of the 18 cases in which it filed friend-of-the-court briefs.
The court's business rulings represent ‚Äútroubling trends that reach back a decade or more, with the court's conservative majority making it harder for consumers, workers and small businesses to go to federal court and hold large corporations accountable,‚Äù said Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive legal group.
Kate Comerford Todd, chief counsel for appellate litigation at the Chamber's litigation arm, brushed aside suggestions that the court - led since 2005 by Chief Justice John Roberts, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush - was overly friendly to business.
Citing a popular view within the business community, she said the court was merely reining in the plaintiffs' lawyers who can make millions of dollars in a single case representing multiple plaintiffs in suits against corporate defendants.
‚ÄúWe see a court that has in recent years beaten back the plaintiffs' bar's aggressive campaign to contort the rules and law to serve their purposes,‚Äù she said.
FINAL WEEK
As is normal for the court in its final week, it issued rulings in some of its most divided cases.
On Monday it issued two rulings that limited the ability of employees to make harassment or retaliation claims against employers under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The court ruled against an African-American Ball State University catering assistant who claimed she was harassed on the basis of race and a University of Texas doctor of Middle Eastern descent who claimed he lost his job in retaliation for complaining of bias.
The rulings prompted liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to call out the majority in a statement from the bench, saying they had ‚Äúcorralled‚Äù Title VII.
The Chamber of Commerce filed briefs in both cases in support of the employer. Todd said the rulings simply set clearer rules for employers and employees alike.
‚ÄúThe court's Title VII cases this week provide much needed clarity,‚Äù she added.
On the same day as the employment decisions, the court also issued its ruling on whether generic drugmakers could be sued under state law for design defects in medications that already have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote on behalf of the majority that although the case ‚Äúarises out of tragic circumstances,‚Äù the lawsuit was blocked as a result of the FDA's approval of the drug and the warnings that accompanied its sale. The ruling was a ‚Äústraightforward application‚Äù of federal law, he said.
SLEEPER CASE
Perhaps the least-noticed, most significant case - and thus branded by some as the term's biggest ‚Äúsleeper‚Äù - was Tuesday's ruling on land-use permit applications.
Ruling in favor of a Florida landowner, Coy Koontz, the court expanded the ability of property owners to challenge permit conditions imposed upon them by government land-use agencies.
Under Supreme Court precedent, government agencies have always had to provide a justification to impose conditions, but the court expanded the limitations on such requests by saying that legal review can be triggered even if officials deny a permit application and in instances in which the only condition is a money payment.
Alito again wrote for the majority, making note of the ‚Äúspecial vulnerability of land-use permit applicants to extortionate demands for money‚Äù from government agencies.
Close observers of land-use law say the decision could limit the ability of government entities to require developers to pay for the environmental impact of a project.
Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said the ruling requires regulators ‚Äúto justify the burdens they would impose,‚Äù which he believes encourages accountability.
The Chamber of Commerce filed briefs in the permit application case in support of the property owner and the generic drug case in favor of the drugmaker.
Scott Nelson, a lawyer with the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said he was wary of attributing too much to the chamber's winning record.
‚ÄúIt's not a situation where there's a majority that sits down and looks to see if the Chamber of Commerce files a brief and this is the way we should vote,‚Äù he said.
Video Games Help Measure Movement in Children with Muscular Dystrophy
Recognizing the need to have patients challenged and motivated to work day-to-day, Nationwide Children's Hospital has found the right tool to help measure movement with muscular dystrophy patients ‚Äì video games.
Patients with muscular dystrophy lose mobility over time, and patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a type that is most common in children, specifically young boys, become weaker over time, slowly unable to feed themselves and other tasks. So, researchers at Nationwide Children's have worked with a local game developer, Chris Volpe of Mulitvarious Games to develop a way to measure upper extremity movement in patients using interactive game technology.
As requested by the patients, the game allows them to dig and collect gems as well as squash spiders. It requires the boys to reach with their arms in various directions and push force fields, allowing researchers to measure their movement. Spending hours doing physical movement is hard on the patients, and the game is the perfect solution that allows them to just play and be kids.
There are more positive impacts of gaming on hospitalized kids. Chris Volpe, the game developer is also over the Game Developers Association of Ohio and leads the Ohio Game Developers Expo each year. The association donates a portion of ticket sales from this event to Extra Life, a CMN Hospitals fundraising program within the gaming community. Funds from this event stay local to benefit patient care at Nationwide Children's.

The last few months for the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) have been rough, as numerous failed offensives in both Syria and Iraq has left this militant group on the defensive against the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), the People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Peshmerga.
As of recently, ISIS has tried to muster up large offensives in the Homs, Aleppo, Hama, and Deir Ezzor Governorates; however, these offensives have all ended in failure, leaving the once powerful militant group in desperation, as their enemies take advantage of their crumbling infrastructure.
ISIS attempted to remedy these recent failures by launching a large-scale offensive at the southern part of the Al-Hasakah Governorate, where they hoped to recover much of the lost territory they conceded to the YPG and Syrian Armed Forces in the months of February and March.
On Monday, ISIS attacked a number of areas in southeast Al-Hasakah, breaking into the villages of Maqbrah, Rad Sharqa, Maylabiyah, Al-Karami, Al-Salaaliyah, and Saba'a Sikoun before they were confronted by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA), Al-Ba'ath Battalions, and National Defense Forces (NDF).
Despite their numerous attacks in Al-Hasaskah, ISIS was unable to take control of these villages they entered, as the Syrian Armed Forces' reinforcements and the YPG's assault on the southwestern part of the province have created many obstacles for the militant group.
The SAA cleared Maqbrah of all ISIS militants before they discovered at least 20 IEDs hidden in a number of vehicles inside the village; this required SAA sappers to dismantle the explosive devices.
Meanwhile, in the southwestern part of Al-Hasakah, the YPG and Suturo (Assyrian militia) targeted ISIS agglomerations at Tal Maghas, Tal Tamer, and Tal Khanzeer, where they were able to recover lost territory to this militant group.

Two countries, Iran and Saudi Arabia, have long borders with Iraq, seat of a growing battle against Islamic State militants. Despite the huge stakes for both border countries, only Saudi Arabia is now welcome as part of a U.S.-driven coalition of nations girding for a long fight.
The question of Iran's participation has become a distraction for the Obama administration as it seeks to build a diverse international support base for a military and diplomatic campaign against militants who have laid claim to territory in Iraq and Syria.
Secretary of State John F. Kerry says Iran should not attend a conference about the militant threat that will be held Monday in Paris, although invitations are up to France.
‚ÄúIt would not be appropriate given the many other issues . . . with respect to their engagement in Syria and elsewhere," Kerry said Friday. He cited Iran's military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and alleged Iranian support for terrorist groups elsewhere. The United States and some Arab states are backing rebels trying to unseat Assad.
But the United States is trying to exclude Iran from the group for a more simple reason: If Shiite power broker Iran were present, Sunni power broker Saudi Arabia would bolt. So would other Sunni states that provide crucial regional backing for what might otherwise smack of another unilateral U.S. military intervention in the Middle East.
Inviting Iran to participate in the military and diplomatic effort that President Obama launched last week might also antagonize congressional critics of the separate U.S. effort to strike a landmark nuclear deal with Iran this fall. Republican hawks and pro-Israel Democrats alike have accused the administration of being too generous in negotiations now running up on a November deadline.
Iran is indisputably a major player in whatever happens next in Iraq and Syria, and as the Islamic State has eclipsed both the rebel war in Syria and sectarian fragmentation in Iraq as the most instant threat, Iran finds itself on the same side as the United States and Sunni Arab states it considers adversaries.
Whether Iran is part of the formal coalition or not, that common cause makes many in the United States and Iran nervous. It may also offer a new sphere of cooperation for the two nations, estranged since 1979. Both Iran and the United States see the Islamic State as a looming threat best addressed swiftly, although it's not clear that Iran would go along with unilateral U.S. airstrikes in Syria.
On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Ministry said the international alliance against the Islamic State is ‚Äúshrouded in serious ambiguities.‚Äù
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was quoted by Iranian media Friday as saying it is ‚Äúnaive‚Äù to suppose that terrorism can be eradicated by airstrikes.
‚ÄúFighting terrorism needs organized planning, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and elimination of economic and cultural poverty,‚Äù Rouhani said.
It is conceivable that Iran could play the role of middleman, however, to allow coordination of airstrikes that strategically benefit Iran's ally Assad.
Washington insists it will not ask Assad's permission to go in and says any action inside Syria would be in pursuit of U.S. goals, not the Syrian government's. Still, last week Assad's government appeared to dangle the possibility of cooperation.
U.S. aircraft have carried out more than 150 strikes in Iraq since early August, at the invitation of the Iraqi government.
U.S. and Iranian diplomats are to meet next week during the annual gathering of the U.N. General Assembly, where the nuclear issue, not the militants, is the main focus.
For now, however, both nations are keeping their distance and Washington is straining to keep Iran out of the equation as much as possible.
Iran's role went unmentioned Wednesday in Obama's prime-time address , which laid out a strategy for defeating militants who beheaded two Americans in recent weeks. By contrast, the White House announced that Obama had called Saudi King Abdullah hours before the speech, and Kerry made stops in Iraq and Saudi Arabia last week to rally Sunni support.
About a dozen Muslim nations are involved so far, including Egypt, which Kerry visited Saturday. All see the Islamic State as an insurgent threat to their authoritarian governments, and most have, at best, a wary, distant relationship with Iran.
A senior State Department official traveling with Kerry told reporters that Iranian influence in Iraq and Syria is ‚Äúworrisome‚Äù to the Sunni states, and that both of those countries and the United States are keeping a close watch on Iran.
‚ÄúWe are very aware of what Iran is doing in Iraq, but let me stress that we've had no coordination with them on the ground whatsoever,‚Äù said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, asked whether Iran should be part of the coordinated response, appeared to leave the door open.
Fighting terrorism, he said, is ‚Äúthe collective responsibility of all members of the international community.‚Äù
Shoukry and several other Arab diplomats are to attend the session Monday in Paris. Although French diplomats had earlier indicated that Iran would be included, U.S. opposition has appeared to scuttle that plan. There has been no public invitation.
‚ÄúAlmost every country has an ability to play some kind of role in this fight against ISIL and to join this coalition, one way or another,‚Äù Kerry said on Saturday in Cairo, using an alternate acronym for the Islamic State. ‚ÄúWe are committed to working with nations in every corner of the globe.‚Äù
He did not mention Iran.
As part of their mid-season finales, the CW did what they called a Fan-Fest that was a viewing party with Tiffany Smith and members of each show's cast spoke to the group, giving away tidbits about what will happen when the season returns. They also released an exclusive clip to the CW App.
For those of you who don't have the app, here is basically what they showed for Supergirl.
This was probably the least spoiler filled of the four clips they posted. Kara Danvers (Melissa Benoist) seems to be having a bad day and heads to the alien bar for a drink‚Ä¶ except she orders club soda. The bartender turns out to be Mon-El (Chris Wood) who took the job since the bar was short staffed after the incident. She says at least he's found somewhere he feels he belongs while she has been feeling ‚Äúbetwixed and between‚Äù. But she has found a story about a missing girl and has decided to find the girl. Mon-El offers her the advice, ‚Äúif you go looking for trouble, trouble you will find‚Äù, which she doesn't find useful then drinks her drink only to discover that it's not club soda. As she runs for the bathroom, Mon-El admits he doesn't know what club soda is.
There isn't a lot to take from this scene. Kara could be feeling left out as her sister now has a relationship and she is alone. She could be missing being part of the team like she was on the other Earth. Or she could just be going through the growing pains of life. Mon-El having a job gives the show more reasons to use the bar set now that M'gann M'orzz (Sharon Leal) is in a cell. And it gives him a place to be other than the DEO and Kara's apartment. Though Mon-El working with alcohol seems like less than an ideal situation.

Humans are not entirely rational creatures. We all know this from daily experience, although we happily assume that we are more rational than other people (which is just one of our irrationalities). We are motivated by the need for meaning, and for esteem. We tend to pick sides, and then invest our egos in that side, defending it at all costs.
We are also motivated by the need for simplicity and control. The world is a very complex place, overwhelmingly so. Therefore we need to simplify it in our minds, so that we can deal with it. We use schematics, and categories, and rules of thumb to impose a manageable order on the chaos of reality. These devices are quite adaptive, as long as we realize that they are just that ‚Äì human devices to approximate reality in a way we can handle.
But too often we confuse our simplistic models of reality with reality. Further, we like our morality plays to be black and white. The villains are villains, without redeeming qualities. The good guys wear white and have no major flaws (nothing beyond an endearing quirk). The ambiguities and gray of the world make us feel uncomfortable. This tendency, by the way, leads to certain logical fallacies, such as poisoning the well. If Hitler believed something, and everything Hitler did was bad, then that belief must also be bad.
We can see this need for moral clarity and scientific simplicity at work in the anti-vaccine movement. Their core belief is that vaccines are not safe, that they are causing harm to our children. They are incorrect in this belief, but that is the bedrock of their movement.
They are not satisfied with this notion that vaccines are not safe, however. Every other belief about vaccines must also be in line with their core belief. They are particularly intolerant of complexity or moral ambiguity. Therefore they have convinced themselves that not only are vaccines not safe, they don't work. Further, the diseases they treat are not that bad. They believe those who promote vaccines are also selfish and evil, morally compromised liars (they happily portray us as baby-eaters). They cannot wrap their heads around the notion that perhaps well-informed people who mean well disagree with them.
The anti-vaccine echo-chamber exists in a cartoon world of cardboard villains, dark conspiracies, and white-hatted heroes (a role they reserve for themselves), where the science all lines up in their favor, without the slightest compromise or ambiguity.
Before someone tries to turn this back on the scientific community, I do not think the same applies to the defenders of science-based vaccines. We admit that vaccines have risks, and harm does rarely occur. But the benefits outweigh the risks. We acknowledge that pharmaceutical companies care mainly about their own profit (they are corporations, and that's what they do), and they need to be carefully regulated to protect the public interest. We acknowledge that, while vaccines work, they are not perfect. The flu vaccine in particular is very problematic, particularly matching the strains each year with the ones that are likely to hit in flu season. But still, we eke out more benefit than harm.
We also acknowledge that the anti-vaccine community is a diverse group. And while I suspect there are some charlatans and con artists thriving in their midst, most anti-vaccinationists appear to be sincere parents who are just trying to do their best for their children. They are simply misinformed, by a well-funded campaign of scientifically complicated misinformation. Many are caught up in the anti-vaccine echo-chamber, subject to group dynamics and all that implies.
Just take a look at the Age of Autism blog ‚Äì a sociologist could make a career out of studying the comments alone. A recent article at AoA is the perfect example of the need for simplicity. David Burd writes Death by Flu, The Big Lie Crumbles. The title itself reveals much ‚Äì flu is not that bad, and those who say it is are lying. Nice moral clarity.
Burd is shocked (shocked!) to discover that the number of flu deaths each year is estimated by the CDC. He writes:
‚ÄúCDC makes it abundantly clear these 3K to 49K ‚Äúflu-associated‚Äù deaths are not actually counted, but are instead estimates generated from computer models that hypothetically link such as pneumonia deaths to those theoretically having a prior case of influenza (with the influenza long gone).
and
Subtracting 105 from 311 we see a documented count of 206 adult flu-associated deaths. It will be interesting to see what CDC's computer-model finally conjures up as the final 2010-2011 ‚Äúflu-associated‚Äù death tally.
Interestingly, Burd glosses over an important fact that he relates ‚Äì the CDC does make it abundantly clear what methods they use. They have complete transparency. Using various methods they, and other researchers, estimate the number of flu-associated deaths in the US as between 3 thousand and 49 thousand each year. They estimate the number for a very good reason ‚Äì the surveillance mechanisms in place do not allow for a direct counting. Most people who come down with the flu do not undergo laboratory testing to confirm that they actually have the flu. The diagnosis is often made based upon clinical symptoms. We also know from case histories that some people will develop complications from the flu, like a secondary pneumonia, which will be the ultimate cause of death.
The goal of the CDC estimate is to figure out, as closely as possible, how many excess deaths are due to the flu ‚Äì how many people died who otherwise would not have if not for the flu.
Burd makes no substantive analysis of the methods used by the CDC and other researchers. Nor does he attempt to make an alternate estimate. He simply counts the laboratory-confirmed cases as if this is the ‚Äútrue‚Äù number. He makes no mention of the fact that most cases of flu are not examined with a laboratory test, and therefore this number is likely to be a gross underestimate ‚Äì by orders of magnitude.
He takes this pseudoscience further by comparing US and Canada laboratory-confirmed cases:
Summing up, while Americans are coerced, cajoled, or required in school and health institutions to undergo the dangers of flu shots, our Canadian neighbors overwhelmingly reject them, and the last five years Canada has averaged but a single (non-comorbidity) flu-associated pediatric death, while the U.S. toll rises ever higher.
He neglects to mention that the US has a higher population than Canada, and that differences in surveillance methods would also need to be taken into consideration. The comparison, in other words, is absurdly useless. While decrying the methods used by the CDC to estimate flu deaths, Burd abuses completely inaccurate numbers for his propaganda purposes.
But he has fed the echo-chamber another round of reassuring simplicity and moral clarity ‚Äì not only is the flu vaccine unsafe, the flu is not that bad a disease anyway, and those who are pushing the vaccine are liars.
Burd makes no attempt at due diligence or respectable scholarship. He does not try to understand the CDC methods. It's enough that he has hit upon a fable that suits the propaganda agenda of AoA.
Nor is AoA an isolated example ‚Äì it is more the rule than the exception (although it is an extreme example). We see the same thing at the DiscoTute with respect to evolution, or on any news outlet with a political skew (which essentially means all of them, although to varying degrees). This phenomenon is widespread (as you would expect for anything that derives from basic human nature), which is why it is important not to rely on any single source of information. It is helpful to look for the other side to the story, assume that there is probably more complexity to an issue than is at first apparent, and to be vigilant about the need for simplicity and clarity in our own thinking.
¬© Pool/Getty Images Troubling details continue to emerge surrounding the criminal cases involving former NFL star Darren Sharper.
Former NFL safety Darren Sharper is facing life in prison after he was indicted on rape charges last week. When you hear some of the details from court, you'll understand why.
Brandon Licciardi, a former St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's deputy who is being charged with rape and much more along with Sharper, began his hearing this week. Testimony from federal investigators on Thursday revealed some disturbing details about the alleged sexual assaults committed by Sharper, Licciardi, and New Orleans waiter Erik Nunez.
For starters, Licciardi allegedly told FBI Special Agent Robert Blythe that he went to a convention in Las Vegas that was attended by several NFL players, one of them being Sharper. While at the gathering, Licciardi said he was warned by an unnamed NFL player (he said he did not recall who it was) that drinks had been spiked with drugs.
‚ÄúI believe Mr. Licciardi called it ‚Äòhorny juice,'‚Äù Blythe said during his testimony, which was summarized by Andy Grimm of The Times-Picayune.
The players also allegedly referred to the drinks as ‚Äúthe potion,‚Äù which Sharper is said to have mentioned in a text message to Licciardi.
‚ÄúShe's on the potion,‚Äù Blythe said Sharper wrote. ‚ÄúShe's ready.‚Äù
Pre-trial services officer James Laney also described a report from the Orleans Parish District Attorney's investigation that indicated Licciardi drugged a woman at a New Orleans bar in November 2013. The alleged victim became sick and went to the bathroom to vomit. When she woke up, the bar was reportedly empty and she was locked inside.
Remember, most of the testimony focuses on Licciardi. Some of the behavior described is sickening, and we haven't even gotten into details of the accusations that are more specific to Sharper. Given some reports shared in the past, it's safe to assume it may get uglier from here.

Today we'll get a first look at Donald Trump's vision for the government.
‚ÄúThis is the America First budget,‚Äù White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters previewing the release. ‚ÄúWe wrote it using the president's own words. We have an America First candidate, we have an America First budget.‚Äù
What does that actually mean?
From soft power to hard power
The biggest-ticket item in his 2018 budget (pdf) is a 10% increase‚Äîabout $54 billion annually‚Äîin US defense funding. Along with increases in law-enforcement spending, it will be paid for by cuts to programs seen as inimical to Trump's worldview, ranging from environmental protection and Amtrak to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Meals on Wheels, but‚Äîespecially‚Äîby a 28% cut at the State Department. Mulvaney said this was not an attack on the department itself but rather on foreign aid.
‚ÄúThe president ran saying he would spend less money overseas and more money back home,‚Äù Mulvaney said. Yet he suggested that military aid to foreign countries, delivered by the Department of Defense, would not be cut.
‚ÄúThere's no question this is a hard-power budget,‚Äù Mulvaney said. ‚ÄúIt is not a soft-power budget‚Ä¶That was done intentionally. The president wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong-power administration. You've seen money move from soft-power programs such as foreign aid into more hard power.‚Äù
Trump's frequent campaign references to bombing ISIL and taking oil from Iraq suggest that this section of the budget indeed follows his own ideas. On top of the $54 billion increase, he will also ask Congress for $30 billion in contingency funding for military operations abroad.
Keeping promises
‚ÄúIf he said it on the campaign, it's in the budget,‚Äù Mulvaney said. This isn't true universally, as we'll see, but it is true of a few key areas.
One obvious promise kept is cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency's rules limiting pollution by large companies. The White House has put Scott Pruitt, a longtime critic of the agency, in charge of it, with a mandate to prune it back; it's budget will be fall by 31%. ‚ÄúYou can expect reductions at the EPA that don't line up with the president's view on things like climate change and alternative energies,‚Äù Mulvaney said.
Trump is also keeping his promises not to touch Medicare or Social Security. That's a key reason why, despite his campaign-trail complaints about how much the US borrows, his budgets will not reduce the deficit or the national debt this year or next.
The White House is also asking for $1.5 billion to spend this year on a border wall with Mexico. Though it's still not at all apparent how Trump will keep his promise to make Mexico pay for the wall, his administration evidently wants to get started on a project experts expect to cost between $21 billion and $30 billion,
What's missing
Still, there are some glaring absences in this budget. One is that there isn't even a placeholder for the $1 trillion in new infrastructure investment that Trump has promised to ask Congress for.
In fact, the budget plans major cuts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which funds some of those investments and would be intimately involved in Trump's vague promises to invest in ‚Äúinner cities.‚Äù Asked about this, Mulvaney said, without naming any, that ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of HUD's programs ‚Äúsimply don't work,‚Äù and that details of replacements will be forthcoming later in this year. (Where have we heard that before?)
‚ÄúYou will see reductions, for example, in other agencies on infrastructure programs,‚Äù Mulvaney said. ‚ÄúPeople might say, ‚Äòwell, goodness gracious, that doesn't line up [with] what the president said about a commitment to infrastructure. That was done intentionally‚Ä¶Why? We believe those programs to be less efficient than the infrastructure package that we are working on for later on this year. What we've effectively done is move money out of existing, inefficient programs and hold that money for what we expect to more efficient infrastructure programs later on.‚Äù
Yet in a budget that Mulvaney described as being perfectly offset between spending cuts and increases, it's not clear if these savings will be available later in the year. Potential infrastructure spending may wind up tied to a tax holiday for multinational companies that bring home overseas profits. Funds raised during the holiday would then be used to guarantee loans to private companies investing in US infrastructure. Such a plan has been attractive to lawmakers from both parties in the past, but also raises concerns of corruption, crony capitalism and wasted funds.
Without more details on this plan, there is little to say other than this America First budget doesn't invest much in America.
Dead on arrival?
Most presidential budgets are barely more than suggestions, but Trump's low popularity and the lack of detail about his drastic shifts in spending mean that this document is more likely than usual to change before lawmakers approve it.
To enact the budget, Republicans who control the Senate hope to win the agreement of a few Senate Democrats and avoid a filibuster. That would mean reducing some of the harsh cuts to domestic spending, some of which even Republican lawmakers have already said they oppose. It may also require excising controversial items, like funding for the Mexican border wall, which Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer says would prompt a full-on legislative battle.
But even leading conservatives like Texas senator John Cornyn aren't eager to buy Trump's wall without details. ‚ÄúI prefer to see a plan first before we start appropriating money,‚Äù Cornyn told Politico. ‚ÄúWe won't just appropriate money and have the plan TBD. And I've got some questions.‚Äù
(Mulvaney doesn't appear to have the answers: ‚ÄùWe haven't settled on construction types, we haven't settled on where we are going to start, I think the funding provides for a couple of different pilot cases‚Ä¶different kinds of barriers in different kinds of places to try and find the most cost-efficient, the safest, and also the most effective border protections.‚Äù)
Combined with the shambolic progress of the American Health Care Act, which has become a political hot potato since Congressional analysts outlined that millions of people would lose health insurance, it's hard to see the Trump White House forcing Congress to accept this spending plan without major alterations.
The creators of Kano, a kit to assemble your own mini-computer, asked for $100,000 on Kickstarter. One day short of the end of the company's campaign, they've raised $1.35 million from nearly 12,000 backers including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler. Alex Klein, one of the three creators of Kano, says people from 44 countries have chipped in (though the majority‚Äîsome 40%‚Äîare American).
Why do these people, all of whom presumably own readymade computers from which they clicked the ‚Äúback this project‚Äù button on Kickstarter, want to build their own machines? It has a lot to do with Kano's sleek look and its promise to teach them how computers actually work. To do that it uses something called the Raspberry Pi, a $35 British micro-computer that got a lot of attention earlier this year when it hit the twin milestones of shipping a million British-made units and 2 million overall.
Quartz The Raspberry Pi on its own.
The Raspberry Pi, like the Kano, promises a DIY experience to inexperienced amateurs. Yet it poses a challenge for the computer illiterate: On its own, the Pi does nothing. It is just a circuit board. Enthusiastic amateurs who buy a Pi discover that they then have to locate peripherals (like a power cord and a screen), download and install an operating system, learn how to interact with a command line and, when they finally have it set up, figure out what to do next. Despite being built to teach basic computing skills to young people, the Pi found its biggest success among the existing hacker community.
Make it simple, but not stupid
Kano, which already received funding from Index Ventures, where one of its founders works, hopes to help fulfill the promise of the Raspberry Pi while offering much more. ‚ÄúThe experience of Kano relies on Raspberry Pi but it is its own product,‚Äù says Klein. Kano comes with the basics‚Äîa Pi, a compatible keyboard and other peripherals, and most importantly, software to help newbies get started. (You still need your own screen.) One of the things Kano's creators talk up is the ability to create your own version of Pong, the pioneering arcade game that consisted of two rectangles of white pixels playing a circle of white pixels. A fun, basic challenge like making Pong is a good way to get started with learning programming, says Klein.
It is a sophisticated offering on many levels. The design is instantly appealing, some of the hardware, such as the keyboard, is made from scratch, and the software has been custom-made to be user-friendly. It may seem like a cop-out to some of the Pi's hardcore fans, but by making DIY computing easier to understand, Kano's creators are doing their backers a favor. At a time when laptops and phones come entirely sealed with no way to even remove the battery, consumer technology has become evermore closed off. An understanding of how it all works gives regular people a chance to regain some of the lost power.
Isn't the cybersecurity debate highly confusing at times? There is a lot of talk about the security of all sorts of cyber assets, discussion about cyberwarfare and cyberdefense, and in all these discussions the Internet seems to be central. Often mentioned in a not so positive context.
In recent conversations I've made the analogy between ‚ÄúCybersecurity‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Economy‚Äù. We all want to fix the economy but making progress is not an easy task. As soon as you are beyond that statement you notice that there is a lot of nuance. Issues like trust, influence, actors, and affectivity all come to play when you want to fix the Economy. The cybersecurity discourse has similar features.
It is important to dissect the cybersecurity debate into palatable pieces, recognize that all these pieces interact, and be careful about what we talk about. Cybersecurity is often about security in a networked world. For example, an attack on a company where lots of data is stolen is in essence a company security issue that is exacerbated because the company is on the Internet. Without dismissing the importance of that discussion, I would like to take a very specific perspective. Let's talk about the security of the Internet as a system.
How do we enable people to trust in the security of their communication and connections across the Internet while ensuring the Internet remains open and accessible? How do we keep confidence at such a level that businesses are happy to offer their products and services on-line, that journalists will feel confident that they can do their work in the more dangerous places on the planet, and that a kid from Bangladesh can invent a new application that can make the current favorite tools and services irrelevant?
Given that the Internet is a global network of networks without any centralized control, there is no magic answer. There are no single solutions that can be prescribed by governments or just implemented by network operators.
Central to this notion is that when you are on the network you are also part of the network. The reality is that comprehensive Internet security only comes through the efforts of many different people collaborating together to take action to help ensure the security, resilience and stability of the global Internet.
Today, we at the Internet Society are publishing a document that outlines ‚ÄúCollaborative Security‚Äù. This Collaborative Security approach is characterized by five key elements:
Fostering confidence and protecting opportunities: The objective of security is to foster confidence in the Internet and to ensure the continued success of the Internet as a driver for economic and social innovation. Collective Responsibility: Internet participants share a responsibility towards the system as a whole. Fundamental Properties and Values: Security solutions should be compatible with fundamental human rights and preserve the fundamental properties of the Internet ‚Äì the Internet Invariants. Evolution and Consensus: Effective security relies on agile evolutionary steps based on the expertise of a broad set of stakeholders. Think Globally, act Locally: It is through voluntary bottom-up self-organization that the most impactful solutions are likely to reach.
The Collaborative Security paper provides further details regarding each of these elements, but, here I want to quickly explore a few examples to show where this approach is already in action.
Open Internet Standards
The development of Internet standards within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a prime example of solutions that scale globally and are available for people to act locally. Deployment of these standards is also a collective responsibility ‚Äì creating the standards is only the first part of the equation, we must also make sure those standards can and will be implemented. Specifically since the deployment of open standards is voluntary, and not mandated.
Keeping Internet Routing Secure
An initiative launched last year, the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS), is a voluntary, bottom-up agreement between network operators to collaborate together to improve the security of the Internet's routing system. Already, some of the largest global networks have signed on as participants, and more networks are signing on every week. This is a key example of the kind of collaboration we need.
CERTs and CSIRTs
All across the world, computer emergency response teams (CERTs), also known as computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), established by governments, businesses, educational institutions, private enterprises and others, long ago realized that while they could fight some of the threats to Internet security, their strength would grow if they collaborated together to share security information. Through organizations such as the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), these teams are showing the elements of ‚Äúcollaborative security‚Äù in action on a daily basis.
Many more examples
I could continue listing examples: the hundreds of Network Operator Groups (NOGs) around the world; the DNS security community; academic conferences such as NDSS, bringing together security researchers. This idea of ‚Äúcollaborative security‚Äù is part of the ‚ÄúInternet way‚Äù that has been with us since the birth of the Internet decades ago.
Today, though, this amazing creation called the Internet is at the center of so many aspects of our lives. It has become a global engine of innovation, commerce and creativity. We use it every day to communicate and connect with people around the world.
For the Internet to continue to be this global engine of growth and to continue to allow communication and creativity to blossom, we need to work together collaboratively to improve the security of the Internet and ensure that users can have confidence that their communication and information across the Internet can be secure.
This week I will join several colleagues at the Global Conference on CyberSpace 2015 (GCCS2015) which is happening at The Hague and bringing together thousands of participants from governments, businesses and other organizations across the world. Here we will talk about the key themes of growth, freedom and security. During our engagements at GCCS2015 we will be using the principles of this Collaborative Security approach to frame how we think we, as a society, should be tackling these challenging issues to bring about a better and a stronger Internet.
We ask you to join us in that endeavor. The Collaborative Security approach is not just a discussion piece. It is a call for action, for Internet participants to take responsibility. Please look at your own networks and sphere of influence and ask how you can implement these principles.
Please join with us to make the Internet more collaboratively secure!

Climate change is an existential threat to Virginia. Without dramatic action, huge portions of our coastline will vanish under rising sea levels that threaten our agricultural, fishing, and tourism industries. This isn't theoretical ‚Äî Virginians are already feeling the economic and ecological impacts in the form of higher flood insurance premiums, eroding coastal property, and severe drought.
Our state's leaders must have the political courage to stand up to electric utilities and major developers. That's why I am the only candidate for Governor to oppose two proposed fracked gas pipelines, and I am the only candidate from either party who has refused to accept contributions from state-regulated utility monopolies like Dominion Power.
Yet, Donald Trump and Republicans in the General Assembly continue to lack the courage to face these threats, much less muster solutions. Instead of taking critical action in the face of climbing temperatures and erratic weather patterns, Trump has proposed cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and is actively trying to roll back current environmental protections. As governor, I will act as a firewall against the Trump Administration's disregard for the environment and use every measure at my disposal to continue the important work of protecting Virginia's natural resources and halting the devastating effects of climate change.
Preserving our environment and natural heritage has been a defining aspect of my career. As a Congressman representing a largely rural district, I backed public policies to help our working farmers sustain their livelihoods and continue to serve as good stewards of Virginia's land. I opposed uranium mining and spent months with leading experts to draft a blueprint for making southside and central Virginia a center of the new energy economy. I voted in favor of aggressive climate legislation and pushed for the Obama Administration's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that included the largest single clean energy investment in American history.
I'm also aware that any serious plan to invest sufficiently in a clean energy economy requires an honest discussion about race. When it comes to questions of environmental justice, our most underserved communities, people of color and low-income Virginians, are most likely to suffer. Every Virginian deserves a clean and healthy environment, regardless of race or socioeconomic status. Policies around transportation have deep structural connections to issues of race, as increasingly do issues of flooding and resiliency planning. As governor, I will stand up to the entrenched interests of the dirty energy economy and center my agenda around the need for environmental justice.
To celebrate Earth Day, here are 13 ways I'll prioritize environmental protection in Richmond:
1. Rejecting Campaign Contributions from State Regulated Monopolies
Virginia will only lead on clean air, clean water, and clean energy jobs if we also lead on clean governance. That's why I've refused donations from Dominion and Appalachian Power, and will fight to ensure that our Commonwealth protects our people and not powerful interests. For decades, efforts to foster renewable energy, energy efficiency, and decentralized energy production in Virginia have been blocked by corporate utilities who profit off the status quo and regulators stuck in the past. When I made this promise, I said the next generation of solutions should be determined not by the size of the campaign contributions but the quality of the ideas. Fortunately this message is already taking hold. Just this week, over 50 candidates running for the General Assembly also took pledges to reject contributions from Dominion and Appalachian Power.
2. Saying No To Fracked Gas Pipelines
If elected governor I will use all available powers to prevent the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipeline projects from proceeding. These pipelines pose immediate harm as well as serious risks to communities across Virginia. The construction process will require seizing private property through eminent domain for corporate gain, and the pipeline will leave 21 counties vulnerable to devastating leaks. Wasting billions on capital investments in pipelines will just lock us into the use of outdated fossil plant technology and limit our energy options for decades. In an era when climate change is a real and very present threat, it makes no sense to sign up for another generation of dirty fuel instead of looking for real solutions.
3. Standing Up to President Trump's Toxic, Pro-Pollution Agenda
My decision to enter this race was prompted by my belief that Virginia's next governor will be called on to actively resist the harmful impacts of President Trump's policies on our commonwealth. Trump's EPA has already begun rolling back important environmental protections. We must recognize the unprecedented threat posed to our health and natural resources by the Trump administration's regressive policies on climate change and environmental protection and commit at the state level to fighting these dangerous and misguided efforts. As governor, I am prepared to mount and sustain a bold campaign of resistance, using all of the legal and policy tools at my disposal, including holding Virginia's industries to a higher, cleaner standard. I will insist that climate considerations ‚Äî both mitigation and resilience ‚Äî be incorporated into all relevant offices of state government.
4. Creating Clean Energy Jobs and Savings
We live in a state where a publicly regulated utility that relies heavily on fossil fuels for energy generation is also the largest corporate contributor to state politicians. Not coincidentally, Virginia seriously lags behind our Southern neighbors in renewable energy production and jobs. Virginia has failed to develop a single megawatt of offshore wind, despite having the highest-potential offshore wind project in the country. We must remove the barriers our legislature has created for renewable energy at the behest of energy monopolies and press Dominion to make productive use of its offshore wind lease. As governor, I will call for reforming state laws that have deliberately held back development of solar and wind energy and push for reforms that embrace net metering, third-party power purchase agreements, and true community solar.
5. Protecting the Chesapeake Bay
The Chesapeake Bay Program is a national example of how states and the federal government can work together to clean up polluted natural resources, and yet that effort is now threatened with a 93% federal funding cut under President Trump's proposed budget. The Bay is an environmental treasure for the state and also an economic engine that supports thousands of jobs in fishing, tourism, and other industries. As governor, I will retain state funding for the cleanup program, preserve our involvement with other bay states in the program, and support farmers to reduce agricultural runoff that contributes to algal blooms.
6. Upgrading Critical Water Infrastructure
The all-too-recent lessons of Flint, Michigan, require us to rebuild and repair our aging water infrastructure and ensure that future generations of Virginians have access to clean water. The American Society of Civil Engineers has pointed out that Virginia will need $6.1 billion in critical water infrastructure spending in the next 20 years to maintain current levels of infrastructure and preserve drinking water quality. I will work with localities and the General Assembly to fund clean water infrastructure and expand statewide water quality testing for drinking water sources and Virginia's natural waterways.
7. Protecting Virginia's Lands and Natural Resources with Local Communities
As I travel to every corner of our state, I consistently hear citizens express frustration that developers and utility companies are attempting to ignore or override local preferences on land use. As governor, I will work with the General Assembly to ensure that the localities retain their ability to make decisions on development and land use. Further, I will support and, where possible, expand the use of the Land Preservation Tax Credit and Purchase of Development Rights programs to prevent our commonwealth's farmland and open spaces from being permanently lost to development. Whether the issue is pipeline construction, siting of high power lines or the creation of sustainable agricultural systems, citizens deserve the ability to determine what development happens in their own communities.
8. Creating an Environmental Justice Advocacy Council
I have worked on transitional justice processes around the world and intend as governor to explore ways to apply lessons from those efforts to racial healing and transformation within Virginia. Racism and economic inequality have led to those without privilege bearing the brunt of Virginia's past disregard for the environment. Whether discussing the location of coal-fired power plants or the layout of urban public transportation systems, we cannot talk about environmental stewardship in Virginia without addressing both the historic and future implications of environmental degradation on these communities. I will commit to the creation of an Environmental Justice Advocacy Council, with members drawn from the environmental justice community and subject-matter experts. This group will advise on and coordinate statewide policies aimed at beginning to correct historic environmental injustices and creating a future that protects our state's resources for all Virginians.
9. Reducing Carbon Emissions and Mandating a Renewable Portfolio Standard
In Congress, I voted in favor of cap-and-trade climate legislation that would reduce carbon pollution and increase support for locally produced wind and solar energy. I believe a similar effort at the state or regional level could allow us to reduce our contribution to climate change, help impacted communities adapt, and support new clean energy jobs in growth industries for affected workers like coal miners. As the Trump Administration rolls back environmental protections, I will explore executive actions to cap carbon emissions, including supporting a mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standard in Virginia.
10. Stopping Coal Ash From Entering Our Waters
I was pleased to see Governor McAuliffe's successful amendment to extend the moratorium on permits that would allow big polluters to cap coal ash ponds. This was an attempt to shirk responsibility for a major source of toxic pollution affecting Virginia's waterways, and I'm proud of the bipartisan effort to reject this approach. As governor, I will push to continue the moratorium on the dumping of coal ash into our lakes and rivers and require that polluters pay for the removal or recycling of this ash.
11. Addressing Rising Sea Levels
Climate change is real, and it's hurting Virginia right now. Hampton Roads already experiences routine flooding as a result of rising sea levels, a situation that will get worse and require significant investments in the coming years to build dikes and wetlands and repair and replace roads. The flooding may also eventually dislocate residents. Continued failure to address these problems will hurt Virginia's economy and leave our coastal communities vulnerable to the type of crisis Louisiana experienced in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I will collaborate with localities, business leaders, and environmentalists to plan and pay for sea level rise, adaptation, and resiliency infrastructure projects.
12. Investing in Sustainable Public Transportation
On transportation, my priority will be to support denser urban development through investment in public transit, including new transit authorities where local jurisdictions choose to form them. We have an obligation to the working parents of Northern Virginia to alleviate road congestion that keeps them on the highways and away from their families, but the solution is not constructing an outer beltway or more tunnels financed through tolls that wreak havoc on small communities and the working poor. I support reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions by providing a high-quality public transit system that entices commuters out of their cars and into our rail, bus and bike networks, combined with long-term smart growth policies.
13. Promoting Sustainable, Local Agriculture
In a bluntly-worded memo issued yesterday, the U.S. Department of Justice directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to begin phasing out all of its contracts with private prisons.
Private prisons, the memo stated, ‚Äúcompare poorly‚Äù to federally run prisons. They ‚Äúsimply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and . . . they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.‚Äù The memo then describes how the Bureau of Prisons will reduce and ultimately end its reliance on private prisons.
This announcement is a tremendous victory.
Phasing out the bureau's use of private prisons will measurably improve the lives of tens of thousands of people who would have otherwise remain locked in these abusive, unaccountable, profit-driven institutions. The reform, long overdue, is the result of years of patient, persistent advocacy by criminal justice advocates, including the publication of the ACLU's 2014 report, Warehoused and Forgotten: Immigrants Trapped in Our Shadow Private Prison System, a five-year project that comprehensively documented the shocking conditions in this shadow system of private prisons.
The Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General also deserves credit for its yeoman's service. Last week, it issued a long-awaited report concluding that these private prisons experienced nine times more lockdowns and more violence than comparable bureau-run prisons, improperly used solitary confinement cells as overflow housing, and failed to provide adequate medical and security staffing.
The news has already jolted prison profiteers: In the wake of the announcement, the stock prices of private prison giants Corrections Corporation of America and GEO Group dropped precipitously.
But the next blows to the private prison industry will hit them harder. The Bureau of Prisons just amended an open solicitation for 10,800 private prison beds ‚Äî something that had been expected to replace five soon-to-expire private prison contracts in Texas ‚Äî to reduce it to 3,600 beds. This will force a series of contract cancellations as early as May 2017. And in each contract renewal that comes after that, the bureau's marching orders are to ‚Äúeither decline to renew that contract or substantially reduce its scope‚Äù with the goal of ultimately ending all of the bureau's private prison contracts.
The Justice Department's action will also trigger aftershocks in its sister agency, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention system.
In the past year alone, ICE has faced fierce criticism for failing to oversee its private detention contractors, failing to react to deadly lapses in medical care, and failing to care for people with mental illness. Many of the most disturbing stories took place in ICE detention facilities run by the same private prison companies that will soon be losing their Bureau of Prisons contracts. Now that the Justice Department has firmly declared its own private prison experiment to be a failure, any attempt by ICE to defend its continued relationships with these companies will ring hollow.
And if DHS follows the Justice Department's lead, the impact will be even greater than yesterday's announcement. While Bureau of Prisons contracts account for a significant share of each company's revenue ‚Äî 15 percent for GEO and 9 percent for CCA ‚Äî and their loss will likely destabilize the companies, ICE detention accounts for an even larger share of their revenue. Eighteen percent of GEO's annual revenue comes from ICE detention, and a whopping 28 percent of CCA's revenue is from ICE detention, much of it from a billion-dollar contract to detain Central American mothers and children in a modern-day internment camp.
The combined effect of losing the Bureau of Prisons contracts and ICE contracts would deal a death blow to both companies. That's a fitting end to two predatory institutions that depend on and profit from America's addiction to incarceration. And it can't happen soon enough.

With the recent unionization of dancers at the Oregon Ballet Theatre, their shows at Keller Auditorium are now executed by an all-union workforce. Ballet dancers and two stage managers are members of the American Guild of Musical Artists, AFL-CIO. The backstage crew ‚Äî carpenters, electricians, flymen, spotlighters, props, wardrobe, and stage door ‚Äî are members of IATSE Locals 28 and B-20. Engineering and custodial are represented by Operating Engineers Local 701. The orchestra is comprised of members of Musicians Local 99. Bartenders and food service workers are with UNITE HERE Local 8. And security guards have a contract with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.
The Labor Press got a tour of Keller Auditorium Oct. 4 for the first technical rehearsal of the Oregon Ballet Theatre's world premiere of Rhapsody in Blue.
Shows were held Oct. 7-14, but the work actually began on Sunday, Sept. 29, with a ‚Äúload-in‚Äù by a crew of 43 members dispatched by IATSE Local 28. When the ballet series ended on Oct. 14, another crew of more than 40 IATSE members spent the night taking it all down.
Keller Auditorium is part of Portland'5 Centers for the Arts, which includes Winningstad Theatre, Newmark Theatre, Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, and Brunish Theatre.
Scientists have known for decades that birds can see UV light because their eyes have an extra type of cone cell specifically tuned to detect those wavelengths. But UV light‚Äîand corona discharge‚Äîis invisible to us. Each of the three types of cones in our eyes isn't all that sensitive to UV light. There's no evolutionary reason for them to be because our lenses filter most UV light before it even reaches our retinas. To get a sense for what the discharges might look like, we need special digital cameras.
These blazes of light are called corona discharge. They happen where the power lines aren't well-shielded, and the concentration of electrons rushing through the line causes the nearby air particles to ionize. This forms a brief cascade of glowing plasma that sporadically triggers a burst of ultraviolet light.
They see power lines as lines of bursting, popping lights. That's because they can see ultraviolet light that's outside the spectrum of human vision. According to recent studies from scientists in the United Kingdom and Norway, It suggests high-voltage lines have more potential to disrupt wildlife behavior than previously thought.
What does a power line look like? To humans, they don't look like much‚Äîjust strands of metal draping from towering poles. But for many animals, they're terrifying.
With UV vision, birds see a much different world than we do. Feather patches that to us seem an unremarkable shade of blue scream brightly in UV. Birds can hunt their prey by following urine trails, which reflect UV light. But with the exception of some rodents and marsupials with a fourth type of cone, we didn't see a way that mammals could access this extra dimension of color.
Or so we thought.
In a study published earlier this year in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , scientists analyzed the eyeballs of 38 different mammalian species. What they found suggests that most mammals can, in fact, see UV light‚Äîincluding dogs, cats, ferrets, and reindeer. Unlike humans, these mammals have lenses that allow UV light though. Even though they lack the specialized UV-sensitive type of cone, the other three kinds of cones can combine to make up for it. (In fact, when people have the lens in their eyeballs removed‚Äîeither through injury or surgery‚Äîthey're able to do the same trick, and report seeing UV light as something like a pale violet.)
Reindeers can see ultraviolet light.
This anatomical discovery could have major ecological impacts. Damian Carrington, writing for the Guardian:
‚ÄúIt was a big surprise but we now think the majority of animals can see UV light,‚Äù said Professor Glen Jeffery, a vision expert at University College London. ‚ÄúThere is no reason why this phenomenon is not occurring around the world.‚Äù
[Dr Nicolas Tyler, an ecologist at UIT The Arctic University of Norway and another member of the research team] said the discovery has global significance: ‚ÄúThe loss and fragmentation of habitat by infrastructure is the principle global threat to biodiversity ‚Äì it is absolutely major. Roads have always got particular attention but this will push power lines right up the list of offenders.‚Äù The avoidance of power lines can interfere with migration routes, breeding grounds and grazing for both animals and birds.
One example is reindeer, whose habitat has become severely fragmented by growing infrastructure in the Arctic, including power lines. Up to now, though, exactly why reindeer avoided power lines was a mystery. But in the dark arctic winters, such light reflecting off the snow can be blinding.
Reindeer aren't alone in their avoidance of power lines. We've long known that many animals avoid crossing high-voltage corridors, but blame was placed mostly on the change in habitat configuration‚Äîthe mowed vegetation below the lines is often substantially different from the surroundings. That hypothesis is likely valid for some animals, but this new data on corona discharge suggests the problem is more complex than we originally thought.

Dairy farmers from eastern Ontario took their tractors and cattle to Parliament Hill to protest possible dairy concessions in the soon-to-be-signed Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The farmers rolled down a busy Bank Street in downtown Ottawa on Tuesday, one day before trade ministers from 12 Pacific Rim member countries were set to meet in Atlanta to discuss the TPP.
They also brought cattle.

A West Virginia police officer reportedly was planning to resign after throwing a homeless man's backpack into the Elk River in August.
According to a criminal complaint obtained by the The Charleston Gazette, Charleston Patrolman Brian Lightner confronted 26-year-old Andrew Joel Hunt on the Spring Street bridge on Aug. 18 over an argument that several homeless people were having while standing in the road.
Hunt admitted that he had been drinking. And when he refused to leave, Lightner arrested him.
After getting out of jail, Hunt complained that Lightner had tossed his backpack off the bridge, including a laptop with the only photos he owned of his dead wife.
The Charleston Police Department eventually agreed to an undisclosed settlement with Hunt after the dive team recovered his belongings.
Brendan Doneghy, who was representing Hunt on the public intoxication and disorderly conduct charges, told The Charleston Gazette that he found it strange at the time that the police department would file a motion to drop the charges without an explanation.
‚ÄúI received a dismissal out of nowhere,‚Äù Doneghy recalled. ‚ÄúIt made me suspicious the allegations [against Lightner] were true.‚Äù
For his part, Lightner called dealing with homeless people a ‚Äúfrustrating job.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt takes a toll on you,‚Äù he said.
Charleston Police Chief Brent Webster confirmed had been suspended without pay since Sept. 9. But he would not comment on sources who said that Lightner had agreed to resign to avoid being charged with destruction of property.
The Atletico Madrid fan who threw a lighter at Cristiano Ronaldo during the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals at the Vicente Calderon faces a ban from sports venues lasting between six months to two years, plus a 50,000 euros fine.
The man has been identified by Atletico Madrid, although he managed to escape before police could arrest him in the stadium.
Sources from the Spanish Football Federation have confirmed to Spanish website ElConfidencial.com that Atletico will also be fined and given a stadium closure warning.
The referee pointed out in his report that ‚Äúas we approached the changing room, a lighter impacted Real Madrid's number 7 on the head; the player was able to continue playing in the second half.‚Äù The fact that Ronaldo didn't require medical assistance will be a extenuating circumstance in the sanction procedure against Atletico.
Thus, the closure of the stadium will be ruled out, something that wouldn't have happened if the lighter had hit the referee instead of a player.
Barcelona received the same punishment when a fan threw Luis Figo a pig's head and when Roberto Carlos was also hit by a lighter.
When asked about the incident, Iker Casillas said: ‚ÄúThere is always someone that tries to smear the image of a club like Atletico Madrid and it doesn't reflect how the majority of their fans are. I think the consequences could be serious because it could have hurt a player.‚Äù
Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos added: ‚ÄúThings like that taint and damage a game like football. That's why there are cameras, and if they detect it, the person should be prohibited from coming in during a good long time.‚Äù

A voice calls to me... it says "Search for Paradise"...
Advertisement:
The Earth sits on the edge of death; years of war between greedy Nobles have reduced the world to a handful of high-tech, Giger-esque cities amidst a barren wilderness. Only a single, small hope still remains: an old legend which says that in civilization's last days, wolves will follow the scent of lunar flowers to Paradise. It sounds promising, but no one has seen either a wolf or a lunar flower for centuries...or so they think.
The world's remaining wolves learned how to project illusions that make them look and sound human in order to protect themselves. Four such wolves ‚Äî Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe ‚Äî meet up in one of the decaying domed cities after noticing the scent of lunar flowers in the air. They soon discover the source of that scent: Cheza, a mysterious young girl genetically bred from a lunar flower by a group of Nobles who want to open a gateway to Paradise.

When a Noble by the name of Darcia kidnaps Cheza to use her healing powers to help his Ill Girl fiance√©, both the wolves and the feuding Nobles behind Cheza's creation chase after him. An obsessive wolf hunter named Quent complicates the feud, as he knows exactly how wolves protect themselves and works tirelessly to kill them at all costs (with the help of his loyal dog, Blue).
Wolf's Rain originally ran for twenty-six episodes, but budget cuts and the SARS outbreak resulted in four consecutive clips shows (episodes 15 to 18); the broadcast series ends with the wolves foiling a Noble's attempt to enter Paradise, but without a proper conclusion to the story. Four OVA episodes, released a few months later (and listed on DVDs as episodes 27 to 30), brought closure to the story ‚Äî but also received criticism for their dark and tragic events. The final episode also explains the show's title, as rain had only showed up in the opening titles until that episode. (Some TV networks outside Japan omit the OVAs from the show's broadcast.)

Tropes:
Formula E, the first all-electric racing series, begins this weekend with the inaugural Beijing ePrix running on a specially designed 2.14-mile street circuit around the city's "Bird's Nest" stadium from the 2008 Olympic Games.
The races are operated by the same body that runs F1 (the FIA), and they'll race on some of the tracks used by the famous racing series, but electricity will make for a different sport. High-level competition will highlight the advantages of electric vehicles, like terrific acceleration that can make passing possible on tracks with tight corners. The downsides of the technology will be on display as well, especially limited range, an issue the race organizers haven't figured out just yet. So before you sit down to watch the very first ePrix on Saturday, the first of ten races that make up the sport's premiere season, here's what you need to know.
The Cars
To save on costs, all ten teams are using a nearly identical car, at least for the first year. The awkwardly named Spark-Renault SRT_01E is built by a new French company, Spark Racing Technology. The carbon fiber and aluminum chassis is sourced from Dallara, the electric powertrain and electronics are from McLaren Electronics Systems, and Williams Advanced Engineering is building the 200-kilowatt battery pack.
The batteries and powertrain will generate 270 horsepower through a five-speed paddle shift gearbox, with fixed gear ratios for the first year, again to reduce costs. Michelin is providing 18-inch tires that will be used in both wet and dry conditions. Then there's the sound. At high speeds, a single SRT_01E produces an 80 decibel whine that sounds somewhat like an airplane‚Äîor a remote-controlled car‚Äîpicking up speed. We'll hear the full grid, with 20 cars taking off simultaneously, for the first time in Beijing.

Strategy
Since no one will have the advantage of a better or more reliable engine, race strategy will be especially important. Most of the competitions will be on street courses, not dedicated circuits, and the pavement won't be perfect. That makes tire wear and grip an issue. Management of battery life is key, since you don't want to run out of charge prematurely. Because the series is so new, and testing has been so limited, the best approach hasn't been determined yet. Drivers will learn a lot from the first few races and will apply that knowledge throughout this season as well as next year, when teams begin constructing their own cars.
Drivers should smile for the fans. In a gimmick called FanBoost, members of the public can vote for their favorite drivers via an American Idol-style social media system. The three drivers with the most votes get a 20 percent boost in horsepower for five seconds during the race, a big help when they need to get past an opponent.
The limited capacity of the cars' battery packs will require all drivers to come in for a ‚Äúpit stop‚Äù after 25 to 30 minutes. But instead of getting a fresh tank of fuel or new tires, they'll hop into a second, fully charged car. Ultimately, the goal is to have one car run the entire race, but that depends on advances in battery technology. For safety reasons, the series has decided against in-race battery swaps in the first season, and actually charging the battery would take 50 minutes, which would make for a not-so-exciting break in the action.
One hope is that the desire to win will push teams to develop better EV systems, which can then trickle down to consumer cars, just like technologies developed for other racing series have have made their way into more mundane vehicles "A lot of NASCAR technology is translated into performance enhancements in cars we drive," says Kenny Hazlett, a sports marketing and sponsorship expert with GMR. If the new sport "can make strides in improving battery life, storage, energy, charging times, lifespan, and take that knowledge to regular electric vehicles, it will be a good thing for everybody."
Who's In
It may be new, but the series has attracted some big names for teams, drivers, and sponsors. "I haven't seen a series coming out of the box with global brands from the beginning like Renault, Michelin, DHL and Qualcomm," says Hazlett. Richard Branson's Virgin Racing team has former Formula One driver Jaime Alguersuari. Mahindra, backed by a giant Indian conglomerate, has Bruno Senna, the nephew of three-time F1 champ Ayrton Senna, as a confirmed driver. Amlin Aguri has popular Japanese former Formula One driver Takuma Sato, as well as Katherine Legge, one of two female racers in the field (Michela Cerruti is the other, racing for Trulli).
Leonardo DiCaprio is a co-founder and backer of the Venturi team, which has announced plans to become a vehicle constructor for the second season. "The future of our planet depends on our ability to embrace fuel-efficient, clean-energy vehicles," DiCaprio says, explaining why he's involved in the team. Famed Formula One Alain Prost driver is co-founder of the e.dams-Renault team, with his son Nicolas as one of the drivers. Hazlett believes that traditional car manufacturers like BMW or Mercedes could eventually make it into the sport too. "The tech that their competitors are going to glean from being involved in the sport," will drive that. The sport already has significant television broadcast agreements worldwide, including with the new Fox Sports 1 network in the United States.
This weekend's Beijing ePrix will air in the U.S. at 3:30AM Eastern Saturday morning on Fox Sports 1, with a replay on Sunday at 1PM Eastern.
Alabama offensive lineman Joshua Casher is likely out for the remainder of the season after sustaining an injury Saturday in Atlanta.
The redshirt sophomore offensive lineman sustained a broken foot late in the Crimson Tide's 54-16 win over Florida in the SEC title game, BamaOnLine has confirmed. The injury was first reported by The Tuscaloosa News.
Casher participated in five games this year, including splitting snaps at first-team right guard with Korren Kirven toward the end of the season. His likely season-ending injury is a blow to Alabama's depth along its O-line.
A former four-star recruit, Casher was the No. 2 center and No. 10 player in the state of Alabama during the 2014 recruiting cycle, according to the 247Sports Composite.
No. 1 Alabama will face No. 4 Washington in the Peach Bowl semifinal on Dec. 31.

Rainbow flags flew from many Davidson Colleges dorm room windows last week in a show of support for an undergrad who was told he could not fly a gay pride flag from his window. While school officials claim there is a safety policy prohibiting the hanging of flags from dorm windows, the student insists that his flag was singled out.
The controversy began several months ago, when Davidson sophomore Max Feinstein was told his dorm room's rainbow flag was a safety hazard. After a back-and-forth with school officials proved fruitless, Feinstein took his story public, penning a column for campus newspaper The Davidsonian on Dec. 6.
He wrote that he took down his flag but later put it back up and, as a result, was called to meet with Director of Residence Life Dean Jason Shaffer, who revealed that the school's unwritten anti-flag policy wasn't motivated solely by safety concerns.
"The Director of Residence Life explained a bystander may mistake a flag outside a window representative of the values of all the inhabitants of the dorm, and not just the individual who hangs the flag [all sic]," Feinstein wrote in his column. "However, the less visible option of hanging a flag inside a window was acceptable, as this would not confuse a bystander."
In an email to The Huffington Post, Feinstein noted that his column received much attention from the North Carolina school's 1,790-odd undergraduates. Indeed, multiple students protested Shaffer's rule by flying pride flags of their own after Feinstein's column ran.
(Story continues below.)

"People ... began putting out flags, many rainbow flags," Feinstein told HuffPost. "I was so excited to see this, felt so welcomed. ... [P]eople just understood the frustration of the LGBTQ community. It was especially surprising to see people that I assumed didn't care start hanging flags!"
While he said he has never been harassed on campus, Feinstein told HuffPost that he feels Davidson has a "strong heteronormative culture" and is lacking in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) visibility.
While the response from students has been largely positive, Feinstein noted that someone had flown a Confederate flag from the window of a dormitory otherwise covered in rainbow banners. Feinstein said he was worried school officials would use this incident as proof that flag-flying can lead to conflict.
"However, I see this as the administration passively allowing homophobic and racist students to anonymously bully minorities on campus," Feinstein said. "The individual who anonymously hung the Confederate flag obviously wants all the LGBT flags on campus down, as it was hung deliberately on the side of a building with about 10 LGBT flags. If the school sides to remove all flags on campus, then the person who hung the Confederate flag gets exactly what he/she wanted, while the LGBTQ community is relegated again to the shadows of campus culture."
On Dec. 13, Feinstein met with Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students Thomas Shandley, who reiterated his support for Shaffer's policy. Though Shaffer did not respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post, Shandley did provide a written statement.
Many people have expressed outrage at NSPD-51 -- a presidential directive that gives Bush dictatorial powers in the event of a national emergency.
For example, well-known conservative writer Jerome Corsi writes:
President Bush, without so much as issuing a press statement, on May 9 signed a directive that granted near dictatorial powers to the office of the president in the event of a national emergency declared by the president.
The "National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive," with the dual designation of NSPD-51, as a National Security Presidential Directive, and HSPD-20, as a Homeland Security Presidential Directive, establishes under the office of president a new National Continuity Coordinator.
That job, as the document describes, is to make plans for "National Essential Functions" of all federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations to continue functioning under the president's directives in the event of a national emergency.

The directive loosely defines "catastrophic emergency" as "any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions."
When the president determines a catastrophic emergency has occurred, the president can take over all government functions and direct all private sector activities to ensure we will emerge from the emergency with an "enduring constitutional government."
Translated into layman's terms, when the president determines a national emergency has occurred, the president can declare to the office of the presidency powers usually assumed by dictators to direct any and all government and business activities until the emergency is declared over.
- Advertisement -
Ironically, the directive sees no contradiction in the assumption of dictatorial powers by the president with the goal of maintaining constitutional continuity through an emergency.
The directive specifies that the assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism will be designated as the National Continuity Coordinator.
Further established is a Continuity Policy Coordination Committee, chaired by a senior director from the Homeland Security Council staff, designated by the National Continuity Coordinator, to be "the main day-to-day forum for such policy coordination."

A Congressional Research Service study notes that under the National Emergency Act, the president "may seize property, organize and control the means of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, institute martial law, seize and control all transportation and communication, regulate the operation of private enterprise, restrict travel, and, in a variety of ways, control the lives of United States citizens."

NSPD-51/ HSPD-20 appears to supersede the National Emergency Act by creating the new position of National Continuity Coordinator [within the White House] without any specific act of Congress authorizing the position.
AURORA | Aurora Congressman Mike Coffman signed on with other lawmakers in an attempt to force a legislative fix to the imperiled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, also known as DACA, before the year ends.
In a letter, along with several other lawmakers from both parties, Coffman asks House Speaker Paul Ryan to expedite a DACA remedy to prevent it from expiring. The program is used by a plethora of Aurora residents.
Earlier this year President Donald Trump rescinded the policy that offers some protections to young immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children. So far, there has been plenty of agreement from both parties that Congress needs to act and even more debate on what that action might look like.
The letter said the bunch agreed with Trump that ‚Äúexecutive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue.‚Äù But the clock is ticking as the order is set to expire in March. Lawmakers said they would like to see legislation passed by the end of the year.
‚ÄúReaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do,‚Äù the letter said.
Coffman told the Aurora Sentinel his BRIDGE Act, which would extend DACA for three years, is still an option. It's been put on the backburner so that Congress can focus on a full DREAM Act. But if a legislative fix doesn't gain movement closer to the March deadline, the congressman said he might be forced to act and push the BRIDGE Act to a vote.
Though, that might not be necessary. The congressman said the working group he's in seems to be moving toward legislation.
‚ÄúNegotiations have not been easy, but we are making progress,‚Äù Coffman said, adding that border security has been the crux of the conversation.
Democrats have made their case for a clean Dream Act, but Republicans along with the president have pushed back, wanting provisions for border security.
California's 2017 wine harvest is under way, and it feels, in a sense, remarkably normal.
Compared with the last two vintages ‚Äî freakishly early, hot and small ‚Äî this year has seen many early-ripening varieties like Pinot Noir begin harvest at the end of August, with later ripeners like Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah expected to remain on the vine until mid-to-late September. Yields look about average.
If the grapes themselves signal a return to relative normalcy, however, the human flurry surrounding them is anything but. Vineyard labor, an increasingly endangered resource, has reached a shortage this year that, according to vineyard owners, could be approaching a crisis.
That pinch looks especially dire in Sonoma County.
Historically, Jake Bilbro, owner of Limerick Lane Vineyard in Healdsburg, could give a vineyard management company a couple of days' notice when he needed a picking crew to show up. But with the management companies increasingly short-staffed, Bilbro said that the timing has been stretching out further and further. ‚ÄúLast year in the heat, we were making calls pushing a week out. This year, we're making calls two weeks out.
‚ÄúWe're prepaying (the vineyard management company) in order to keep the crew there through the end of the pick,‚Äù Bilbro continued. ‚ÄúI've never heard of that in my life.‚Äù
Whereas five years ago, some Sonoma County growers charged wineries around $125 to $150 per ton for labor, those figures have now nearly doubled, to $275 to $300. In Napa, it can reach $400. That's because vineyard workers' wages have risen considerably as they've become harder to find.
It also means fewer people are doing more work. ‚ÄúThe pickers are gearing up for three shifts, 18 hours a day,‚Äù Bilbro said.
Other California wine regions don't seem to be feeling the pinch so acutely. In Monterey County, where the wine industry shares workers with other crops, grape grower Steve McIntyre said he's seeing a surplus of labor this time of year.
‚ÄúActivities in many annual crops starts to taper off, and operations move south,‚Äù McIntyre said. And 95 percent of his grapes are machine-harvested, which further reduces labor needs, unlike in Sonoma or Napa, where higher-end wineries demand hand harvesting.
Certainly, those higher-end wineries can afford to pay workers more ‚Äî and they are. Workers for Napa's Silverado Farming Co., for instance, which farms for wineries like Dana Estates and Lail Vineyards, are now earning as much as $45 an hour during the peak of harvest.
But when you're charging $475 for a bottle of wine, as Dana does, you're in the 1 percent. For most of the state's vintners, the labor situation has become untenable. ‚ÄúAlmost 80 percent of wine grapes in California are harvested by machine,‚Äù said Peter Nissen, owner of Napa's Nissen Vineyard Services Inc. and the president of the California Farm Labor Contractor Association. ‚ÄúAs labor tightens, you're just going to see more and more machines.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe are in completely uncharted territory,‚Äù said Limerick's Bilbro.
It's uncharted territory, too, for our era's ever-erratic weather patterns. While 2017 marked the official end of California's five-year drought, the wetter winter didn't quite have the effect that many had hoped.
‚ÄúWe had so much rain this past winter that we didn't think the irrigation demand was going to be so great,‚Äù said Jed Steele, a winemaker in Lake County. ‚ÄúBut the summer was too hot. The heat was excessive to the point where it actually slowed ripening.‚Äù
And while you might think a rainy winter would bode well for yields, the crop size is merely average. Still, that's a big relief compared with the last two years: In 2015, a freakishly short crop year, some coastal Pinot Noir vineyards were down by about 50 percent.
It's not just winter rain that affects crop size; it's also rain in the springtime, when the plants flower. ‚ÄúSpring is a really important time for root flush growth,‚Äù said Cam Mauritson of Mauritson Wines in Dry Creek Valley. ‚ÄúWhen you have not as much spring rain, you're getting a smaller root system. Over time, that has an effect.
‚ÄúThe drought is still taking its toll,‚Äù Mauritson said.
June hailstorms this year wrecked the crop loads at some vineyards in Contra Costa County and on Napa's Atlas Peak. Evangelho Vineyard in Antioch was down 80 percent in some blocks; Atlas Peak's Mead Ranch was about 70 percent diminished, according to Turley winemaker Tegan Passalacqua.
Though vintners are harvesting about 10 days to two weeks later than last year, it's still not exactly a late harvest.
‚ÄúThis would have been considered, a decade ago, on the earlyish side,‚Äù said Adam Lee, owner of Clarice Wine Co. ‚ÄúBut the fact that I'm looking at my calendar and can see the month of September makes it seem like we're in a more normal range.‚Äù
Last week's heat hastened ripening considerably, and with temperatures expected to exceed 100 degrees in some regions this week, it could be a mad rush to get the fruit off the vine.
Where there are heat spikes, there's a risk of dehydration. ‚ÄúYou don't want to overwater the plants this close to harvest,‚Äù said Fred Delivert, winemaker for Tolosa Winery in San Luis Obispo. ‚ÄúBut we had to irrigate ... to avoid dehydration.‚Äù
Heat in its most extreme form ‚Äî fire ‚Äî threatened vineyards in Santa Barbara, Mendocino and Lake counties this year. In July, the Alamo Fire burned dangerously close to Santa Maria's 650-acre Bien Nacido Vineyard.
‚ÄúThe fire came within a few feet of our vines,‚Äù said Michael Brughelli, Bien Nacido's director of sales. Luckily, it didn't come in contact with any plants, and the smoke didn't linger: ‚ÄúThe fuels were fairly light, and the smoke was blowing up and away, not settling. There was really no ash fall.‚Äù
Meanwhile, farther north, Masut Wines owner Jake Fetzer watched as 1,000 acres burned in July next to his vineyard in Mendocino's Eagle Peak AVA. ‚ÄúWe were cutting trails around the vineyard so that the fire wouldn't burn us up,‚Äù he said.
Fetzer knows well what fire can do to grapevines: In 2008, extreme fires led to high levels of smoke taint in his vineyards ‚Äî and there was no hiding it. ‚ÄúYou could smell the grapes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey were almost like a smoked ham when you delivered them.‚Äù
None of this year's fires presented any such danger. ‚ÄúWe've been testing for smoke taint pretty extensively since the fire,‚Äù said Brughelli. ‚ÄúWe haven't found any trace amounts.‚Äù
Though it's too soon to say, the 2017 vintage's quality looks promising. Acids are a little bit lower, in general, but color is more stable than in the last few years.
‚ÄúThe flavors are fascinating,‚Äù said Dominic O'Reilly, winemaker at Topa Mountain Winery in Ojai. ‚ÄúThe vines have just gotten a lot more nutrients with the rain down into the roots, and more foliage on the vines has translated to more character in the grapes as well.‚Äù
Hotter summers, earlier harvests, fewer workers: Even when we call it ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù California's wine harvests seem to be moving toward extremes.
Jake Bilbro is grateful, at least, that the extreme conditions have brought all hands on deck. Last week, when he was in a pinch, friends like Cam Mauritson and vineyard manager John Grace lent him trucks, forklifts and tractors. ‚ÄúIf it weren't for them,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe wouldn't make it when unforeseen issues such as labor shortages and 110-degree weather come at you.‚Äù

It's so easy to get on the bandwagon: lower my taxes, smaller and more efficient government, don't touch my liberties, throw the bums out, etc. But what if that bandwagon has to cross a bridge? And what if that bridge hasn't been maintained in years?
The Tea Party has captured the imagination and spirit of many Americans and may very well turn that into a powerful voting bloc come November. But, that bloc may not have a leg or girder to stand on as our nation's infrastructure continues to crumble. I am very concerned, from what I have read so far, and what has been ignored to date, that the Tea Party movement will throw our public works overboard with the tea.
The Tea Party stands for smaller government. I'm not going to argue with that. There are things that the government can't repair all by itself. We can argue about laissez faire vs. public intervention when it comes to poverty or jobs. But, there isn't much arguing that not painting a bridge leads to corrosion. Or that 100-year-old water mains need attention to protect them from leaks or worse ‚Äì collapses. Infrastructure is not going to repair itself without government leadership and intervention (which to date has gotten only a D from the American Society of Civil Engineers). And the responsibility is on all politicians regardless of party affiliation. A broken bridge isn't going to distinguish between a Democrat, Republican or Tea Party candidate driving by when it crumbles. As Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett, a Republican, was quoted recently in the New York Times: ‚ÄúThe infrastructure needs are real. We can argue about how to pay for it.‚Äù
A fiscal conservative must look at the short and long-term costs. Study after study, including Fragile Foundations commissioned by President Ronald Reagan's National Council on Public Works Improvement, found that deferring maintenance led to much higher costs down the road (if there were a road left). It's like your car: if you don't get the oil changed regularly, the bearings will eventually seize and the engine will fail, forcing you to buy a new car ‚Äì a much pricier option that could have been avoided. Similarly, allowing a bridge to corrode to a danger point and then building a new bridge is the far more expensive route. I'm worried that discussions about transportation issues are essentially absent from the Tea Party rhetoric. There is a startling lack of specific solutions. As New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman recently wrote, the Tea Party movement is ‚Äú‚Ä¶all steam and no engine. It has no plan to restore America to greatness.‚Äù Tea Party candidates like to speak in one-liners, outdoing opponents with promises reminiscent of ‚Äúno new taxes‚Äù on their lips. That could be dangerous if they win and voters hold their feet to the fire.
Public works industries and all concerned citizens need to start engaging Tea Party candidates like Rand Paul, the Kentucky Senate nominee, Christine O'Donnell, the Delaware Senate nominee, and Tea Party cheerleader and GOP darling Sarah Palin. We need to start a conversation with the Party about the critical importance infrastructure plays in our nation's economic future, and how important funding is. Why? Because if elected, Tea Party candidates will influence the actions of the next Congress, which will most likely take up the long overdue reauthorization of the multi-year surface transportation law. The law, known as the 2005 Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETY-LU), is the current authorization of federal transportation policy that expired in 2009. Congress has been dragging its feet on the bill. Looking for ways to fund the measure, Democrat Rep. James Oberstar, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has wisely proposed an increase in the federal gas tax, which hasn't been raised since 1993. Maybe he should stop calling it a tax right now, and start calling it a user fee, because Tea Partiers would not vote for a hundredth of a penny increase in the gas tax. We have to get them over the idea that no tax is a good tax, or tweak the semantics.
When it comes to our nation's transportation infrastructure, we are in deep trouble. In his new book, Too Big to Fall: America's Failing Infrastructure and the Way Forward, author Barry B. LePatner makes a compelling case for funding to fix our roads and bridges that every candidate should read. He examined the collapse of the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis in August 2007, which killed 13 people and injured 145 others, showing us that the tragedy could have been prevented. He also warned that it could happen again at thousands of bridges across the country, with more than 50 percent of our bridges past their intended lifespan. In a recent conversation, LePatner posed a question for Tea Party candidates, turning an issue too often seen as one about bricks and mortar into a question about life and death. He asked, ‚ÄúIf I tell you that your children, your grandchildren, and your nieces and nephews are going over bridges that are `structurally deficient' and `fracture-critical,' which any engineer will say can go down at any minute, does that mean anyone can tell you you're safe? Absolutely not. Are you telling me you don't care because you are trying to shrink the budget?‚Äù
If the Tea Party wants smaller government, they may turn to corporate America to pay for our roads, bridges and rails. The concept of privatizing transportation infrastructure was recently touted by Clifford Winston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He wrote that privatizing infrastructure would ‚Äúhelp cut the federal deficit by raising revenues and reducing expenditures.‚Äù But the government should be wary of taking this route, or it could wind up like the driver who blindly follows his GPS onto a recently closed bridge and ends up in deep water. As my friend Joe Giglio, a Professor at Northeastern University, who has written extensively about transportation issues, and served as the chair of Reagan's National Council on Public Works Improvement, puts it, ‚ÄúPrivatization is as American as handguns or bourbon and branch water.‚Äù But don't be fooled, he adds. The big argument for public-private partnerships is that private corporations have ‚Äúskin in the game,‚Äù while in fact many companies are as shortsighted about revenue as the politicians are. ‚ÄúWhat is a CEO concerned with? Long-term profitability or short-term?‚Äù Dr. Giglio asks. Too often, it's the latter goal, and that's not good for the public when we're talking about transportation infrastructure that's supposed to last lifetimes. That's not to say there aren't times when privatization won't work. When it comes to projects involving new technology and financial risk, let the private sector do it, Dr. Giglio said. But we must be careful about selling off our highways and roads, lest willy-nilly tolling schemes lead to unintended traffic congestion. If Americans are grumbling now about a 5 cent/gallon gas tax increase, just wait until privately managed companies start charging market rates for using roads. The year 2010 will be known as ‚Äúthe good old days.‚Äù
If we can't appeal to the Tea Party's good sense, then perhaps we could try appealing to their sense of history. This is a party, after all, whose main reference point is the Boston Tea Party. Craig Ruyle, an engineer at NYS Department of Transportation who is a history buff, points out that the conservative parties actually have a history of supporting funds for transportation infrastructure. In the pre-Civil war era, he notes, it was the Democrats who were against anything they considered ‚Äúinternal improvements‚Äù like building railroads and canals, claiming it was unconstitutional. It was the Whigs who pushed to invest in transportation. Why? It was all about commerce. Merchants had to move goods and prosperous commerce was vitally important for the country's future. President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, authorized the Transcontinental Railroad. And don't forget, a century later, it was Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower who fathered the Interstate Highway System. Fellow GOP President Ronald Reagan later imposed a five-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike for the Highway Trust Fund.
The Tea Party candidates have adopted the historic ‚ÄúDon't Tread on Me,‚Äù Gadsden flag for their cause, a bright yellow flag with the coiled timber rattlesnake poised for attack. But let's remember that this flag has been known as a symbol of patriotism as well as conflict with government. Hopefully we can harness the Tea Party's patriotism without losing support for those things that make this country so great, including a world-class transportation system.

Crews are working to clean up 300,000 gallons of diesel that have leaked in Arthur Kill between Staten Island and New Jersey. (Published Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2012)
Officials say 336,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled in Arthur Kill after a storage tank was lifted and ruptured from the surge from Sandy.
All the spilled oil is believed to be contained by booms put in the water, the Coast Guard says.
The diesel fuel leaked at the Motiva oil tank facility in Woodbridge, N.J., according to authorities.
Coast Guard spokesman Les Tippets says a secondary tank caught most of the oil and that the liquid that escaped moved into the Arthur Kill, the water waterway separating New Jersey from New York's Staten Island.
Two hundred responders were on scene to contain the spill.
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese says the company reported the spill and hired contractors to clean it up.
Air samples collected by the Coast Guard at Arthur Kill showed levels within acceptable thresholds Wednesday.

Sacramento Kings forward Matt Barnes is reportedly wanted for questioning after allegedly choking a woman and punching two people in a New York City nightclub Monday morning.
According to TMZ Sports, Barnes allegedly choked an unnamed woman during an argument and then hit two people who tried to break up the altercation. He was not at the scene when police arrived. "At least" one other Kings player was allegedly with Barnes at the time but was also gone before officers could question him.
"We do not believe a crime was committed," Barnes' attorney, Alex Spiro, told Jason Jones of the Sacramento Bee. "We are cooperating with law enforcement and are hopeful no charges will be pressed."
However, A.J. Perez of USA Today reported that "footage of the incident obtained by investigators appears to show Barnes was the assailant, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation who is not authorized to speak publicly because the investigation is ongoing."
Despite Perez's report, Barnes stated his innocence in a post on Instagram:
"We have clear standards of conduct and behavior expected of the entire Kings organization‚Äîon and off the court," the Kings said in a statement, per Jones. "We are working with all parties involved to gather information in order to take any appropriate next steps."
The Kings were in town for their Sunday matchup with the New York Knicks. Barnes scored two points on 1-of-11 shooting as the Kings dropped their third straight game. Knick fans also chanted "Derek Fisher" at Barnes toward the end of the game. (The two used to be teammates on the Lakers, but any friendship ended after Barnes' estranged wife became romantically linked to Fisher.)
No charges have been filed against Barnes at this time. Police are nonetheless investigating and want Barnes to come in for questioning. Jones reported the New York Police Department is still waiting to speak with Barnes.
Barnes was previously arrested in 2010 on suspicion of domestic violence charges. Those charges were later dropped when the woman, then-fiancee Gloria Govan, said Barnes never abused her or her family. The pair later married and then divorced.
Barnes was also arrested for resisting arrest and a misdemeanor traffic warrant in 2012. He pleaded no contest and served two years of probation.
The Kings, who signed Barnes as a free agent this summer, have yet to comment on the situation. They are scheduled to be in Dallas for a game against the Mavericks on Wednesday.

Sara Tasneem is a 36-year-old business student at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. But when she was 15, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, her father, who belonged to a religious cult, forced her to marry a man 13 years her senior.
"A person who marries a 15-year-old, there's obviously something wrong," Tasneem, who remained in that relationship for four years before filing for divorce, told the Chronicle. "Putting that label of husband and wife makes something disgusting and not OK seem normal and OK."

A 2017 report from the Tahirih Justice Center shines a grim light on child marriage in the US and how oftentimes state laws fail young people. According to the Center's analysis, more than 200,000 children were married between 2000 and 2015; sadly, most of them were girls who wed men sometimes decades older than them.
"From our experience, when a child is forced into a marriage, the perpetrator is almost always the parents," Unchained At Last founder Fraidy Reiss told the Huffington Post. "But these children are not all coming out of abusive, violent, dysfunctional homes. It's often parents who think they are doing the best thing for their child."
According to the report, most state laws set the minimum age to marry at 18, but these can often be overridden by parental consent, approval from a judge, or even simply a signature from a court clerk. What's more concerning is that 25 states have no laws on the books that indicate an age "floor" for marriage‚Äìmeaning, a girl who's barely started menstruating could legally become someone's wife if certain exceptions are met.
"For example," the report's authors write, "New Hampshire's laws describe the age of consent to marry as 18 years for both males and females, but then permit judicial approval for males age 14 or older and for females age 13 or older. At least as recently as 2013, a 13-year-old girl was married in New Hampshire. Maryland has a pregnancy exception that applies to children as young as 15, which is younger even than the state's legal age of consent to sex. Since 2000, this exception has enabled the marriages of at least 140 15-year-olds who were pregnant or had already given birth to a child."
The consequences of entering or being forced into a marriage at a young age can be damaging: As the report notes, not only do most of these marriages end in divorce, increasing the minor's likelihood of being stuck in poverty, but child brides are more likely to experience abuse and serious medical issues, such as psychiatric disorders.
One of the biggest problems with allowing a child to marry is that they don't have the same rights as an adult. For example, in many states, if the minor tries to leave a marriage to start fresh, they wouldn't be able to legally enter into an apartment lease. In fact, she may not even be able to file for her own divorce.
The simplest solution to protecting minors from entering marriages they may not be ready for, the report states, is to pass laws that set the marriage age without any exceptions to 18. So far, only Virginia, Texas, and New York have addressed this issue, passing laws that do not allow anyone who is a legal child to get married (though a minor who has been emancipated and given the full rights of an adult can).
"Every state in the country could make that change, and within just a few years we could eliminate the antiquated laws that have permitted child marriage in the US."
"It's easy and cheap to do that‚Äîclerks need only check IDs," says Jeanne Smoot, Tahirih Justice Center's senior counsel for policy and strategy and author of the report. "Rarely do we get a chance to make such a tremendous difference in the whole trajectory of a girl's life, and in her future family's life, than to make a change in laws that's so simple. Every state in the country could make that change, and within just a few years we could eliminate the antiquated laws that have permitted child marriage in the US."
Critics, however, argue that marriage is a fundamental right, and these instances of coerced marriage are relatively small in number. "For those who suggest these cases are rare," Smoot says, "whether it's one, 100, or 1,000 girls marrying each year in a particular state, it's unconscionable for states to keep lax laws on the books that subject any girl to the acute risk of a forced marriage or other lifelong harm."

And for teenagers who are interested in tying the knot because they actually want to? "We'd say that genuine couples can wait a few months or a year for their 'happily ever after,'" Smoot says. "Their chances at a solid marriage and future only improve if they wait."
She adds: "An at-risk girl needs legislatures to act now to adopt strong laws that keep her from having to face a never-ending nightmare."
Of all the practices implemented to improve code quality, such as unit testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment, daily stand-ups, I find the most important one is doing proper code reviews.
Code reviews have a lot of advantages:
It's much easier to spot problems with other people's code than with your own
Knowledge of the codebase is spread through the team, thereby avoiding the pitfall where certain developers have sole knowledge of a subsystem
General knowledge of the team is improved as new methods or practices are visible to everyone
Adherence to code standards are enforced
It can be a bit awkward in the beginning, but once you have found a good flow, you'll notice a big change in how software is developed, not only in terms of quality but also in terms of the morale and coherence of the development team.
Rules for reviewing code
For code reviews to work in your benefit, a certain set of rules need to be followed. It's easy to just start using some software, but if you aren't reviewing code consistently, it won't bring you all the benefits listed above. Here are a few the rules I have experienced to positively influence the gains of code reviews as well as satisfaction among developers.
Small commits, good commit messages
Having a lot of small grained commits with decent commit messages makes it much easier to review code as everything will be explained step-by-step. It also makes it easier for the reviewer to see the thinking behind the implementation.
As an added benefit, git blame will serve as your living documentation for all your code.
Review the code, not the developer
Since you're reviewing someone's work, it might be tempting to critique that person. However, if this culture persists, you'll more often than not get developers that aren't happy anymore or who will start hiding their not-so-nice code.
This doesn't mean you should let code pass that doesn't live up to the standard, it just means you should critique the code instead of the person. This can be a subtle difference. Instead of saying ‚ÄúYou didn't follow the standard here‚Äù, which can sound accusatory (intentional or not), say ‚Äúthis code should be formatted differently‚Äù. Note the difference in tone.
This responsibility also falls on the developer. As a developer you have to get into the mindset that you are not your code. Even if a comment might sound accusatory, don't take it personally and remember that it's a comment on the code, not on you or your behavior.
Multiple reviewers
Always assign more than 1 person to review the code. That way, if there are any disagreements, it will be easily solved by a majority vote. If you assign only 1 developer, you might run into a discussion without end between the developer and the reviewer.
Have a checklist
Having a list of things to look out for, makes it easier to conduct code reviews systematically. Here's my personal list of things to check for (in order of priority):
Function: does it do what it needs to do? (A good spec goes a long way here)
Bugs
Test coverage
Adherence to architecture and patterns
Duplicate code
Code style and formatting
Having a checklist also makes it easier for the developer to run through it before submitting the code for review.
When to review
This depends a bit on the confidence of the team and how well they work together.
In teams with low to medium confidence, I would opt for a feature-branch strategy where code is reviewed first and only then integrated into the main line. In this case, you have to make sure that code is reviewed as soon as possible, since you don't want any branches to live for a long time only to see that your properly reviewed code can't be integrated anymore without merge conflicts.
In teams with a high confidence level, I would opt to integrate directly into the main line and do reviews after the fact. The reason this can only be done in high confidence teams is multiple:
It might open you up to code reviews that are never completed
A developer can ignore the code review
Bad code can be committed
Review process
Whether you sit down together in front of the screen or have software to be able to complete your task, make sure reviewing code is as accessible as possible. The last thing you want is that developers come to see it as a chore. A fast code review process will yield more code reviews and better results.. I had very good experiences with Kiln. It does more than just code reviews, but I particularly liked their interface (YMMV).
Quick tip: Review only tests
If you have limited time and have good test coverage (or it's enforced by your build process), you can choose to only review the tests. The reasoning is that if the tests are good, the implementation will be good as well. By reviewing the tests you will see what the public API looks like, so you'll get a good feel about the code. Use this tip sparingly though, a full review is still useful.
Pitfalls
Apart from following the above rules, there are a few pitfalls and anti-patterns to look out for.
Gaming the system
If you don't have complete buy-in from the whole team, this issue might come up. It happens when 2 or more devs on the team decide to approve each other's code without properly reviewing it. They're technically following the rules, but in practice the code is not reviewed at all. A possible remedy is to make sure that the rule of 2 or more reviewers is appended with a rule that says you have to select two different people all the time.
Review gate
This problem can manifest itself in a few ways:
One dev never approves of any review so code is unnecessarily blocked in the review. If this happens frequently, find out what the underlying issue is.
All code needs to pass past one developer before it hits main. While this can sometimes be good for a short while, it's never a good plan to do this long-term. If really necessary, than at least that role should be switched regularly. Otherwise developers might stop caring about their code at all.
Complete lockdown: this happens where developers are taken away permission to touch the main line at all. If you really have big code quality issues it can be a good temporary measure, but otherwise this is the fastest way to sink your team's morale.
Conclusion
Code reviews are, in my experience, the most valuable tool for improving software quality, distributing knowledge and enforcing a common coding standard.
If you're just starting out with code review, keep in mind that it needs perfecting. Don't worry when it's not yet creating that huge change you expected. If you improve the process bit by bit and get more experienced, you'll soon see the benefits.
Story highlights Two brothers, four and two, died after being swept away by floodwaters during Sandy
Their mother said she had sought shelter at a nearby house, but was turned away
The homeowner has said he only saw a man outside, and could not help him
He said the mother, Glenda Moore, should not have been driving during the storm
As Superstorm Sandy ravaged New York, Glenda Moore drove frantically across Staten Island in an attempt to get her sons to safety.
Instead, Moore found herself and her boys -- Connor, four and Brandon, two -- caught in the full fury of the storm.
Buffeted by torrential rains and winds of up to 90 miles per hour, her Ford Explorer plunged into a hole. According to the account she would later give police, Moore carried her sons to a nearby tree, gripping branches along with her boys as she tried to shelter them from the storm surge.
She told police they clung together for hours, before Moore managed to make her way to a nearby property, and pleaded to be let inside. But according to her police account, rather than sheltering the desperate strangers, the occupant refused to let them enter.
In desperation, Moore told police she then went to the back of the house, and tried to break in using a flower pot, but was unable to do so. As the storm raged on, her sons were swept away by floodwaters.
The bodies of the boys were found near each other Thursday, about a quarter of a mile from where Moore last held them.
Relatives said Moore was too distraught to speak with CNN.
Meanwhile, public anger has been directed at the homeowner who allegedly failed to help Moore and her children. The man, who told CNN's Gary Tuchman that his name is Alan but did not want his full name used, disputed Moore's account, saying he saw only a man outside.
"He didn't come to the door... he must have been standing at the bottom of the stairs," said the man. "He took a concrete flower pot... and threw [it] through the door."
The man at the door didn't ask to enter the house, he said, but instead asked him to come outside in order to help.
"What could I do to help him?" he asked. "I had a pair of shorts on with flip-flops."
The man told CNN he sat up for the rest of the night, with his back against the door in the kitchen.
He said he did not know the fate of the children. Told that their bodies had been found, he said the deaths were a tragedy, but implied that the woman was at fault.
"It's unfortunate. She shouldn't have been out though. You know, it's one of those things," he said.
He said there was nothing he could have done. "I'm not a rescue worker ... If I had been outside, I would have been dead."
The man said he had given his account to police.
Legal experts consulted by CNN said that no crime would have been committed by a failure to render assistance.
A new bitcoin exchange launched yesterday in Sydney, Australia, with an aim to improving general consumer confidence in the digital currency market.
Called Independent Reserve, the exchange is promoting both itself and its Australian base as secure and well-regulated, saying the country's AAA credit rating and political stability made it the ideal place to locate.
It will aim first at the local and New Zealand markets before expanding overseas to the financial centers of Asia, though says it already has the ability to electronically verify customers in minutes from over 20 countries by working with identity specialists Global Data Company.
Adrian Przelozny, Independent Reserve's co-founder and chief technology officer, told CoinDesk the company has been in regular contact with local financial regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and would adhere to all KYC and AML compliance protocols.
He said:
‚ÄúWe're very comfortable that we have the right settings here to ensure its safety and success.‚Äù
Australian tax issues
A recent ruling by the Australian Tax Office on digital currency use was met with concern from the local bitcoin community, who said the definition of those currencies as akin to barter transactions and not ‚Äòmoney' or ‚Äòfinancial supply' would lead to the 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST, or sales tax) being applied twice ‚Äì once when purchasing bitcoins and again when using them to purchase other goods.
If passed on to consumers, it would also make bitcoins purchased in Australia 10% more expensive, most likely driving users to overseas exchanges and local companies out of business.
Independent Reserve, Przelozny said, would absorb the GST with its own profits and through the 0.5% brokerage fee it charges Australian customers, keeping its prices competitive.
‚ÄúWe strongly believe that Australians should not be penalised for the use of bitcoin [‚Ä¶] This would stifle bitcoin innovation in Australia and ultimately force companies to move operations offshore which would have a negative impact on the Australian economy as a whole.‚Äù
Financial experience
Independent Reserve is backed by a group of private investors and its executive team has years of experience in the finance and IT industries. CEO Adam Tepper has worked as a software Engineer and Solutions Architect at major Australian companies like ANZ bank, AMP insurance, and the Nine Entertainment Company.
Przelozny worked with Tepper at those three companies and both men were also co-founders and managing directors of Asia Australia Technology, a software engineering firm.
Independent Reserve, Przelozny added, has spent ‚Äúthousands of hours on R&D to make sure our platform is completely robust and our proprietary technology includes many levels of safeguards to ensure users are well protected.‚Äù
Tepper told the Sydney Morning Herald that the exchange is doing everything it possibly can to mitigate risks and ensure people feel secure about keeping money there. He mentioned that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers would be auditing all Independent Reserve's finances.
Bitcoin in Australia
Australia's international reputation as a stable business and legal environment, and financial services center, could serve digital currency companies well when attracting overseas customers.
It recently called a Senate Inquiry into bitcoin and digital currency use, which has increased confidence in the country's ability to take a sensible approach toward regulation.
While the market in Australia is relatively small compared to North America and Europe, bitcoin brokerages such as CoinJar, a bit Trade Australia and igot have performed well in the local market and payment processors such as BitPOS (as well as CoinJar) are working hard to build a local digital currency-using economy.

French president elect Emmanuel Macron appeared to an audience worldwide last night after declaring victory in the country's elections. His rival Marine Le Pen accepted defeat just 11 minutes after the polls closed after projected votes declared the En Marche! candidate would win by a significant margin. Rather than having a significant impact on currency markets; the events which played out on live television worldwide, had a modest impact although charts showed some volatility around the time Mr Macron appeared on television while having his make-up done. French banks are all down on the day after the election of Mr Macron with Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale down almost 2 per cent, BNP Paribas down 1.34 per cent, Natixis down 1.35 per cent. ¬£1 = ‚Ç¨1.18 / ¬£1.29

Mr Macron beat his opponent hands down but wasn't as successful as he would have liked thanks to millions of spoiled ballot papers. Nevertheless Mrs May says she hopes she can repeat his achievement, she said: ‚ÄúYesterday a new French president was elected. He was elected with a strong mandate which he can take as as strong position into the negotiations," she said at an event in Harrow. "The UK we need to ensue we have an equally strong mandate and an equally strong negotiating position.‚Äù

9.26am BST update: Peter Ashton, managing director of Eiger FX, commented: ‚ÄúFor once the currency markets have been revelling in the accuracy of the opinion polls. Macron's campaign had gained an air of invincibility after he narrowly came out on top in the first round. ‚ÄúBut while his final victory was as crushing as it was expected, the Euro has so far failed to follow the script. Rather than rocketing in relief, the single currency began the week with all the ups and downs of a French farce. "Sometimes currencies spike beyond what's priced in, as the expected outcome becomes fact. The Euro's stubborn refusal to surge reveals a deeper malaise surrounding the single currency. "Macron's victory will soothe frayed nerves in Brussels. But the spectre of populism is growing across Europe and the markets are increasingly looking to this broader trend rather than one-off events. "Le Pen lost but she still took more than a third of the votes cast, and the consensus is that she will be a far more significant force come 2022 if France follows its current economic trajectory."

"The next decisive step for France will be the Parliamentary elections. The latest polls indicate Macron's party "En Marche" to be the first party at Parliament followed with the Republicans.

In the Panthers' final game of the 2009-10 season, through a snowstorm of inappropriately dropped confetti, 21 year-old defensive prospect Keaton Ellerby had been given his first real chance to shine. In that 3-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning, Ellerby logged 14:20 (the most he'd play that season after averaging 5:25 TOI) of assertive and physical hockey but more importantly his effort gave the franchise reason to at least reconsider future plans on the blueline; he displayed more than adequate capability...the riches of losing seasons were beginning to emerge.
Despite not making the following season's roster out of training camp, Keaton has quietly become a solid member of the Panthers new-look defensive core. His booming hits are becoming a thing of folklore around Sunrise, an underrated offensive ability is taking flight during this stretch run with 4 points in 8 games, and coach Peter DeBoer continues to entrust Ellerby and defensive partner Dmitry Kulikov with some of the team's toughest assignments; oh what a difference a year makes.
In his final call-up of last season, Ellerby found himself to be more waterboy than player, never quite earning the trust of the coaching staff. After a summer of intense training in Calgary, Ellerby bulked up to 220 lbs from 200 while instilling a far more assertive approach to the game, Keaton looked poised to finally cement himself as an NHL regular. Despite Keith Ballard being shipped off to Vancouver, Ellerby was buried under organizational depth accrued by new General Manager Dale Tallon during the summer months. The additions of Mike Weaver, Nathan Paetsch, and top draft pick Erik Gudbranson greatly increased competition, and hurt Ellerby's chances of breaking through; despite a great showing, with what was widely believed to the best performance by a rookie at camp, Ellerby was back with the Rochester Americans in October.
As Ellerby's luck would have it, Nathan Paetsch was soon traded away, Erik Gudbranson's contract talks stalled out at the last minute and he was sent back to the OHL, and the aging defensive core started to get banged up; by late in the season's first month the new and improved Ellerby would have his chance.
While his opportunities with the Panthers this season have been short lived, Ellerby has shown a great deal of development and proven himself to be a young and skilled NHL calibre defenseman, amassing 8 points in 29 games which is .28 points per game; when comparing other NHL rookie dmen (yes, Ellerby qualified for Rookie status this year) who've played 29 or more games, only seven have a higher point average--and all of them have benefited considerably from powerplay opportunities in comparison to Keaton who has yet to surpass the 13 minute-mark for the season.
Perhaps the most interesting statistic is that Ellerby is tied with Steven Kampfer of the Boston Bruins for giveaway efficiency, only giving up the puck .27 times a game-- in a league where puckmoving young defensemen are coveted, Ellerby is showing he's one of the best and most responsible young dmen with the puck in the entire league. It's not only his offensive prowess that is floating under the radar, it's his increased physicality and defensive play. Ellerby's prorated hit totals would put him around 3rd or 4th in the league amongst rookies; as well, he's ranked 9th in +/- for defenders who've played in as many or more games as him in their first year.
When Ellerby was drafted with the 10th overall pick in '07, some prematurely dubbed him as destined to take over the long-vacant Ed Jovanovski throne (a title since passed - fairly or not - to Gudbranson). Keaton hasn't yet delivered the consistent physicality and inherent assertiveness that JovoCop seemingly oozed from the start, but comparing results from the rookie seasons of Jovanovski and Ellerby are a bit shocking, placing Keaton in very good company.
P/PG +/- PIM/G Ellerby .28 1 0.35 Jovanoski .30 -3 1.95 McCabe .28 -23 1.9
Despite coming into camp this year meaner and nastier, Ellerby has played very cerebral hockey. While Jovanovski will always be associated with his motion picture namesake alter-ego (Jovocop), Keaton can be likened more closely to the Terminator: more concerned with the final result than any associated violence. He's conscious of his play and very responsible not to take a bad penalty or be caught out of position, a trap many "big hitters" fall prey to early in their careers.
The effect Keaton Ellerby has on the Panthers team is made clearly visible when looking at Derek Zona's scoring chances data. Keaton Ellerby has been the most productive member of the defensive core when you tabulate a players total scoring chance efficency. When Ellerby is on the ice, the Panthers have a better chance of getting a scoring chance, then giving one up.
Player CH% Ellerby 0.613 Allen 0.520 Wideman 0.534 Kulikov 0.537 McCabe 0.537 Weaver 0.564 Callahan 0.609 Garrison 0.513 Def. Average 0.542
When one considers the positive progress Ellerby has made since this point a year ago, it's truly astonishing. Ellerby has grown into a very confident player and could be considered for the top spot on the Panthers' most-improved list. It's interesting to note that observers ridiculed former GM Randy Sexton's decision for keeping the young defender up with the Cats after the trade deadline, to be used sparingly in a trial-by-fire instead of getting his minutes with Rochester; Sexton believed the attention he'd get at the NHL level would be more beneficial to his development. Whether right or wrong, it's a much different approach to development and one can't help but think what that belief might have had if employed for the Grabner situation. Whatever the belief though one can't discount the hard work and perseverance the young bruising defenseman put into the off-season.
While it is uncertain that Ellerby will remain with the team in the near future, as captain - and pending UFA - Bryan McCabe eyes a return soon, Keaton's making life awfully difficult for Tallon to order a reassignment to Rochester.
If such a fate is in the cards, his play has already spoken loudly: "I'll be back".

Two decades of dedicated service by Bhavesh Patel have made sure the ‚Äòdead' don't come alive on Mumbai's railway stations. The activist who has been tirelessly working for rail accident victims and their families is responsible for a doctor certifying that a victim is dead. Until 2004, the station manager or a Government Railway Police (GRP) constable would certify an injured person's medical condition. This unskilled evaluation often deprived victims of crucial medical assistance. Patel, 42, recounts a tragicomic episode when the body of a ‚Äòdeceased' stirred while it was being taken out of the ambulance. ‚ÄúTerrified, the cops dropped the stretcher and ran,‚Äù he says.It's one among several critical changes theadvisor has brought about. He has also ensured that victims are rushed to the nearest hospital within an hour of the accident, known as ‚Äògolden hour'. The Bombay High Court's order to this effect in 2004 was passed on Patel's petition.As a college student who took the local from Dadar Station, Patel remembers seeing naked runover bodies lying on stretchers outside the ladies' toilet, often unattended from morning to night. ‚ÄúThe cops used to sell the shrouds and cover the bodies with newspapers,‚Äù he says cringing. The turning point came when he witnessed a commuter fall off a train. When he rushed to inform the GRP, they threatened to jail him for bothering them. ‚ÄúI went home in tears. My dad convinced me to make those who had made me cry, pay,‚Äù he says.Patel shot off a stream of letters to decisionmakers and spent hours every day at the Divisional Railway Manager's office and various GRP stations, waiting only to be heard. ‚ÄúMy plea was simple. At least in death, one deserves dignity,‚Äù he says, about his appeal to make shrouds compulsory. They did become mandatory, and the victory made Patel a famous face in the media. Yet, for a decade, he achieved only middling success.It took the tragedy of Jayabala Ashar for the railways to sit up. In 1998, on her way to a college exam, the 23-year-old was accosted by a drug addict on a Borivli-bound local. When she refused to part with her bag, she was hurled on the tracks and lost her limbs. The accident caused outrage. Patel took up the issue of her delayed hospitalisation with the then Railway Minister Ram Naik. ‚ÄúStretchers were made mandatory at every station, and mortuaries were built at Dadar, Kurla and Thane stations. In 2003, I started the first helpline for railway victims, to dispense information to their families and facilitate immediate hospitalisation,‚Äù says Patel, who also built a fleet of 35 private ambulances that would be on stand-by around various stations.With a not-so-pretty picture being painted in the media, railway authorities suddenly asked Patel to pack up. ‚ÄúThey said they'd take over my job. But they never did,‚Äù he sighs. Undeterred, Patel's next initiative was to link BMC and staterun hospitals through a centralised information database that carried information on the injured and dead. This, too, wound up. Earlier this year, GRP Commissioner Prabhat Kumar acknowledged Patel's contribution and launched Shodh, a website to help families locate accident victims. Patel is also the one to perform the last rites in case no relatives turn up to identify the deceased.‚ÄúMy work is not about making someone happy. I only try to lessen the blow of sadness,‚Äù he says. His bag of memories is packed with poignant ones. But the one that leaves him moist-eyed each time he narrates it, is about the time a grateful lady who begged to earn her living, came knocking at his door to hand over Rs 60, after Patel had arranged for a shroud to cover her son's body.
D.C. Fire Chief Dennis L. Rubin said Friday that "it's very possible" someone put furniture in the hallway of a Mount Pleasant apartment building to keep people from escaping a fire there this week.
Investigators said they think that Wednesday morning's fire started in the fifth-floor hallway, where a mattress and other furniture were found. It killed one man who tried to jump to safety and injured 10 others, including a 2-year-old girl with burns on 30 percent of her body. She is in guarded condition at Shriners Hospital for Children in Boston, a pediatric burn center.
Rubin said fire investigators are still looking into all possible accidental causes before ruling the blaze an arson. Most likely, though, "this will be some sort of set fire," he said. The mattress, he said, might have helped fuel the fire.
Speaking at the firehouse of Engine Company 24's Rescue Squad 2, which sent a number of emergency responders to the blaze, Rubin asked for patience as investigators finish conducting interviews and collecting evidence. He said that officials had several "what we would call suspects or persons of interest" but that no one is in custody.
Among other victims taken to hospitals after the fire, three were released, and three remain in critical condition, said Pete Piringer, spokesman for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services. He was not certain of the conditions of the others.
Rubin praised the efforts of the 125 firefighters and emergency responders from across the District, specifically those of Rescue Squad 2, who he said faced difficult conditions in their attempt to save dozens of people.
Firefighters were called to the 63-unit Sarbin Towers apartments, in the 3100 block of 16th Street NW, at 3:45 a.m. They escorted dozens of people out of the eight-story building, carrying some through smoke-filled hallways or down ladders.
Heat, smoke, language barriers and residents' panic made rescue efforts challenging, according to the firefighters. Brian Phillips described having to forcibly enter an apartment on the fifth floor, where he found a man who had removed a cable from his television, tied it to the refrigerator door and was "sitting on his window ledge, grasping it with both hands."
"That was his last-ditch effort," Phillips said. "to go out the window."
Capt. Timothy Jeffery said he knew things were bad when he saw "bloody footprints coming across the lobby area" as he entered the building. People were gathered at the windows of nearly every apartment he entered "just trying to get fresh air," he said.
"At some point, when [the window is] their only egress, who knows what's going to happen," he said.
Three people tried to climb down a tree from their fifth-floor apartments, said firefighters who were able to block one of them. Another person made it to safety, but one fell and died.
The detective's latest reboot is based on the BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch as the pipe-puffing protagonist and Martin Freeman as his sidekick Watson
Sherlock Holmes has had many incarnations since he was first brought to life by the pen of Arthur Conan Doyle in 1887. This summer, that most British of detectives, who has appeared as everything from a vampire hunter to a crime-fighting teenager, is being immortalised in Japanese manga.
Out in June, Sherlock: A Study in Pink adapts the BBC series, which started in 2010, transforming Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes and Martin Freeman's Dr John Watson into classic manga images. Publisher Titan Comics said the release would be the first time the manga series, illustrated by manga illustrator Jay, would be printed in English. It launched in Japan four years ago, and according to io9 its popularity has meant there have been a plethora of fan translations since.

‚ÄúIt's really interesting seeing such a British thing being reinterpreted in Japanese manga,‚Äù said Titan Comics editor Andrew James, who acquired the manga series for the publisher. ‚ÄúIt's still dynamic and full of action, but compared to American comics, there's often a quietness and reflectiveness about manga.‚Äù
Titan is offering extended page counts, as well as new art and covers by artists including Alice X Zhang, in its manga series, the first issue of which opens with Holmes and Watson's first meeting and ends with the pair moving in together.
The pair's relationship, James said, is ‚Äúnot made any more explicit than it is on the television, but it's certainly something the television has hinted at ... so [the manga] is not a thing with love hearts appearing, but it's definitely something in which the subtext is just as strong‚Äù.

Danie Ware, from retailer Forbidden Planet, said the manga series was ‚Äúpitched just right‚Äù, and an ‚Äúinteresting crossover‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt's a very new thing, putting something which is very British into the manga format. It's very unusual,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut ever since Benedict appeared on the television, Sherlock has been on the up and up. [And] there's a huge following for manga amongst young women of around 21, and I think the same group follows Benedict, so there is a crossover.‚Äù
Titan is also the publisher of the Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series, in which the detective variously deals with alien attacks and vampires, as well as James Lovegrove's forthcoming Cthulhu Casebooks series, in which he takes on occult forces. In Mycroft Holmes, by the basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the life of his older brother is imagined.

‚ÄúAs a core starting place, Holmes is the detective ‚Äì the first one, the one everyone references,‚Äù said Titan Books editor Miranda Jewess. ‚ÄúIt's nice to have that point of familiarity, then you can have writers from any genre playing with it ... We've had Holmes fighting everything ‚Äì even Frankenstein's monster.‚Äù
According to book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan, hundreds of Holmes-related titles were published in 2015. The most popular was Anthony Horowitz's authorised sequel, The House of Silk, followed by a miniature edition of Conan Doyle's Essential Mysteries. Other popular titles included Andrew Lane's Young Sherlock Holmes books, Tim Dedopulos's Holmes puzzles, and psychologist Maria Konnikova's Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes.
Jewess speculated that Conan Doyle himself probably wouldn't have approved of the industry his creation has spawned. ‚ÄúLuckily, he's out of copyright, because I don't think he'd like it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe tried to kill Holmes off once, and I'd think he'd want him to die again. But on the other hand, perhaps the fact that he has become more than a character, that he's an icon, might help ease his mind.‚Äù
Alexander Graham Bell, noting how the sun's rays ignite paper only when focused in one place, advised, ‚ÄúConcentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand." Yet ordinarily our attention wanders, a sitting duck for whatever distraction comes our way ‚Äì especially when our email inbox alone offers constant distractions that seem urgent, but are just not that important.
Then there's multitasking, which really means switching from one narrow focus to another ‚Äì the mind cannot hold more than one at a time in what's called ‚Äúworking memory.‚Äù So interrupting one task with another can mean taking many minutes to get your original focus back to speed.
The opposite of multitasking is single-tasking, the ability to bring our focus to bear fully on just what we are doing. It comes to us naturally in those do-or-die times when a deadline forces us to focus fully. But how can we have that full concentration during the rest of our work life ‚Äì or our life in general?
Mindfulness is one answer. When we are mindful we bring an even, full attention to whatever is at hand. It gives us the power to move our concentration from place to place as we move through our day ‚Äì finishing a report, relishing a meal, loving a child.
Mindfulness gives us the capacity to notice when the sea of distractions we swim though in any given day has pulled us in: here I am again, scanning my inbox, instead of finishing what I want to be doing. Mindfulness strengthens our meta-awareness, the ability to track where our attention goes.
When we find ourselves stuck in our inbox instead of that other important task, we can have a second thought ‚Äì I don't need to do this now ‚Äì and move our attention back to what we need to be doing. A mindful awareness offers the antidote to mindless multi-tasking. We can single-task.
An increasing number of companies, from Google to General Mills, are offering their employees training in mindfulness. And Jon Kabat-Zinn, an old friend and pioneer in introducing mindfulness in all its pragmatic applications, has just updated his classic book, Full Catastrophe Living, including a review of the new, powerful research on the benefits of mindfulness.
For the Google program, now offered by the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute, Stanford researchers found increases in self-awareness and empathy, better self-management of upsetting emotions, and better listening.
That sounds like an upgrade in emotional intelligence to me.

A waxy substance in apple peel, called ursolic acid, might help humans suffering from muscle wasting that can accompany disease, illness and aging. In a new study, researchers found apple peel in the diet reduced muscle atrophy in mice, promoted muscle growth and fat loss and even lowered blood sugar, cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Compound in apple peel helps muscle building hormones
The researchers were looking for a chemical that could stop muscle atrophy that Christopher Adams, M.D., Ph.D., University of Iowa endocrinologist and senior author of the study says is very common, but lacks treatment.
"We studied muscle gene activity in people with atrophy and used that information to find chemicals that might block atrophy. One of those chemicals was especially interesting. It's called ursolic acid and it's particularly concentrated in apple peels.
When the scientists tested ursolic acid in mice, they found it increased muscle size and strength, in addition to reducing body fat, cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Adams explained, the apple peel compound works to build muscle and protect from muscle atrophy in the mice "by helping two hormones that build muscle: insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and insulin."
Apple peel given to the mice and added to the daily diet corrected abnormal gene signaling that leads to muscle atrophy. The mice were fasting to simulate what happens to humans during prolonged illness that leads to muscle weakness and longer hospitalization times from debilitation.
Natural compound in apples changes gene expression to promote muscle building

The research team isolated 63 genes that change in a fasting state in mice and in humans, and another 29 that change expression in the presence of spinal cord injury and during fasting.
Dr. Adams said ursolic acid is an ‚Äúinteresting compound‚Äù. An apple a day changed gene expression in the mice to promote strong muscles, opposing the pattern that causes muscle wasting.
"We know if you eat a balanced diet like mom told us to eat you get this material," Adams said. "People who eat junk food don't get this."
It's not clear if the same results will be found in humans, but if so, the compound could be developed to protect patients with chronic illness from debilitation that comes from muscle atrophy during prolonged illness, immobility and inability to eat.
Ursolic acid, a natural compound found in apple peel, boosts the effect of the muscle building hormone IGF1 without increasing body weight and fat. The researchers hope to study the compound in human trials to see if daily intake of apple peel is enough to provide the same muscle building benefits to humans found in the mouse studies.

MANILA ‚Äì The Court of Appeals (CA) upheld the decision of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) allowing a son of former Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan, Sr., who is one of the respondents in the Maguindanao massacre case, to be released on bail.
In a four-page resolution penned by Associate Justice Marie Christine Azcarraga-Jacob, concurred in by Associate Justices Ricardo Rosario and Edwin Sorongon, the CA 16th Division denied the government prosecutors' plea seeking the reversal of Quezon RTC Branch 221 Presiding Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes decision granting Datu Sajid Islam Ampatuan.
Datu Sajid is one of the principal suspects in the Maguindanao massacre, where 58 people were killed including 32 journalists in November 2009.
He was granted bail last January 9, 2015.
The Ampatuan clan was accused of masterminding the Maguindanao massacre, which killed 58 people to derail the political plans of rival Esmael Mangudadatu, incumbent governor of Maguindanao, for the 2010 elections.
The appellate court did not give credence to the claim of the petitioners that its January 30, 2017 decision should be reversed following the decision of the trial court to discharge Police Insp. Rex Ariel Diongon as state witness and to admit his testimony.
Government prosecutors asked the CA to give weight to the testimony of Diongon which was previously disregarded by the trial curt, to prove that the evidence against Ampatuan was strong enough to deny his application for bail.
The petitioners said that this ‚Äúsupervening event‚Äù should warrant the reversal of the CA's decision favoring Ampatuan.
The CA noted that the petitioners failed to submit proof that such order was issued by the Court.
Even assuming that such order was issued by the trial court, the CA said it would have no relevance to this present case considering that the CA power of review is limited only to a determination whether or not the trial court issued the said order in grave abuse of its discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction.
‚ÄúIndeed, our power of review does not include encroaching upon the lower court's prerogative of determining the witnesses whose testimonies are relevant to the application of bail as well as the power of probative weight to said witnesses' testimonies in the absence of any showing that the exercise of such discretion was gravely abused by the trial court ‚Äì an imputation we find wanting in the instant case,‚Äù the CA ruled.
Aside from the said supervening event, the CA described the other arguments as mere rehash of the arguments raised in its main petition which it already considered in coming up with its earlier decision.
‚ÄúIn other words, these arguments are not issues which are novel or which the Court overlooked to pass upon. Hence, the same do not need further judicial determination,‚Äù it added.
In a related development, the CA also affirmed the QC RTC's grant of bail to 16 policemen who were among the 198 accused in the Maguindanao massacre.
The decision issued last month, penned by Associate Justice Jhosep Lopez of the CA Tenth Division, denied the petition filed by government prosecutors seeking the reversal of the order issued by the trial court on October 13, 2014 which granted the petition for bail filed by the 16 accused police officers who are members of the 1508th Provincial Mobile Group (PMG).
Granted bail were PO1 Heirich Amaba, PO3 Rasid Anton, PO3 Felix Enate, PO1 Esprielito Lejarso, PO1 Narkouk Mascud, SPO1 Eduardo Hong, PO2 Saudi Pasuta, PO1 Arnulfo Soriano, PO1 Pia Kamidon, PO3 Abibudin Abdulgani, PO2 Hamad Nana, PO1 Esmael Guilal, SPO1 Oscar Donato, PO1 Abdullah Baguadatu, PO2 Saudiar Ulah, and P/Insp. Michael Joy Macaraeg.
In granting their bail applications, the trial court noted that none of the testimonies or exhibits presented by the prosecution had particularly linked and identified the police officers to the relevant times and places surrounding the alleged killing of the victims.
Earlier, Supreme Court (SC) Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said that Quezon City RTC has been conducting hearings on the Maguindanao massacre case thrice a week in a bid to serve justice to the victims of the crime and their families.
Sereno said Judge Solis-Reyes has already heard a total of 233 witnesses: 131 prosecution witnesses, 58 private complainants, and 44 defense witnesses.
She added the court has also resolved all the 12 sets of formal offer of evidence (FOE), and all bail applications of the 69 accused, except the bail application of accused Andal ‚ÄúUnsay‚Äù Ampatuan, Jr., which was deemed submitted for resolution on January 3, 2017.
Last July 2015, Ampatuan Sr., succumbed to cardiac arrest and died at the age of 74.
Living Symphonies is a musical composition that grows in the same way as a forest ecosystem. Portraying the thriving activity of the forest's wildlife, plants and atmospheric conditions, it creates an ever-changing symphony heard amongst the forest itself. Composed and realised by James Bulley and Daniel Jones, Living Symphonies took place across four of England's forests over summer 2014. It was produced by Forestry Commission England and Sound And Music, with support from Arts Council England. If you are interested in commissioning or hosting a future edition of Living Symphonies, please write to info (at) livingsymphonies.com. Places that have hosted Living Symphonies

More about the making of the piece
Each forest location is surveyed in detail to understand what flora and fauna live nearby, in conjunction with ecologists and wildlife rangers from the Forestry Commission. We look for animal habitats, food sources and movement patterns, building up a metre-by-metre map of the forest. Pictured above is the survey from Thetford Forest. You can see ash, hawthorn, elm and Scots pine trees, and a great deal of moss, grass, bramble, and Mahonia aquifolum. Read more: The ecosystem model
This survey is used to make an sophisticated model of the forest ecosystem which mimics the behaviours of the real wildlife. Mammals, birds and insects move around the space in real-time, with nocturnal creatures coming out at night. Current temperature, wind, rain and sun conditions are linked to this model via a weather station installed on site, so that a rainy day will cause wet-weather animals to emerge. Read more: The growing composition
Each animal, tree and plant is linked to a unique set of musical instrumentation and motifs, which portray its changing behaviours. Up in the canopy, the gliding cello harmonics of a butterfly are heard fluttering from tree to tree, whilst from beneath a decomposing log comes the chattering percussion of teeming beetles. Amongst the undergrowth a spider spins a web of glistening piano, waiting to ensnare the discordant violin chords of flies whirring by. Dozens of these musical elements are heard at once, collectively creating an ever-changing symphony from the complex web of interactions that make up the forest. Read more: Exploring the space
Living Symphonies is heard from a network of speakers embedded invisibly amongst the canopy and undergrowth. Musical motifs swarm and flutter across the space, following the real animals' movement patterns, and encouraging a mode of engagement that is spatial and exploratory.
AT&T got Turner Networks to join its upcoming Internet video services in the latest example of how the carrier is building a broad, mainstream offering to compete with cable television.
Turner, which owns cable channels TBS, TNT, and CNN, among others, agreed to be included in the new digital service as part of a larger deal to also be carried on the DirecTV satellite service that AT&T bought last year. AT&T has signed a series of deals for its digital service, including with other units of Time Warner, using its newly obtained heft in the pay TV market.
AT&T paid $49 billion for DirecTV last year. Approximately 80% of the carrier's 25 million video subscribers are on DirecTV, with the rest paying for wired connections in AT&T's U-verse service. In March, AT&T said it was creating several Internet-based video services that could compete with traditional cable TV. The services, which will vary in price and content, are expected to roll out in the fourth quarter.
‚ÄúThe Turner agreement adds more premium content to our already robust line-up of DirecTV Now channels available to customers when it launches this year,‚Äù said Dan York, chief content officer for AT&T, in a statement. The carrier has previously struck deals Time Warner's (twx) HBO, Comcast's (cmcsa) NBCUniversal and Disney (dis).
Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.
AT&T (t) has not disclosed the prices or exact details of its new Internet video services. It has said that the DirecTV Now offering will let customers assemble their own bundles of cable channels. A more affordable offering, called DirecTV Mobile, will combine premium video with made-for-digital content. And a free offering called DirecTV Preview will offer some shows from the other apps but with advertising.
At the same time, the company is working on the Internet services that looks much like traditional cable TV, AT&T is also investing in other kinds of digital video services. In April, opened a new $5-per-month video streaming service called Fullscreen pitched toward millennials.
AT&T executives have said they expect the new Internet TV services to hit the market by the end of the year.
Since the first experiment with an Origami / Papercraft hybrid in which the manes and tails of the ponies are printed on adhesive labels then attached to the origamis I have created quite a few new drafts. The second I made after Pinkie Pie is Rainbow Dash.Recently Rocking Scorpion (check out his awesome drawings and photographs!) suggested jokingly in a chat that I should do an origami of a sonic rainboom. I took up the challenge and here is the result.At first I had thought of something more complex involving a lot of wire and tissiue paper (I might still give that one a try since I already purchased the materials for that) before I took a rather simple approach using very easily foldable triangular components and sticking them together to a circle and attaching Rainbow Dash inside with a barely visible nylon thread (admittedly, when I added a background fancier than the wallpaper of my room to this photograph, I also removed any trace of said thread from the image. If you are interested here is an unedited version of the photograph used for the image above).For the newer origamis I also came up with different sets of eyes, manes and tails for the different characters. In this case we got Rainbow Dash with flying mane and tail and eyes closed, thoroughly enjoying the flight. Other versions I made of her come with more regular manes and with neutral, determined or angry eyes.
With the Ravens approaching franchise records in yards gained and points scored this season, offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak pointed to the success his players have had in learning his new scheme as a main factor ‚Äì and the first-year coordinator means all of them, not just the stars.
‚ÄúThe biggest thing going on with us, I think, as a group, is all the people that are contributing,‚Äù Kubiak said. ‚ÄúWe're not some group that just sits there and waits for one or two guys to make a play.‚Äù
The Ravens have had eight different combinations of players among the top three pass catchers through 13 games. At least seven different players have receptions in 11 of the team's 13 games, and six different players have led the team in receptions: injured tight end Dennis Pitta, wide receiver Steve Smith, running back Justin Forsett, wide receiver Michael Campanaro (River Hill), tight end Owen Daniels, and wide receiver Torrey Smith.
All three active running backs ‚Äî Forsett, Bernard Pierce, and Lorenzo Taliaferro ‚Äî have led the team in rushing, though Forsett has taken over a majority of carries in recent weeks.
Kubiak said the well-worn ‚Äúnext man up‚Äù mantra rings true in the locker room, pointing to tight end Phillip Supernaw and second-string wide receivers Kamar Aiken and Marlon Brown, all of whom stepped up last Sunday against the Miami Dolphins without Torrey Smith (knee) and tight end Crockett Gillmore (back), and could be called on again Sunday.
Our Baltimore Sun panel of experts predicts the outcome of Sunday's Week 15 game between the Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars at M&T Bank Stadium.
‚ÄúIn our meeting Saturday night before the game, we talked about everybody probably having an opportunity to contribute in the game,‚Äù Kubiak said. ‚ÄúJohn [Harbaugh] talks about that all the time, and I'll be darned if it didn't happen really in a big way this past week. I don't think it's going to be different here down the stretch.‚Äù
The success from all over the depth chart has led to an offense that, with 356 points in 13 games, is all but assured of eclipsing the franchise record set in 2012 (398), and could do so Sunday against Jacksonville. At its current pace of 376 yards per game, the Ravens will surpass the franchise record of 5,723 yards, set in 1996, by season's end.
The city of Indianapolis is preparing to take legal action against the makers and distributors of opioids, Mayor Joe Hogsett announced Thursday morning at a press conference.
The city has hired the law firm of Cohen & Malad LLP, which plans to file a ‚Äúrobust lawsuit‚Äù in the coming weeks, city officials said.
Likely defendants include Purdue Pharma, which makes OxyContin, as well as Endo Health, Teva Pharmaceutical, Cardinal Health, McKesson and AmerisourceBergen, Cohen & Malad managing partner Irwin Levin said.
Officials didn't specify an amount the city would seek in damages.
Hogsett said opioid addiction took the lives of 345 Marion County residents last year, more than four times the number of traffic-related deaths. In 2014, Indiana ranked 15th in the nation for the number of deaths due to drug overdose, and Marion County led the state with the highest number of deaths due to drug overdose as well as non-fatal emergency department visits, the city said.
As of Oct. 2, Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services had administered overdose medication naloxone 1,670 times in 2017, on pace to surpass last year's record-high number of administrations, according to city figures.
Hogsett pointed a finger directly at opioid makers and distributors, saying they were seeking ‚Äúprofits over people.‚Äù
‚ÄúOpioids are killing Americans,‚Äù Hogsett said. ‚ÄúOpioids are killing Hoosiers. Opioids are killing our neighbors here through the city of Indianapolis.‚Äù
In many cases, he said, victims were seeking relief from pain, as promised by opioid makers, following medical procedures. ‚ÄúThey were instead administered addiction,‚Äù he said.
Levin said his office has already spent ‚Äúmany hundreds of hours‚Äù analyzing information on how much the city spends on police, social services and other efforts to treat victims and prosecute drug lawbreakers. ‚ÄúThe impact is tremendous,‚Äù he said.
Indianapolis is joining a recent landslide of government entities filing similar lawsuits.
More than two dozen states, cities and counties‚Äîincluding Ohio, Mississippi, Orange County in California, and the Washington cities of Seattle, Everett and Tacoma‚Äîhave sued the pharmaceutical companies.
Most other states have recently broadened a joint effort to investigate the companies' actions.
The governments hope to recoup costs of responding to drug addiction, including money spent on emergencies, criminal justice and social services.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2015, drug overdoses killed more than 52,000 Americans. Most involved prescription opioids such as OxyContin or Vicodin or related illicit drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. People with addictions often switch among the drugs.
John Parker, senior vice president of the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, said the lawsuit is misguided. The alliance is a national trade association representing distributors, including McKesson, Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen.
"As distributors, we understand the tragic impact the opioid epidemic has on communities across the country," Parker said in a written statement. "We are deeply engaged in the issue and are taking our own steps to be part of the solution‚Äîbut we aren't willing to be scapegoats.
"Distributors are logistics companies that arrange for the safe and secure storage, transport, and delivery of medicines from manufacturers to pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and others based on prescriptions from licensed physicians. We don't make medicines, market medicines, prescribe medicines, or dispense them to consumers."
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has joined a Muslim community rally to promote tolerance, condemn the attacks in Paris and rebuke a growing anti-Islam movement.
Speaking at the gathering in Berlin on Tuesday, she urged Germans not to marginalise Muslims or other minorities, saying: "Excluding population groups due to their faith or their origin is beneath the dignity osf our liberal state.
"Hatred of foreigners, racism and extremism have no place in this country."
President Joachim Gauck also addressed the vigil at the Brandenburg Gate, organised by the Central Council of Muslims in Germany under the banner "Let's be there for each other. Terror: not in our name!"
"We are all Germany," Gauck said. "We, democrats with our different political, cultural and religious backgrounds; we, who respect and need each other; we, who want to live life in unity, justice and freedom.
"Our answer to the fundamentalism of the Islamist perpetrators of violence is democracy, respect for the law, respect for each other, respect for human dignity. This is our way of life!"
The vigil came a day after the self-declared Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident, or PEGIDA, drew a record 25,000 marchers to its 12th weekly rally in Dresden, located in the former communist East Germany.
Charlie Hebdo attacks
Flag-waving PEGIDA members held a minute's silence for the 17 victims of the attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a siege on a Jewish supermarket.
Their latest protest was met by about 100,000 counter-demonstrators nationwide, who accused PEGIDA of exploiting the French attacks, and who voiced support for a multicultural German society.
Merkel on Monday thanked leaders of Germany's four-million-strong Muslim community for quickly and clearly condemning the violence committed in the name of their faith in Paris.
"Germany wants peaceful coexistence of Muslims and members of other religions" and Tuesday's vigil would send "a very strong message", she said at a joint news conference with Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkish prime minister.
On Sunday, Merkel and Davutoglu joined French President Francois Hollande and other world leaders at a massive solidarity rally in Paris.
Announcing Tuesday's vigil, the Muslim Council and the Turkish Community of Berlin said: "We Muslims in Germany condemn the despicable terror attacks in France in the strongest terms. We want to express our solidarity with the French victims.
"There is no justification in Islam for such acts."
With their vigil, the Muslim group said, they "want to send a message for peace and tolerance, against hatred and violence and for a cosmopolitan Germany which respects and protects the freedom of expression and religion".
The statement said, with a view to the new rise in xenophobia expressed on German streets, that "those who voice racist and Islamophobic slogans strengthen the agitators, arsonists and terrorists".
PEGIDA, launched in October, has grown to set new attendance records week after week and spawned smaller copycat groups nationwide, provoking much soul-searching in a country haunted by its history of Nazi rule and the Holocaust.
The protests have been spurred by a sharp rise in refugees seeking political asylum in Germany, which has been struggling to house the newcomers in converted schools, office blocks and container villages.
Germany last year received more than 180,000 asylum applications, a 57-percent jump from 2013, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea and Somalia but also from several Balkan countries.
First of all, can I announce the winner of the digital downloads from Northern Whimsy? (It's my blog, sure I can! HA!) So‚Ä¶Alli Rutherford Smith, YOU are the winner!!! Congratulations to you!!! Shoot me an email at Kristen@theroadtodomestication.com and I'll get ya all set up!
And now‚Ä¶
I'll admit it. It's nothing you don't already know, so that makes it easier. I'm a clean freak.
Yes, it's true. But, believe it or not, I've actually gotten much more relaxed than I used to be! (You can stop laughing any time now.)
Still, there are some things that are very easy for me to obsess over. For instance: when I sit down on the couch at the end of the day and I've worked the full time job for 8 hours and then the part time for 2-3 more hours and then I'm trying to work on the blog until I fall asleep and I look up and see the filthiness that is the set of sliding glass doors that lead to the back porch‚Ä¶I get a little agitated. Suddenly I notice dirt everywhere, and then I feel the need to get up and clean and then I'm tired and overwhelmed‚Ä¶you get the idea.
I tossed this around in my head for a while: how do I spread out all the cleaning that needs to be done across a week so not one day is more loaded than any other? How about across a month? A year? Hmmm‚Ä¶
You may remember when I solved PART of that problem a few months ago with my Weekly Chore List Printable. (If you missed that post, no worries, just CLICK HERE and you can check it out‚Ä¶and still get that free printable!) So that was that, and it's been working pretty well so far. But I still needed to work on the cleaning items that needed to be accomplished once a month, or once a quarter, or once a year, even.
I searched Pinterest and Etsy and the blogosphere, looking for the type of printable I needed. Of course, when all else fails, I did what I always do: I made it myself.
So here's what I've done: I've really just made a few simple and pretty lists!
Weekly, Monthly, and I've split the year up into quarters:
(I obviously have the other quarters, as well, I just won't use the space to display them here!)
These are very simple, and they're simple on purpose. I already have an actual paper planner/calendar, and I also have my Outlook calendar at work, so the last thing I needed was one more calendar. I mean, come on! What I wanted was to be able to space things out easily in a clean format, so this is what I came up with!
Now, the cool thing is, you can use these for just about anything. Notice that none of them say anything about cleaning anywhere. So you can use these for any of your lists, really! I hope you find them helpful! And pretty! (Because even if I don't necessarily LOVE what I'm writing down, I'll like it a lot more if I can write it on something pretty! I'm such a GIRL like that!)
And, for those of you who are just plain NOSY (don't apologize, I'm right there with ya!), here are MINE!
Now you can see how I have everything spaced out! Have I forgotten anything? I sure hope not!
And now, for YOU!

Campus rape and the power of early sex education to make a difference
Rape is the most common violent crime on American college campuses. It is estimated that one in five women are sexually assaulted while in college. This deeply entrenched reality has a long history‚Äîas does activism to combat it.
‚ÄúStudent activists have been working to eradicate sexual violence from college campuses for decades,‚Äù said Tracey Vitchers, board chair of Students Active for Ending Rape (SAFER), a student-led advocacy organization that started at Columbia University in 2000. ‚ÄúWith the issue in the spotlight more than ever before thanks to modern media and social media, there is a heightened awareness of the issue.‚Äù
This heightened awareness, along with continued advocacy, has led to some legislative and policy advances, such as California's ‚ÄúYes Means Yes‚Äù law, passed last year, that mandates consent standards on campuses that receive state funding, and New York's ‚ÄúEnough Is Enough‚Äù law making affirmative consent a standard on all college campuses. On the federal level, last year the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault was established.
However, to enact real change across the board, not just on college campuses, many activists are making the case that outreach and education need to happen years before students even show up for their first day of freshman orientation.
‚ÄúTalking about sexual assault in college is too late,‚Äù said Annie Clark, cofounder of End Rape On Campus, a survivor advocacy organization. ‚ÄúAge-appropriate discussions about consent could start as early as kindergarten. But talking about sexual assault in this country is taboo because talking about sex is taboo.‚Äù
Even as sex education in public schools gained widespread support in the 1960s because of concerns about teen pregnancy, issues of consent and sexual violence were never central. But during the Reagan administration, a strong push for abstinence-only programs pushed even these programs to the sidelines. Including comprehensive sex education in public school curriculums has been a battle ever since.
‚ÄúFor decades, the only federal funding available was for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs,‚Äù explained Diana Rhodes, director of public policy at Advocates for Youth, an organization focused on adolescent reproductive and sexual health. Although President Obama has been able to expand funding beyond this narrow viewpoint, ‚Äúsex education policies vary widely, which means young people are being taught vastly different programs across the country. We have to teach about these topics early on (in secondary school) so by the time they are on college campuses, there is no question as to what consent looks like. Denying information about sex and relationships will mean more and more young people will be having unprotected sex and not understanding consent, violence, or healthy relationships.‚Äù
More than 10 percent of high school girls and 4 percent of boys report being forced to have sex, according to Answer, an organization that publishes teen-written sex education materials and has worked with public school districts and public health organizations around the country.
‚ÄúSexual assault is not just an issue on college campuses, and given that many young people do not attend college, we cannot wait until college to begin educating young people about consent, gender, and power,‚Äù said Nicole Cushman, executive director of Answer. ‚ÄúEducators have an imperative to incorporate discussions of sexual violence into their curricula. [They] and parents can start to have age-appropriate conversations with elementary students about gender, gender roles, and the impact gender roles have on people's ability to communicate and negotiate in friendships. This is the foundational knowledge young people need to later learn about healthy romantic relationships, consent, and sexual assault.‚Äù
Currently, 35 states and the District of Columbia require that public schools provide some form of sex education or information about HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. However, the quality and content of the lessons and curriculums differ not only from state to state, but even from classroom to classroom within the same school. Some public school students are receiving comprehensive sex education, including information about consent and dating violence. But most are not.
A new piece of legislation that was introduced earlier this year, the Teach Safe Relationships Act, aims to do something about this disparity. Introduced by Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), it requires the incorporation of lessons about consent into sex education curriculums in secondary schools. But even if it does pass, which seems unlikely with the current Congress, it would apply only in places that offer sex education. The bill grew out of a meeting between Kaine and student activists from One Less, a student sexual assault and education group at the University of Virginia, last December. Some of the students reported that they had never been taught about sexual assault before college orientation.
‚ÄúBy waiting, we ignore the realities that many victims are assaulted before college,‚Äù said Alison Safran of Surviving in Numbers, a sexual assault and domestic violence prevention nonprofit. ‚ÄúMany teens are having consensual sex before college, and by not talking about either of those things, we're perpetuating a culture that silences healthy sexuality and experiences of sexual violence. Combating it starts with talking about it openly and in a way that is survivor-informed and survivor-driven, instead of reiterating deeply embedded victim-blaming. It's not a lack of alertness, or a type of outfit, or walking alone that causes sexual violence, it's a perpetrator.‚Äù
Many organizations like Answer have already created and implemented sex education curriculums that incorporate information about consent. Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts developed Get Real, a comprehensive program targeted for middle-school students that emphasizes healthy relationships and family involvement, and has been used in close to 200 schools and youth programs in five states. ‚ÄúLearning how to ask for, give, and hear consent‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîare skills that need to be learned, and sexuality education provides the opportunity to do so,‚Äù said Jen Slonaker, vice president of education and training at PPLM.
Leslie Kantor, vice president of education at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, adds: ‚ÄúWe also need to talk about gender in sex education because part of the problem is in the gender script: boys and men are repeatedly given messages that they are always supposed to want sex and girls and women are never supposed to be interested in sex. That sets young people up for terrible dynamics when it comes to saying what they want and don't want. What we want as parents and educators is for young people to gain the skills to be able to have healthy relationships for their whole lives.‚Äù
If the recent focus and media gaze on the issue of rape on college campuses does contribute to increased comprehensive sex education, the benefits could last well past graduation.
‚ÄúIncreased visibility and attention about the prevalence of campus sexual assaults is really critical,‚Äù said Heather Boonstra, director of public policy at the Guttmacher Institute. ‚ÄúThe first step towards solving a problem is identifying it in the first place. Through these stories, we are learning how truly common an experience this is. Providing comprehensive sex education will not only better serve women in the long run, but will also help to make relationships between men and women more equal.‚Äù
The former parliamentary speaker, Peter Slipper, has taken the extraordinary step of making a costs application against the solicitors of the man who brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against him.
Mr Slipper applied to the Federal Court on Wednesday for Harmers Workplace Lawyers and James Ashby, the staffer who accused him of sexual harassment, to pay for the costs of his legal proceedings on an indemnity basis.
The costs awarded by the Federal Court usually amount to between 50 and 70 per cent of the actual proceedings, but costs awarded on an indemnity basis cover the whole cost, and are considered a punitive measure.
It would be rare for the Federal Court to award costs on an indemnity basis, but some lawyers read the judgment handed down by Justice Steve Rares last week as a coded suggestion for Mr Slipper to seek unusual orders.
Sources indicated that the fare hikes could be announced even before the railway budget. (Source: Express archive)
Six days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in Goa on the need to take ‚Äútough decisions‚Äù to revive the economy, the government on Friday approved a steep hike in the train fares and freight rates. Effective from June 25, fares of all classes are set to rise by 14.2 per cent, while the freight rates will go up by 6.5 per cent.
Advertising
Railway Minister Sadananda Gowda had sought the approval of Modi to roll out the ‚Äúunpopular move‚Äù barely a couple of weeks before the government's first rail budget. Gowda had also made a case for the hike to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley earlier this week.
As much as 4.2 per cent of the fare hike is on account of a variable Fuel Adjustment Component (FAC) approved in last year's rail budget. The remaining 10 per cent is a flat hike across all classes. Similarly, freight rates will have a five per cent hike flat over and above a 1.4 per cent of the FAC.
Railways had pressed Gowda to seek a subsidy from the government if it was ‚Äúpolitically inconvenient‚Äù at present to give a green signal to the hike.

It had become a political decision since the last government had prevented the proposal of this very hike to be rolled out on May 16, the day of the election results that brought in the regime change. But the problem before the railways was that the expected mop-up due from the hike ‚Äî around Rs 10,000 crore ‚Äî had already been factored into the interim rail budget passed in Parliament before elections.
It was understood within the railways that the hike would be automatic, and that was why the decision to effect the hike was announced without asking Railway Minister Mallikarjun Kharge on May 16 and then quickly withdrawn hours later following Kharge's objection.
‚ÄúI have merely withdrawn the earlier government's decision to withhold the fare revision on May 16,‚Äù Gowda told The Indian Express when contacted. ‚ÄúI am ready to face the brickbats.‚Äù
Railways' subsidy to passenger operations has touched Rs 26,000 crore and its ordinary working expenses have been mounting on account of fuel bill and salary. The two takeaway almost Rs 70 of every Rs 100 earned by the national transporter.
The opposition parties have slammed the move, saying it bypasses Parliament by not introducing the fare hike in the rail budget. The Congress tweeted a screenshot of a tweet by Modi, who as the Gujarat chief minister a year ago, had criticised the then Railway Minister Pawan Bansal's decision to hike fares after 16 years before the rail budget. ‚ÄúJust before rail budget UPA has suddenly increased railway freight rates bypassing Parliament. Wrote to PM against this,‚Äù Modi had tweeted on March 7, 2013.
‚ÄúAfter coming into government, without taking Parliament into confidence and without bringing out a white paper‚Ä¶ , they have gone ahead and increased rail tariffs by 14 per cent,‚Äù Congress leader Manish Tewari was quoted by PTI as saying.
‚ÄúThose who till yesterday were talking about ‚Äòaam aadmi' and how his concerns should be addressed, have now started doing the opposite by imposing as much burden as they can on the so-called ‚Äòaam aadmi' who voted them to power,‚Äù he said.
The Left parties slammed the Prime Minister for his ‚Äúreward‚Äù to the people. ‚ÄúWe strongly condemn the unprecedented hike in railway fare. This is going to be a huge burden on the people at a time when they are already battling relentless price rise,‚Äù CPM Politburo member Brinda Karat said. ‚ÄúIt is criminal. We demand its reversal.‚Äù

Trinamool Congress spokesman Derek O'Brien said: ‚ÄúIs this a super rail budget before the rail budget? The common man is already burdened, now he will be over-burdened.‚Äù
Caltrain is on the road closer to financial independence following the introduction of legislation Wednesday that would add a revenue source for the regional transit agency.
Senate Bill 797, authored by state Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo and Santa Clara), would allow the governance that oversees Caltrain to place a one-eighth-cent sales tax increase to fund the transit agency.
‚ÄúOur region is an economic powerhouse for our state, but its continued growth is jeopardized if our residents cannot get back and forth to work, school and their families because our main transportation corridor cannot accommodate them,‚Äù Hill said in a statement.
Caltrain's capital and operating budget relies on voluntary funding from the three counties that it serves: San Mateo, Santa Clara and San Francisco.
Boosting Caltrain ridership through additional funding is widely seen in transportation circles as a way to combat ever-slower congestion along U.S. Highway 101, which some see as a boon to local businesses along the Peninsula.
At this point, ‚ÄúHighway 101 has become so congested that we've changed its name to the ‚Äò101 Parking Lot,'‚Äù said Silicon Valley Leadership Group CEO Carl Guardino in a statement.
Though the measure offers a glimmer of hope for Caltrain to obtain more funding, the hurdle to place a sales tax on the ballot is high.
The authority overseeing Caltrain, the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, would need to pass a tax proposal by two-thirds vote, which would then go before transportation authority boards of San Mateo, Santa Clara and San Francisco for further approvals, followed by subsequent approval by the Board of Supervisors for each county. Only then would a sales tax go to the ballot, where it will require two-thirds voter approval.
The tax measure has wide support from politicians across the region, including co-authors state Sens. Jim Beall (D-San Jose), Bob Wieckowski (D-Fremont) and Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), and assemblymembers from San Jose, South San Francisco, Monterey and San Francisco.
‚ÄúThese funds are crucial to modernizing and improving our regional rail, which has been ignored and underfunded for decades,‚Äù said Wiener in a statement. ‚ÄúWe need to get serious about improving gridlock on our highways.‚Äù

Story highlights Israeli PM Netanyahu says the document shows there is "no moderation in Iran"
Iran's supreme leader Khamenei calls for Israel to be "annihilated"
He opposes a massacre of Jews, wants the West Bank "armed like Gaza"
Obama slams Iran's "anti-Israeli rhetoric and behavior"
A new document by Iran's supreme leader calling for the elimination of Israel shows that world powers must not rush into a deal on the country's nuclear program despite an upcoming deadline, Israel's Prime Minister said Monday.
"There is no moderation in Iran. It is unrepentant, unreformed, it calls for Israel's eradication, it promotes international terrorism," Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.
"This terrorist regime in Iran must not be allowed to become a nuclear threshold power. And I call on the P5+1 countries -- don't rush into a deal that would let Iran rush to the bomb." (The P5+1 refers to the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany.)
Iran insists it only wants nuclear energy. And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while calling for the elimination of Israel, said he opposes "a massacre of the Jewish people in this region."
Instead, he seeks a referendum. But in the meantime, "armed resistance is the cure," he says, calling for the West Bank to be "armed like Gaza."
The call reflects internal Palestinian politics as well. Iran supports Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Hamas' rival faction, Fatah, controls the West Bank. On Sunday, the government in the West Bank accused Hamas of bombing its leaders' homes.
Annihilation call made through Twitter
The Iranian leader made his call for Israel to be "annihilated" on Twitter over the weekend. Mixed in with tweets insisting that Iran is committed to diplomacy on other issues, Khamenei posted a series of tweets slamming Israel. Among them was a document called "9 key questions about elimination of Israel."
While he and other Iranian leaders have spoken similarly of Israel in the past, the one-page document, packed with specific details, was new.
It says the "proper way of eliminating Israel" is for "all the original people of Palestine including Muslims, Christians and Jews wherever they are, whether inside Palestine, in refugee camps in other countries or just anywhere else, take part in a public and organized referendum." The "Jewish immigrants who have been persuaded into emigration to Palestine do not have the right to take part," he adds.
It's unclear who Khamenei thinks the "original people of Palestine" are, given that the region's history dates back thousands of years and includes countless waves of immigration and exile.
A June poll by the Washington Institute found that most Palestinians in Gaza oppose a two-state solution and want to work toward abolishing Israel -- a goal that is in line with Hamas' charter. A July poll by the Dialog Institute found that most Israelis support a two-state solution, Haaretz reported
ISIS affects U.S.-Iran relations
U.S. President Barack Obama recently sent a letter to Khamenei about cooperating in the fight against ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. Revelations about the letter have raised questions over whether Obama's stance on Iran is softening.
U.S. officials insist Washington is not coordinating military actions with Tehran.
"There is some deconflicting, in the sense that since they have some troops or militias they control in and around Baghdad," Obama told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday. "We let them know, 'Don't mess with us. We're not here to mess with you.' We're focused on our common enemy. But there's no coordination or common battle plan. And there will not be."
"We still have big differences with Iran's behavior vis-a-vis our allies, them poking and prodding at -- and creating unrest and sponsoring terrorism in the region, around the world, their anti-Israeli rhetoric and behavior," Obama added. "So, that's a whole 'nother set of issues which prevents us from ever being true allies."
"Like all close friends, we talk honestly with one another. We talk directly with one another. We disagree with one another. We love one another, and we drive one another crazy," he said in a speech to the Jewish Federations of North America.
"We will not let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, period," he added.
The deadline for the current round of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 is November 24. Obama left it unclear Sunday whether a deal will be struck by then.
"The question now is: Are we going to be able to close this final gap, so that they can re-enter the international community, sanctions can be slowly reduced, and we have verifiable, lock-tight assurances that they can't develop a nuclear weapon? There's still a big gap. We may not be able to get there."
A year after the US Supreme Court's narrow 5-4 ruling redefining marriage, many of the elite in the Republican Party are anxious to declare ‚Äúthe marriage issue‚Äù settled. It's a common refrain from high-ranking Republicans: ‚Äúthe Supreme Court has spoken,‚Äù and the party should move on to other issues. The trouble for the echo chamber of corporate lobbyists, paid political consultants, wealthy donors, and media personalities who constantly push this narrative is that the actual Republican Party‚Äîthe tens of millions of Americans who vote in elections‚Äîdo not buy the refrain, and they regularly hold accountable those who do.
Anne Zerr is the latest example. A state house member in Missouri, Zerr was one of three Republicans who refused to support SJR 39, a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would protect supporters of marriage from being punished by government for refusing to be part of same-sex ‚Äúmarriage.‚Äù SJR 39 is essentially the Missouri version of the First Amendment Defense Act pending in Congress. Grassroots activists had pushed the measure through the state senate to protect the bakers, florists, photographers, innkeepers, and others who have been targeted in other states with lawsuits, fines, and financial and reputational ruin from facing a similar fate in Missouri. SJR 39 would have let voters decide the issue. But when LGBT activists and their allies in corporate America expressed their opposition, Zerr caved and helped kill the proposal.
Unfortunately for Anne Zerr, she then faced voters in a Republican primary race for an open state Senate seat. Social conservatives saw an opportunity to send a message to the echo chamber by opposing her. The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) funded mailers and phone calls targeting Zerr for her refusal to allow voters to protect supporters of marriage. And ordinary voters responded. NOM endorsed her main opponent, conservative businessman and devout Catholic Bill Eigel, who supported SJR 39. On August 2nd, Eigel defeated Zerr in the Republican primary.
Zerr is not the first Republican to pay with her career for following the urgings of the elite to abandon marriage. She is just the latest.
It's rarely covered by the media, but the political landscape is littered with the wrecked careers of Republicans who abandoned the party's commitment to marriage as it has always existed, which is a foundational institution of virtually every faith tradition on the planet.
New York enacted same-sex marriage only because four Republicans in the state senate listened to the political elite and wealthy donors and voted against their party platform and the wishes of their constituents. They were promised, and received, big-time fundraising help from Governor Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Wall Street billionaires. But none of that mattered. Conservatives and marriage supporters like NOM focused voters on their betrayal. An unprecedented coalition of people with diverse beliefs and backgrounds came together to hold these legislators accountable‚Äîincluding African American and Hispanic clergy, the orthodox Jewish community, New York's Conservative Party, and longtime GOP activists. Today, all four Republicans who for voted for gay ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù are now former senators. Despite all of the Wall Street money, grassroots activists were able to spread the word about the betrayal these four senators committed‚Äîand the voters responded.
This phenomenon is not limited to state legislative races. In 2014, two prominent gay Republicans were recruited by GOP leaders in Washington to run for congressional seats in California (Carl DeMaio) and Massachusetts (Richard Tisei). Both made support for gay ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù a prominent feature in their election campaigns. As a result, social conservatives opposed them both, some going so far as to endorse their Democratic opponents on the theory that the lesser of two evils was to have a bad Democrat serve for two years rather than a bad Republican serve for decades. DeMaio and Tisei each raised millions, but both were defeated.
A similar thing has happened in races for the US Senate. In California, Republican Tom Campbell, a former state legislator and member of Congress, came out in support of redefining marriage. Social conservatives funded TV ads against him, and he lost a competitive GOP US Senate primary as a result. The same thing happened in New Hampshire, when NOM funded an ad campaign against wealthy businessman Bill Binnie, who thought gay ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù was his ticket to the US Senate. Binnie was defeated. This past cycle, Monica Wehby was the Republican nominee for US Senate in Oregon and promptly aired a TV commercial announcing her support for redefining marriage. Conservatives responded by openly opposing her, and Wehby was trounced.
Meanwhile, US Senate candidates in competitive races who stood firm in their support for marriage‚Äîoften against the wishes of corporate interests and the consulting class‚Äîwere rewarded. Tom Cotton in Arkansas and Thom Tillis in North Carolina both benefited from independent expenditure campaigns from groups like NOM in winning their elections.
Lest you conclude that this is a battle between social conservative money and corporate money, it's not primarily the money that matters. Social conservatives are always outspent by the corporate interests, and often badly. What matters is the support of the voters. Once they are alerted to where the candidates stand, they respond. A modest degree of spending by social conservatives produces an outsized response because voters deeply care about the issue.
It's not only partisan candidates who have seen this effect. In Iowa, three sitting members of the state supreme court, including its chief justice, were removed from the bench by voters furious with their ruling imposing gay ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù in that state. An aggressive campaign opposing their judicial retention was mounted by social conservatives to alert voters to their judicial misdeeds.
It should be acknowledged that these races often involve more than the marriage issue. There is usually a range of issues at play in any contested race, whether for the state legislature or Congress. But unquestionably, marriage was a critical issue in all of these contests. Marriage was the issue that drove conservatives to oppose and ultimately defeat incumbents like Anne Zerr in Missouri.
Finally, it is also important to note the importance that support for marriage played most recently in the GOP when grassroots Republican activists made their views clear in crafting the national Republican Party platform last month in Cleveland. Despite an organized and well-funded campaign by Wall Street billionaires and corporate lobbyists to ‚Äúmodernize‚Äù the party's official position on marriage, convention delegates utterly rejected the notion. The 2016 GOP platform is the most pro-traditional marriage platform ever adopted. It specifically calls for reversing the Obergefell ruling redefining marriage. It explicitly condemns as the product of activist judges the rulings on marriage in both Obergefell and the Windsor case that overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act, and it calls for the appointment of Supreme Court justices who will reject their reasoning. It endorses the First Amendment Defense Act to protect supporters of marriage from governmental persecution. And it calls for a constitutional amendment to return to the states their right to define marriage solely as the union of one man and one woman.
Never fans of social issues to begin with, it's a safe bet that the consulting class, corporate lobbyists, and wealthy donors will ignore the mountain of evidence all around them that rank and file Republican activists and voters revere marriage and will act to defend it. But Republican candidates should come to understand that succumbing to the pleadings of the elite echo chamber can come at a very high price: their very political careers.
Today across the blogosphere Ada Lovelace will be honoured by writing about her and other remarkable women in technology. But today I prefer to appeal to and for the unremarkable.At the day job we've been hiring people continuously for a year for programming jobs. My entire team of 12 is all men, and in the last 12 months we've interviewed two women. Looking into all the candidates who've sent in an application, men overwhelm women with a ratio of 24:1. Even if we just hired people randomnly the chance of hiring a woman would be tiny.I find this situation tragic. We've hired with blindness to the age of our employees or their backgrounds. In a team of 12 there are people who hail from Mexico, Northern Ireland, Greece (via Canada), and Poland. But not a single woman.And yet I've known women who love these implacable machines as much as I. I've talked to women programmers about the deepest guts of computers, about algorithms and problems to be solved. Many of those women have recognized something that people outside the industry overlook: much of computer programming is a craft.The people who made the smart phone in your hand, or built the system that waits patiently in your car for an accident to happen so it can fire the airbags in the right order, or made your web-based email and your music player, or built the software on the Voyager 1 spacecraft that keeps it looking longingly back at Earth as it leaves our grasp: those people are incredibly creative.They have made beautiful things: beautiful things that everybody sees, and beautiful computer structures hidden out of sight but playing a part in all of our lives. They have struggled against constraints of time, space and resources, and they have. Although software may seem ephemeral because it has no physical form, these people, men and women, have sculpted electricity to form numbers to form programs and make software that touches the physical world.So, my appeal when thinking about Ada Lovelace is to all the women who, like me, will never be a world famous genius, who will never look like computer engineer Barbie , but, like the men I've worked with in the computer industry, love what they do. Don't think that computers are just for men to program and debug, but come place your fingers on a keyboard and share with me the joy of making.And, perhaps, one day, I won't remark a woman in a team of computer programmers, because she'll be unremarkable. Or at least I'll only remark her because she's remarkable for her ability, not her missing Y.

Media playback is not supported on this device Liverpool Ladies clinch Super League title
England and Lincoln Ladies captain Casey Stoney is writing a regular column for the BBC Sport website this season.
Here she talks about Liverpool's WSL triumph and what it means for the women's game.
Liverpool's victory over Bristol Academy in the Women's Super League title decider on Sunday signalled a real power shift in the women's game and it's set a new level that other teams will now have to match.
Their first league title underlines what real investment in a women's team can achieve.
All about Casey Stoney Born: 13 May 1982, London
Captain and centre-back at Lincoln Ladies
Former clubs: Arsenal, Charlton, Chelsea
England skippers with 115 caps
Considered international retirement after not playing at Euro 2005 in England
Says she often gets confused on Twitter with former MotoGP rider Casey Stoner Twitter: @caseystoney
Liverpool were bottom of the WSL table last season and although they signed a whole team and were able to train five times a week it is still a wonderful achievement by manager Matt Beard to make everything gel in the first year.
In my view, they deserve to win the title as they have been the most consistent side this season and it shows you that if other teams want to compete with Liverpool, they have to match their commitment.
Other teams, including former champions Arsenal, still train only two to three times a week but I believe Liverpool's move to a full-time schedule has made a telling difference.
Unless other clubs can follow suit, Liverpool will start as favourites for next season's title. They are only going to improve and clubs that don't keep up with them will go backwards.
This season has been a great stride forward for the women's game; domestically the league has never been more competitive and you have to compete for every single point. It's an exciting time.
But if the England team is to compete at international level we have to get to point where all our top-flight clubs are full-time. My hope is that happens within five years.
The introduction of a second tier next season should add to the league's competitiveness while offering the chance for players at other clubs to develop in a more professional environment.
And although our poor European Championship was a blip, we need to keep moving forward to stay in touch with our international rivals and avoid becoming complacent.
England back on song
England's victories over Belarus and Turkey put the Euro 2013 nightmare well behind us and while were expected to win both games, I was pleased we didn't drop our standards because of that.
Scoring 14 goals and conceding none was fantastic, and you could tell that the girls were bursting to make an impression after Sweden and in front of new manager Brent Hills.

Brent was very relaxed, and enjoyed himself because being the manager is something he has always wanted to do.
He has already declared he wants the job on a full-time basis but it is not for me to say whether he has enhanced his chances. Picking the new manager is not something the players can control.
All I will say is that the new manager should be the best person for the job, male or female. I'm excited about a new coach but also anxious because I don't know where my future lies with England.
The new boss might have difference ideas and although I've been picked for England over the last 13 years, who's to say the new person will think the same?
Time to take take stock at Lincoln
At my club, Lincoln Ladies, it has been a disappointing season, finishing third from bottom in the WSL.

We are due to move the club to Nottingham next season and become Notts County Ladies so we are desperate to win some silverware when we take on Arsenal in the Continental Cup final on Friday.
Winning a trophy would be the perfect send-off for everyone involved in the club since it formed in 1995. It would also represent my first cup since 2006, which has been far too long.
After the final I will sit down with the club to discuss their ambitions for the future because it is clear this season has not been good enough.
We need to sign new players and train more often if we are to improve and with my contract up, I want to make sure that the club's targets are the same as mine.
I came here to win things but it hasn't been that way for the last three years so things need to change a little bit if we are to succeed.
Risks and challenges
Our Shield face mask has been a vision of ours for over a year. We have taken a lot of time to prototype and test multiple models and designs before presenting the one that we thought was the best of the bunch. In our prototyping stages, we established trusting relationships with our manufacturers, who have assured us that they can deliver us a quality product in a timely manner.
As with any new venture, we may encounter a few hiccups along the way.
QUALITY
We have been very specific in our communications with our manufacturer regarding our expectations of quality. They also have our designs in hand, along with samples of the exact material we intend to use. However, because our manufacturers are not local, it is difficult to oversee the production of our face masks to inspect the quality. That being said, our manufacturer has promised to deliver us a sample before moving forward to mass production. If that sample does not meet our expectations of quality, our manufacturer has agreed to adjust the process as we see fit. Our main goal is to make sure that we deliver a product that we are proud of.
DELIVERY
If we reach our startup goal, we hope to approve our designs immediately so that we may begin manufacturing as quickly as possible. Our hope is to be able to deliver our products to our backers before the 2015-2016 ski season. That being said, our timeline is dependent upon the efficiency of our manufacturer. As stated above, if we do not approve the quality of our production sample, there will be a small delay in delivery time. Based on our relationship with our manufacturers, we are confident that they can deliver us a product that meets our vision, but we cannot guarantee that they will be shipped before the 2015-2016 ski season.
MANUFACTURING TIME
Our manufacturers have assured us that they can complete our initial order of face masks in one month. That being said, they may encounter their own hiccups along the way, like equipment malfunctions etc. Even so, this does not sway us from producing our face masks, it will simply delay the process. Again, we have been in communication with our manufacturers for over a year and we are confident in their credibility and the quality of their products.
Recently appointed acting fire chief Gerry Mahoney gives off a palpable love of Cambridge.
ItÔøΩs not just the way in which he gushes about his firefighters or how he seems to blend in with the backdrop of the iconic fire headquarters on Broadway.
His love extends beyond those walls to the citizens, city officials, higher education institutions, area hospitals, neighboring fire departments, his three daughters, wife, parents and grandfather ÔøΩ all subjects he touched upon during a recent interview with the Chronicle.
Mahoney, 57, speaks fluidly, confidently and openly. He speaks as though he has waited his whole life for this moment. And the truth is, he has.
MahoneyÔøΩs grandfather, Jeremiah F. Mahoney, was a Cambridge police officer. His father, Paul F. Mahoney Sr., was a Cambridge firefighter from 1948 to 1955, before becoming a schoolteacher and then an elementary principal.
Following in his fatherÔøΩs footsteps, Mahoney was appointed to the Cambridge Fire Department on March 6, 1983. Thirty-four years to the day later, he would stand in Sullivan Chambers at City Hall to be sworn in as the acting fire chief.
ÔøΩIÔøΩve been very blessed. My only regret about the whole thing is that my dad wasnÔøΩt there to see it,ÔøΩ Mahoney, whose father passed away in 2006, told the Chronicle a few days after the ceremony. ÔøΩI know how much it would have meant to him.ÔøΩ
MahoneyÔøΩno longer lives in Cambridge (his reasoning: ÔøΩI married a girl from Medford"), but his 95-year-old mother still lives on Lexington Avenue in an apartment thatÔøΩs been in his family since 1926 and where she and Mahoney's father started off as newlyweds in 1949.
We sat down with Mahoney to talk about his personal and professional history, his visions for the department ÔøΩ what he hopes to improve upon and what it was like working with recently retired fire chief Gerry Reardon ÔøΩ the safety of the citizens and the departmentÔøΩs personnel, and what he likes to do in his downtime (when he has it).
How did you find out you were going to be appointed acting fire chief? Is it something you had sought out or do you think you were just the natural next selection?
Chief Reardon retired Saturday, March 4, and I was approached by City Manager Louis DePasquale and asked if I would be interested in serving as the acting fire chief. I told him it would be a honor and a privilege. I had made it be known in the past in general conversation that IÔøΩd be interested in becoming the fire chief when Reardon retired.
So youÔøΩre hoping itÔøΩll be a permanent position.
Yes, I am.
What was it like working with Reardon all these years?
I actually knew him before I got on the Fire Department. We worked together as firefighters for about eight or nine months. Gerry has a tremendous wealth of knowledge. HeÔøΩs a leader ÔøΩ not only locally, but nationally ÔøΩ when it comes to emergency communications. He has been a real leader for this department. The goal of every fire chief I think in every community, no matter how large or small, is to leave the department somewhat better than you found it. Not that you inherited something bad from the previous chief, but you obviously want to make things better, as in any line of work.
And how did Reardon leave the department better?
He did that through tremendous equipment purchases. ItÔøΩs not an exaggeration to say our fire apparatus is the envy of most departments around here. We have reserve or spare fire apparatus that is in better shape than front-line apparatus in some communities.
Gerry will be the first to tell you, he was complimented by both city councilors and the executives ÔøΩ Bob Healy, Rich Rossi and Louis ÔøΩ in wanting to work in a cooperative partnership to make the Fire Department better. A fire chief canÔøΩt just snap his or her fingers and say, ÔøΩIÔøΩll buy this or that,ÔøΩ you have to have the backing of City Hall. His legacy I think will be the apparatus, the equipment. We have two marine units. We joked for years the only thing he never got was a helicopter.
He always did what he thought was best for the personnel and the community.
How do you hope to grow the department?
One of my ideas is that IÔøΩd like to see more community engagement. We do community engagement, but we want to improve upon it. You have to sell yourself in this day and age, and I think itÔøΩs even more so apparent now.
Also, we have eight fire stations in this city. [Fire headquarters on Broadway] was built in 1934. The firefighters are using the same lockers my father used in 1948; that needs to be improved upon. While weÔøΩve had tremendous equipment, apparatus and personal protective equipment, our firehouses have suffered somewhat.
A fire chiefÔøΩs No. 1 concern is the safety of the public and his or her personnel that work alongside him. My firefighters are No.1 in my book. That being said, we need to improve upon the living conditions of the firehouses. This Broadway firehouse was built in 1934; this is the second newest firehouse in the city. The newest firehouse in the city is in East Cambridge (Engine 3), which was opened in 1976.
The other thing we do need is a dedicated training facility. ItÔøΩs difficult in a built-up urban environment. The city of BostonÔøΩs Fire Department, their training facility is out on Moon Island. You have to travel through Quincy to get out there.
Where are the CFD training facilities?
Our classroom is located [at the East Cambridge station], and we are fortunate enough to use the classroom at ProEMS particularly if itÔøΩs medical-related training. But we have no place to do hose and ladder evolutions. We donÔøΩt really have a place to do training evolutions and we need that.
What about firefighter safety and health?
I think the Boston Fire Department, Commissioner Finn and the Boston Firefighters Union should be commended for the joint efforts theyÔøΩve put in for the health and safety of their firefighters. IÔøΩd like us to do something similar.
WeÔøΩve been fortunate; we havenÔøΩt had the high incidence of cancer they have, but weÔøΩve had it and one case is too many in my opinion. Part of that is education. Firefighters for years back in the day wouldnÔøΩt wear their breathing apparatus. TheyÔøΩd come out of a smoky fire and the first thing theyÔøΩd do is fish in their coat pocket for a pack of cigarettes. Those days are over, a firefighter and police officer hired after Jan. 1, 1988, is not allowed to smoke tobacco products on or off duty. ThatÔøΩs state law. Absolutely.
Firefighters tend to, when the smoke clears, take the mask off, and unfortunately thatÔøΩs one of the most dangerous times because you still have high carbon-monoxide levels, thereÔøΩs off-gassing going on and many of these carcinogens are colorless, odorless and tasteless.
The old clichÔøΩ, 0-60, this is a line of work where it happens. Similar to law enforcement and EMS, firefighters could be in a very sedentary position and then the alarm sounds and within minutes itÔøΩs a building fire, itÔøΩs people trapped, itÔøΩs people screaming, itÔøΩs go, go, go, go, go and thatÔøΩs not good for the heart.
Why do you think the Boston Fire Department has more cases of cancer than Cambridge?
I think part of it is higher [number of] fire incidents in Boston, but we have had cases. The cancer presumption law for firefighters covers seven forms, but basically any cancer: melanoma, leukemia, prostate, lung.
I havenÔøΩt been able to dig down into the data that would indicate percentage-wise that theyÔøΩve had higher incidence. So IÔøΩm not certain what the percentage data shows. We have roughly 275-280 personnel, while Boston may be around 1,400 firefighters. Maybe weÔøΩre not so far off in terms of percentages.
WeÔøΩve had huge resources to tap into ÔøΩ Harvard Medical, Dana-Farber, the two foremost institutions of higher learning in the world in our backyard. IÔøΩm hoping we can tap them as a resource for a whole bunch of issues that concern the CFD.
Is there anything youÔøΩd like to do differently from Reardon?
I always told my daughters growing up if we all thought and acted alike the world would be a very boring place. While I have tremendous admiration for Gerry, and everything he did during his tenure as chief, there are things that I would probably do a little different.
Our fire apparatus ÔøΩ and his hands were tied somewhat by this ÔøΩ I think we can do something about downsizing the size of some of our apparatus.
One of the things that constrains us somewhat is that so many of our firehouses are old, the architecture is old and we canÔøΩt alter because of historical designation. So you see these beautiful, brick arched doorways, yet these firehouses were built for horse-drawn apparatus. WeÔøΩre now putting large, heavy-duty, diesel apparatus in these, so I want to do something about the size of the apparatus.
What do you find most rewarding about working all these years in the fire department?
In all honesty, in my 34 years in this line of work, the most rewarding times are when you can help somebody, that can be a citizen and, now in my role as acting chief, helping my firefighters whether helping them with an issue theyÔøΩre dealing with or encouraging them to advance through the ranks, helping them get to a solution, encouraging them to pursue education outside the Fire Department or advance their skill set whether itÔøΩs attending trainings at the state fire academy, becoming an EMT, a paramedic.
This city has been extremely good to me and my family for many generations. As I said, my 95-year-old mother still lives in this city. And I just want to help the citizens of Cambridge and the people who run the city, to know they have somebody effective and caring running the Fire Department.
What do you do on your downtime, if you ever have any?
I like to read. And my wife and I, now that the kids are older, we like to travel. We actually just returned a few weeks ago. We went to Aruba for a week. I joke because it was like Cambridge Fire Department South. It was our first visit, but a tremendous amount of retirees from this department own timeshare in Aruba. So we had a lot of fun. It was great.
IÔøΩm currently reading William ManchesterÔøΩs fabulous biography on Douglas MacArthur. I also like true crime stuff. I read James Patterson, John Grisham. ItÔøΩs interesting because when I was younger with my dad being an educator he was always pushing me to read and I hated reading as a kid, and now I love to read.
My family has had a home on the Cape since I was 5 years old. IÔøΩve been very fortunate to spend almost my entire summer as a kid on the Cape.
YouÔøΩve had a good go it sounds like.
IÔøΩve been very fortunate. IÔøΩve been very blessed. My only thing, I commented on it during the brief ceremony the other day at City Council chambers, I said my only regret about the whole thing is that my dad wasnÔøΩt there to see it. I know how much it would have meant to him, especially having served on the Fire Department.
Over the course of a season, all teams are faced with players lost to injury, players shipped out and added, and the typical ups and downs. In the end, only the strong survive while the rest are left wondering what might have been. With just a handful of games remaining on the schedule, the 2016 Sacramento Republic FC appear to be one of the teams that has survived.
And let's be honest. It wasn't that long ago that few believed that the Republic would be in the position they are today sitting on top of the USL Western Conference Table with 44 points. The club was struggling to score goals, there were all these new faces, fan-favorite Tommy Stewart was released, and Emrah Klimenta went down with a season-ending knee injury.
Yet here the Republic are playing some of the most inspired soccer they've played all year at the most critical juncture of the season. So how have they been able to do it? Well, Cameron Iwasa has had a breakout year for the Republic leading the team with 11 goals (tied for fourth in the USL), Danny Barrea has been a force all over the field setting up teammate after teammate (team-high eight assists), and defensively they have been solid, to name a few. But behind it all, it's second-year manager Paul Buckle who has quietly done an exceptional job pulling it all together.
Buckle, with Director of Football Graham Smith, have been able to bring in quality players to the Republic and quickly unite new and existing players to buy into his system. The players believe in one another, play unselfishly and guinnuely like one another. Buckle deserves loads of credit for creating this dynamic and has proven he's exactly what the Republic needed when they signed him mid-season last year following the departure of Preki.
I asked Buckle following the Republic's 0-0 draw versus the visiting third place Vancouver Whitecaps FC 2 last Saturday night how in the face of so much change, the team has been able to rise above it all and be sitting on top of the standings.
‚ÄúBelief‚Ä¶belief in what we're doing at the Club,‚Äù said Buckle. ‚ÄúAt the end of last season, we lost players and we allowed players to move on because it's Club policy. If a player can get a higher caliber of football, we've allowed it. So, we can all be proud of the way we've glued it together. We've brought in people like Chris Christian in and [Mike] da Fonte when we lost the two center [backs]. I'm very pleased and believe our recruitment was right. Letting Tommy Stewart go I believe was correct. It was nothing against Tom. I loved him as a player. Sometimes you have to allow players to move on to allow other players to come through. Cameron Iwasa now is the one [who has benefited from Stewart moving on], where as before he was sort of in the background. I don't think we've got any superstar players, [but] I think we've put together a team that is very functional, very much together as a group, fights to the very end, and is also now showing great quality. Graham must take a lot of credit for recruitment‚Ä¶he puts a lot of players in front of me and the policy has been to not allow anyone into the Club that doesn't share our core values, which is being a good person and working hard.‚Äù
In typical Buckle fashion (at least since I've been covering him), he took the opportunity to answer the question by praising the players, Graham and the organization, but not really himself. You might be thinking‚Ä¶well, of course he did. That's what a coach should do. But I believe Buckle goes out of his way to not be the one taking the credit. It's what makes him so effective in my opinion and epitomizes everything you want in a leader.
I'm not going to say Buckle has come a long way, because that's simply not accurate or fair. I do believe though when he arrived in Sacramento (especially because it came in mid-season), Buckle and his style of play was immediately compared to Preki, whose up-tempo style of play and Championship season set the bar high. When goals weren't immediately flying into the back of the net under Buckle and fan favorites were being moved, fans and media started to question the identity of the Republic under his tenure. I think that bell has been answered soundly.
The bottom line is this. The Republic may be a better overall team now than they were during their 2014 Championship season. Whether that translates into a deep playoff run is yet to be determined, but with Buckle at the helm, the horizon looks bright now and into the future.

One of Jan Struther's popular stories of the 1930s included the following passage:
She saw every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles. It would seem at first glance that the more they overlapped the better the relationship; but this is not so. Beyond a certain point the law of diminishing returns sets in, and there are not enough private resources left on either side to enrich the life that is shared. Probably perfection is reached when the area of the two outer crescents, added together, is exactly equal to that of the leaf-shaped piece in the middle. On paper there must be some neat mathematical formula for arriving at this; in life, none.
Interestingly, mathematicians who pursued the problem found that no precise solution is possible. With circles, as with relationships, we have to do the best we can.
Rob Zombie's latest horror film ‚Äú31,‚Äù which got a limited theatrical release last month, is arriving as an exclusive on the subscription horror streaming service Shudder in December. It's one of 60 titles that Shudder is adding next month as the service aims to establish itself as a darker and scarier alternative to Netflix.
‚Äú31‚Äù is the story of five carnival workers that find themselves kidnapped and subjected to a sadistic game that pits them in a last-man-standing type fight against a horde of killer clowns. The movie first premiered at Sundance earlier this year, where it received mixed reviews.
Here's a trailer for the movie:
Some of the other titles included in Shudder's December catalog refresh include John Carpenter's ‚ÄúThe Fog,‚Äù Michael Powell's ‚ÄúPeeping Tom‚Äù and David Cronenberg's
‚ÄúDead Ringers.‚Äù Most of the movies added to the service in December are not available on any other streaming service.
Shudder, which is run by AMC Networks, launched in beta last summer. The service is available on the web as well as on mobile devices and on Roku streaming devices, and costs consumers $4.99 per month. Shudder is also available through Amazon Channels, the subscription video services platform operated by Amazon, as well as Ellation's recently-launched video subscription bundle VRV.
December Update! [Pugmire]
Pugmire
As the year winds down, it's time for the last Pugmire update of 2016!
PUGMIRE MANUSCRIPT
All of the relevant playtest comments were reviewed and incorporated into the final edit of the manuscript. I tweaked a few last-minute things that bugged me, and now it's all in the hands of the art director, Mike Chaney. He's reached out to some artists, and I believe sketches are coming in (at least, files are appearing in my Dropbox folder). There's a lot of art to hire out, and I can't wait to see it all!
MONARCHIES OF MAU
A lot of my focus has been thinking through some elements of designing Mau, as well as doing research on cats and how people relate to cats beyond my own experiences. From there I used the backer-offered cat characters as a springboard to make what I call the ‚Äúiconic‚Äù characters of the setting, which represent the various ideas and concepts I want to explore. Now I've got a few chapters done, and I'm in the weeds of making new tricks (which I'm considering renaming into ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù to feel more cat-like). The tricky part right now is finding what areas I can change to offer a new experience, while also making sure that Mau and Pugmire characters can easily play together in the same chronicle.
FICTION ANTHOLOGY
Jim and I are at the ‚Äútrading regular emails‚Äù stage of things. He's getting pitches from interested writers, and I'm compiling a master world document based on Pugmire, Mau, and some other things stuck in my head (like the secrets of the world that I don't want to print but I need writers to know so they don't inadvertantly reveal them). I'm expecting to see first drafts in a few months!
PAN'S GUIDE
The outlining phase is taking a bit longer than expected, mainly because Matt and I have some ideas on how we can push the envelope, but we need to do some tests to make sure those ideas actually work in practice. Right now Mike Chaney is doing a quick test layout of some example text to see if we can structure the manuscript the right way.
EARPLAY
Dave and I are trading notes on the chapter outlines, and things are shaping up nicely. His experience has been immensely helpful in making sure the story strikes the right balance of fun and compelling from an interactive standpoint. The working title for it is ‚ÄúFriends and Enemies,‚Äù and I'm hoping to spend this month nailing down the script.
MIDWINTER GAMING CONVENTION
As a reminder, a good chunk of the Onyx Path crew will be heading out to Milwaukee January 12th ‚Äì 15th for Midwinter Gaming Convention. You can find more information at http://www.midwintergamingconvention.com/.
There will be a ton of Pugmire things there. The Wrecking Crew will be running games of Pugmire, and I'll host the first-ever session of Monarchies of Mau. I'll also be testing out some (yes, more than one) prototypes of Pugmire-themed card games I've been working on. On top of that, my friends at Earplay are also coming out, and we'll have some cool stuff to show you. Midwinter is certainly turning into a great place to try out the very latest Pugmire projects!
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
And with that, I'm heading back to work ‚Äî there's a lot to do, and December's always rough to coordinate with people with the holidays around the corner.
While the headlines are dominated by White House leaks and personnel scandals, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have been quietly helping the financial industry siphon off your retirement savings. First, the administration announced that it was reviewing a rule scheduled to take effect in April requiring financial advisors to work in their clients' best interests. Yes, you read that correctly. Some people presenting themselves as financial advisors can now legally steer you to rip-off investments, a glaring problem the Obama administration addressed in a commonsense rule six long years in the making.
The rule, backed by the Consumer Federation of America, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Vanguard founder John Bogle, and others, applies to brokers, plan consultants, and others advising participants in 401(k)-style plans and IRAs who don't already adhere to a fiduciary standard. Among other things, it prohibits financial professionals from pretending to offer disinterested retirement advice while working on commission and from steering retirement savers to higher-cost investments when similar but lower-cost options are available. Importantly, the rule protects job-leavers from being lured into rolling over their pensions and 401(k)s into higher-cost IRAs, at a time in their life when many people are vulnerable to bad advice.
How can anyone argue against the fiduciary rule with a straight face? The financial services industry counters that if some clients don't get bad advice, they may not be able to afford advice at all. This is like dietitians arguing that clients may not be able to afford nutritional advice if it's not paid for by Coca-Cola. The industry also says the rule could put some people out of business, which isn't reason to oppose it‚Äîit goes without saying that we shouldn't prop up a business model where survival is dependent on fleecing savers.
So far, three federal courts have turned back challenges to the rule‚Äîmost recently in Texas. But the effort the financial industry has expended to fight the rule tells you how much some players have to lose when it goes into effect‚Äîan estimated $17‚Äì20 billion a year. This suggests that roughly a quarter of taxpayer subsidies intended to promote saving in 401(k)s and IRAs are pocketed by firms engaging in sleazy practices.
The fiduciary rule stops short of requiring plans to offer the lowest-cost investments, such as index funds or no-load annuities, though companies offering low-cost funds and annuities are expected to benefit from the rule. The rule is also expected to favor certified financial planners and other advisors who already adhere to a fiduciary standard but have been undercut by salesmen masquerading as advisors.
The rule doesn't prevent plan sponsors and others from providing educational materials with generic advice about how much to save and the importance of diversifying across asset classes, which is all most people really need. There's a remarkable consensus in the academic literature that individual investors would be better off adopting passive investment strategies, such as investing in index funds, rather than trying to beat the market. The idea has finally caught on, and over the past decade money has poured out of actively-managed funds and into passively-managed funds.
Despite this, many 401(k) plans are still loaded with high-cost investment options. This is because plan sponsors have little incentive to focus on fees passed on to participants‚Äîand may even benefit if financial providers sweeten the deal by discounting other services. This explains why Republicans in Congress are trying to repeal another Obama administration rule that helps state and local governments establish IRAs that workers can contribute to through automatic payroll deduction. These initiatives specifically target workers whose employers don't offer retirement plans and so would actually expand the pool of savings managed by the financial services industry. But they pose a threat to the mutual fund industry insofar as they demonstrate the cost advantages of passive investing and pooled savings.
Congress may vote as early as today on federal legislation that creates potential roadblocks for five states poised to implement retirement plans and other states considering similar initiatives. The legislation, backed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, takes aim at an Obama administration rule clarifying that state- or city-administered IRAs don't fall under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act governing employer plans. Overturning the rule wouldn't mean state and local governments couldn't move forward with the plans‚ÄîCalifornia plans to enroll workers next year regardless‚Äîbut could cloud their legal status.
The legislation, which will be voted on without a public hearing, belies Republicans' claim to respect states' rights. The sponsors falsely claim that the initiatives ‚Äúforce‚Äù workers into government-run plans without consumer protections, even though participation is 100 percent voluntary and the plans will have much less expensive investment options than most 401(k)s. David John, who coauthored an influential paper in favor of auto-enrolling workers in IRAs when he was at the conservative Heritage Foundation, has done a good job debunking other false claims with his AARP colleague Angela Antonelli. But with billions of dollars of fees at stake, it's probably safe to assume that the financial industry‚Äîand the members of Congress who support them‚Äîwill keep finding reasons to oppose state initiatives and commonsense consumer protections.

Jeb Bush on gun violence: 'Stuff happens'
A day after a massacre on a U.S. college campus, Jeb Bush said "stuff happens" but that does not mean gun restrictions should be tightened.
"We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's very bad to see," the former Florida governor said. Then he added: "Look, stuff happens and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do."
Story Continued Below
His comments came during an appearance in Greenville, South Carolina where the 2016 candidate was discussing gun control and urging caution before pushing new laws and regulations. He first said that in Florida "we believe that concealed weapons permits is a proper thing."
"All sorts of rules that are appropriate for Florida may not be appropriate for other places but the basic right is embedded and it's a personal right to bear arms but that shouldn't be infringed," he said.
Bush also said the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, that left nine dead and seven injured was "just heartbreaking."
Bush, in a question-and-answer session with reporters after he made the comments, said he was referring to tragedies in general, not specifically gun violence or the Oregon shooting. He also said states should look at gun laws to make it harder for the mentally ill to have access to weapons.
The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza asked if Bush made a mistake with the phrasing.
"No, it wasn't a mistake, I said exactly what I said. Why would you explain to me what I said wrong?" Bush said.
Lizza responded, "Well you said 'stuff happens.'"
"'Things' happen all the time. 'Things,' is that better?" Bush said.
"A child drowns in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools," Bush said. "Well it may not change it or you have a car accident and the impulse is to pass a law that deals with that unique event and the cumulative effect of this is in some cases, you don't solve the problem by passing the law, and you're imposing on large numbers of people, burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder for people to protect liberty, and that is, the whole conversation today was exactly about that."
Later on Friday, the Bush campaign blasted what they called liberals' unwarranted criticism of the former Florida governor's comments. ‚ÄúIt is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush's comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. Taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy is wrong and only serves to prey on people's emotions,‚Äù said Allie Brandenburger, a Bush spokewoman, in a statement.
Asked to react to Bush's comment, President Barack Obama was blunt.
"I don't even think I have to react to that one, I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting,‚Äù Obama said at a press conference Friday afternoon. "They can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happens.'"

It's All in How They're Raised Posted Date: February 25, 2014 Or is it? A look at nature vs. nurture by Sara Reusche CPDT-KA CVT ANWI. "All puppies are blank slates." "If you do everything right with your puppy, you'll have a great adult dog." "If dogs have behavioral issues, we should blame the handle end of the leash."
These are common misconceptions I hear as a trainer, and they make me so very sad. Behavior is a combination of nature and nurture, and if we could just take a moment to look logically at these myths, we would see just how silly they are.
Genetics influence behavior. This is part of the reason we have breeds: if you want a dog to work your sheep, you're going to choose a Border Collie, not a Brittany. Even though the two dogs have the same basic size and shape, one is more likely to have the instinctive motor patterns to do the work than the other. Getting a Border Collie whose parents successfully work sheep further increases the likelihood of your dog having the necessary genetic ability to be a great sheepherder.
In the 1970s, researchers began to study the difference between normal and fearful lines of Pointers. In cross-fostering experiments, puppies from fearful parents were raised by normal mothers. These puppies still turned out fearful, in spite of proper socialization and a confident role model.
Interestingly, puppies from normal parents who were raised by fearful mothers also turned out fearful. Environment also influences behavior, and the best genetics in the world can't create the perfect dog without a supportive upbringing.
If we believe that the way a dog is raised is solely responsible for his adult behavior, how can the tremendous success of the Pit Bulls from Michael Vick's kennel and many other fighting operations be explained? With their neglectful and abusive upbringing, we would expect these dogs to be vicious and unsalvageable. Yet many of them have gone on to become wonderful pets. Some compete in agility or work as certified therapy dogs. Many Pit Bull enthusiasts are adamant that it's all in how the dogs are raised, yet the success of many former fighting dogs tells us that it's more than just that. These amazing, resilient dogs also have to have a sound genetic basis to explain their ability to overcome adversity.
On the other end of the spectrum, many of my clients have done everything right, yet continue to struggle with anxiety or aggression issues in their dogs. Certain lines of Golden Retrievers are known for severe resource guarding issues that often show up even in tiny puppies. Most of my German Shepherd behavioral consults occur when these dogs hit 12-18 months and growl at or bite a stranger. Miniature Australian Shepherds are likely to come to me due to extreme fear issues at 6-10 months of age. Terrier owners often call me when their dog hits social maturity and begins fighting with housemate dogs. While these traits may be common in my area, trainers in other areas of the country report completely different issues in the same breeds due to different lines of dogs with different genetic potentials living and being bred near them. I also see hundreds of friendly, stable, solid Goldens, German Shepherds, Mini Aussies, and terriers in our Beginning Obedience and Puppy Kindergarten classes.
The truth is that dogs are born with a certain genetic potential that will influence which behavioral traits they display. This could include a dog's sociability towards people, dogs, or other animals; their level of boldness or fearfulness; their likelihood to display anxious or compulsive behaviors; whether they are calm and confident or nervous and neurotic; and many other behavioral factors.
Let's look at one trait to make this more clear. We know that dogs born from fearful parents are more likely to be fearful and that dogs with bold parents are more likely to be bold. There is a behavioral continuum, with boldness on one end and fearfulness on the other. Here's what that spectrum would look like. A dog on the left end of the spectrum would be incredibly fearful, while a dog on the right end would be exceedingly confident. Most dogs wind up somewhere in the middle, and dogs on both ends of the spectrum present challenges for their owners.
A dog with bold parents is born with the potential to be quite bold. He is physically capable of bold behavior. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that he will become a bold dog. If his experiences as a puppy and young adult are very limited or if he has negative, scary experiences, he may develop into a fearful adult due to environmental influence. His genetic potential gave him the ability to be bold, but his environment did not nurture that ability.
On the other hand, consider a dog that is born from fearful parents. This dog does not have the genetic potential to be bold. Even given an incredibly supportive and nurturing environment as a puppy and young adult, this dog will always be somewhat fearful because the physical ability to be bold is just not there.
These dogs may present identically when we look at their behavior, in spite of the very different levels of dedication their owners had to socializing and supporting their puppies. However, the genetically bold dog may make a lot of progress with appropriate behavioral interventions, while the genetically fearful dog makes little or none. This has nothing to do with the skill level of each dog's owner, but rather with the raw material each dog started with. (This is also, by the way, why ethical trainers do not make guarantees: without knowing what genetic package a dog starts with, there's no way to know how much progress that dog can make until we try.)
Do you see how very unfair statements about how "It's all in how they're raised" are to committed, wonderful dog owners who have dogs with more difficult baselines? Just because your dog flew through a behavior mod program doesn't mean every dog can or will, and assuming that it's all because of the owner is unrealistic and downright cruel. I regularly work with wonderful people who do the best they can with difficult dogs, and that adage about walking a mile in someone's shoes is applicable to their situation. As if living with and training a more difficult dog weren't enough, these people are often subjected to comments and insinuations that if they were just a better handler, a better trainer, or a better leader, their dog would be perfectly fine. This is untrue and incredibly hurtful, and it needs to stop.

Vaccines are a crucial part of maintaining public health. Here are five things about vaccines‚Äîincluding the ones you may have received!‚Äîthat you might not know.
1. One Man Created Eight of the Most Common Vaccines
Although most people have never heard of him, Maurice Hilleman developed dozens of vaccines, including eight vaccines that you may have received. Hilleman developed vaccines for chickenpox, Haemophilus influenzae bacteria, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, and pneumonia (among many others). His vaccines saved millions of lives, and I've received a bunch of them myself! His obituary read, in part (emphasis added):
"Hilleman is one of the true giants of science, medicine and public health in the 20th century," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "One can say without hyperbole that Maurice has changed the world," he added. ... "If I had to name a person who has done more for the benefit of human health, with less recognition than anyone else, it would be Maurice Hilleman," Gallo said six years ago. "Maurice should be recognized as the most successful vaccinologist in history."
His obituary is well worth a read, including colorful lines like: "'Montana blood runs very thick,' [Hilleman] said later, 'and chicken blood runs even thicker with me.'" (He grew up on a farm and worked with chickens quite a bit in developing vaccines.) His story is also told in the book Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases.
2. Vaccines Aren't Just About Health
While the primary effect of a vaccine is to protect human health, vaccines also help people and communities in other ways. The secondary effects of vaccines include protecting income, improving learning, and promoting economic growth. The logic is simple: If you're not sick, you're able to work, go to school, or otherwise go about your business without draining resources treating disease. Here's an animated video from the GAVI Alliance with one perspective on how it works:
This is exactly why I get a flu shot every year. I'd rather be able to work (helping myself, my family, and at least my local economy) than run the risk of getting sick and having to waste a week on the couch. My choice to vaccinate myself may also mean that others won't get sick, because I won't pass the flu on to them. (That is, assuming this year's flu vaccine targets the flu strains that actually might reach me.)
3. Many Vaccines Can Be Delivered Without Needles

While we often think of shots as the main way to receive vaccines, many vaccines can be delivered in other ways. Some can use a nasal spray (you may have seen the FluMist flu vaccine‚Äîit's not the only one), others via drops of liquid you swallow (the modern polio vaccine is one), others via tablets dissolved under the tongue, and many others can be delivered using needle-free technology. We have a whole article about ways you can get "shots" without needles. Even Batman uses needle-free technology!
4. The Measles Vaccine Turned 50 Last Year
Until 1963, getting measles was just part of being a kid in the United States, like getting chickenpox. The sad part is that measles can be a very serious illness; prior to the vaccine, measles led to tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. every year, sometimes caused brain damage, and killed an estimated 2.6 million people each year around the world. A vaccine was introduced in 1963 that cut the number of annual U.S. measles cases from 4,000,000 to 2,000 in the course of just four years. That vaccine has saved tens of millions of lives.
We still see some measles cases in the U.S., despite the disease being effectively eliminated for a decade. A JAMA report explains (emphasis added):
Since 2001, there has been fewer than 1 case of measles per 1 million US individuals; rubella reached this same threshold in 2004. Of the few measles cases that did occur in the United States, 84% were imported from countries where measles are circulating or linked to imported cases. An uptick of measles clusters in pockets of unvaccinated US residents has raised concerns among public health officials and renewed efforts to improve vaccine coverage here and abroad.
The WHO also announced yesterday that worldwide measles mortality rates are at historic lows, saying in part, "[Between 2000 and 2012,] an estimated 13.8 million deaths have been prevented by measles vaccination." On the other hand, they reported that the disease is still a major problem: "Measles continues to be a global threat, with five of six WHO regions still experiencing large outbreaks...."
5. FDR Created the March of Dimes to Fight Polio
Image courtesy of March of Dimes
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt suffered from polio, and created the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (commonly known as the "March of Dimes") to fight it. The March of Dimes funded research that led to effective polio vaccines developed by Drs. Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, which in turn have rid more than 99% of the world of polio. Celebrities joined the cause, and even Elvis Presley (shown above in 1956) cheerily received his polio vaccine on camera to spread public awareness.
With the polio threat reduced, the March of Dimes turned its attention to preventing birth defects and reducing infant mortality. Today, the March of Dimes is overwhelmingly known for its work on infant health, though it all started with FDR's crusade to fight polio.
(Note: there are still three countries where polio is endemic, so the fight against polio goes on.)
It sounds like a horrible nightmare: human bones stacked in patterns on the floor, their skulls lining the walls and staring, gaping-eyed, at visitors. It's no nightmare, though: in churches, cathedrals and underground chambers all over the world, the bones of millions of dead greet visitors. The grisly rooms, known as ossuaries, serve as the final resting place for human remains, often due to overcrowded cemeteries. They exist for different reasons, but they all hold a sort of macabre fascination for us, the living. These seven stunning examples of ossuaries remind us that life is fleeting, but some part of us can live on in this world.
1. Sedlec Ossuary, Czech Republic
Easily one of the most incredible collections of human bones in the world, the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic is unlike anything else. The small church rests at the outskirts of Kutna Hora and is filled with the mortal remains of more than 40,000 people. The origins of the ‚ÄúBone Church,‚Äù as it's commonly known, are nearly as interesting as the array of bones. In 1278, an abbot named Henry made a pilgrimage to Jesus' burial place and brought back a small amount of earth. He sprinkled the dirt over the Sedlec cemetery, making it holy ground. Suddenly, it was the most popular place to be buried. When the cemetery ran out of room, the previously buried bodies were dug up, starting in 1511, to make room for the more recently dead.
It wasn't until 1870 that the excavated bones were put to use. That's when a local woodcarver, Franti≈°ek Rint, was employed to arrange the huge quantity of bones in an attractive way. Rint proved to be a true artist, creating the most amazing bone art the world has ever seen. A coat of arms on the wall depicts a raven pecking at a skull, the breathtaking bone chandelier uses every bone in the human body at least once, and the walls and ceiling are adorned with jaunty strings of bones and skulls. The chapel is a Christian church, not a cult or Satanic ritual space as is often rumored. The bones on display were simply removed from the ground to allow more Christians to be buried on holy ground. The resulting ossuary is maybe the most beautiful one on Earth.
2. Santa Maria della Concezione, Rome, Italy
Santa Maria della Concezione is a wonderful example of the fact that not everyone sees death as something to be feared. The church features the remains of more than 4,000 Capuchin friars arranged in artistic displays. Some bodies are complete and dressed in Capuchin robes, but most have been disassembled and are displayed individually as bones in artful designs. A plaque in the chapel tells visitors in three languages ‚ÄúWhat you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.‚Äù It is a reminder that life is fleeting and that any one of us could be gone tomorrow. Rather than being gruesome or horrific, the reminder is gentle and positive, reminding us to take care of our affairs today and be right with the higher power at all times.
3. Brno Ossuary, Brno, Czech Republic
The Brno Ossuary has been quietly existing under St. Jacob's Square for hundreds of years, mostly forgotten. When a new construction project was set to begin in the area in 2001, a routine exploratory archaeological dig was performed. What it turned up was beyond anyone's imagination. The remains of approximately 50,000 people were found stuffed into the subterranean channel. The bodies were likely dug up from cemeteries to make room for more burials. They were, at one time, stacked neatly, but centuries of neglect and flooding saw them washed into a big messy pile. The city began restorations on the site and plan to open it to the public in 2010 or 2011; it will be Europe's second-biggest ossuary. And although it's filled with dead bodies, the ossuary won't be a place to get lost in morbidity or sadness; rather, it will be an ideal place to meditate on the relationship between life and death.
4. Capela dos Ossos, Evora, Portugal
The Capela dos Ossos, or Chapel of Bones, sits next to the Church of St. Francis and is a major tourist attraction in Evora. Like the above ossuaries, the goal of this particular mass crypt isn't to scare or disgust; it's to inspire visitors to contemplate the transitory nature of life. The Capela dos Ossos was created in the 16th century to handle overflow from local cemeteries and to communicate the inevitability of death. One of the more noticeable features of the chapel is the two dessicated bodies ‚Äì a man and a young child ‚Äì hanging by chains from the wall. Their identities are unknown, but local legend says that they are a father and son who treated the mother of the family badly and were cursed.
5. Chapel of Skulls, Czermna, Poland
The story of the Chapel of Skulls (or Kaplica Czazek) is almost more interesting than the actual display of human remains in this Polish church. Between the years of 1776 and 1804, a Czech priest and a local gravedigger spent many long hours exhuming bodies from the numerous mass graves in the Czermna area. They set aside the more interesting skulls (those will bullet holes or obvious maladies, or those of politicians) and took the rest to the chapel. Overall, they dug up somewhere in the neighborhood of 24,000 skeletons. Most of them are stuffed into the 16-foot underground crypt, but the bones of approximately 3000 people adorn the chapel in what the Czech priest liked to call a ‚Äúsanctuary of silence.‚Äù
6. Paris Catacombs
The bone-lined catacombs under Paris are arguably the most famous ‚Äì and undoubtedly the largest ‚Äì underground ossuary in the world. From the 18th century, poor burial procedures and hopeless overcrowding in Parisian cemeteries were causing widespread disease among inhabitants. It was decided that the dead would be buried in a large system of tunnels (actually depleted quarries) beneath the city, and the long process of moving them all began. While the bones were originally just piled up and labeled, French officials eventually realized that the catacombs could become a major tourist attraction. The bones were tidied and arranged in neat displays, with stacks of tibiae and skulls forming lovely ‚Äì if macabre walls. Sadly, a vandalism incident in September 2009 caused Paris officials to close the catacombs to tourists for an undisclosed period of time.
7. Skull Tower of Ni≈°, Serbia
The Skull Tower in Serbia is the only bone collection on this list that is actually meant to inspire terror in those who see it. However, the terror incited by the tower was meant for a long-ago enemy. In 1809, the Serbian rebel army suffered a significant setback in their quest for freedom from the Ottoman Empire. The commander of the Turkish army ordered the heads of the fallen Serbs to be cut off and mounted on a tower to warn anyone who might try to fight against the Empire. A total of 952 were once a part of the Skull Tower, but over the years deterioration and family members have claimed most of the skulls. Only 58 remain today, and a chapel was built to protect the tower. It stands today as a monument to the brave Serbs who fought for their independence.
For the Thoroughbred racehorse, see La Lorgnette
A lorgnette () is a pair of spectacles with a handle, used to hold them in place, rather than fitting over the ears or nose. The word lorgnette is derived from the French lorgner, to take a sidelong look at, and Middle French, from lorgne, squinting.[1] They became popularized by Englishman George Adams when he designed a practical case meant to be carried in the pocket.[2]
The lorgnette was usually used as a piece of jewelry, rather than to enhance vision. Fashionable ladies usually preferred them to spectacles. These were very popular at masquerade parties and used often at the opera. They were worn popularly in the 19th century. The lorgnette was employed as a prop and affectation by early 20th century trial lawyer Earl Rogers, and one is featured on the front cover dust jacket of his biography, Final Verdict, by his daughter Adela Rogers St. Johns.[3]

Six young people from Montreal ‚Äì four men and two women ‚Äì recently left the country to join Islamic State militants in the Middle East, CTV News has learned.
The group, which includes 18-and-19-year-olds, is said to have left Canada in mid-January, and was likely headed to Syria.
Four of them were students at the Coll√®ge de Maisonneuve in Montreal.
One of the young men's fathers was so concerned that he took his son's passport. But his son reported it stolen and received a new one.
Students at the college expressed their shock and concern after they learned about the report.
The college also suspended a contract to rent classroom space to an organization run by Adil Charkaoui, after a link was found between one of his courses and a student suspected of joining ISIS in Syria.
Charkaoui was arrested under a security certificate for suspected terrorism-related activities in 2003, which was quashed six years later.
Lise Theriault, Quebec's public security minister, told The Canadian Press that she's not surprised by the news, and she urged people to contact authorities if they suspect radicalization.
During question period Thursday, Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the news of young Canadians leaving to join ISIS emphasizes how the Conservatives' anti-terror legislation, Bill C-51 could help police stamp out radicalization before it occurs, and provide more tools to deal with high-risk travellers.
However, NDP MP Randall Garrison said the legislation was redundant and ignored the need to reach out to at-risk youth.
"Police already have the power to stop people from travelling abroad to commit terrorist offences, what we don't have is planned to counter radicalization and to stop our young people from turning towards extremist ideologies," Garrison said.
Hussein Hamdani, a lawyer who works with families to prevent radicalization, told CTV News Channel Thursday that news of young Canadians joining ISIS is "devastating."
Hamdani's efforts have focused on preventing radicalization through education and providing a sense of purpose to young people who have dropped out of high school or university.
"These are people who either have very low job prospects, or feel disconnected to their current environment and then decide this is how they're going to make some meaning of themselves," he said.
"(And) joining a new emerging state, if you will, gives them meaning," he said.
Amarnath Amarasingam, a post-doctoral fellow at Dalhousie University, told News Channel that he does not believe enough is being done to prevent youth from becoming radicalized.
He added that efforts need to begin at the "community level," and criticized Bill C-51.
"I don't think you're going to arrest your way out of this problem, as many others have been saying," he said.
"I think it has to start at the community level -- at a very basic level in terms of educating the community -- on how to respond to these things."
Amarasingam said the onus is currently being placed on families and friends, who are ill-prepared to handle the situation.
"They have very little idea of who to call," he said. "Do you call 9-1-1? Do you call RCMP? Do you call CSIS, and what are the consequences of doing that?
There is a lot of fear in the families about to do when they are noticing these kinds of things," he said.
With a report from CTV Montreal's Tania Krywiak
A group of citizens sets out to audit the audit performed by the Chicago Election Board and were horrified by what they saw while watching the audit take place.
The group has since voiced their concerns at the Chicago Election Board meeting on April 5, 2016. One of the ‚Äúaudit auditors‚Äù from the citizen group testified in front of the Election Board committee that she witnessed shocking altercations to the hand-counted tallies from voting machines by Chicago Election Board auditors, noting that the auditors were changing final tallies in a bid to ensure the results matched the machine counts even when they were off by a significant margin.
In one particularly concerning instance, the citizen group witnessed an auditor erase 21 Bernie Sanders votes and add 49 Hillary Clinton votes in order to ensure the audit matched the machine's official count. This, according to the group, is proof that the Chicago Election Board is not performing a true audit, but rather performing a ‚Äúfake‚Äù audit that hides the fact that hand-counted votes were significantly different from the machine counted votes in the Chicago area.
The State of Illinois requires an official audit of five percent of all votes by local election boards to ensure that electronic voting machines are working correctly. However, one group of citizens claims that the city of Chicago did not perform a real audit but rather manipulated audit results in such a way to ensure that all hand-counted votes matched the machine's output and precinct totals from the election. Therefore, instead of identifying possible discrepancies in electronic voting machine totals, the auditors covered up the evidence by manipulating the data after performing the hand count.
At the Chicago Election Board Meeting on April 5, 2016, the group presented their audit concerns to the Board for consideration and the evidence was shocking. The video gets interesting at approximately the 24 minute mark and the bombshell is dropped at the 30 minute mark.
In the video, we see a member of the citizen group who audited the Election Board audit discussing discrepancies she personally witnessed as the auditors tallied hand-counted votes. According to the group, numerous members of their audit watch team witnessed with their own eyes, ‚Äúauditors‚Äù changing tally marks after hand counting votes. The group claims that the tallies were changed in a bid to ensure the numbers matched that of the electronic voting machine totals and the official precinct totals released to the public.
However, as you can see at the 30 minute mark, the totals didn't always legitimately match. Instead, the group says the tally marks were altered and were not a true representation of what was actually counted during the audit. One particularly concerning incident was witnessed by the speaker in which she details watching auditors remove 21 Bernie votes from the final tally while adding 41 tally marks to the Hillary Clinton total in order to force the audit results to match that provided by the machine. Therefore, the group says the audit is meaningless and not an audit at all.
Chicago Election Board Meeting ‚Äì 2016-04-05 ‚Äì something fishy about vote totals‚Ä¶:‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ekdgyEWuZm pic.twitter.com/1B8wsNXj43 ‚Äî IL9th Distr 4 Bernie (@IL9CD4Bernie) April 21, 2016
The Daily Kos points out that if the group's accusations are true, it could change everything about the Chicago election as the hand counted votes would have shown Bernie Sanders winning a district secured by Hillary Clinton with 56.7 percent of the votes. However, due to the alleged manipulation by the Chicago Election Board, Sanders totals were dropped to 47.5 percent, which is an astonishing 18.4 percent swing from the audit hand count. Despite the alleged discrepancy, no recount was ordered by the Election Board, as the tally was altered to match the machine output instead of signaling a red flag to a potential problem with the electronic voting machine.
Chicago Election Board Meeting 2016-04-05 Showing It should be 56.7% for Bernie 18.4% Swing https://t.co/5ZO05gR94y ‚Äî edmund katso (@ekatso) April 22, 2016
As law currently stands, citizens can not demand a recount, only a candidate can do that, and Bernie Sanders has since missed the deadline for such a count to take place. Therefore, a group of concerned voters have created a GoFundMe account to secure litigation funds in a bid to change the law to allow voters to request a recount when evidence such as this presents itself.
‚ÄúWe need money to file suit over possible violations of Illinois election law and a constitutional right to have your March 15, 2016, primary vote counted without being corrupted, stolen or disregarded by ‚Äòblack box' vote machines. The money raised will be used for attorney fees, costs, legal research, legal filing fees, expert witness fees and costs and any other costs of the litigation. I am not the attorney for the matter but am I helping us obtain the best legal representation for this matter.‚Äù
If the citizen group is able to prove their claims against the Chicago Election Board, should a recount be honored as the city would have failed to perform the state mandated five percent audit? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.

Ms. Tennant was presented at court in 1956, and a year later she married Sebastian Yorke, the son of the novelist Henry Green. The marriage ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Christopher Booker, a founder of the satirical weekly Private Eye, and the journalist Alexander Cockburn.
In addition to her daughter Rose, she is survived by her husband, Tim Owens; a son, the writer Matthew Yorke; another daughter, Daisy Cockburn; a sister, Catherine Tennant; a brother, Toby; and three grandchildren.
Under the pen name Catherine Aydy, Ms. Tennant published ‚ÄúThe Color of Rain,‚Äù a dark satire about the British upper classes, in 1963. Her publishers submitted it for the Prix Formentor, awarded yearly in Majorca, Spain. The chairman of the judging panel, the Italian novelist Alberto Moravia, denounced it as a prime specimen of the decadence of the British novel.
Ms. Tennant found her footing in the early 1970s after discovering writers whose anti-realist qualities dovetailed with her own love of myth, magic and dream. In 1980 she told the reference work World Authors:
‚ÄúIt became gradually clear to me, after meeting British science-fiction writers ‚Äî J. G. Ballard amongst them ‚Äî that a way to the center for me lay in the fantastic; and despite the very deep loathing of the British literary establishment for any writing that could be so described, I set out to read as many Latin American and Central European writers as possible, finding confirmation in such works as Bulgakov's ‚ÄòThe Master and Margarita' and the writing of Bruno Schulz that there was nothing inherently ‚Äòsilly,' as the English would have it, in showing the world through lenses both fantastic and real: that the English were indeed limited by a creative feebleness and love of irony which left them out of the most interesting writing, all going on in other parts of the world.‚Äù
This new orientation was reflected in ‚ÄúThe Time of the Crack‚Äù and the two novels that followed, ‚ÄúThe Last of the Country House Murders‚Äù (1974) and ‚ÄúHotel de Dream‚Äù (1976).
In 1975 she founded the influential literary journal Bananas, which published new work by Mr. Ballard, Beryl Bainbridge, Angela Carter and the science-fiction writer Michael Moorcock. She served as editor for three years.
Her many novels also included ‚ÄúQueen of Stones‚Äù (1982), a feminist retelling of William Golding's ‚ÄúLord of the Flies‚Äù; ‚ÄúFaustine‚Äù (1991), about a woman in her late 40s who makes a pact with the Devil to return to her 20s; and ‚ÄúThe Beautiful Child‚Äù (2010), a ghost story revolving around an unfinished manuscript by Henry James.

To read more about Robert Johnson, go to www.robertjohnsonhellhoundale.com.‚Äù < Site not yet up...] [3/2 Update: Fixed the Youtube link below (it's worth listening to this guy jam). Also, Kyle reminded us in the comments of a Dogfish blog post featuring a new lemony beer that the brewery expects to release in big bottles in May (full distribution). Looks like this is the one though it's unconfirmed. ]
Robert Johnson may not exactly be a household name like Miles Davis, the subject of Sony Legacy and Dogfish Head‚Äòs Bitches Brew collaboration beer, but he influenced a number of musicians who grew to stardom. From Sony Legacy's website:
May 8, 2011, marks the 100th birthday of Mississippi Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, who, according to legend, sold his soul down at the crossroads of Highway 61 and Highway 49 in a midnight bargain that has haunted the music world for three-quarters of a century. The ‚Äòdeal' brought forth Johnson's incandescent guitar technique and a run of 10-inch 78 rpm singles for the Vocalion, Oriole, Conqueror and Perfect labels recorded in San Antonio in 1936 and Dallas in 1937. Those songs have become a cornerstone of Columbia Records' identity, and will be celebrated on two CENTENNIAL releases from Columbia/Legacy.
In mid-January, Sony Music Entertainment filed a trademark application for Robert Johnson's Hellhound on my Ale. The name is a play on words from one of Johnson's songs, Hellhound on my Trail, shown below. This week, Dogfish got TTB approval for a keg collar. The only description available is that it's brewed with lemons. Look for the beer to appear at SAVOR.
The 2015 federal election solidified a few truths in Canadian politics. First, it showed us that we are still capable of ousting a party that no longer deserves to govern. Second, it proved we are willing to give a chance to a leader who is both inspiring and largely unproven.
And third, it revealed a hard truth about the NDP; the party can't convince voters to give them the keys to the country. Voters don't trust them to do the big job. In other words, it is time to rename and rebuild the party. After all, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada did it, and it gave them ten years in power.
Like it or not, the Liberal Party of Canada convinced a large segment of the Canadian public that they were now the voice for progressives. Justin Trudeau seemed a lot more modern and left leaning than Tom Mulcair, and voters looking for an antidote for a decade of Stephen Harper's conservatives made their choice.
The bad branding of the NDP isn't entirely the fault of the NDP, however. Try being Bob Rae after his reign as the NDP premier in Ontario came to an end. Rae was pillared by his political enemies, and his party became a laughing stock to almost everyone in Canada's largest province. Even to this day, the impact of the opposition's insistence that he was the most incompetent leader in the history of the country still resonates with many Ontario voters.
A rebranding of a progressive-minded party would be a positive development for not just the NDP, but for voters as well.
Many people will point to the 2011 election as proof the NDP's branding is not the problem. The party became the official opposition after securing the most seats in its history, surprising pundits and Canadians alike. But let's be honest what that really was; a declaration of the impact Jack Layton had on voters. Like Trudeau in 2015, Layton was the biggest reason the party was so successful, and several candidates rode Layton's coattails to victory, despite some not even campaigning in the election.
The presidential race in America is yet another barometer on how badly progressives are currently represented in politics. Bernie Sanders forced Hillary Clinton to profess progressive platform ideas early in the race, yet most Americans still view her as a centrist at best. Sanders has wrestled the base away from Clinton, leaving the party fractured going into the convention. This is an example of a party not nurturing its own core values, and while the party will survive, the brain trust behind the scenes are certainly going to be in damage control after the general election wraps up, no matter who wins.
Luckily for the NDP, unlike the Democrats south of the border, they can scrap their party's name and orange motif without much blowback. And they should. The party's image is irreparable, tattered from years of negative election results and cemented in a state of mediocrity. Mulcair ran one of the worst campaigns in modern times, gambling on a push to the centre while brandishing one of the most unsettling and inauthentic smiles the country has ever seen. Whether it was Mulcair alone or through the assistance of his handlers, the NDP were once again viewed through a lens of incompetence. The Orange Crush of 2011 is now completely eviscerated, and the party is in a familiar third place mindset with no clear-cut leader on the horizon.
All is not lost, however. A rebranding of a progressive-minded party would be a positive development for not just the NDP, but for voters as well. The new party, while it would need to promote some left wing mainstays like labor rights and fighting climate change, could also challenge its base to support a less ideological stance on issues like health care and the military.
Moreover, it could outflank the Liberals on issues like domestic spying or international trade deals, even as it finds room in the centre for tax policies and marijuana legislation. The party could view the right and left as a symbiotic relationship, becoming an ambidextrous party instead of an ideological one. This would require unity among the members, and if you were at the recent NDP convention you are fully aware of the lack of unity among the party faithful.
The convention featured a fractured base of passionate and practical progressives, both vying for influence in how the party moves forward. If both groups understood how much they needed each other, they would have something to build upon. Even if they do finally come together and compromise, they would still have to deal with a deflated orange shanty instead of a robust, inclusive big tent.
Of course, many lifelong members will dismiss the idea of renaming a historical party as needless fiddling. They will trot out Tommy Douglas and Layton as examples of how the NDP contributed to the Canadian political ether. But they will eventually notice that they are only speaking in the past tense, and if the party has a future it might be time to finally clean the slate.

HOUSTON ‚Äî TransCanada Corp., the Calgary-based energy company behind the controversial Keystone Pipeline, announced plans to end its contract with public relations firm Edelman after a proposal to attack the company's opponents was leaked.
The PR strategy, obtained by environmental activist group Greenpeace in leaked documents, outlines how TransCanada should respond to critics of its multi-billion dollar Energy East project.
The planned 2,800-mile pipeline will carry 1.1 million barrels of crude oil daily from Alberta and Saskatchewan to refineries in Eastern Canada, according to the company.
A plan outlined by Edelman, a major PR firm contracted by TransCanada, calls for conducting opposition research on TransCanada's critics and working with third parties to put pressure on them.
‚ÄúIn order to add layers of difficulty for opponents, we will work with third parties and arm them with the information they need to pressure opponents and distract them from their mission,‚Äù the strategy document says.
Greenpeace released the documents on its blog last week. They were featured in media outlets worldwide, including London's The Guardian, Canada's The Globe and Mail and the New York Times.
TransCanada said in a new post on its website this week that it's not able to have a ‚Äúrespectful‚Äù conversation with Canadians in the current environment and is thus ending its contract with Edelman. The company writes:
Regrettably, recent controversy around our communications strategy has created distraction most notably in Quebec. Media reports have incorrectly suggested that TransCanada's communications practices are unacceptable. The conversation about Energy East has turned into a debate about our choice of agency partner. We need to get back to a conversation about the project itself and as a result we have agreed that it is in the best interests of the project that we do not extend our contract with Edelman.
Edelman indicated that its contract with the energy company expires at the end of December. It defended its PR strategy. ‚ÄúIt was both ethical and moral, and any suggestion to the contrary is untrue,‚Äù Edelman wrote Wednesday.
One of the first choices you need to make when starting a new project using React is what library to use for styling your components.
There are a ton of options to choose from and the community hasn't yet reached a consensus of what is the best way to style components. So where do you start?
Instead of going over each library in detail, I find it helps to first understand the high level picture - what are the general approaches related to styling and only from there start to see where each library fits.
Three main styling paradigms
There are 3 main styling paradigms in the React world right now, and the CSS in JS one can further be split into three approaches, since it's such a broad area:
Let's break them down!
Vanilla CSS
This is the way we've all worked with CSS until now - just plain CSS/LESS/SASS files that we included inside index.html . The best practice is to have a CSS file for each component, inside the component folder. You can choose to bundle the CSS files either manually or through Webpack.
How you would use it
each component gets its own CSS file
manually refer to the CSS classes via className
Pros
works out of the box
great to get started quickly and for beginners
default option for create - react - app
Cons
CSS is global
Common ‚Äúpower-ups‚Äù
BEM naming convention
LESS / SASS
CSS Modules
This option builds on top of ‚ÄúVanilla CSS‚Äù, so each component has its own CSS file, however the difference here is that the file is locally scoped. So you can give your classes very generic names, like ‚Äúbutton‚Äù or ‚Äúbox‚Äù and they will not clash with anything else in other files.
How you would use it
each component gets its own CSS file that is locally scoped; use :global to explicitly define global styles
enable the ‚ÄúCSS Modules‚Äù flag on the Webpack css - loader
Pros
private CSS - you no longer need to worry about CSS class name clashes
naming best practices are enforced by default (as opposed to BEM where you are counting on a convention); you will see classes like . hsbrys a lot since they are given random names
Cons
you must use separate CSS file, you cannot colocate your styles with the component code

CSS in JS
Using CSS styles inside the JS code was first introduced by Christopher Chedeaux in 2014 (see the presentation and slides ).
His presentation highlighted the main problems CSS has when used at scale, with a big codebase and a big team of developers.
Global namespace CSS is global by default; This is something we know is a bad practice in other languages yet we don't bother with in the CSS world Dependencies It's really hard to tell where a class is used, what other styles apply to a given component and if it's safe to delete a piece of CSS, because dependencies are not explicit; Dead code elimination It's also really hard to tell which code is not used, so you cannot just remove it for the production build Minification We already minify JavaScript variable names; Why wouldn't we minify CSS class names? Sharing constants How do you share constants between your JavaScript and CSS code? Non-deterministic resolution CSS is executed in the order the classes are declared, which is linked to the order the files are included; This means that unless you explicitly define the order in which your CSS files are included, you have no guarantee of which class / override will be loaded first Isolation How do you make sure that the styles that you intended are not overridden from the outside? If you're working on a small plugin that can be embedded in external websites or such, you would want to make sure your base styles are not overridden by the outside CSS; however that's not the case - CSS cascades, allowing external parties to override anything.
His presentation sparked the community to create a number of libraries, approaching the CSS in JS idea from different angles. This is why I found it useful to group the CSS in JS approaches in 3 different categories.
CSS in JS: Inline styles
Assign styles to a variable and apply them directly:
const buttonStyle = { backgroundColor : ‚Äò green ' }; return < button style = { buttonStyle } >< /button >
This is a quick way to apply styles and works out of the box as described in the official React docs.
How you would use it
attach style to the style attribute of an element
Pros
supported natively, works out of the box
Cons
very common CSS features no longer work natively - pseudoselectors, media queries
Noteworthy libraries
Read more
CSS in JS: Generated class names
How you would use it
attach styles to the className attribute of an element
// Example using Aphrodite import { StyleSheet , css } from 'aphrodite' ; const styles = StyleSheet . create ({ button : { backgroundColor : 'green' } }); const ButtonComponent = () => ( < button className = { css ( styles . button )} > Hello !< /button > );
Pros
solves many of the 7 issues CSS in JS aims to solve, with the benefit that you can use all CSS features (unlinke inline styles - media quries, pseudoselectors etc.)
Noteworthy libraries
Read more
CSS in JS: Styled components
If you think about it, in all approaches described above, you need to define a variable or a class describing the styles and then you need to map an element to the given object/class. But actually you always have a one-to-one relationship, so why declare the class name at all? With styled components you encapsulate styles by creating display components.
import styled fromm 'styled-components' ; const GreenButton = styled . button ` background - color : green ; ` ; const helloComponent = () => ( < GreenButton > Hello !< /GreenButton > );
How you would use it
define styles as part of the component definition
using class names is no longer needed at all
Noteworthy libraries

A housebound terminally ill man has been left a ‚Äúnervous wreck‚Äù after his house was burgled while he was in bed.
Burglars raided the home of Neil Fitzgibbon, 52, sometime between Tuesday at 8pm and Wednesday at 8am morning stealing a safe containing all of his medication and a Playstation.
Among other items stolen from the home on Vane Street, Stockton were Playstation games, a Samsung tablet and a 50 inch television.
Neil's sister-in-law Val said that her husband Ian, who is his main carer and brother, was made aware of the crime by his father who had gone to check on Neil on Wednesday morning.
She said: ‚ÄúNeil suffers from Huntington's Disease and he can't move or speak very well at all. My husband cares for him full-time and usually goes to see him at 8am and takes care of him until 8pm.
‚ÄúWhen he heard about the burglary he went to Neil's house and discovered that the back security doors had been broken into.
‚ÄúIt looked as though the windows had been prized open and that how they must have got into the house.‚Äù
In an apparent attempt to conceal their identities the CCTV cameras around the property had been upturned by the intruders and the hard drive that stores the footage was taken in the burglary.
The intruders then went upstairs to Neil's bedroom where he was in bed listening to the radio and was unable to do anything while they raided draws and wardrobes looking for items to steal.
A safe in the kitchen that contained Neil's entire medication supply was also taken.
Val added: ‚ÄúNeil is just devastated with what has happened, he is a nervous wreck, he never ever goes out due to his illness.
‚ÄúAll he is interested in is his TV and getting some stimulation by playing on his Playstation.
‚ÄúThe family can't believe what's happened. Neil is such a light hearted guy and it's heart breaking that someone would treat him like this - it's so sad.‚Äù
A spokeswoman from Cleveland Police said that they were investigating the incident and anyone with any information should contact them on 101 or crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
The Steyr 100/200 Cabrio was a small, relatively fast (100km/h) car built by the Austrian manufacturer Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG from 1934 to 1940. I don't know much about cars (most of my knowledge comes from Top Gear), so I can't pretend I am an expert; this review focuses on the quality of the kit itself. The car looked gorgeous, so there's that.
The model is very small; the chassis and the undercarriage/seat come as individual pieces. Once you clean them off, they snap together; the fit is so good you don't even need to use glue. The model is quite simple to assemble as the number of parts is small; we get four wheels, two alternate parts for the canvas top (one erected, one folded), and that's pretty much it. There is a casting error on the folding canvas top; generally the quality of resin is good. The chassis has some really fine engraved lines depicting doors, panels, etc. The windscreen frame, the steering wheel and the stick for the manual transmission come as PE parts; you will need fine tweezers to handle them. The driver's rear view mirror is missing; probably because it would be a very tiny part indeed. There are no clear parts provided, but in this scale I would not use them anyway. (Difficult to make realistic 1/72nd scale glass panels.) Due to the small scale the leaf spring suspension is not depicted, either; it would be hidden in any case.
The only issue I could find was the Steyr text on the radiator grilles; since the letters are only slightly raised details (and they are quite soft) it will be difficult to paint them well. Perhaps undercoating the grilles with silver and using a heavy black wash might be a solution. I'm not sure what the alternative would have been though; I think it would be equally difficult to deal with a tiny PE part instead.
The whole assembly including cutting the parts off the pouring block and cleaning them up took about an hour.
The painting was, well, not easy. I can't replicate the polished-up look of luxury cars, that's for sure. I was thinking about carefully polishing it with some polishing compound, but was worried about rubbing the paint off.
The interior was black with the leather seat and instrument panel painted in different shades of brown.
The white base coat was followed by the deep red color. I've used some brown in the scarlet Citadel paint, and carefully applied it with a brush. It took several layers to get a relatively even coverage, but it's still not perfect. I thought about airbrushing but masking would have been a nightmare. The car would definitely benefit from some deeper panel lines even if it's out of scale. (It's always a compromise, isn't it? A lot of the time small details need to be overemphasised so they are actually visible on a model.)
The whole thing got a gloss coat for protection. I've tried some black washes, but the details are way too delicate; I did not want to risk the wash over flood the white paint.
All in all the model was a breeze to build, and a bit difficult to paint. It's a pretty cool little project for a weekend.

Dzmitry Samal, the former car designer turned eye wear manufacturer now has a line of timepieces. This watch collection is the first ever to have a concrete case, and I must agree they look great. The price isn't very high for a Swiss Made timepiece, but the sad news is this will be a limited edition of only 100 watches.
The straps are made of rubber, and attached to them are 42mm steel cases which are wrapped in polished concrete. Dzmitry, the line's designer created it with big city life and pop art in mind, and he seems to have succeeded giving us this feeling. The 8 different watches in this collection will have simple numeric names (One,.. Three,.. Seven,..).
Getting back to the price, it will be somewhere around 980-1240 Euros, that's roughly $1200.
Before enjoying the photos below, I'll let Dzmitry describe his own creation:
Watchmaking, as I see is more than just a time measuring mechanism.
It is the main male jewellery and should reflect the personality and strenght of its owner.
I chose concrete, a noble, modern, honest and robust material, the stuff our megapolis are made of.
My watches tell the story of an alliance of French creativity and Swiss technical performance, innovating in a field that has never been explored in watchmaking before.
My designs are sophisticated in their simplicity and plainly contemporary‚Ä¶

If you needed any more proof that SOPA isn't really dead, just delayed, look no further.
Despite calls that SOPA, for all intents and purposes, had been killed in the House of Representatives, the truth was that the harmful legislation had simply been put on the backburner.
Just ask Lamar Smith, SOPA author:
Stop Online Piracy Act Markup to Resume in February House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today said that he expects the Committee to continue its markup of the Stop Online Piracy Act in February. Chairman Smith: ‚ÄúTo enact legislation that protects consumers, businesses and jobs from foreign thieves who steal America's intellectual property, we will continue to bring together industry representatives and Members to find ways to combat online piracy. ‚ÄúDue to the Republican and Democratic retreats taking place over the next two weeks, markup of the Stop Online Piracy Act is expected to resume in February. ‚ÄúI am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to send a bipartisan bill to the White House that saves American jobs and protects intellectual property.‚Äù
The language coming out of Eric Cantor's camp last weekend that prompted the ‚ÄúSOPA is dead‚Äù cries made a point to say the SOPA could be resurrected when a consensus was reached.
This is indeed a timely release from the congressman's office, as we find ourselves on the eve of the internet-wide SOPA blackout. Wikipedia, reddit, and other sites will go dark for 24 hours. Google has announced that they will put up a link on their homepage voicing their opposition to SOPA and PIPA.
SINGAPORE - Workers' Party (WP) MPs Sylvia Lim, Low Thia Khiang, and Pritam Singh have filed their defence in the lawsuit brought against them by the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC), saying that are not personally liable for $33 million in payments made by the town council to its former managing agent and service provider, and had acted in good faith.
The MPs, who have been asked to account for the sum, also said they do not owe any special duty of care to the town council beyond what is stated in the laws governing town councils.
Even so, they added, they had acted in the best interests of the town council in appointing its managing agent FM Solutions and Services (FMSS) and service provider FM Solutions and Integrated Services (FMSI).
These arguments were made in a 40-page statement of defence filed in the High Court on Tuesday (Aug 15), which also covers two other defendants, town councillors Kenneth Foo Sek Guan and Chua Zhi Hon.
In July, AHTC, represented by Shook Lin & Bok, had initiated legal action against them under the direction of an independent panel appointed by the town council in February to help recover improper payments.
The lawsuit is the latest development in a long-running saga arising from the town council's inability to submit a clean set of accounts since the WP won Aljunied GRC in the May 2011 general election.
The town council alleged that $33,717,535 in payments it made from July 15, 2011 to July 14, 2015 to FMSS and FMSI, are not valid, as the town councillors had acted in breach of their fiduciary duties.
Related Story Politically risky to retain reluctant and unwilling managing agent for AHTC, say WP MPs
On Wednesday, Ms Lim, Mr Low and Mr Singh said in a statement on the WP website that their defence would deal with all the allegations made against them, adding that they denied them all.
"We maintain that, at all times, we had acted in good faith and in accordance with our duties as Town Councillors. Our actions had the best interests of the residents of AHTC at heart and sought to ensure that AHTC was able to fulfil all its functions and duties, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances that we were faced with," they said in their statement.
In their statement of defence filed in court, the five defendants, represented by law firm Tan Rajah & Cheah, argued that town councillors do not owe such duties - which include a duty of loyalty and fidelity among other things - to the town council.
"Their duties as town councillors are no more and no less than as set out in the Town Councils Act (TCA) and the Town Council Financial Rules (TCFR)," said the defence lawyers.
Under the TCA, town councillors are also protected from any personal claims against them in relation to actions they have taken in their roles, they added.
They also denied that the town council had made any improper payments or suffered any losses as a result of their conduct.
AHTC had asked for "equitable compensation" for any sum that has been wrongfully paid out, in its statement of claim filed in the High Court in July.
It also wanted Mr Low and Ms Lim to be liable for a sum of $1.2 million, which it described as the difference between the "inflated charges" of FMSS compared to the rates charged by previous managing agent CPG Facilities Management.
The town council had pinpointed the appointment of FMSS - set up by Ms How and her late husband Danny Loh on the instruction of Mr Low and Ms Lim - without a tender being called, as the start of its financial woes.
Mr Low and Ms Lim, refuting allegations of wrongdoing, said they had done so to ensure that services to residents would not be disrupted, and had acted in good faith. Recounting the circumstances surrounding the appointment, they said CPG had informed them that it wanted to stop providing managing agent services to AHTC, even though its contract was good for two more years.
Given this, they said, they did not trust CPG to continue to do its best to serve the residents, and felt it was "too politically risky to retain a reluctant and unwilling managing agent".
They also said they had taken steps to "ameliorate" any conflicts of interest that would arise from making Ms How the general manager of the town council and Mr Loh the secretary, by requiring all payments to FMSS to be co-signed by either the chairman or vice-chairman of the town council.
In their Wednesday statement, Ms Lim, Mr Low and Mr Singh said of the appointment of FMSS as AHTC's managing agent: "Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang acted in good faith and in the best interests of its residents."
FMSS and Ms How, who are also named in the suit, are represented by lawyers from Netto and Magin.
Separately, the Attorney-General's Chambers, representing the Housing Board, has written to the court to ask for permission to follow the case at all hearings, a request objected to by Tan Rajah & Cheah on behalf of its clients.
The AGC said in its letter to the court that the HDB has an interest in the proceedings as they pertain to the recovery of improper past payments, a key issue in a previous case between the HDB and AHTC, then known as Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council.
By: Al-Shabaka
Al-Shabaka is an independent non-profit organization whose mission is to educate and foster public debate on Palestinian human rights and self-determination within the framework of international law. This brief is by al-Shabaka policy member Dina Matar.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently claimed in a video posted on his Facebook page that the Palestinian demand to dismantle illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) constitutes an act of ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù against Israeli Jewish settlers. The term, which was originally used as a euphemism during the Serbian campaign against Bosnians, soon came to describe extreme violent practices, mass killings, and forced displacement during conflict and war. It has also been used by many scholars as well as in public discourse to refer to Zionist practices against the Palestinian population in the lead-up to and during the Nakba of 1948. These practices include the destruction of more than 500 Palestinian villages and the expulsion of approximately 730,000 Palestinians from their homes.
Netanyahu's application of the term to Israeli settlers garnered more than a million views on his Facebook page, and drew millions more via the video's recirculation across social media platforms. It shocked many analysts, created a tense debate in the international media, and brought condemnation from the likes of then-UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who called it ‚Äúunacceptable and outrageous.‚Äù Yet such rhetoric, albeit more incendiary than usual, is but the latest instance of an Israeli strategy of appropriating a narrative of victimhood in order to shore up public support.
This commentary traces the history of the Israeli claim to this narrative from the early Zionist movement campaigns of the beginning of the twentieth century to the present day. It marks the ways in which such a rhetorical strategy has been used to justify the state of Israel's actions to the detriment of Palestinians. It concludes with recommendations for how Palestinian leaders, intellectuals, journalists, and activists can counter the Israeli strategy of appropriation to further their quest for Palestinian self-determination and human rights.
Narratives of victimhood in context
In any conflict, actors resort to narratives of victimhood to justify aggression, invasion, and even the killing of civilians. Such rhetoric is intended to establish binary lines of good versus evil, victim versus perpetrator. This mobilizes supporters against ‚Äúthe enemy.‚Äù As we see with Israel and in other conflicts, narratives of victimhood serve to legitimize violent and often pre-emptive acts against ‚Äúthe enemy,‚Äù perpetuating the cycle of violence and victimhood indefinitely.
By contrast, Palestinian narratives of victimhood draw on the injustice enshrined in the Balfour Declaration of 1917 that began to be implemented before and during the British Mandate of 1923 and since the 1947 UN partition plan. These sentiments continue to this day, and are exacerbated by the international community's, and the Arab world's, unwillingness to enforce international law and basic human rights. Thus, Palestinians' narrative of victimhood cannot be discussed outside of this context and continued Israeli political and military actions against Palestinians in the OPT. The situation includes an unequal power dynamic given that Israel is the mightier power and the occupier; a large number of Palestinian fatalities, including children, as a result of Israeli actions and attacks; and Israeli control of space and territories, as well as resources and movement.
Accordingly, while an analysis of how the history of Jewish persecution and victimhood was -- and is -- used to justify the actions of the state of Israel should never lose sight of the facts and context of that very real persecution, there is at the same time a need to scrutinize the mobilization of this narrative to understand how one group -- Israeli Jews -- has been granted victimhood, while another -- Palestinians -- has not, shoring up a power imbalance in which Jewish Israeli rights are favored at the expense of Palestinian rights.
From victimhood to ethnic cleansing
Jewish persecution in Europe is rooted in anti-Semitism and the many ways in which it impacted Jewish communities in different locations and at different times. As for the narrative of persecution, it can be traced to the late nineteenth century, when Theodore Herzl, a father of Zionism, drew on the history of Jewish persecution in Europe to legitimize the nationalistic project of the Israeli state and its settler colonial practices. After WWII, this history of persecution was again invoked to justify the founding of the Israeli state. Indeed, Israel's Declaration of Independence contends that ‚Äúthe Holocaust...in which millions of Jews in Europe were forced to slaughter again proved beyond doubt the compelling need to solve the problem of Jewish homelessness and dependence by the renewal of the Jewish state in the land of Israel, which would open wide the gates of the homeland to every Jew.‚Äù
Since the creation of Israel, historical narratives that value Jewish victimhood over Palestinian lives and rights have been used time and again by Israeli politicians. Prime Minister Golda Meir commented, for instance, that Jews have a ‚ÄúMasada complex,‚Äù a ‚Äúpogrom complex,‚Äù and a ‚ÄúHitler complex,‚Äù and former Prime Minister Menachem Begin drew parallels between the Palestinians and the Nazis.
Scholarship suggests that Israeli and Zionist leaders manipulated the memory of Jewish persecution, particularly in relation to the Holocaust, as a diplomatic tool in their treatment of the Palestinians. For instance, the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe, in his book "The Idea of Israel," argues that these leaders constructed a sense of Israelis as victims, a self-image that prevented them from seeing the Palestinian reality. This, he says, has impeded a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In recent years, new evidence and studies have begun to question the dominant claims of the Zionist movement. At the same time the global solidarity movement in support of Palestinians has been growing, in part thanks to digital platforms that allow global audiences unmediated access to Palestinian stories and lived reality. This has spurred Israeli leaders, PR managers, spokespeople, and their media to focus on diverse strategies to maintain their hold on Western public opinion.
These include using a discourse -- such as Netanyahu's use of ethnic cleansing -- to refer to Jews and Israeli citizens as victims of continued persecution by the Palestinians, with the knowledge that these terms have specific legal meanings and, according to international law, are considered to be crimes against humanity. But it is the term's associative and emotive meanings, particularly if they are intended to act as reminders of the long history of the persecution of the Jews, that serve to promote Jewish Israeli victimhood at the expense of Palestinian experiences of oppression. The term ethnic cleansing also has yet to be used officially in the West in regard to the Nakba, making it vulnerable to Israeli appropriation.
Around the same time as Netanyahu's ethnic cleansing statement, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs reposted a related video on its Facebook page that had originally been released in 2013. The video, titled ‚ÄúWelcome to the Home of the Jewish People,‚Äù was billed as a short history of the Jews. It follows the travails of a Jewish couple, called Jacob and Rachel, when their home (the ‚ÄúLand of Israel‚Äù) is invaded by various groups, including the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Arabs, Crusaders, the British Empire and -- finally -- the Palestinians. It thus proposes that Jews have survived a series of brutal invasions, with the only remaining invaders the Palestinians. The video provoked a strong reaction from Palestinian activists and those who work for Palestinian rights due to its clear attempt to rewrite the history of the conflict, framing of Israeli Jews as victims rather than the Palestinians, and deployment of racialized and violent language in its depiction of the Palestinians.
Netanyahu's ethnic cleansing video is the latest in a series of videos planned and executed by David Keyes, Netanyahu's foreign media spokesman, who was appointed in March 2016. Keyes has been a key strategist behind an increase in pro-Israel marketing campaigns on social media. Since his appointment, eight videos with Netanyahu addressing a variety of issues have been posted. All have proved popular among his supporters in Israel and the US.
The arguments in Netanyahu's statement draw on those proposed in a 2009 document for the Israel Project, a pro-Israel advocacy group, prepared by Frank Luntz, an American political consultant identified with the US Republican Party. In this dictionary-cum-messaging-manual, Luntz details various tactics and terminology as well as tips for marketing and legitimizing discourses while also highlighting shared values with the West, such as ‚Äúdemocracy,‚Äù ‚Äúfreedom,‚Äù and ‚Äúsecurity.‚Äù
With such a focus on the West, it is thus perhaps no surprise that Netanyahu communicates in English in the ethnic cleansing and other videos, with versions available with subtitles in Hebrew and Arabic.
Countering Israel's rhetorical strategy
The history of Jewish persecution is a deeply affecting issue for Israelis and, more widely, for the international community, especially Europeans. However, the Israeli use of such terms as ethnic cleansing -- at the hands of the Palestinians -- wrongly depicts Israel as a victim and the Palestinians as an aggressor. Such rhetoric can be used in the dangerous practice of seeing any criticism of Israeli actions as anti-Semitic or as antagonistic toward Israel. This helps to stymie efforts on the part of Palestinians and Palestinian solidarity movements to hold Israel to account for its actions, such as extrajudicial killings and the illegal building of settlements in the OPT.
Given the fact that battles over narrative are becoming more prevalent and more visible in the digital age, and given the ways in which particular language may be used to deflect attention from on-the-ground developments, Netanyahu's pointed use of the discourse of victimhood cannot be ignored. Attention to this development is all the more crucial at the current juncture, with Israel planning to expand settlements in and possibly annex further occupied territory, and with international determination and ability to resolve the conflict more sluggish than ever. Attention is also particularly necessary -- and strategic -- in a year marking the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, the five decades since the 1967 war, and the three decades since the First Palestinian Intifada.
The Israeli appropriation of the discourse around victimhood demands a more effective engagement by Palestinian spokespersons, political elites, and activists in the public sphere to expose the reality of Israeli actions and elicit international support for Palestine and the Palestinians. This does not mean taking part in a futile battle over who deserves to be called the real victim in the conflict, but to build a coordinated campaign to refute Israeli claims through evidence.
Such a campaign should contest Israeli narratives by using images and the language of international human rights that appeal to Western publics and leaders. It must always be based on evidence, facts, and context to counter attempts to misinform and disguise actions. The campaign should also train the Palestinian political elite and diplomatic staff in the use of political discourse directed to Palestinians, regionally and internationally, ensuring that the discourse does not legitimize Zionist discourse by, for example, inadvertently using anti-Semitic tropes. Those Palestinians leading the campaign and international solidarity groups must use Twitter and other social media outlets to target the mainstream media with the real-life situation on the ground in the OPT, as well as facing the Palestinian citizens of Israel and the Palestinian refugees and exiles, using the language of rights and international law.
Finally, the campaign should engage media professionals to train Palestinians and advocacy groups on how to counter propagandistic narratives and statements, as well as how to use digital media to reach out to global audiences.
Only with such concerted efforts can Israel's strategy of appropriating the Palestinian narrative be contextualized and thus revealed as rhetoric intended to disguise the violence of Israeli settler colonialism.

The ancient Malian city of Timbuktu has housed for centuries thousands of manuscripts which are invaluable to the history of Africa and Islam. Several thousand of them seem to have been lost or taken away by retreating Islamist militants as French and Malian troops were advancing towards Timbuktu.
The most important collection belonged to the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research which moved to this new building in 2009. Recent video footage of the library shows charred books and empty boxes. This is how it looked in May 2010 when BBC Africa journalist Manuel Toledo visited Timbuktu and took these pictures.
These 13th-Century commentaries on the Koran were among the oldest manuscripts in the library. Workers at the Ahmed Baba Institute have told the BBC that around 2,000 manuscripts may have been lost while 28,000 were taken to Bamako, Mali's capital, after the Islamist groups took control of the city.
Many other manuscripts may have survived at the institute's old building, as the collection was still in the process of being moved to the new facilities. The Ahmed Baba centre was established by Mali's government in 1973. The new library was built with South African support. The institute's director is Dr Mohammed Gallah Dicko.
The centre is named after Ahmed Baba, considered Timbuktu's greatest scholar. Several of his best known texts were written while he lived in Morocco, like this manuscript from Marrakech which dates from 1599. He died in 1627 in Timbuktu.
The manuscripts dealt with different fields of knowledge. The text with red drawings, for example, is a treatise on astronomy by Nouradine bin Mohamed Ahmed, and the manuscript on the bottom left is an 18th-Century copy of an earlier text on pharmacology. It contains recipes for traditional Sahelian remedies written next to Koranic verses.
In 2010, researchers at the institute pointed out proudly that many of the texts proved that Africa had an ancient written history, unlike what many of the continent's colonisers had claimed. The University of Timbuktu was one of the most important academic centres in West Africa around the 15th Century and is said to have attracted thousands of scholars.
In the new building the manuscripts were being digitised before being restored - in case something went wrong and also with the hope of making them available on the internet. It was a project that was expected to take many years. It may have saved some of the contents of the missing texts as the hard disks containing the digital data were reportedly taken to Bamako.
Many of the manuscripts were acquired from Timbuktu families which had kept them for centuries. The dry climate of the region, located on the southern edge of the Sahara desert, contributed to their preservation. This is a 17th-Century copy of a biography of the Prophet Muhammad.
The long process of restoration included specialised book-binding and the making of insect-proof boxes. Researchers from the Ahmad Baba Institute also taught contemporary preservation methods to local people who did not want to sell their manuscripts to the state.
The manuscripts were written using different kinds of West African scripts, including Saharan, Sudani, Maghribi and Suqi. Once the type of script was identified, the researchers would try to establish the theme of the manuscript, its title, its author, as well as the names of the calligrapher and that of the person who commissioned it.
With a militant style more associated with the crew of The Pirate Bay, TorrentFreedom promises to put the user back in control, by offering a new BitTorrent-optimized, zero-logging, 100% anonymous VPN service, guaranteed to punch a hole through throttling ISPs. Be quick for a free account!
Born out of the VPNTunnel Project, the TorrentFreedom ‚Äòmanifesto' is an interesting document, particularly if you've ever worried about being tracked, traffic shaped, blocked or censored on the Internet. With a suitably clandestine feel, the manifesto states:
‚ÄúToday, there is a nexus of Schumpeterian creative destruction to be found at the asymptotic fringe of intellectual property law and networking technology. Everyone says there is an ‚Äòarms race' between the unwashed filesharing masses and the forces of Big Brother ‚Äì we like to think of ourselves as the suitcase nuke for the little guys.‚Äù
TorrentFreak got in touch with ‚ÄòFaust' of TorrentFreedom to find out what on earth they're talking about.
TF: Tell us about this ‚Äòcreative destruction' and what inspired you to create TorrentFreedom.
Faust: It's all but trite to point out nowadays that we've undergone a revolution in how human knowledge is created, stored, and shared. And, much as Schumpeter himself had predicted, the creativity unleashed has more than made up for the detritus of old forms of information transmission that now scatter the landscape like broken, forgotten toys. This is as it should be. The backlash from the praxis of stasis threatens to drown the organic reinvigoration that innovation technology has always brought forth ‚Äì there would be no 95 theses without Gutenburg, remember.
So our inspiration comes from a deeper, historical appreciation for the transformative role of new technologies in human social organization. Nobody knows where creativity, academia, and knowledge creation will evolve as our tools allow for more and deeper interconnection between physically disparate peoples ‚Äì but we do know that hampering that process isn't part of making a better world for all beings. We'd like to see people keep sharing, keep learning, keep exploring. . . and they can't do that if there's roadblocks and threats of censorship every step of the way. Make it easy and make it work, that's our approach ‚Äì then the creative destruction can continue apace.
TF: There are a number of evils you appear to tackle head on with this service, such as traffic shaping, packet raping, blocking, censorship etc. I expect lots of Comcast customers will be interested as you specifically mention the ‚ÄòSandvining' technique they employ. How does your system work and how will it benefit each type of problem?
Faust: Metaphorically, the system is quite simple: think of the difference between sending postcards in the postal mail, versus sending sealed envelopes. A postcard can easily be read by anyone along the way, and if they don't like what it says (or who it is addressed to), they could just throw it out ‚Äì oops! A sealed letter isn't vulnerable like that ‚Äì the contents aren't readable whilst in transit. Even more than that, our system protects the address (sender and receiver) on the envelope as well ‚Äì so nobody can block the message just because they don't like where it's headed (or where it's come from).
At a deeper level, our server farm is based in the Netherlands. Everything passes in and out of these machines, and all IP addresses are associated with them. The activities of our customers ‚Äì once their sessions decrypt and leave our server farm ‚Äì are fully and unambiguously decoupled from their RL info (including local/physical IP address). Big Brother isn't going to show up at their doorstep with a fishing-expedition summons or subpoena. We took it a step further, however ‚Äì we've broken the link between RL info and public IP for our customers inside our systems as well ‚Äì once an account is set up, it is methodologically impossible for anyone to back-connect a given external TF IP address to a customers' specific account, ever.
TF: You're called TorrentFreedom so it's fairly clear which crowd you're aiming your product act. What sort of dedicated optimizations can BitTorrent users look forward to when using your service?
Faust: We've tested the service extensively with just about every BT client out there. They all work seamlessly. We also don't penalize our customers for running lots of network traffic over TorrentFreedom ‚Äì there are no monthly caps, and no drama if someone uses a lot of gigs with us. That's cool ‚Äì it's why we built the system!
OpenVPN, in its rawest form, will work with BT traffic ‚Äì but getting it to do so consistently and smoothly is nontrivial. We've done all that work, so our customers don't need to become experts in subnet addressing, MTU window sizing, and the 100 other little tweaks one needs to do to really make BT over a VPN sing. We also hand out real, public IP addresses ‚Äì so no port forwarding garbage, just fast connectivity.
TF: Please give us a brief rundown on how your system works.
Faust: On a technical level, it's an implementation of the TLS-based OpenVPN project's codebase (which itself implements various OpenSSL crypto algorithms). Starting from there, we've created a Java-based client that handles all the encryption and coordinates OpenVPN's handshake tasks, to ensure that every packet coming and going from our customers' PCs is tightly encrypted (including DNS queries, unlike pptp). The really cool stuff comes in the firewall-busting tricks that our client has up its sleeve ‚Äì there's very few local network configurations that we can't tunnel through. . . with no customer tweaking of the software needed. We've also implemented a rather clever port 443 wrappers so that, unlike many VPN instantiations, the TorrentFreedom service can't be blocked unless the entire HTTPS capacity is also shut down ‚Äì unlikely.
We've built most everything with open code, and we're pushing further in that direction (with perhaps full distribution of the source for our client extensions in the works). ‚ÄúJust trust us‚Äù crypto isn't worth anything ‚Äì if it's not open, it's not reliable. We run 2048 keylength RSA algorithms so, to the local ISP or anyone else ‚Äúlistening in‚Äù to our customers' packets, the data all looks like a stream of secure web traffic, back and forth. This is true for ALL IP traffic coming off a machine, all protocols and all applications. So there's no need to tweak individual applications to get them to ‚Äúwork‚Äù with TorrentFreedom ‚Äì just set up the client, connect, and everything is encrypted all the time.
TF: There are other well known VPN services that say they are strong on anonymity and hide your IP address, yet all of them will give up your personal details at some point. How is TorrentFreedom going to live up to the claim in the manifesto that BitTorrent users using your service will be ‚Äújust about as traceable as dusty footprints in a windswept street. You can't subpoena what doesn't exist‚Äù ?
Faust: Ok this is where the rubber really meets the road. An ‚Äúanonymizing‚Äù service that keeps detailed records of their customers' activities is just a problem waiting to happen. There's no point in hiding an IP address only to keep records that connect that IP address to the one that's used to cover for it! And, reality is that there is no place in the world that isn't subject to some form of legal jurisdiction ‚Äì just saying ‚Äúwe won't turn over records‚Äù is silly. When the authorities show up ‚Äì with court orders or guns ‚Äì and people start talking about jail time and contempt, those records are going to get coughed up, period. Despite our respect for the company overall, Hushmail's admission that it provides ‚Äúsecure‚Äù email information to certain government authorities demonstrates all too well that even a good team will fold if the pressure gets too high ‚Äì and if they have information to provide in the first place!
We built the system from day one so that there's no correlation between an IP+timestamp and a username ‚Äì this means we can't hand over logs of ‚Äúwho was on what IP at what time‚Äù, and therefore the user can't be tracked back from their online activity. Our payment system is fully abstracted from the operational environment ‚Äì billing events are passed to the VPN engine via temporary ‚Äútokens‚Äù that are one-way-factors ‚Äì there's no link between the VPN account and the details of the billing transaction, ever.
We keep a little bit of data on file to make sure we can monitor the performance of the system overall, but we don't have ‚Äúserver logs‚Äù like everyone else does. They don't exist. So, we can be forced to turn over those logs ‚Äì but they don't link back to anything. Not to mention all of our operational VMs run in fully-encrypted partitions, etc. Someone seizes any of our servers has nothing but an expensive doorjam for their troubles. Even someone with full access to every machine we have cannot link people to their past network traffic through TorrentFreedom. It's structural anonymity, at the most fundamental level.
Now, there are lots of other VPN services out there and some of them are sorta ok. Most, let's be honest, are based on pptp ‚Äì it's really insecure with several known weaknesses. Plus, it's closed-source/proprietary, so who knows if it has backdoors or not? The reason people use it is because it's easy to set up ‚Äì Windows machines come with it pre-installed. Well, we did the hard work of getting a real VPN implementation (OpenVPN) to work just as easily as pptp ‚Äì but without the security problems.
Some of the stuff we did is a little complex, behind the scenes, but the end result is a service that's really easy to set up and use. We've got clients for Windows, Macs, and Linux. We don't limit bandwidth, and we've got some very fast servers backing it all up. It's all done right.
TF: Any final thoughts?
Faust: Using TorrentFreedom for online security is like bringing a machine-gun to a knife fight. . . it might not be ‚Äòfair,' but the outcome isn't going to be in question either.
TF: lol ;)

EXCLUSIVE: Walt Disney Pictures is now in business with Moonlight Oscar-winning writer Tarell Alvin McCraney to script a musical idea for David Oyelowo to star. Details are under wraps on what is being titled Cyrano the Moor, but we know it's some kind of musical mash up of two classic stories ‚Äî Cyrano de Bergerac and Othello ‚Äî and will be set in the Bristol region of England during the 19th century.
So that means that the script will take inspiration from the two classics, one written by Edmond Rostand and the other by William Shakespeare. Cyrano de Bergerac is a comedy about a man of many talents ‚Äî poet and musician ‚Äî who has a very large nose and because of that has no confidence. He becomes a kind of ghostwriter for a handsome man with no writing or verbal ability to woo the beautiful Roxane (whom de Bergerac is secretly in love with). Eventually, all is found out. Othello is tragedy about a Moorish general whose life is basically torn asunder by the jealous and Machiavellian Iago which leads Othello to murder his own beloved wife.
Interestingly, Oyelowo recently received critical acclaim for his performance as Othello opposite Daniel Craig earlier this year in the Sam Gold directed and Barbara Broccoli produced play. Othello had a limited off-Broadway run at the New York Theatre Workshop in New York.
The live-action musical Cyrano the Moor is planned to be as lavish a show as Disney classics Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. The idea was originally conceived awhile ago by former CAA agent Jon Levin in one of the Oyelowo team development meetings. Disney then bought the idea and hired McCraney to write it. The producers will be Yoruba Saxon (A United Kingdom, Nightingale) with David Oyelowo and Jessica Oyelowo. Tendo Nagenda and Chaz Salembier are overseeing for Disney.
McCraney is repped by CAA and Manage-ment. Oyelowo is repped by CAA and Inphenate.
There's nothing like ringing in the new year with an old canard.
A few days ago, the chancellor of a public university, Troy University in Alabama, sent students and staff an email message regarding the new year. In addition to expressing his hope that their new year would "be blessed," Chancellor Jack Hawkins, Jr. included a link to a video, which, he said, would serve as a reminder of America's "greatness and vulnerability."
The video itself is ninety seconds of intellectual rubbish and bigotry masquerading as insight. Essentially, it's a Harvard business school professor making the claim that religious belief is essential for democracy. The professor suggests that if people do not believe in God, they will not voluntarily obey the law. The video ends with the ominous observation, "If you take away religion, you can't hire enough police."
The assertion that widespread atheism will lead to moral and social decline is a claim oft-repeated. But frequent repetition doesn't make this unsupported assertion true. Instead, it serves as a reminder of the prejudice that many have toward atheists, as well as a telling admission of the weakness of arguments for theism.
To begin, where's the evidence to support this claim? None is cited in the video. That's not surprising, because there is no evidence to support this claim. What evidence is available refutes the purported connection between disbelief in God and moral and social decline. Widespread, voluntary rejection of belief in God is a phenomenon of only the last several decades, but there are a number of European countries, principally in Scandinavia, where a significant percentage of the population, if not a majority, no longer believes in a deity. The sociologist Phil Zuckerman, in his book-length study, Society Without God, described how Sweden and Denmark are peaceful, prosperous democracies with generally law-abiding, civic-minded populations, whose crime rates compare favorably with the United States, a much more religious nation. Their police presence is much lower as well. So much for the supposed tumble into the abyss.
Moreover, empirical studies of the behavior of theists and nontheists have not revealed any significant causal connection between lack of belief in God and criminal conduct. If one visits our prisons, one would find the overwhelming majority of inmates are believers.
Admittedly, a few years ago, the researchers Robert Putnam and David Campbell did conduct surveys, the results of which were summarized in their 2010 book American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us, which purported to show that religious Americans are more pro-social than nonreligious Americans. For example, religious Americans donate more to charities. Leaving aside questions about their methodology (the surveys relied heavily on self-reporting), a close look at their studies shows that it's not religious belief per se that correlates with altruism, but rather being active in a religious community. Being actively engaged in community associations may have some connection with pro-social behavior (in part, because it serves as a reminder of our obligations toward others), but there's no reason to think that civic associations cannot perform this function as well as religious groups.
In addition, the Putnam and Campbell study revealed one important aspect of conduct toward others where the nonreligious scored better than the religious, and that is with respect to support of civil liberties and conduct and attitudes toward minorities, such as gays and lesbians. Put simply, the nonreligious are, overall, more tolerant. Bottom line: even assuming the Putnam and Campbell study is reliable, at most it shows that there are some differences in conduct between religious and nonreligious, not that a religious society is necessarily better or that a democracy cannot survive with a nonreligious population.
Of course, the most interesting thing about the assertions that atheism leads to moral decay is the motivation for such claims. Exactly who is supposed to be persuaded by these claims? It's not like atheists are suddenly going to slap their foreheads and exclaim, "My goodness, I better start believing in God." No, these claims are clearly designed to bolster the religious who may have some doubts about the soundness of their beliefs. To put it mildly, the intellectual foundations for theism have been greatly eroded over the last couple of centuries. It is much more difficult to accept belief in invisible spirits. So, if one cannot come up with a positive argument for belief in God, try to scare people into believing. We better believe in God or chaos will result!

POLICE were given a tip-off about a sighting of a missing pensioner six days before her body was found - but failed to pass it on to the inquiry team.
The body of Janet McKay, 88, was discovered yesterday - eight days after she was reported missing from her home in Knightswood in Glasgow.
But it has now emerged that police received details of a sighting two days after she disappeared but the inquiry team were not informed.
A full five days later, police acted on a tip-off of another sighting which was received by a force call centre and discovered Mrs McKays the next day in Clydebank.
The disturbing case echoes the botched police investigation into the M9 crash that saw Lamara Bell and John Yuill left in a car wreck for three days after the crash was reported.
‚Ä¢ Were you the person who contacted police a week ago today with a possible sighting of missing Janet? Email us on reporters@dailyrecord.co.uk or contact us on 0141 309 3251
John Yuill, 28, died on impact but Lamara, 25, survived the crash and lay critically injured next to her partner for before she was eventually found.
She later died in hospital.
Police have apologised to Mrs McKay's family but the blunder will heap further pressure on the beleagured force following a series of controversies.
Aamer Anwar, the solicitor acting on behalf of Lamara Bell's son Keiran Burt, dismissed the apology and said the system had failed yet another family.
He said:‚ÄùI don't think apologies are good enough anymore. The Scottish Government needs to get to grips with what is going on.
‚ÄúHow many more families have to suffer in this way?
(Image: ¬© HEMEDIA / SWNS Group)
"What does it take for the Scottish Government and Police Scotland to realise this is not good enough.
"What we have seen in the last few months is that people have lost their lives. This is the tip of the iceberg.
"The system is fundamentally failing the people it is supposed to be helping. There is no point in talking about low crime figures if people are losing their lives because the system is not functioning the way it is supposed to.‚Äù
Mr Anwar is now calling for a full judicial review in to procedures at Police Scotland.
A probe into the mishandling of Mrs McKay's disappearance has now been launched by the Police Investigation and Review Commissioner for investigation - the same body overseeing the M9 crash scandal.
The Scottish Government also ordered an urgent review of all police call handling in the country by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland.
It will focus broadly on all call handling procedures and will be in addition to the ongoing independent inquiry specifically into the M9 incident by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).
Divisional Commander Ch Supt Andy Bates said: ‚ÄúSince she was reported missing last Wednesday, an extensive investigation and search has been conducted by my officers throughout the local area. On Friday evening as part of our inquiries, a member of the public provided us with information of a possible sighting of the missing person. This information was not passed to the call handling centres nor was it passed to the inquiry team.
‚ÄúOn Tuesday, further information about this potential sighting was received through the call handling centre who immediately passed it to the inquiry team. Following further extensive inquiry a body was discovered. We have kept Janet's family fully informed.
‚ÄúI would like to apologise to the family for any distress caused at this difficult time and take this opportunity to express my condolences to the family and friends and thank those members of the public who supported the search for Janet.
‚ÄúThis incident has now been referred by Police Scotland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to the Police Investigation and Review Commissioner for investigation.‚Äù
Police Scotland has been dogged by a string of controversies in recent years including concerns about routine arming of officers, complaints about the abuse of stop and search powers and the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody in Perth.
Last month, Chief Constable Sir Stephen House announced he will stand down from his post in two months time - accelerating his departure by nearly 12 months.
He had previously signalled his intention to leave when his four year contract expired next September.

Baraka is an incredible nonverbal film containing images of 24 countries from 6 continents, created by Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson, with music from Michael Stearns and others. The film has no plot, contains no actors and has no script. Instead, high quality 70mm images show some of the best, and worse, parts of nature and human life. Timelapse is used heavily to show everyday life from a different perspective. Baraka is often considered a spiritual film.
Baraka is now available on Blu Ray DVD Baraka has finally got a Blu Ray transfer, allowing the film to be seen in the quality that it was intended. A unique 8K ultradigital transfer system was developed especially for Baraka to capture it to Blu Ray. The new release includes 80 minutes of new bonus features. The disc comes in 100% recycled material. Order on Amazon.com for just $15.98, and Amazon.co.uk for just ¬£12.98.
Baraka is an ancient Sufi word, which can be translated as "a blessing, or as the breath, or essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds." For many people Baraka is the definitive film in this style. Breathtaking shots from around the world show the beauty and destruction of nature and humans. Coupled with an incredible soundtrack including on site recordings of The Monks Of The Dip Tse Chok Ling Monastery.
Baraka is evidence of a huge global project fueled by a personal passion for the world and visual art. Working on a reported US$4 million budget, Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson, with a three-person crew, swept through 24 countries in 14 months to make this stunning film.
One of the very last films shot in the expensive TODD-AO 70mm format, Ron Fricke developed a computer-controlled camera for the incredible time-lapse shots, including New York's Park Avenue rush hour traffic and the crowded Tokyo subway platforms.
Some people find the lack of context in Baraka occasionally frustrating, not knowing where a section was filmed, or the meaning of the ritual taking place. However, the DVD version includes a short behind-the-scenes featurette in which cinematographer Ron Fricke explains that the effect was intentional. "It's not where you are that's important, it's what's there."
The DVD also includes behind the scenes footage, including scenes of the grueling shoot at Ayer's Rock in Australia, when a plague of flies of Biblical proportions made it impossible to film until they rigged up a vacuum to suck the bugs away from the lens.

Overview
For me Baraka is the pinnacle of these films. The quality of the cinematography is outstanding. Shots flip from solitary Monks to crowded streets from great temples to images of war firing a hundred and one thoughts in your mind that you never complete.
Baraka is not just about what you are seeing, It is also about how it is presented. Shots of monks will make you grab your backpack and head for Asia as soon as the film finishes, but you never make it as the shots of post war Kuwait and the refuse dumps of Calcutta remind you that us humans are far from perfect. The decision to use the Todd-70mm format film could never have been easy. The extra cost and work is clearly worth it though, it leaves its mark against all of the other films.

Interviews
Here are some great interviews with the filmmakers. Taken from the DVD extras.
Visual images include...
Tibetan monks, Orthodox Jews, Whirling Dervishes, a solar eclipse, Buddhist monks, African tribal rituals, Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, rain forests, Ayers Rock, Big Sur country, Hawaiian volcanoes, Brazilian slums, time-lapse footage of car and pedestrian traffic, post-Persian Gulf War shots of Kuwait's burning oil fields, burning-of-the-dead ceremonies on the Ganges, refuse dumps of Calcutta, Auschwitz, Egyptian Pyramids, Angkor Wat, Mount Everest, Tuol Sleng in Cambodia, Indonesian factory workers.
Soundtrack
Baraka has a stunning and varied soundtrack. Primarily composed by Michael Stearns, but also including contributions from many other artists and performers. Buy the soundtrack here.
The Book
'Baraka a visual journal' is a book containing 58 original still photographs taken by Mark Magidson during the journey that created the film. Buy the book here. The images vary greatly with content and style, from Black and white to colour, from letter box to full page. The book contains passages where Magidson describes the film and its meaning. It also has 36 small shots, with descriptions showing the people and equipment that made the film. I would strongly recommend the book to anyone who has a passion for the film. It is very nicely printed on Monadnock Dulcet and bound in Asahi Cloth, produced by St. Anne's Press.

New Delhi, July 22
India has decided to start work on militarily crucial strategic railway lines in the Himalayas to connect areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), dividing India and China, with the mainland India.
The rail lines will enable rapid deployment of forces over the rugged, inhospitable and mostly snow-bound terrains. A high-level meeting of the government on July 14, chaired by the Deputy National Security Adviser Nehchal Sandhu and attended by representatives from ministries of defence and finance, identified four strategic lines that would be taken up on a priority as part of the BJP-led government¬ís budget announcement to build strategic railway lines, sources said.
The four lines have been prioritised from among the 14 strategic lines identified by the Ministry of Defence. China has high-speed railways connecting almost all areas of its side of the 3,448 km LAC.
This will be the first foray of India in the upper Himalayas to build strategic railway lines. This will enable rapid deployment of troops, especially the newly created Mountain Strike Corps mandated to face China. The railway line being built in Kashmir has a dual purpose - socio-economic and strategic. The other existing narrow gauge lines in Himachal Pradesh and Northern Bengal are of British vintage.
The most important railway lines will connect Leh in Jammu and Kashmir and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh with the mainland India. Both these are on the LAC. The other two routes will connect one of the remotest parts of Arunachal Pradesh and facilitate easier military movement between other north-eastern states and Arunachal Pradesh.
The Tawang line is the most significant, considering the strategic importance of the area which is also a major Indian military base.
At present, there is no crossing over the Bhramaputra from Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram forcing the troop movement by a circuitous road route.
For north India, the Rail link to Leh will be crucial. The pre-feasibility report pegs the cost of the entire 498-km all-weather broad gauge Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway line at Rs 22,831 crore. The take off point could be either near Kiratpur Sahib in the foothills of Punjab or Pathankot.
A British era 181 km narrow gauge line exists between Pathankot and Joginder Nagar. It can be converted into board gauge. The conversion is expected to cost Rs 3,279 crore. The rail-line to Leh will pas through Upshi in Ladakh providing for further bifurcation to important conflict points at Demchok and Chumar in south-eastern Ladakh. From Upshi onwards, it's a flat plateau.
A sum of Rs 1,000 crore for this fiscal will be used in land acquisition and preparing detail project reports.

As with all drugs, I have nothing but contempt for marijuana. To me, the consumption of any substance that causes any level of inebriation, addiction, intemperance or long-term health issues should be avoided diligently. I loathe Marijuana ‚Äì so why do I believe it should be legalized and federally regulated, like tobacco?
There are many assumptions placed on both marijuana use and marijuana users. I would not be filling my role adequately as a social commentator if I did not pursue challenges to our collective assumptions.
First and foremost, allow me to break the assumption that only ruffians and hooligans consume this substance. According to a study conducted by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 44 per cent of Canadians have used marijuana at some point in their lifetime. I would hardly consider half of our nation's population to be criminals; however, it appears our current laws have an antithetic perspective.
Another predisposed assumption is that the legalization of a substance immediately spurs its consumption. This, again, is a fallacy. According to a study published in the Social Sciences Journal: ‚Äú[US] States and regions that have maintained the strictest criminal penalties for marijuana possession have experienced the largest proportionate increase in use.‚Äù Additionally, if I may draw a comparison between the contemporary prohibition against marijuana to the past prohibition of alcohol in the United States, many studies show that as a result of prohibition, in most regions, alcohol consumption either stayed the same or increased as a result of new laws against the drug's consumption. I believe this to be an analogue for the levels of marijuana use; Were it to be legalized.
Additionally, it is a rampant assumption that marijuana is so damaging to individuals' health that it should not be legalized for recreational use. However, the vast majority of objective studies on marijuana has deduced that it is exceedingly safer than alcohol and cigarettes for the consumer. Alcohol and tobacco are more toxic, more addictive, and more harmful to long-term health than marijuana, and alcohol use is more likely to cause injuries and lead to violence. Also, it is nearly impossible to die of an overdose of marijuana, as it has never been recorded as ever happening. Yet death by alcohol poisoning is prevalent.
What about the cost to society for prevention and health treatment resulting from marijuana use? To cite an assessment published in the British Columbia Mental Health and Addictions Journal, health-related costs for alcohol consumers are eight times greater than those for marijuana consumers, and those for tobacco consumers are forty times greater than those for marijuana consumers.
If generally in society we view the consumption of alcohol or cigarettes to be an accepted social norm, then why do we take such an aggressive stance towards marijuana ‚Äì a substance that in many cases has been proven to be less of a detriment to human health?
So, if there is no reason to keep marijuana illegal, is there reason to legalize it?
Yes. According to the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse: Canadians spend up to $1.3 billion policing and persecuting the marijuana industry. This expense would obviously disappear after legalization, freeing up your tax dollars to be spent on dealing with actual crimes of consequence, such as violent crime. Furthermore, the US Drug Enforcement Agency estimates the value of the Canadian black market marijuana industry to be worth $19-21 Billion dollars. Since regulated marijuana would be taxed at an enormous rate, it would provide a tremendous amount of tax revenue for our nation, taking money out of organized crime and gang warfare, and putting it towards our children's education or other social programs.
As with many things in our society, the prohibition of marijuana is based on decade-old assumptions and void of any support in factual evidence.
It turns out the majority of Canadians agree with me. An Angus Reid poll showed that 53 per cent of Canadians believe marijuana should be legalized and federally regulated.

Russian police are hunting a brown bear in Siberia who pinched two guns from a hapless hunter.
The bear trashed a wood cabin and left with a Vepr carbine automatic rifle, which shoots 600 rounds per minute, and an IZH shotgun as the hunter hid in the woods.

To avoid an encounter with the animal, the hunter scurried off into the woods where he hid for several hours.

When he returned to the remote cabin, his bag and two guns were missing.
The Siberian Times reported the man hunted in the vicinity for several days seeking to find the guns, but the bear had made away with them.
Bear hunting season in Siberia runs until November 30 but the animals are beginning to hibernate, so the thieving bear could be fast asleep with the guns already.

For the last two weeks, we've been introducing you to real stories of those who are using Xperia Z3 to do great things with their smartphone. Last but not least, we're delighted to reveal ‚ÄòPeek' ‚Äì the final film in the three-part Demand Great series. The films were created to showcase how three every-day heroes turn situations from good to great using the Xperia Z3, and ‚ÄòPeek' tells the story of a truly exceptional collaboration.
The video is centered on Stewart Jordan, the cofounder of Peek ‚Äì a portable eye examination kit which consists of apps loaded on to smartphones, including Xperia Z3, and a clip-on adapter allowing ophthalmologists to diagnose eye conditions anywhere in the world.
Without treatment and contact lenses, Stewart himself would be diagnosed as blind. Stewart now wants to help people who are in the same position as him, but without access to healthcare when they desperately need it.
Peek's technology, combined with the phone's 20.7megapixel camera and low-light capabilities, ensures that the highest quality images of patients' eyes can be used to accurately diagnose their condition. Stewart has introduced Peek to local healthcare workers in Guatemala, which will help to ensure that more patients in rural areas are diagnosed than would have previously ever been found.
Along with its innovative camera technology, the phone's durable design, including dust-tight and waterproof capabilities* makes it the best tool to ensure it functions in the extremes of the Guatemalan weather ‚Äì which varies from dry and dusty to monsoons. Its extensive battery life means that it can work for long periods of time out in the country, making it the perfect partner for the work that Peek has set out to accomplish.
‚ÄúIt is difficult for the bulky equipment that you find in a hospital to be transported out there,‚Äù says Stewart. ‚ÄúBut with Peek and a smartphone we can send just one person almost anywhere and they can perform some high quality eye examinations.‚Äù
With 39 million people worldwide suffering from blindness, Peek bridges the gap and takes healthcare where it's most needed. Stewart's story shows how his desire to go above and beyond, using his pioneering app and Xperia Z3's exceptional technology, have combined to achieve something great.
The ongoing collaboration between Peek and Sony Mobile will see over 150 smartphones donated to areas including Kenya, Mali, Tanzania, India and Guatemala to support Peek's initiative in making eye examinations more accessible for those in even the remotest of settings.

*In compliance with IP65 and IP68, the Xperia Z3 is protected against the ingress of dust and is waterproof. Provided that all ports and covers are firmly closed, the phone is (i) dust tight and (ii) protected against low pressure jets of water from all practicable directions in compliance with IP65; and/or (iii) can be kept under 1.5 m of fresh water for up to 30 minutes in compliance with IP68.
Apple has made some pretty big strides of late with its operating systems and their integrations with each other. But there are still a few daily niggles that cause friction. One of those niggles for me is clipboard management. There have long-been a good selection of clipboard manager apps for the Mac which allow you to access your clipboard history. To perform such tasks cross-device I always end up emailing links, text or images to myself. Airdrop is too slow to connect most of the time, and handoff is useful if you want to open a webpage or an email (or other content types that are supported) that is already open on Mac to an iOS device, but there are scenarios when I don't want to open it first on desktop just to handover. Handover is also very immediate, sometimes I might want to access something on a different device later.
Partly inspired by the recent iOS9 long-press Safari URL field ‚ÄòPaste and go' or ‚ÄòPaste and search' shortcuts, also now that Apple's iCloud infrastructure seems fast and reliable, I wondered if a there could be a way to enable an Apple-ID shared clipboard with recent history? The idea would be that any Apple device you are logged into and is connected to the internet can access and add to a shared cloud clipboard. Copy a URL on your Mac, paste it directly into the address bar on your iPhone. Copy some text on your iPad and paste it straight into a doc on your Mac.
The secret to making this work would be ensuring the iCloud Clipboard is easily accessible at the point of pasting. The obvious place would be in the copy/paste dialogue that appears after a long press in a text field. The regular ‚Äòpaste' function could be replaced by ‚ÄòPaste last' (as there are multiple clipboard items now), next to which a small iCloud logo could live to access the full clipboard history.
Likewise the same functionality could be used to ‚ÄòPaste last and go' and ‚ÄòPaste last and search' directly from the iCloud clipboard into the Safari URL field. The iCloud clipboard selector can also be intelligent and only present relevant options for the context ‚Äì for example if pasting into the Safari address bar only shorter text snippets or URLs could be displayed.
The iCloud clipboard view could be similar to the iCloud Drive app, but should appear contextually over the content you are pasting into. It's possible you could add a new section to the existing iCloud Drive app, or even create a new app just for iCloud Clipboard allowing the user to access the clipboard as a starting point for an interaction. There would need to be sensible limits put on this functionality such as copying large files or perhaps files of any kind would only be supported on Macs. Other storage based solution should be used for document transfer and sharing. Also the number of items held in the clipboard could be limited.
Just an idea, and there are likely many things I've not given the time to properly consider here, but the fundamental idea has legs and would be great to see Apple explore something like this in future iOS and macOS releases.
Carl Williams was seen off in an appropriately ostentatious style at a ceremony in Melbourne attended by more than 100 guests, plus 12 police guards brought in to keep the peace.
During the service, a montage of photographs of the man once known as the "smiling assassin" was showed to mourners, accompanied by the Tina Turner song Simply the Best.
Williams was later laid to rest in a $30,000 (¬£18,000) gold casket, reportedly the same model that was used for Michael Jackson's funeral.
His ex-wife Roberta Williams, who arrived at the ceremony in a stretched Hummer, paid tribute to her former spouse saying that he had encouraged her to "stand tall" and respect herself.
Ms Williams said that Williams would do anything to protect his family.
"You didn't love Dhakota (the couple's eight-year-old daughter) any more or less than my other three children."
The service was dominated by stories of Williams showering his daughter and stepchildren with gifts and playing the joker.
"You gave me $500 after my teeth fell out, because you were drunk," said his stepdaughter Bree. "You were my best friend."
His daughter Dhakota spoke of her love for her father and gave a frank account of how he used to annoy her mother by changing song lyrics around to tease her.
"Your favourite was *Hot and Cold*, but you sang for mum 'I'm hot and you're not'," she said.
"You thought you were really funny, but you weren't."
Williams, a major player in a vicious gangland war that terrorised Melbourne during the 1990s and first years of the new millennium, died last week after a fellow inmate bludgeoned him over the head with part of an exercise bike.
Known as "the baby-faced killer" Williams, 39, was serving three life sentences for the killing of five underworld figures at the time of the attack.
Police are investigating how he came to be murdered in one of the most secure parts of the country, when he was supposed to be under constant CCTV surveillance.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A JetBlue airline passenger, who media outlets and a witness described as making angry remarks at the sight of Ivanka Trump on his flight, was removed from the plane on Thursday by the airline.

JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) confirmed in a statement that a passenger had been removed from a flight set to depart from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, bound for San Francisco, but provided no other information about the incident.
Another passenger on the flight, Marc Scheff, said that, when the man saw U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, he ‚Äúdid a double take and said ‚ÄòOh my God. This is a nightmare!'‚Äù
JetBlue said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly. In this instance, our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight.‚Äù
Reuters was not able to identify the passenger who was removed. Matthew Lasner, a Twitter user cited by TMZ, said his husband was going to confront Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, at the airport.
‚ÄúIvanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial,‚Äù Matthew Lasner (@mattlasner) wrote in a tweet, which has since been deleted. ‚ÄúMy husband chasing them down to harass them. #banalityofevil.‚Äù
Lasner, a professor at New York's Hunter College, did not respond to requests for comment directed to his Twitter account, which has since been taken offline, or to messages left at his office or sent to his Facebook account.
‚ÄúTo do that to a woman who was on there with her children, I don't care what your political background is or what your thoughts are, that's not the way we as Americans need to act,‚Äù Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said on Fox News.
Scheff, 40, who told Reuters he was sitting in the row in front of Ivanka Trump on the flight, said the passenger who was later removed from the flight ‚Äústarted shaking.‚Äù
He said that after JetBlue staff approached the man to ‚Äúmake sure he was calm,‚Äù the passenger said: ‚ÄúThey ruin our country, now try (to) ruin our flight!‚Äù
Scheff said the passenger was ‚Äúclearly agitated‚Äù but did not ‚Äúscream or yell.‚Äù
Ivanka Trump was en route to Hawaii for a vacation with her family, according to ABC News.
Donald Trump and his family are spending the Christmas holidays at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

Little Lewis, my son, I see some evidence that you have the ability to learn science, number and proportions, and I recognize your special desire to learn about the astrolabe‚Ä¶
‚Äî Chaucer's Astrolabe Treatise, 1391.
At what point did we create artificial intelligence? Was it when we first chiseled on rocks the memory of our debts? Was it that point when we enhanced reasoning by exploring possibilities in the arena of a game? Or when we solved a problem of inference beyond our merely fleshy ability to calculate? The dream of a fully autonomous artificial intelligence, stuff of infinite science-fiction prognostication, has blinded us to the incremental nature of artificial intelligence. The deep intellectual and ethical question facing our species is not how we'll prevent an artificial superintelligence from harming us, but how we will reckon with our hybrid nature.
This dual nature of ours has been evident for centuries. In the 14th century, Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, prepared a treatise for his son in which he set out in meticulous detail the operations of an astronomical machine‚Äîthe astrolabe‚Äîdesigned to assist in the identification of planets and stars and provide a calendar of their motions. The astrolabe was in effect an artificial astronomer, a mechanical expert that mariners carried on voyages in lieu of libraries, charts, and mathematicians.
The astrolabe captures three properties essential to what Donald Norman, the director of the Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego, has described as ‚Äúcognitive artifacts‚Äù‚Äîa store of memory, a mechanism for search, and an instrument of calculation. The use of physical objects and machines as ‚Äúamplifiers‚Äù or ‚Äútrainers‚Äù of cognition has, in fact, a long and celebrated history. In her magisterial study of memory in antiquity, The Art of Memory, Frances Yates describes the tale of Simonides of Ceos who once used the positions of seats around a table to recall the identities of a dinner party crushed by a falling roof. Yates dispassionately concludes, ‚ÄúOrderly arrangement is essential for good memory.‚Äù
Orderly arrangements need not be purely physical‚Äîacronyms, rhymes, and imagery are all methods for expanding recall. As David Rubin observes in his monograph, Memory in Oral Traditions, ‚ÄúIn Homer, the sea is always wine dark, the dawn, rosy fingered.‚Äù And when the material is too vast to memorize, we rely on lists, indices, bibliographies, catalogs, etymologies, bestiaries, dictionaries, encyclopedias, concordances, and guide books‚Äîa whole ‚ÄúGutenberg galaxy‚Äù as it were, of stored information.
Mechanisms of search represent another level of sophistication beyond memory. A chessboard, for instance, is a virtual search engine‚Äîit not only encodes through an outsourced working memory the positions of pieces; the 64 elements of the grid also provide a mental scaffold for plotting out possible futures. But strategic maps are perhaps the best understood ancient search engines for constructing tactical sorties in the field of battle. Napoleon, considered by many historians one of Europe's greatest military strategists, made extensive use of maps to arrive at new troop formations. Napoleon's strategy of the ‚Äúcentral position‚Äù was topographically conceived in order to defeat detachments of enemy forces. So important were Napoleon's combinatorial innovations that, for many years, students at West Point were required to learn French in order to experience his insights firsthand.
Calculation, though, is perhaps the omega-point property of cognitive artifacts. Mathematical tools from the tally stick to arithmetic rope, the protractor to the compass, and the slide rule to the abacus, all enhance our unassisted aptitude for calculation. By engineering precise constraints, each of these machines can, like the astrolabe, ensure that through a sequence of stereotyped actions (an algorithm), we arrive at the correct answer to a simple question. And computers‚Äîfrom the analytical engine to the differential analyzer, through to our contemporary zoo of digital universal Turing machines‚Äîprovide the essentially ambient analytical matrix of modern society.
In every one of these cases an artificial element has been introduced to our intelligence. They're certainly amplifiers, but in many cases they're much, much more. They're also teachers and coaches. In almost every use of an ancient cognitive artifact, after repeated practice and training, the artifact itself could be set aside and its mental simulacrum deployed in its place.
In every one of these cases an artificial element has been introduced to our intelligence.
I call these machines complementary cognitive artifacts. Expert users of the abacus are not users of the physical abacus‚Äîthey use a mental model in their brain. And expert users of slide rules can cast the ruler aside having internalized its mechanics. Cartographers memorize maps, and Edwin Hutchins has shown us how expert navigators form near symbiotic relationships with their analog instruments.
So our upper Paleolithic lineage has always possessed artificial intelligence to the extent our ancestors have been aided in this way. In modern life, mobile devices and their apps‚Äîto-do apps, calendar apps, journaling apps, astronomy apps, game apps, social apps, and on near infinitum‚Äîjust recapitulate the three essential elements of the astrolabe: memory, search, and calculation.
Compare these complementary cognitive artifacts to competitive cognitive artifacts like the mechanical calculator, the global positioning systems in our cars and phones, and machine learning systems powering our App ecosystem. In each of these examples our effective intelligence is amplified, but not in the way of complementary artifacts. In the case of competitive artifacts, when we are deprived of their use, we are no better than when we started. They are not coaches and teachers‚Äîthey are serfs. We have created an artificial serf economy where incremental and competitive artificial intelligence both amplifies our productivity and threatens to diminish organic and complementary artificial intelligence, and the ethics of this sort of mechanical labor are only now engaging the attention of practitioners and policymakers.
We are in the middle of a battle of artificial intelligences. It is not HAL, an autonomous intelligence and a perfected mind, that I fear but an aggressive App, imperfect and partial, that diminishes autonomy. It is prosthetic integration with the latter‚Äîas in the case of a GPS App that assumes the role of the navigational sense, or a health tracker that takes over decision-making when it comes to choosing items from a menu‚Äîthat concerns me. The writer William Gibson has said that the future is here‚Äîit's just not evenly distributed. But the future, in the form of aggressive Apps, is nearly everywhere.
It is not HAL, an autonomous intelligence and a perfected mind, that I fear but an aggressive App.
In Homer's The Odyssey, Odysseus' ship finds shelter from a storm on the land of the lotus eaters. Some crew members go ashore and eat the honey-sweet lotus, ‚Äúwhich was so delicious that those left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back and say what happened to them.‚Äù Although the crewmen wept bitterly, Odysseus reports, ‚ÄúI forced them back to the ships‚Ä¶Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home.‚Äù
In our own times, it is the seductive taste of the algorithmic recommender system that saps our ability to explore options and exercise judgment. If we don't exercise the wise counsel of Odysseus, our future won't be the dystopia of Terminator but the pathetic death of the Lotus Eaters.
We must ask: What kind of artificial intelligence do we wish to become?

Back in July an ocean exploration team led by Swedish researchers found what some suggested may be a flying saucer on the sea floor. There were even skid marks behind the large object that suggested it may have moved across, or crashed on, the sea floor.
While experts speculated that the object was just a glitch in the team's sonar, new reports surfaced this week that the team uncovered a second, similar object nearby. But, as the report hopped from one website to the next, one thing was missing: an image of the second object.
Life's Little Mysteries contacted Peter Lindberg, who led the expedition, to get the full story, and the elusive sonar scan .
The tale begins in July, when Lindberg, who has successfully recovered objects from sunken ships, announced he had discovered a strange round object at a depth of about 300 feet (about 91 meters) on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Bothnia, between Finland and Sweden. Adding to the mystery, he noted evidence of scars or marks disturbing the environment nearby, suggesting that the object may have moved across the ocean floor at some point. [7 Things People Mistake for UFOs]
His claim that the object "is perfectly round" may or may not be accurate; while it looks round, the resolution of sonar image is too low to verify it. And while it's possible the lines that appear to be leading to the feature indicate movement, it's also possible they are totally unrelated.
The object remains unidentified, but many experts questioned whether the sonar image was accurate to begin with. In a story that ran on the Popular Mechanics website, Hanumant Singh, a researcher with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, explainedthat the sidescan sonar Lindberg used to find the object is not very reliable. Although it's perfectly useful for finding sunken ships that have a high profile on the ocean floor, it's far less accurate for revealing flat, low formations, Singh said. Furthermore, Singh said, there was evidence the sonar was not calibrated properly.
The story seemed to end there, and Lindberg said his team had neither the interest nor resources to investigate the anomaly. But interest in Lindberg's find was revived a few days ago when CNN reported that his team had found a second, similar object not far from his original discovery.
CNN's Brooke Bowman claimed the original mysterious object "is not on its own down there. The ocean explorer team also found another, smaller, disc-shaped object nearby. Both show a rigid tail or drag marks more than 400 meters (about 437 yards) long. Their size and distinctive shape are generating some peculiar theories," including that it could be: Han Solo's spaceship, The Millennium Falcon, from the "Star Wars" films; Russian warships; Atlantis; a marine version of Stonehenge; a crashed flying saucer, or a plug to another world inside Earth.
The announcement of a second, similar object strengthened the original claim: Although sidescan sonar is known to create false images, the likelihood that it could create two nearly identical false images is very remote.
But the story takes a bizarre turn when we discover that the image of the second mysterious object used in current reports is actually a duplicate of the original sonar image. For example, the image featured at 1:13 in the CNN video clip is clearly the same image released in July. What's going on? Is there really a second saucer-shaped anomaly, and if so, where's the image of it?
Lindberg told Life's Little Mysteries, "I confirm that we have found two anomalies. We did find the other anomaly approximately 200 meters [about 219 yards] from the circular find at the same sonar run." Lindberg explained why his team had not released the sonar image of the second object: "We decided not to expose that anomaly so much because there is a lot of disturbance on the sonar image when we passed it, so it's very blurry. We can see it's something but to an untrained eye it might just look like 'pea soup.'"
Indeed, the second object looks almost nothing like the first; instead of the well-defined, disc-like appearance of the first object, the new one more closely resembles a lumpy eggplant or a blueberry muffin sprouting what looks like an owl's head.
Still, Lindberg speculated that the two objects may be linked in some way: "There is a chance that the two anomalies had been parts of the same body from the beginning. But at the same time it might mean nothing, it might be a coincidence."
It was the unusually round shape that first drew the public's interest in the first find, but it's not clear why the second feature would necessarily qualify as an anomaly ‚Äî especially given the difficulty in interpreting (potentially miscalibrated) sidescan sonar images. Perhaps future exploration with better equipment will finally solve the mystery.

James Comey has agreed to testify in open session before Congress about Russian meddling in the US elections (AFP Photo/JIM WATSON)
Washington (AFP) - James Comey, the former FBI chief whose firing by President Donald Trump has triggered uproar, has agreed to testify publicly about Russian interference in the 2016 elections, lawmakers announced Friday.
"I hope that former Director Comey's testimony will help answer some of the questions that have arisen since Director Comey was so suddenly dismissed by the president," the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, said in a statement.
"Director Comey served his country with honor for many years, and he deserves an opportunity to tell his story. Moreover, the American people deserve an opportunity to hear it."
Both Warner and the committee's chairman, Richard Burr, indicated they were looking forward to Comey's testimony about Russian interference in the November 8 presidential elections that saw Trump secure the White House by scoring the electoral college, though Democratic rival Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.
No date has yet been set for the open session hearing, though the statement said it would take place after the Memorial Day holiday, May 29.
The White House has been thrown into turmoil by a succession of stunning allegations against the president this week, including that he may have obstructed justice by asking Comey to drop an investigation into one of his top advisors.
On Friday, The Washington Post reported that a senior White House official was now under investigation as part of a probe over Russian efforts to tilt the elections in Trump's favor.
And The New York Times said the US president had told top Russian officials Comey's sacking had relieved "great pressure" on him.
Trump told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last week that Comey was a "nut job," according to the Times, citing notes taken at the meeting and read to the paper by a US official.
That flies in the face of the White House's public insistence that Comey's dismissal was not linked to his ongoing investigation.
The president's son-in-law Jared Kushner is among those whose contacts with the Russian government have come under scrutiny.
On Thursday, Trump declared himself the victim of the "greatest witch hunt" in American political history and denied allegations of collusion.
"There is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself, and the Russians -- zero," Trump told reporters.
The White House on Friday predicted that the investigation would back up Trump's account.
"As the president has stated before -- a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity," said spokesman Sean Spicer.
WikiLeaks Says Julian Assange's Internet Access Cut Off By 'State Party'
Enlarge this image toggle caption Markus Schreiber/AP Markus Schreiber/AP
Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET on Oct. 18
The activist organization WikiLeaks says the Internet connection for its founder, Julian Assange, has been severed by what it called a "state party."
The accusation came in a tweet early Monday.
A subsequent tweet accused Ecuador of cutting off Assange's Internet access.
The WikiLeaks founder has been living at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for more than four years. As The Two-Way has reported, Assange sought refuge there after Sweden issued a warrant for his arrest to question him over allegations of sex crimes. He has said that if sent to Sweden, he fears he would be handed over to the U.S. and could face trial over the release of classified U.S. material on WikiLeaks.
An NPR call and email to WikiLeaks were not returned. The Associated Press reported on its efforts to corroborate the Internet outage accusation:
"Calls, texts and emails left with WikiLeaks weren't immediately returned Monday. A woman who picked up the phone at the [Ecuadorean] embassy said: 'I cannot disclose any information.' An email to Ecuador's ambassador wasn't immediately answered. London's Metropolitan Police declined comment. ... "Ecuador's foreign minister, Guillaume Long, approached by The Associated Press on the sidelines of a United Nations conference in Quito on Monday, declined to comment when asked about Assange."
A brief statement posted by Long's office on Twitter Monday evening did not mention Assange's access to the internet, but referenced the "speculation of the last few hours" in reaffirming that his asylum status at the embassy remained valid.
On Saturday, WikiLeaks published another round of emails purportedly linked to John Podesta, chairman of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign, NPR's Meg Anderson reported.
Here's more from Meg:
"This batch was the eighth installment of what WikiLeaks says are Podesta's emails, and the controversial organization claims to have more than 50,000 emails in total that they plan to release. "The Clinton campaign has not confirmed that the hacked emails are real, and NPR has not been able to confirm their authenticity, but the campaign has linked the hack to Russia and says Moscow is interfering with the election to promote Donald Trump's candidacy. ... "If the emails are authentic, they provide insight into the private conversations happening at the highest levels of the Clinton campaign. So far, those conversations have included how to defend Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and potential problematic excerpts from her Wall Street speeches."
At a press conference on Oct. 4, Assange said via video link that WikiLeaks would be releasing information he felt was relevant to the U.S. election beginning that week, and that he hoped the organization would "be publishing every week for the next 10 weeks," leading up to and through the Nov. 8 presidential vote.
I get jittery when everyone is on the same side of an issue. Like Rob Ford's subway. So let me take a stab at a contrary view.
What if Ford's right?
He wouldn't be right for especially good reasons ‚Äî though he has exhibited many fine qualities over the years, he still seems deeply unintelligent, and the Sheppard line is an odd one to be nailing your colours to ‚Äî but it wouldn't be the first time someone was on the right side of an issue for the wrong reasons.
What's giving me these unsettling little glimmers of doubt are a couple of books I read in the last couple of years. Unbuilt Toronto and Unbuilt Toronto II by Mark Osbaldeston are about what hasn't happened in this city, and in them ‚Äî among the tales of genius architects snubbed and neighbourhoods not razed to make room for highways ‚Äî are story after story, from the beginning of municipal history until extremely recently, of the ambitious being trumped by the practical, decisions made out of consideration of what is ‚Äúappropriate and practical.‚Äù Sometimes it's the politicians, sometimes it's the citizenry, but the reasoning is always the same.
Take Vimy Circle, for instance. It was meant to honour our war dead and would have made up a part of a ceremonial Federal Avenue running directly from City Hall to Union Station. A grand avenue of the sort that gives a city a sense of pride in itself, in its contributions to the world, the sport that eventually connects a place to its history.
People liked the idea, but in the end, the city figured it wasn't necessary that there were more efficient, less costly ways of achieving the same basic ends.
We've even visited this subway question before, twice, once when we almost built a subway system a full four decades before we actually did, and again, when it was called Network 2011 in the 1980s, that would have built lines along Eglinton and Queen.
So when I hear the eminently reasonable arguments from Ford's various opponents, and from this transit panel, about how much less expensive the LRT would be, how much easier to build, how it's the right thing for right now, it rankles. I've heard this before. It's Vimy all over again.
Cities are not businesses. They do not need to show a profit, or even break, They are, unlike businesses, meant to be around for centuries, and are meant to serve their population. This is often expensive, with today's governments needing to make commitments on future generations' behalf.
Ford's stupidity comes in how he sees paying for all the subway he wants. As we've seen in Denver and Los Angeles, people are often happy to pay for good transit, for transit they can get excited about. There's nothing more inherently evil about taxes than there is about ticket prices at the ACC. We may quibble with the amount, but we don't try to argue that we shouldn't be paying at all. But the Fords are nothing if not ignorant populists, second-guessing their constituency, and convincing a good number of them, just as they convince themselves, that peppy-sounding rhetoric is actually reasoning.
Torontonians are practical to a fault. We have been for centuries, and our waterfront, our public buildings, our cultural centres and our main streets are testament to the fact. They all work, and in fact we do wonderful things with them, but we suffer from a real deficit of grand. Our opera house, a brick schoolhouse with a picture window, is only the most recent sin of omission. I took a trip to Winnipeg a few months ago. I'd always thought of High Park as a place I really should spend more time in, but after visiting Winnipeg's much more effortful version, Assiniboine Park, I realized the reason I didn't spend more time there is that it's kind of a crap park. They've put very little effort into the landscaping, amenities, anything that might make it attractive enough to cross town for.
But we're getting better. The last 10 years, though still not that architecturally impressive, have seen enormous improvements to the urban fabric of Toronto. And if the renderings on the hoardings around town are any indication, even the architecture's going to be getting better, or at least more interesting, in the next decade. Could it be time to raid the piggy bank, not to steal from our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, but to invest in the city they'll be taking over. That city's not going to be any smaller than this one.
Are you familiar with the idea of desire lines? They're those worn-down paths in parks, the ones that branch of from sidewalks and cut across the grass, between the trees, a people's hypotenuse. In Finland, I hear, when the city wants to pave some new paths, they send workers out right after a fresh snow, to see where people are walking. Desire lines are any paths, roads or other routes, officially acknowledged or not, that people exhibit a preference for.
There's a lovely map, created by cartographer Eric Fischer, that tracks Toronto's desire lines based on their geotagged tweets. True, not everyone tweets, and not everyone who tweets geotags their tweets. But those who do have not been shown to have drastically different traveling patterns than those who don't. The great thing about Fischer's maps ‚Äî he's done the same thing for several cities ‚Äî is that they make those desire lines look very much like veins and arteries. It lends itself nicely to the metaphor of the city as a body that needs circulation to survive and thrive, and as a city grows, it needs to encourage that blood supply.
At the moment, without a unifying transit system, if I'm not on my bike, I'm very unlikely to decide to zip over from the Annex to Roncesvalles if I know I have to transfer to a bus at Dundas West station, or take the subway to Osgoode and transfer to a streetcar that could take anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes to arrive. There are parts of the city, like the Bayview strip, for instance, that I almost never go to for this very reason. There are other sections, like Windfields, say, or Bendale, that are off the radar for everyone who didn't live or work there, and the Peanut Plaza, a wonder of an independent neighbourhood mall, is, I'm sure, still a mystery to most. If I could walk down into one subway station, and come out at another, transfers or not, I'd be going to the Peanut Plaza and bringing home some Allan's hardo bread way more often. I'm sure others would, too.
It can be difficult to put your finger on what's not there; it's much easier to criticize or praise something that is. But books like Osbaldeston's do let us see the patterns. You never go too wrong with appropriate and practical, but you never go too right, either.

There's been a lot of celebrating in the Chinese state media about the sentencing of former Communist Party high-flyer Bo Xilai to life in prison.
Getty Images Xi Jinping and his allies have been tackling corruption and improving efficiency within the party.
Many observers outside of China have said for months that getting past the problems of Bo would finally allow the Party leadership under Xi Jinping to proceed with the sort of reforms the system is crying out for.
A front-page commentary in Monday's People's Daily seemed to agree, stating that ‚Äúthe use of law to oppose corruption is already reflecting a civilized politics, and solidifies a more general consensus in society‚Äù about how to cope with the misconduct of cadres and other shortcomings.
But politics might not stay civilized for long. Possibly the biggest impact Bo has had on Chinese politics is to distract and delay the leadership from making tough decisions ahead of the Party plenum scheduled for November‚Äîa major meeting that will need to resolve what sort of reform Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants to see.
Among the many questions left unaddressed: Just how committed is this leadership to pushing through serious economic reforms?
The answer to that question remains unclear. While jailing Bo would seem to slam the door on the so-called ‚ÄúChongqing Model‚Äù for China's development, we've not seen an alternative economic template emerge, either. In fact, there's still been little sign in the Party media of a more general and open debate about how China should confront its slowing growth and mounting debt.
The focus for the leadership at large seems to be everywhere but economics.
Dear UVic,
I have a confession: I'm a nerd. That's right; a pun-loving, glasses-wearing, life-long learner, a lover of science and politics and all things academic. I am involved in departmental clubs and avidly uninteresting at parties unless I have someone to talk to about some article they just read or the latest weird science-y news. I have always been the teacher's pet, and I am that person who will stop in the hallway to chat up my professors or go for a beer with my past teaching assistants whose books I have borrowed.
Despite this nerdy passion, something is getting in the way of my love of learning, and I'm not talking expensive textbooks, food plans, or tuition fees that just won't quit. What I'm about to admit is profoundly upsetting for anyone in my position . . . but I think I might have chosen the wrong place for post-secondary.
I mean, based on my interests, it sounds like I should be at least a promising university candidate. Right? The University of Victoria is supposed to be a world renowned centre of research that welcomes nerds like me with open arms. In the beginning, it was like that; you could say it was love at first sight. My first-year professors were inspirational world-travellers who left me feeling empowered, like I could change the world and be the next Al Gore. By second year, most of my faculty knew me on a first name basis. I was involved in clubs and other clever department acronyms. I knew my office administrator's life story, I knew which professors were doing research projects over the summer, and I received glowing recommendations from faculty for upcoming exchange opportunities . . . the future looked bright.
But I'm not coming back. Nope. This nerd can't do it. You know why? Because I'm having panic attacks about what might happen to my mental health if I end up living in a basement suite with no windows, no heat, and four small screaming children living upstairs . . . again. Or worse: I could be living in a tent, which is what one of my friends was forced to do for two weeks last semester. Or, even worse: I could end up in the homeless shelter, which is where one student told me he was living as he desperately asked when he could come check out my $600 per month illegal windowless room in an unfinished basement located 40 minutes away from the university.
It doesn't help when I call my friends from Kamloops, Calgary, or Quebec about these problems. (Sorry, we're saying ‚Äòchallenges' these days, right?) They tell me something along the lines of ‚ÄúI'm so sorry. My house is great, and I found it in August. Have you tried looking earlier, like July?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúMaybe you should join the gym to work out some stress.‚Äù That's a good idea, I say; except we have to pay more than $200 per year for a full gym pass. At this point, there is usually the deep, awkward silence of disbelief and pity over the phone, and I can't help wondering why on earth I chose to study at what seems to be the only university in Canada where it's next to impossible to find housing and you have to pay that much for a gym.
So, as I was looking up tenant rights, B.C. building codes, and panicking over where I might live next year, I remembered the new motion that Victoria mayor Lisa Helps proposed on April 2 which would allow people sleeping in their vehicles to be exempted from getting ticketed. This was great news for more than a few friends who had put time and effort into making a liveable travelling van as a solution to the housing crisis, only to find out they had nowhere to park it.
Which brings us to where I am now: writing this open letter after having seriously decided that taking a year off to work and build a tiny house is actually a good solution to the total insanity that is finding a place to live in Victoria. The fact is that this city has less than a 0.5 per cent vacancy rate, and I'm not willing to risk my mental health for an overpriced illegal basement suite living with screaming children any more (for which, of course, I will have to find a subletter ‚Äî and then do the whole process over again next year, and the year after that).
Essentially, I would rather stop going to school to build a tiny house to live in so that I can afford to go back to school. I've done the math. Logistically, this is actually a reasonable option for anyone willing to put in the time and effort into a longer-term lifestyle change. And you know what? As ridiculous as it sounds, I think it would be a great change for a lot of students who are struggling to pay ridiculous amounts of rent for illegal suites. Because it's not fair for me, as a student, to be worrying about having a roof over my head and a quiet place to study on top of actual academics. How am I supposed to concentrate on deadlines and grades when I'm trying to figure out my tenant rights and go to dispute resolution with my landlords during finals season every year? And between all of this, I'm still trying to feed myself, find part-time jobs, and be a functioning human.
The only part about UVic that I'll miss while I'm building my tiny house is CARSA. It's a shame I won't have the option of paying more than $200 per year to lift things up and put them back down again to relieve the catastrophic stress that being a student here has put me through.
I'm not upset, just disappointed.
Love,
Sonia Hrynchyshyn

Cave Story meets Conker's Bad Fur Day
meets A storyline that's simple on the surface yet complicated if you look closer
Huge world where you're free to go where you want filled with side-quests
Available for windows, mac and PS4 if stretch goal is reached
The game is set in a vast world filled with a great variety places and creatures. The world contains everything from glittery and beautiful beings, to the most disgusting piece of filth you can imagine.
explore, grind and slay into endless hours. Search for the strangest, coolest weapons and loot while meeting creatures you will never forget.
Behind every creature, place and object there is a unique story connecting it to the world in its own way. One of our goals is to be able to voice every character in the game. We already have a huge amount of characters we are looking forward to bringing to life.
The content you see so far is only the start. We are already working on increasing the visuals drastically, and improving the gameplay to greater heights. We use the concepts alot, and aim to get pretty close to them visually.
We will release a demo as soon as we can, but we want to work more on the gameplay and visuals before we do this.
We are sorry about the difficulties with using Norwegian Kroner.

Looked upon as the ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù he is sent on a quest to seek the lost logan stones. Growing up as the special frog Finch grew into a cocky personality and cares more for himself than anyone else, but he is still the frogs only hope for survival.
We draw a lot of inspirations from the games we played in our childhood. When working on the level design Super Metroid is a great inspiration, while Conker's Bad Fur Day is our main inspiration for the character development. For our setting we've looked at Zelda Ocarina of Time for inspiration. We want to make a game that appeals to the player the same way these games did to us when we played them for the first time.

CAMBRIDGE ‚Äî Former US secretary of state John F. Kerry said he didn't want to get ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù in his address Wednesday to graduates at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. And then he excoriated President Trump and the nation's political discourse in one of his most political speeches since leaving office.
In front of hundreds of graduates and their families, Kerry said that while acknowledging the celebratory day, he did not want to ‚Äúinsult your intelligence by pretending that it's smooth sailing for America and the world.‚Äù
Kerry joked that in the past, the way to get ahead in government was to run for office or attend the Kennedy School, but ‚Äúwith this White House I'd say, buy Rosetta Stone and learn Russian.‚Äù
Advertisement
‚ÄúAnd the truth is ‚Äì no, this is not a normal time,‚Äù Kerry said. ‚ÄúIt's not normal to see a president of the United States decrying ‚Äòso-called judges.' It's not normal for the leader of the country that invented the First Amendment to routinely degrade and even threaten journalists. And no, it's not normal to see the head of the FBI fired summarily because he was investigating connections between Russia and the presidential campaign of the very man who fired him.

‚ÄúAnd it's not normal that when you close your eyes and listen to the news, too often the political back and forth in America sounds too much like it does in the kinds of countries that the State Department warns Americans not to travel to,‚Äù he continued.
After serving as secretary of state during Barack Obama's second term, the former longtime senator has made Massachusetts home again, changed vacation residences from Nantucket to Martha's Vineyard. He has also taken official roles at Yale University and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Kerry described today's political environment as not that different from the divided country during the anti-communist witch hunts of McCarthyism and Watergate. Though these are dark analogies, he said, he was hopeful because even in those times the nation's institutions ‚Äî whether it be media or even individual senators ‚Äî worked to preserve the country.
In fact, Kerry noted that there was only one time when these institutions could not prevent a full crisis: the Civil War.
Advertisement
‚ÄúYou know what, I don't think even Andrew Jackson could've stopped that one,‚Äù joked Kerry in a reference to Trump's quip weeks ago that Jackson, who owned slaves and died 16 years before the Civil War began, could have stopped the war if he had lived later.
Kerry expressed optimism about the nation's institutions, but he also acknowledged there are real challenges and anxieties in the country, particularly for those people who may have voted for Trump.
Kerry argued that it isn't free trade but breakneck technological changes that led to a massive job loss, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
‚ÄúSure ‚Äì yes, technology is transformative, but if it was your job that disappeared and nothing replaced it ‚Äì guess what,‚Äù Kerry asked. ‚ÄúYou'll find zero comfort in the fact that the same technology that eliminated your job also gave you a smartphone that lets you binge-watch a future that's out of reach for you and everyone you grew up with.
‚ÄúWhat concerns me is that if our institutions can't build consensus and respond to the demand of Americans for jobs today ‚Äî how are we ever going to do it in a time when artificial intelligence and robotics kick in and five times that number of jobs disappear twice as fast?‚Äù he said.

He also talked at length about American political culture, climate change, and global terrorism.
This week the Harvard campus served as a reunion of sorts for several former Obama administration officials. Former vice president Joe Biden spoke to college graduates, and former deputy attorney general Sally Yates addressed the graduating class at Harvard Law school.

Purdue mycologists Catherine Aime and Jorge D√≠az-Valderrama examine cultures of Moniliophthora roreri, the fungus that causes frosty pod rot. (Purdue Agricultural Communication/Tom Campbell)

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - A fungal disease that poses a serious threat to cacao plants - the source of chocolate - reproduces clonally, Purdue University researchers find.
The fungus Moniliophthora roreri causes frosty pod rot, a disease that has decimated cacao plantations through much of the Americas. Because M. roreri belongs to a group of fungi that produces mushrooms - the fruit of fungal sex - many researchers and cacao breeders believed the fungus reproduced sexually.
But a study by Purdue mycologists Catherine Aime and Jorge D√≠az-Valderrama shows that M. roreri generates billions of cocoa pod-destroying spores by cloning, even though it has two mating types - the fungal equivalent of sexes - and seemingly functional mating genes.
The findings could help improve cacao breeding programs and shed light on the fungal mechanisms that produce mushrooms.
"This fungus is phenomenally unusual - it has mating types but doesn't undergo sexual reproduction," said D√≠az-Valderrama, doctoral student in mycology. "This knowledge is biologically and economically valuable as we seek better insights into how mushrooms come about and how we can reduce this disease's damage to the cocoa industry."
Cocoa is one of the few major crops produced almost entirely by small farms, and the instability of cocoa prices often makes fungicides a risky investment for growers. Instead, many growers opt to regularly monitor their crop for symptoms of frosty pod rot, burying pods that display the telltale dark lesions or white dusting to prevent further dispersal of fungal spores.

Over the last 60 years, the disease has spread - likely through unwitting transportation of infected pods - through much of South America, all of Central America and into Mexico. Frosty pod rot has dropped cocoa yields in some areas by up to 100 percent, forcing many growers to abandon their plantations altogether. Brazil is the only cocoa-producing country in the continental Americas untouched by frosty pod rot, whose pernicious effects have spurred the majority of global cacao production to relocate to West Africa. These regions remain highly vulnerable to the disease, D√≠az-Valderrama said.
Understanding the fundamental biology of the fungus could help disease control efforts, but researchers have long been stumped by M. roreri's reproductive habits, which seem to deviate from those of sister species.
Fungal reproduction is complicated. Instead of male and female sexes, fungi can have a vast number of different mating types, leading to a wide and varied range of potential mates - up to 20,000 in some species. But many fungi also reproduce clonally under favorable conditions, simply copying their genome and producing billions of offspring.
Digging into the genomics and population genetics of M. roreri, Aime and D√≠az-Valderrama found indications that the fungus might be able to sexually reproduce: It has two seemingly compatible mating types and what appear to be functional sex pheromone receptors. But they couldn't find any evidence that the mating types were recombining in the field or lab, and no records of M. roreri mushrooms exist - signs that the fungus has ditched sexual reproduction in favor of cloning.
"Fungi usually start reproducing via cloning when they're very well suited for their environment," said Aime, associate professor of mycology. "In terms of resources, sex is expensive while cloning is a cheap and easy way to produce a lot of offspring."
The researchers found both mating types in South America and only one type in Central America. This supports the hypothesis that the disease originated in South America and was more recently introduced into Central America where it rapidly spread through clonal reproduction.
The study also shows that what some researchers believed to be different varieties of the fungus are actually genetic variations in the two mating types. The findings open the door for breeding programs to investigate which mating type is more virulent and possibly develop resistant cacao cultivars.
In the meantime, chocolate lovers should stay calm, D√≠az-Valderrama said.
"We're working on identifying biochemical components that could be useful for controlling frosty pod rot and protecting vulnerable cacao-growing regions."
The study was published in Heredity and is available to journal subscribers and on-campus readers at http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/hdy20165a.html.
The research was funded by the Purdue Department of Botany and Plant Pathology.

ABSTRACT The cacao pathogen Moniliophthora roreri (Marasmiaceae) possesses biallelic A and B mating loci but reproduces clonally J.R. D√≠az-Valderrama 1; M.C. Aime 1 1 Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA E-mail: jdiazval@purdue.edu The cacao pathogen Moniliophthora roreri belongs to the mushroom-forming family Marasmiaceae, but it has never been observed to produce a fruiting body, which calls to question its capacity for sexual reproduction. In this study, we identified potential A (HD1 and HD2) and B (pheromone precursors and pheromone receptors) mating genes in M. roreri. A PCR-based method was subsequently devised to determine the mating type for a set of 47 isolates from across the geographic range of the fungus. We developed and generated an 11-marker microsatellite set and conducted association and linkage disequilibrium (standardized index of association IAS) analyses. We also performed an ancestral reconstruction analysis to show that the ancestor of M. roreri is predicted to be heterothallic and tetrapolar, which together with sliding window analyses support that the A and B mating loci are likely unlinked and follow a tetrapolar organization within the genome. The locus is composed of a pair of HD1 and HD2 genes, whereas the B locus consists of a paired pheromone precursor, Mr_Ph4, and receptor, STE3_Mr4. Two A and B alleles but only two mating types were identified. Association analyses divided isolates into two well-defined genetically distinct groups that correlate with their mating type: IAS values show high linkage disequilibrium as is expected in clonal reproduction. Interestingly, both mating types were found in South American isolates but only one mating type was found in Central American isolates, supporting a prior hypothesis of clonal dissemination throughout Central America after a single or very few introductions of the fungus from South America.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday promised that the United States would review all actions taken by Iran on account of its "alarming ongoing provocations" aimed at destabilizing the Middle East and US interests there.
Among the key policies to fall under review was the nuclear deal brokered in 2015 between Iran and world powers, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the agreement, negotiated during Barack Obama's presidency, Iran agreed to place limits on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
Tillerson's comments on Wednesday came just a day after the State Department said Iran is complying with the nuclear agreement. The US government must present a report on Tehran's compliance with the deal every 90 days, and Tuesday's update was the first conducted by President Donald Trump's administration.
Watch video 02:28 Many Iranians have yet to feel sanctions relief
However, addressing reporters in Washington, Tillerson branded the deal a failure, adding that Trump had ordered a review to evaluate whether the lifting of sanctions was "vital to the national security interests of the United States."
While Tillerson said the United States would not intend to walk away from the landmark accord, he argued the deal was merely a way for Iran to delay the development of a nuclear weapon.
The JCPOA "fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran," the top US diplomat said. "This deal represents the same failed approach of the past that brought us to the current imminent threat we face from North Korea."
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif responded on Twitter, accusing the US of making excuses to avoid implementing its side of the deal.
During the presidential campaign, Trump described the nuclear accord with Iran "the worst deal ever negotiated."
Iran's regional rivals Israel and Saudi Arabia have also decried the accord for not forcing Iran to shut down its nuclear industry completely nor forever.
Top diplomats from leading powers labeled the Iran deal "historic"
Strengthening the grip on Tehran?
However, while Washington may not be prepared to completely break with the accord and re-introduce sanctions lifted as part of the deal, it could impose new penalties against Iran for its alleged sponsorship of terrorist organizations in other countries.
"We have to look at Iran in a comprehensive way in terms of the threat it poses and all areas of the region and the world. And the JCPOA is one element of that," Tillerson said. "So we are going to review completely the JCPOA itself... It is another example of buying off a power who has nuclear ambitions and we buy them off for a short period of time and someone has to deal with it later."
Tillerson's comments echoed those of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who during a visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday said Tehran's destabilizing influence in the Middle East would need to be overcome to foster a peaceful solution in Yemen.

dm/sms (Reuters, AFP)
Scientists have identified the cluster of genes responsible for reproductive traits in the Primula flower, first noted as important by Charles Darwin more than 150 years ago.
Darwin hypothesised that some plant species with two distinct forms of flower, where male and female reproductive organs were of differing lengths, had evolved that way to promote out-crossing by insect pollinators.
His ground-breaking insight into the significance of the two forms of flower known as ‚Äòpins' and ‚Äòthrums' coined the term ‚Äòheterostyly', and subsequent studies contributed to the foundation of modern genetic theory.
And now scientists at the University of East Anglia, working at the John Innes Centre, have identified exactly which part of these species' genetic code made them that way, through an event that occurred more than 51 million years ago.
Prof Philip Gilmartin from UEA's School of Biological Sciences said: ‚ÄúTo identify the genes which control the biology noted by Darwin is an exciting moment. Many studies have been done over the past decades to explore the genetic basis of this phenomenon but now we have pinpointed the supergene directly responsible, the S locus.‚Äù
Supergenes are clusters of closely-associated genes which are always inherited together as a unit and allow complex biology to be controlled. Researchers worked with the Earlham Institute to map the plant's genes and sequence the Primula genome to find the specific gene cluster responsible for creating the differing flower morphs.
Prof Gilmartin said: ‚ÄúNot only did we identify the supergene but we found it is specific to just one of the flower forms, the thrum. This insight has profound implications for our understanding of a key evolutionary innovation of flowering plants.
‚ÄúUnderstanding of the genetics which underpin flower development and reproduction of a species broadens our knowledge about the entire system of pollination, which underpins biodiversity and food security.
‚ÄúWith challenges such as climate change and its effects on plants, crops and their insect pollinators, it's even more important to understand pollination mechanisms and how species can and will react.
In their hunt for the genes controlling heterostyly, researchers also managed to date the original mutation, to 51.7 million years ago.
Having found the S locus, they realised the gene was a close relative to another, identified six years ago as responsible for controlling the identity of petals on a Primula flower.
At some point this gene duplicated, inserted itself in the S locus, and mutated to control the position of the anther in the flower. Finding this duplicated gene allowed the team to date how long ago the mutation occurred for the first time.
Prof Gilmartin has been researching the origins of heterostyly for a large part of his career. He said: ‚ÄúThis study answers some of the crucial questions that have been asked since Darwin's time, and for me since I bought my first packet of Primula seeds twenty years ago.‚Äù
The study ‚ÄòGenetic architecture and evolution of the S locus supergene in Primula vulgaris' is published in the journal Nature Plants, on Friday 2 December 2016.

Trump praised Putin on Friday for deciding not to retaliate against a series of measures ordered by President Obama the previous day.
The sanctions announced by the Obama administration were in response to the Moscow-backed hacking of Democratic groups whose stolen documents were published in the months leading up to Trump's electoral win.

Those measures include sanctions against Russia's two leading intelligence services and four top officers; the ejection of 35 Russian intelligence operatives and their families from the U.S.; and the closing of two estates in New York and Maryland believed to be used by Russia for intelligence activities.
On Friday, Russian officials threatened retaliatory measures, but Putin said he would instead wait until the start of the Trump administration.
Trump tweeted about the delay Friday, writing, "Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"

From HuffPost:
Daniel McGowan may have been the first person thrown in solitary confinement for writing a HuffPost blog. Now he'll be the first person to sue the Bureau of Prisons over it.
The environmental activist and former prisoner filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against the prison system over an April 2013 incident in which U.S. Marshals threw him in a Brooklyn federal jail ‚Äî ironically, for criticizing earlier violations of his free speech.
‚ÄúThe Bureau of Prisons does not like criticism and their reaction was unsurprisingly to try and crush someone who stepped out of line,‚Äù McGowan told HuffPost Tuesday in an email.
After a federal judge labeled him a terrorist in 2007 for arson committed with the Earth Liberation Front, McGowan spent years in some of the federal prison system's most restrictive prisons, the communication management units (CMUs). The Bureau of Prisons denies it, but internal prison files strongly suggest McGowan was placed there because of his continued outspoken association with the environmental movement.
Serving the final months of his sentence in a Brooklyn halfway house in 2013, McGowan continued to speak out. He detailed how he was placed in the isolated special prisons in a HuffPost blog entry.
Three days after writing that post, the marshals threw him in the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center. He was placed in solitary and told that he would be soon taken back to one of the CMUs. Inmates call them ‚ÄúLittle Guantanamo.‚Äù
‚ÄúI had just served over five years in prison and was acclimating to life on the outside only to be yanked back to prison,‚Äù McGowan said. ‚ÄúIt was terrifying.‚Äù
After his lawyers interceded, McGowan was released the next day back to the halfway house. But in a separate, multi-plaintiff lawsuit against the Bureau of Prisons for how it creates and runs CMUs, McGowan's lawyers argued that the entire incident was a startling example of their larger claim that the special units are used to punish political speech. Even the federal government later admitted in that case that McGowan was jailed contrary to the established law that inmates may write articles under their own bylines.
Although a judge dismissed McGowan's claims in the lawsuit against the CMUs in July 2013, he is now forging on against the Bureau of Prisons for what he says was a case of unconstitutional retaliation.
‚ÄúMcGowan was arrested for his criticism of the government, plain and simple,‚Äù his lawyer David Rankin told HuffPost in an email. ‚ÄúCommunication management units are wrong now, they were wrong then, and trying to tell that to the world should not get you thrown back in prison.‚Äù

ATLANTA (AP) ‚Äî Gov. Nathan Deal could deal another major blow to conservatives in the Republican-dominated Legislature as lawmakers await his decision on another controversial piece of legislation: a bill to allow college and university students ages 21 and up to carry a concealed handgun on campus with a permit.
Rep. Buzz Brockway, a Republican from Lawrenceville, co-sponsored the bill, but said he did not want to predict which way the governor would lean.
Brockway also said he did not think the veto of the religious exemption bill earlier this week would weigh into Deal's decision.
"I don't think folks like retribution, or revenge in politics, so if he chooses to disagree, we will just roll up our sleeves and work harder," he said.
Brockway cited Deal's strong relationship with the Legislature, saying that even if the bill is vetoed, he does not see how it would have any impact on Deal's support from Republican lawmakers.
House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams said she could not speculate on a reaction from Deal's supporters on the right, but said the core group that lobbied for the bill would be impacted. She then said that the bill was not brought to the table by the entirety of the Republican base in the House, but by a smaller special interest group.
"I can say (Deal) raised some thoughtful and important concerns expressed both by House and Senate Democrats about the expansive nature of the legislation," said Abrams, D-Atlanta. "There is no urgency to the passage of this bill."
Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.Org, has been a strong supporter of the bill. He said if Deal vetoes the measure, it will hurt his reputation as a champion of the Second Amendment.
"For 35 years, he has had an A-plus rating from NRA, and now he could veto a good gun bill," Henry said.
As with the religious exemption bill, Deal has also been pressured from outside groups to kill the measure. Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, says it will spend $25,000 on ads running Thursday through Monday in metro Atlanta.
Henry said the outcry is part of Bloomberg's efforts to fund anti-gun advocacy around the country.
"I don't think it's necessarily right to buy your rights away from you and if he is successful buying your Second Amendment rights, what rights will he go after next?" Henry said.
Another campus-related bill allowing students to carry electroshock weapons on campus is currently sitting on the governor's desk. Brockway was the primary sponsor of this bill, and said he believes the governor will view handguns and stun guns as two separate measures.
"The campus carry bill is a Second Amendment issue, and the stun gun bill, while related, is more about personal protection," Brockway said.
Deal has until May 3 to sign or veto the bill, or else it becomes law by default.
Apple's esthetic police headed by Jonathan Ive have been hard at work inventing ways to kill off device housing apertures for good. Apple has been thinking of killing off iDevice speaker grills by having sound carry through specialized cover glass . They're switching to the audio connector working with the Lightning port to kill off the standard audio jack aperture . And now Apple wants to add to their collection of apertures killing methods by having light transmissive fillers fill holes when not in use so as to appear as if they're not really there. Do you think that Apple's idea is just a little farfetched? If you do, then think again, because Apple's current wireless keyboard for the iMac already uses this invention. In a way this would make it a patent fulfilled, though Apple's invention talks about taking this idea further to other devices. After checking out my iMac's keyboard indicator light when off and on, I was rather surprised at just how well this invention really works.
Apple's Patent Background
Conventionally, a portable electronic device has a housing that encases various electrical components of the portable electronic device. Often, the portable electronic device has one or more indicator lights. For example, the housing can include a small hole through which light can be expelled when an indicator light is to be provided. The indicator lights can be used for various purposes, such as for a status indication or an alert to be provided to a user of the portable electronic device. Examples of common indicator lights include a battery charging indicator light, a power-on indicator light, etc. Unfortunately, however, the holes in the housing for the indicator lights are visible and cosmetically unappealing when the indicator lights are not use.
Apple Invents Method of Camouflaging Apertures in iDevices and Beyond
Techniques and apparatus for providing one or more holes in a housing for an electronic device. The one or more holes in the housing can be used to facilitate visual indicators. A light source can be controlled to provide light into a hole and thus emit light from the hole. When the light source is not providing light to the hole, the hole can be visually disguised (e.g., camouflaged) so it blends with the surrounding portions of the housing. The electronic device can, for example, be a small electronic device, such as a portable or handheld electronic device.
Embodiments of the invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a method, system, device, or apparatus. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.
As an electronic device, one embodiment can, for example, include at least: a housing having an outer exposed surface with at least one hole extending therethrough, the housing at least partially covering an inner region; a light source provided within the inner region and proximate to the at least one hole; a light transmissive filler provided in the hole; and light reflective material selectively provided in or on the light transmissive filler.
As a method for camouflaging an indicator hole in an outer housing for an electronic device, one embodiment can, for example, include at least: filling at least a portion of the indicator hole with a transparent material to seal the indicator hole; and selectively providing light reflective material in or on the transparent material provided in the indicator hole.
As a consumer electronic device, one embodiment can, for example, include at least: a housing having an outer exposed surface with at least one hole extending therethrough, the housing at least partially covering an inner region; a light source provided within the inner region and proximate to the at least one hole; a controller provided within the inner region and operatively coupled to the light source to control when the light source emits light; a polymer filler provided in the hole; and ink selectively provided in or on the polymer filler.
Apple's patent FIG. 2B noted below is a cross-sectional diagram of a portion of an iPhone (electronic device #200) in an illuminated state in which light produced by the light source #210 is projected through the hole. In patent FIG. 2C an iPhone illustrates a non-illuminated state in which a portion of incoming external ambient light is reflected by the light reflective material #218 to produce reflected ambient light #242. The reflected ambient light can provide a visual impression that the hole or aperture isn't present. In other words, when the light source is inactive, the hole is disguised whereby the user does not visually perceive the existence of the hole.
As a result, the light reflective material allows the hole in the housing member to be disguised or camouflaged while the light indication is not being provided. Apple notes that the light reflective material comprises a plurality of micro dots of ink.
Apple's patent FIG. 3 illustrated below is a housing indication process.
Apple notes that the reflective elements can disguise or camouflage the hole in a device as shown in patent FIG. 7 below. The number, size, shape and spacing of the reflective elements can vary widely with implementation. Through the use of inks in one or more colors and in one or more layers, there is a great deal of flexibility for the visual appearance of the hole to appear any color. Hence, the visual appearance of the hole #704 (when the light indication is inactive) can take on any desired color.
Apple lastly notes that the techniques and apparatus described in their invention may be applied to housings used by any of a variety of electronic devices including but not limited handheld electronic devices, portable electronic devices and substantially stationary electronic devices. Examples of these include any known consumer electronic device that includes a display. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the electronic device may correspond to media players, mobile phones (e.g., cellular phones, smart phones), PDAs, remote controls, netbooks, notebooks, tablet PCs, gaming controllers, monitors, all in one computer like the iMac and the like.
Apple's patent application which was published today by the US Patent Office was originally filed on June 19, 2013. Apple credits Kroghahl, Ng and Rimple as the inventors.

African giant pouched rats‚Äîhuge, cat-size rodents native to central Africa‚Äîhave bad vision but an extraordinary sense of smell.
This makes them perfect candidates for discovering hidden landmines by sniffing out the explosive TNT. Even decades after conflict, explosive remnants of war linger in the earth, maiming and killing thousands of people who stumble across them each year.
In 2013, mines and other buried explosives caused 3,308 casualties worldwide‚Äîdown from 4,325 in 2012, according to the 2014 Landmine Monitor report.
Finding these hidden explosives is challenging and dangerous: People with metal detectors not only risk their lives, they work slowly, stopping to investigate every suspicious ping. Trained dogs, while commonly used, are expensive and tough to transport. (Read more about dogs, rats, and bees on the hunt for landmines.)
Enter APOPO, a Belgian nonprofit that has created an army of TNT-sniffing African giant pouched rats. These critters are light enough to walk over the mines without setting them off, and use their noses to find the explosives quickly.
One rat can search over 2000 square feet (200 square meters) in 20 minutes, an area that could take a human up to four days, APOPO training manager Abdullah Ramadhan says in an email.
Since APOPO was founded in 1997, these furry super-sniffers have helped clear 13,200 mines from minefields in Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, and, most recently, in Cambodia. (Learn about Cambodia's recovery from landmines' scourge.)
A Different Kind of Rat Race
Training the rats to sniff out landmines isn't easy, though.
For one thing, the rodents need to learn how to be around humans, starting at infancy. For another, they don't respond to verbal commands, so the trainers have to teach them that hearing a click means they get a food reward.
The last step is hooking the critters up to harnesses and teaching them how to walk on a rope grid in the field.
When the trained rats find a landmine, they stop and scratch at the TNT-scented spot, which the human de-miners mark and come back later to excavate. If they find a mine, they detonate it on site.
This whole training process takes about nine months for every rat. And there's a downside‚Äîthe animals only live about eight years, which means a lot of training for an animal with a relatively short time span.
Ramadhan says that the landmine-sniffing rats have already made a big difference in the places where they work. (Related: "Giant Rats Trained to Sniff Out Tuberculosis in Africa.")
For instance, in Cambodia, nearly 50 percent of communities say that landmines hurt their livelihoods by restricting the land they could otherwise use for building or farming, according to a government report.

One of the proposed logos for the Open Hardware Definition Version 1.0 of the Open Source Hardware Definition (OSHW definition), first initiated in July 2010, has now been published. Originally planned as a singular licence, the process expanded to cover a range of licences by creating a definition of what open source hardware is. The OSHW definition attempts to codify a definition for hardware that has a design made publicly available for others to study, modify, distribute, make or sell things based on that design.
The definition, based in part on the OSI's Open Source Definition, covers the requirements for availability of documentation, necessary software and optional attribution. It also covers what attributes the licence used should have such as not being specific to a product, not restricting other hardware or software and being technology neutral.
However, the OSHW definition does come with an important caveat; in the USA copyright does not apply to electronic designs, unlike software, and are covered by patents instead. Because of this an Open Hardware licence "can in general be used to restrict the plans but probably not the manufactured devices".
Despite this, a number of organisations and individuals involved in open hardware have endorsed the definition; more endorsements from organisations and individuals are welcomed. A logo is also being selected which can be used to identify designs which comply with the definition.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the OSHW was being translated.

After Wednesday's extended carnival of sycophancy, in which the leaders of the institutions of American government did everything except toss a virgin into a volcano in tribute to the president*, it seems almost too obvious a thing to point out that the Republican Party has handed itself over to this president* as his personal chew-toy. They have figured out that flattering this walking ego is the way for them to get what they want, and he can't live outside a constant bubble of counterfeit affection. It's a marriage made several levels lower than heaven.
But there's more to it than the revolting spectacle to which we were treated after the Loot the Joint Act of 2017 was passed. Over the past week, there has been a staggering welter of reporting about back-channels, hidden agendas, and covert shenanigans that makes the opaque creation of the tax bill look like a town meeting in Vermont. The phrase, ‚Äúa small group of influential Republicans‚Äù has come to mean something very dark and crooked.
The inevitable assault on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is hardly a secret anymore. It's the second stage of Paul Ryan's grand plan, and everybody knows it. But there is a general effort now to prop up the administration*, especially as Robert Mueller and his hounds get to baying more audibly outside the wrought-iron fence. On Thursday morning, for example, Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, who previously recused himself from ‚Äúall aspects‚Äù of the investigation into the Russian ratfcking of the 2016 presidential election, apparently has decided that the Uranium One ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù is not one of those aspects. From NBC News:
A senior law enforcement official who was briefed on the initial FBI investigation told NBC News there were allegations of corruption surrounding the process under which the U.S. government approved the sale. But no charges were filed. As the New York Times reported in April 2015, some of the people associated with the deal contributed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 for a Moscow speech by a Russian investment bank with links to the transaction. Hillary Clinton has denied playing any role in the decision by the State Department to approve the sale, and the State Department official who approved it has said Clinton did not intervene in the matter. That hasn't stopped some Republicans, including President Trump, from calling the arrangement corrupt ‚Äî and urging that Clinton be investigated
(Here I would like once again to congratulate The New York Times for getting into bed with Bannonite apparatchik Peter Schweitzer, whose book-like product, Clinton Cash, jump-started all of this nonsense.)
At the same time, according to Politico, Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and midnight White House creeper, has been running a parallel ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù apparently aimed at pre-emptively discrediting whatever it is that Mueller finds.
The people familiar with Nunes' plans said the goal is to highlight what some committee Republicans see as corruption and conspiracy in the upper ranks of federal law enforcement. The group hopes to release a report early next year detailing their concerns about the DOJ and FBI, and they might seek congressional votes to declassify elements of their evidence. That final product could ultimately be used by Republicans to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether any Trump aides colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign ‚Äî or possibly even to justify his dismissal, as some rank-and-file Republicans and Trump allies have demanded. (The president has said he is not currently considering firing Mueller.) Republicans in the Nunes-led group suspect the FBI and DOJ have worked either to hurt Trump or aid his former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, a sense that has pervaded parts of the president's inner circle. Trump has long called the investigations into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election a ‚Äúwitch hunt,‚Äù and on Tuesday, his son Donald Trump Jr. told a crowd in Florida the probes were part of a ‚Äúrigged system‚Äù by ‚Äúpeople at the highest levels of government‚Äù who were working to hurt the president.
There is an undercurrent of shared fantasy now driving a Republican Party that controls all the institutions of the government and can do pretty much anything it wants, as long as it doesn't get in its own way, for which it also has something of a gift. It is armored in unreality, which protects it from all the checks and balances to which this system of government is heir. Clinton sold all our uranium to Russia. The FBI conspired with the Clinton campaign against the Trump campaign. And all this unreality is being weaponized now to one purpose: to protect the presidency* of Donald Trump.

(Count me as someone who doesn't believe that the president* will fire Mueller. Absent an uncontrollable fit of Trumpian pique, even I don't think the president* is that stupid. I think the campaign to delegitimize Mueller and his investigation will go on as long as the investigation does. It will be said to be a waste of time and money. Smokescreens and squid ink will fly thick and fast until most of the country loses the plot entirely. The Russian ratfcking will be yet another something on which Experts Disagree. This was the game-plan the Reagan people used against Lawrence Walsh in Iran-Contra and, by and large, it worked. Of course, it all depends on sane people being able to keep this president* from having a nutty.)
I am sure that, among conservative intellectuals, there are some people sincerely and seriously opposed to the current president*. But among conservative Republican politicians of any influence, there are none. Bob Corker pretty much called the president* a lunatic, and now he's profiting handsomely from being a performing seal like all the rest of them. Lindsey Graham is conceding putts at Bedminster and dreaming of being Secretary of State. Orrin Hatch may well be seen within the month, climbing up Mount Rushmore with a chisel between his teeth, ready to get to work. The Department of Justice is now acting as an adjunct to a Breitbart comment section.

And the members of the responsible committee of the House are acting at cross-purposes with each other, with some members meeting secretly to undermine their own investigation. (The Senate committee seems marginally more reasonable, for now, anyway. At the very least, they found someone to put gunpowder in Mark Warner's oatmeal.) There is no such thing as #NeverTrump among Republicans anymore, and, because of that, the essential destructive corruption that is the very nature of this presidency* now has spread so widely that rooting it out completely may well be impossible. There is the shadow of ruin hanging over everything.

A London man who rose to fame performing stunts on YouTube before the online video provider pulled the plug on his channel amid media reports of his criminal past is facing child pornography charges.
David Rock, 51, is charged with two counts of possession of child pornography and one count of accessing child pornography, London police said Thursday.
When contacted Thursday, Rock said the charges are related to a nudist video.
‚ÄúIt's a nudist video. There's no sexual content whatsoever,‚Äù said Rock, who described himself as a nudist. ‚ÄúThat's all I'm going to say.‚Äù
Rock landed in the Internet limelight in 2009 after his YouTube channel Davidsfarm, featuring Rock performing driving stunts at his Lucan farm, generated around 100 million hits worldwide.
The channel proved lucrative for Rock, earning him upwards of $15,000 a month through YouTube's profit-sharing agreement.
But Rock's sudden fame also led to a Free Press report that uncovered Rock was a convicted sex offender.
Court records show he was jailed for one year after being convicted of several charges in the early 1990s, including sexual exploitation of what court records refer to as ‚Äúyoung persons.‚Äù
Rock has said they were teenage boys he encouraged to masturbate while he videotaped them.
Other convictions were for sexual assault on two children whose genitals he said he touched and videotaped.
More than a year after media reports of Rock's criminal past surfaced, Google, the owner of YouTube, pulled the London stuntman's channel in December 2010.
Though Davidsfarm disappeared from YouTube for a short period, it was back online within days. Today, it features 277 videos and has more than eight million views.
Calls and e-mails to Google weren't returned Thursday.
Police say the most recent charges stem from a police search of homes in London and Lucan.
Rock was arrested but has since been released from custody.

I see Ruby people bashing Python a lot on Stackoverflow. It's a bit sad, Python and Ruby are usually bestest friends forevah. So I started a question on Stackoverflow, not about which of them is best, but just what the differences are, objectively.
It was more difficult to make that objective than I thought, but I sure learnt a lot. And, as suspected, many of the differences are just semantic, like Ruby using @attribute and Python using self.attribute. And of course it's objectively it's impossible to say what language is better, which we of course knew from the beginning. That's no surprise. The surprise is that there are so few differences that can be cast as better or worse at all. Even such things that sound like an objective good or bad, such as a language having a certain feature, turns out to mostly be a matter of taste.
I could just find these differences that in any way can be called objectively better:
1. Ruby has a reference to the class in the class body
This means that code like this is possible:
class MyClass initialize_magick() end
While in Python, you would have to write:
class MyClass: pass initialize_macgick(MyClass)
As you see the practical difference is very small. But Rubys variant is cleaner, as the magic stuff is done in the class definition, so you see that it's being done when you look at the class. And indeed, the Zope component architecture uses some heavy magic with metaclasses to make the same thing happen in Python:
def MyClass: implements(IMyInterface)
So it's possible (In Python 2) by some clever tricks to get the same effect. In Python 3 it isn't because the metaclass syntax is different, so in Python 3 you instead need to use class decorators. And what you think is cleaner of
@magickly_initialized def MyClass: pass
or
def MyClass initialize_magick() end
is again a matter of taste. So, a small plus for Ruby there, without a doubt. But it's really not a big deal, because calling the initialize method after the class or as a decorator is really not a major drawback.
2. Ruby has continuations
Continuations are heavy magic. And Ruby has them, and Python has not. You can ‚Äúfake‚Äù them, and it seems that many of the usecases can instead be done with passing variables into .next() which you can do in Python 3.1. The use of continuations seems rather limited, and hard to understand, but it's there in Ruby, and not in Python. So another plus for Ruby.
3. Python has generators
You can fake them in Ruby by using blocks, or use continuations. So no big deal again, but a small plus for Python anyway, as Pythons generators are both easy and clean.
4. Python has multiple inheritance
Some people claim multiple inheritance is evil. But having it means that if you think it's evil, you can simply not use it. I have used it a lot, never found it a problem, but I think adaptation is a better pattern. Still, it's clearly a plus for Python.
5. Python has docstrings
Docstrings makes it possible to attach documentation directly to the classes and methods. That'sa nice documentation plus, and makes things like the Python interpreters help() function really useful. Another plus.
Aaaaannnd, that's it!
These five small differences are the only things that I can see are objective improvements over the other language. And as you see, none of them are really major. It's just small things that are more convenient or not. So, am I gonna switch to Ruby now, when it's almost just as good? Nope. Because there are a lot of other differences, that are differences in attitudes and semantics. And there I really like Python better. Here are three major features of Ruby that in my opinion either are misfeatures or just not of value:
1. Ruby has built-in regexp and line input looping
This is inspired by Perl, and means you can easily make a script that looks through a text file and munges each line separately and prints out another text line. This is extremely useful'in many cases. Also Ruby is said to be better to make glue.scripts, so it can more readily be used for a shell script replacement than Python. Plus for Ruby? Well, no, not in my book. I do these things sometimes, mostly in awk. If they get more complex than that, I prefer to use the clarity of Python than the obscure machinations of regexps. And having a small open(filename).readlines() isn't that much trouble. So this is a feature I think only adds clutterm and I'm happy Python doesn't have it. Wow! That turned out to be a subjective issue! That surprised me.
2. Ruby protects class attributes etc
Ruby treats variable names that have the first letter in capitals like a constant, so you can't modify it. You also can't access attributes of objects from outside the class. Python doesn't protect your code from other programmers. If they want to shoot themselves in the foot they are allowed to. I like that. I remember when using Delphi, and I needed to subclass an object in the standard library, but some attributes or methods were protected, so I couldn't. I ended up having to duplicate almost the whole (rather big) component class in my subclass, just because the developer of the base class hadn't forseen my type or requirement. So these sorts of protections are generally just a problem. OK, it's less of a problem in Ruby, as it allows you to monkey-patch the class but this still is a big plus for Python in my book. I'm sure Ruby people do not agree. It's subjective again.
3. Ruby has blocks
But some differences are more differences in attitudes than anything else. And sometimes these different attitudes seem to in the end be the same attitude but from different angles. Ruby has for example the concept of blocks. Block seems to pretty much be Rubys name for closures, and it's an abstract concept basically meaning a piece of code that gets variables from somewhere else and can have local variables that doesn't pollute the surrounding name space.
Rubys blocks are widely hailed (by Ruby people) as something fantastic compared to Python. But it turned out to be very difficult to find actual cases where Ruby really did something in a cleaner way than Python thanks to blocks. Well, it turns out that Python also has blocks. But they are called ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù. What's the difference? Functions need a name, while blocks don't. At this point a Python programmer says ‚ÄúAha, so blocks are lambdas!‚Äù Yes, except that blocks can be multiline code and do anything, while Pythons lambdas are restricted to being expressions.
OK, so plus one to Ruby then? Well, no. Because what use is a block if you don't attach it to a variable name so you can call it? In Ruby you create blocks and use them directly like this:
amethod do |variable| print variable end
This is principally equivalent to Pythons
def theblock(variable) print variable amethod(theblock)
Which of course is doable in Ruby as well. Which way is neater? Matter of taste again. And it becomes even harder to decide when considering that Ruby has a special statement to call the block with parameters. It's called yield. Yield exists in Python as well, but there it's used for generators. But the get this code examples:
def themethod for a in [1,2,3,4,5] yield a end end themethod do |b| puts b end
Which is almost suspisciously similar to
def themethod(): for a in [1,2,3,4,5]: yield a for b in themethod(): print b
So in the end, this much touted principle of block seem to very rarely actually lead to any significantly different code than in Python. So here are widely discussed differences in principals that in the end‚Ä¶end up as the same thing (almost)!
4. Python has list comprehensions
It's worth mentioning here that Python has some big features that Ruby doesn't, like for example list comprehensions.
[foo(x) for x in alist if bar(x) != 'frotz']
But although I use them all the time because they are practical I don't know what I think about them. Well, it's shorter than:
foo = [] for x in alist: if bar(x) != 'frotz': foo.append(x)
But is it really neater and more readable? I'm not sure. It becomes a matter of taste again. I did not like list comprehensions when they first arrived in Python, but of course now I've gotten used to them. So that is not a good argument for Python. It's subjective again.
5. Python has decorators
Decorators are prettier than the other ways of doing the same in Python, for example the above initialize_magick(class). But again it can be argued that the @decorator syntax just makes Python ugly, and that you don't need them as much in Ruby. Again, matters of taste.
So why Python?
So, in the end, why do I, subjectively prefer Python over Ruby in almost everything? Because of Pythons clarity and simplicity, and it's attitudes and principles. In Ruby, you have open classes, so you can extend any class. In Python, you can monkey patch in extensions into any class. The difference? That in Python it's an ugly attitude that is frowned upon. In Ruby, many people tutorials and examples of blocks extend the Array class, like brutally monkey patching the standard types is a normal thing to do. (A hint guys: That does NOT help in explaining blocks, it's just confusing).
In Ruby, there are no functions, but there are methods, blocks and lambdas. All of them seem to have subtle differences, and sometimes you need to not just call them, but use .call(). In Python, there are only functions. Lambdas are functions whose __name__ is <lambda>. Methods are functions that are wrapped to you don't have to pass self. Simple and clear.
Python is more explicit. In Ruby you can skip the () when calling a method. Rubyists like that because it makes calls look like statements they say. Pythonists like me think it's a bad idea to make a call look like a statement. If it's a call it should bloody well look like one.
And Pythons packages and modules are just so much better for namespaces than Rubys modules. Again, subjectively. And you can choose if you want to import * in Python or not. In Ruby that's all you can do
And all of these things, the things that make me go ‚ÄúEww‚Ä¶‚Äù about Ruby and ‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù about Python turns out not to be features, but just subjective options of the different languages semantics and attitudes. It is truly so that none of the Languages are better than the other.
Except, of course, that Ruby sucks. üòâ

During the Nintendo Switch presentation, the Japanese company confirmed that the console will come with 32GB of internal storage space, which can be expanded with SD cards. Not much else has been said about the console's storage options, but reports seem to suggest that the console is ready for external USB drives.
While attending the Nintendo Switch London event, Game Reactor Spain learned that the console will support micro SD cards up to 2 TB. With SD cards with such capacity being uncommon today, it's clear that Nintendo has been thinking ahead.
Related Civilization VI for Nintendo Switch Review ‚Äì Finally On Console
Additionally, the Game Reactor Spain reports reveals that the Nintendo Switch is ready for external USB drives, which will have to be connected to the console via the dock's ports. This option, apparently, won't be active at launch.
Following the Nintendo Switch presentation, the Japanese company revealed more details regarding its next console, which will launch in a little over a month.
Nintendo Switch is a breakthrough home video game system. It not only connects to a TV at home, but it also instantly transforms into an on-the-go handheld using its 6.2-inch screen. For the first time, players can enjoy a full home-console experience anytime, anywhere. The screen includes capacitive multi-touch capabilities for compatible games. Battery life can last for more than six hours, but will vary depending on the software and usage conditions. For example, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild can be played for roughly three hours on a single charge. While away from home, Nintendo Switch can be charged by plugging the AC adapter into the console's USB Type-C connector.
The Nintendo Switch launches on March 3rd in all regions. We will keep you updated on the console as soon as more comes in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.
As a child, Mike Brown had all the trappings of an astronomer in the making, with space books, rocket drawings, and a poster of the planets on his bedroom wall. The poster depicted Pluto as ‚Äúthis crazy and very eccentric planet,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was everyone's favorite crazy planet.‚Äù Brown, now an astronomer at Caltech, still recalls the mnemonic he learned for the names of the planets: Martha visits every Monday and (the was for asteroids) just stays until noon, period. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòperiod,' for Pluto, was always suspicious,‚Äù Brown says with a laugh. ‚ÄúIt didn't seem to fit. So maybe that was when I first got the idea that Pluto didn't belong.‚Äù
Brown's childhood insight now sounds like a premonition. In August 2006 the International Astronomical Union officially demoted Pluto, putting it into the new category of ‚Äúdwarf planet,‚Äù a sun-orbiting object big enough to be forced into a spherical shape by gravity but not big enough to clear its own orbit. The IAU more recently deemed Pluto and two newfound bodies to be ‚Äúplutoids,‚Äù bright dwarf planets that circulate mostly outside Neptune's orbit. The decision was controversial and continues to generate protest, fueled by new findings from this icy realm.
These remote celestial bodies are the largest known members of the Kuiper belt, a band of rocky, icy objects that orbit the sun in a swath stretching from beyond Neptune to a distance of nearly 5 billion miles. Whatever you call them, one point is beyond debate: Pluto is no longer a lonely outpost in an otherwise empty frontier. A string of discoveries has revealed that it is merely the entry point to a vast and still mysterious wilderness that teems with an uncount-able number of unusual objects. They come in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, many with their own moons, some in peculiar orbits that have been pushed by Neptune or pulled by passing stars. Stranger objects are likely to be found, since astronomers are only on the edge of discovering this vast new terrain.
In the 1940s and 1950s, astronomers Kenneth Edgeworth and Gerard Kuiper independently predicted that a reservoir of icy rocks lay beyond the orbit of Neptune. Many of these objects became short-period comets, with orbits of 200 years or less, that blasted in toward the sun, crossing the paths of most planets. Excluding Pluto (discovered in 1930), the first official Kuiper belt object was not found until 1992, by astronomers Jane Luu and David Jewitt. Since then, in excess of 1,200 have been detected in the 2-billion-mile-wide Edgeworth-Kuiper belt (commonly truncated to Kuiper belt), including burly Eris, even larger than Pluto. Almost all of the biggest have been found by Brown and his colleagues. More than 100,000 objects at least 30 miles across may occupy the belt.
But our solar system doesn't end there. Far beyond the Kuiper belt lies the mysterious Oort cloud, a spherical shell that stretches to the boundaries of interstellar space and blasts its own dark ice balls toward the sun. Trillions more bodies may lurk there. A few may be as big as Mercury or Mars. Imprinted in those far-flung worlds, scientists say, is the history of the solar system before planets came to be. Every Kuiper belt object and Oort cloud entity is a geologic fossil, preserved at low temperatures, largely unaltered by time, and made up of the material from which the solar system formed. Understanding their compositions‚Äîand why they are where they are today‚Äîwill help scientists reconstruct the nascent moments of our planetary neighborhood and our sun's younger days, when it was just one of a cluster of stars.
Name That Celestial Object
Scientific nomenclature can barely keep up with the range of objects that astronomers are discovering in the solar system these days. Future discoveries will no doubt suggest new categories and further blur the boundaries of old ones. In the meantime, here's a field guide to the known residents.
Planets are defined by the IAU as bodies orbiting the sun that have been made spherical by their own gravity and have cleared their orbit of other objects. Not every astronomer accepts this designation.
Dwarf Planets are similar to planets but are too small to clear their own orbits. Most lie beyond the orbit of Neptune, making them plutoids, a subcategory named for the most famous member of their group.
Asteroids are rocky, metallic, or carbonaceous bodies whose solar orbit takes them beyond Mars into the so-called asteroid belt. They typically lack sufficient gravity to retain an atmosphere. The latest count of asteroids in the inner solar system, inside Jupiter, is between 1.1 million and 1.9 million.
Comets are icy bodies that follow elliptical orbits. Those originating in the Kuiper belt have orbital periods shorter than 200 years. Longer-period comets originate much farther out in the Oort cloud. Known comets number in the thousands, but trillions might be out there.
Classical Kuiper Belt Objects orbit the sun at 3.9 billion to 4.5 billion miles out. They are sometimes called cubewanos, after QB1, the first Kuiper belt object discovered (1992).
Resonant Kuiper Belt Objects orbit in synchrony with Neptune. Pluto is the prototype, orbiting twice around the sun for every three solar circuits made by Neptune. The majority of known RKBOs are thought to orbit with a similar 2:3 resonance and thus are called plutinos. About 100 other objects with resonant orbits have been detected.
Scattered Kuiper Belt Objects have very eccentric and tilted orbits that carry them from around 3.3 billion miles from the sun to almost 100 billion miles out. They may have been kicked into their far-flung orbits by Neptune's gravity.
Chuck Wielgus, who as the top official in American swimming was credited with doing more than anyone to make it the nation's premier Summer Olympics sport, but who was later scarred by his response to accusations of sexual abuse by coaches, died on Sunday in Colorado Springs. He was 67.
A spokesman for U.S.A. Swimming, the organization Mr. Wielgus ran as executive director, said the cause was complications of colon cancer.
As head of U.S.A. Swimming from 1997 until his death, Mr. Wielgus (pronounced WILL-gus) was the longest-serving leader of any United States Olympic organization. His swimmers brought home a third of United States medals in the last five Summer Olympic Games, many won by Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever.
Along the way Mr. Wielgus expanded his organization's revenue, membership and fan base exponentially.
WASHINGTON ‚Äî Representative Trent Franks announced Friday that he would resign from Congress immediately after accusations emerged that he had offered $5 million to a female employee to be a surrogate mother for his children, and that she and another female employee worried that the lawmaker wanted to have sex as a means of impregnating them.
Mr. Franks, Republican of Arizona and one of the House's most ardent social conservatives, had said Thursday that he would leave the House in January, and he admitted that he had discussed surrogate pregnancies with two employees. The House Ethics Committee had opened an investigation into his behavior, and the office of Speaker Paul D. Ryan said in a statement that Mr. Ryan had made it clear that Mr. Franks's actions were intolerable.
On Friday, Mr. Franks changed course and said he would leave immediately because his wife, Josephine, had fallen ill and had been hospitalized in Washington.
‚ÄúAfter discussing options with my family,‚Äù he said in a statement, ‚Äúwe came to the conclusion that the best thing for our family now would be for me to tender my previous resignation effective today.‚Äù
With 4,800 members, Ung Pirat (Young Pirates) claims to be Sweden's third largest youth organisation.
"It is truly gratifying and shows what we are achieving with our politics," said Ung Pirat chairperson Stefan Flod in a press release.
"It is surprising. Ung Pirat works in principle to encourage something illegal. That they then receive money from a state institution is remarkable," said Lars Gustafsson, CEO of record company sector organisation IFPI to Svd.se.
Ung Pirat has been awarded 1.3 million kronor ($159,000) by the National Board for Youth Affairs (Ungdomstyrelsen), a government agency. The sum has been calculated based on an official member estimation of 1,284 members.
The organization claims in a press release that its membership has almost doubled in a year and is thus confident of receiving further state support next year.
"We have our finger on the pulse of the issues important to young people today. Our political issues touch us deeply, because they concern our lives," Flod said.
The group share the Pirate Party's opposition to a new law based on the European Union's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive (IPRED), that would make it easier to track people who illegally share copyrighted material on the Internet.
The party intends to stand for election to the European and Swedish parliaments on a platform to "reform copyright law, to get rid of the patent system (and) ensure that citizens' rights to privacy are respected."
Stefan Flod claims that there is a conflict between the interests of young people and the politicians that currently run the country.
"For older people it is still a question of a one-way form of communication. You talk to people and they listen. But the whole internet is about sharing, to communicate, to create new channels," Flod claims.
The youth affairs board announced on Friday that 90 youth organizations would share grants totalling 247 million kronor in 2009. 176 million kronor comes from the state-owned gaming monopoly Svenska Spel and the remainder is provided directly by the state.
The board defended its decision to award support to Ung Pirat.
"It is our understanding that they want to change legislation around copyright issues and that is an opinion that they are entitled to," said the youth affairs board director-general Per Nilsson.
Shortly after June 29, when the governor of Puerto Rico declared that the island's $72 billion in debt was not payable, the Working Group was established to start on a comprehensive fiscal adjustment plan to restructure the U.S. territory's debt.
The Working Group's restructuring plan was due to be delivered to Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla for review on Sunday. However, according to a statement issued by the Governor's Chief of Staff, V√≠ctor Su√°rez Mel√©ndez, the Governor granted a last minute extension to the Working Group to present their fiscal adjustment proposal.
"Since the Government's efforts in the past days have been focused on preparing for the possible impact of tropical storm Erika, the work of the designated group, the consultant's analysis, and the final drafting of the document have not been completed."
The new deadline for the group to deliver the plan to the Governor for review will be "on or before September 8, 2015."
Once the proposal has been completed, the intended date the details will be made public is not known; Padilla is to make that decision after he reviews the plan.
Many walkable cities experience road congestion at levels higher than their car-friendly counterparts. In a review of 74 cities, we compared Tomtom's congestion index with car use. The results: more congestion equals less car use. It begs the question ‚Äì why are we chasing congestion solutions?
Can low congestion and walkable urban context co-exist?
Planning policy has changed to help transition cities into more walkable, dense urban forms. But what about for those of us who drive? Is it really possible to have both?The Complete Streets concept tries to take the focus off one over the other, promoting balance. It is perhaps one of the better branded (and recycled) ideas in urban transport planning in the last quarter century. A complete street is a street that tries to provide pedestrians, cyclists, transit, and cars with facilities all on the same street.
The problem is there usually isn't enough space on the road for everyone. Typically (at least in a North American context) this means taking space away from cars to ‚Äúre-balance‚Äù the situation and improve conditions for other users. Sometimes it's possible to fix traffic light timing or undertake creative lane re-configurations to keep cars moving at the same rate, but many of these practices have already been exploited. And so, the perceived ‚Äúwar on cars‚Äù persists. For progressives who favour sustainable travel, perhaps it's not such a bad thing. Urban dwellers who travel by car regularly may think otherwise.
The Easy Out ‚Äì solving both (improve congestion and sustainable transportation modes together)
Politicians have recently supported both improvements for sustainable transport and car congestion reduction and allow city officials to solve the issue on the ground ‚Äì a prospect which seems to re-ignite the ‚Äúwar on cars‚Äù debate.
Prague has high levels of traffic congestion. Still, only the vast majority of trips are not by car (only 33% drive)
You can't do both
A city can provide people with a beautiful shaded sidewalk, but it doesn't mean people will use it. It's not simply a matter of making non-car travel attractive, but recognizing that people select their mode of travel through relative comparison with other options. The more a city improves driving conditions, the easier it will be for people to stay in their cars.
Tomtom's congestion index indicates a number of the cities with high congestion ratings (e.g. Vancouver, San Francisco, Stockholm, Stuttgart, New York, etc.). What it doesn't indicate is that these many of these cities have viable and attractive alternatives to getting into traffic. On the flip side, cities with low congestion seem to exhibit very high levels of car use. The 10 least congested cities ranked all had more than 93% of daily trips done by car.
According to Jonas Eliasson with the Center for Transport Studies (Stockholm), every day people make new decisions. Policymakers around the world are pushing the envelope to make sustainable travel modes more attractive. But if the rate of making improvements for driving is relatively the same (or greater), it's only serving to undermine sustainable transport policies.

It is basically an online program of academic education in CS planned to be taken while working, costing around USD7,000 to complete.
My context: I am brazilian, living in Brazil, 37 yo, graduated in Economics and just recently made the career transition to become a developer. I basically studied more practical things about software development (web, mostly javascript) through free content available online. I am already working as a frontend web developer.
I believe this program is a good complementary source of knowledge to become a better software developer. I assume the more theoretical academic approach would benefit me as a complement to my more hands-on learning I had so far. And I also assume the Georgia Tech credentials will benefit my career.
So, what you think?
Strachan has been Scotland head coach since January 2013
Scotland boss Gordon Strachan said his team were "genetically behind", after they missed out on a World Cup play-off place with a 2-2 draw in Slovenia.
Victory in Ljubljana would have made the Scots one of the eight best second-placed finishers, but Slovakia edged them out on goal difference.
"We had to pick a team to combat their height and strength," said Strachan, who would not be drawn on his future.
"It's a problem for us because we have to work harder for every ball."
Leigh Griffiths shot Scotland into a first-half lead in Slovenia but substitute Roman Bezjak scored twice from set-pieces to put the hosts in front.
Robert Snodgrass netted a late leveller after Darren Fletcher spurned a wonderful chance but it was not enough as Slovakia cruised to an expected home win over Malta.
"Genetically, we are behind," said Strachan. "In the last campaign we were the second smallest, apart from Spain.
"Maybe we get big women and men together and see what we can do."
Scotland's starting XI in Ljubljana were more than three centimetres smaller than their opponents on average.
And Strachan said they had been unable to combat Slovenia's "height and strength" at set-plays.
"Nobody can tell me that, apart from one player, they are technically better than our players," he said. "But, physically, we have a problem.
"We can fight it, battle it and get through games on sheer determination and work-rate and that takes a lot out of you.
"That's what happened tonight. These guys have put so much into this. I really feel for them but they can also be really pleased.
"This group is as good as anything I've worked with."
Strachan's side had four points after four games of their qualifying campaign, following a calamitous home draw with Lithuania and heavy defeats in Slovakia and England.
They finished with a six-game unbeaten run, including four victories, but it was not enough to finish as runners-up to runaway Group F winners England.
Strachan, 60, said it was "an honour to work with this group".
"The players are hurting badly but when they look back they can be proud, they gave it a right good shot," he said.
"They left nothing in the dressing room, over the last two games especially.
"We've been beaten on goal difference by Slovakia, who are an excellent side."
Leigh Griffiths opened the scoring for Scotland but the visitors could not find the win they needed
'No-one hurts like the players'
Former Celtic and Middlesbrough boss Strachan, who has been in charge since January 2013, said now was not the time to discuss his future.
"No-one is hurting like the players, it's impossible," he said. "The fans can't hurt like that, I can't hurt.
"There shouldn't be any talk about what I'm thinking or what I'm doing at this moment in time because I am just looking after them.
"Sometimes in life you have to hurt badly before you achieve things. I have been lucky enough to achieve things with other groups of lads but these have achieved as much as anybody.
"I have never been in a dressing room as silent as that. That was a real hurting silence.
"I really have to thank them for the effort they have put in."
Horror as three high school soccer players arrested for raping three young boys at a summer sports camp in brutal 'hazing'
Galileo Mondol. 17, and two 16-year-old students are accused of raping three freshmen in their cabins
Officials have condemned the attacks and praised the courage of those who stood up for the victims
All three suspects are in custody, will be arraigned Tuesday
Three high school students have been accused of raping three freshman during a school-sponsored sports camp.
Galileo Mondol, 17, and two 16-year-old boys were charged Friday with raping three male freshmen during a sports camp sponsored by Somerville High School, where all six boys are students, according to reports. The school's athletic department was made aware of the allegations Tuesday.
The two 16-year-olds have not been identified because they are minors.
Horrific: Galileo Mondol, 17, and two 16-year-old boys are accused of brutally raping three freshman male students
Mondol and the two minors are alleged to have entered the cabin where the boys were sleeping an sexually assaulted them. All six males are members of the school's soccer team, said reports.
‚ÄòThese are terrible allegations. I'm disturbed and appalled that they may have happened,' Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone said at a news conference Friday.'‚ÄúBe clear on this, these allegations go far beyond hazing. This is rape.'
Curtatone volunteers for the coaching staff of the football team and was one of 24 adult chaperones at the camp, the Bo ston Herald reported. Each cabin had an adult chaperone inside, according to WHDH .
Mondol has been charged with aggrevated rape of a child under 16, indecent assault and battery, two counts of assault with intent to rape a child under 16 and three counts each of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and intimidation of a witness. The minors face similar charges.
Disturbing: Mondol is taken out of the police station following his arrest in September
‚ÄòIn no way are these allegations a reflection on the team, our kids, [or] our community,' Curtatone added.
Somerville High School, which sponsors the team-building retreat annually, was made aware of the charges Tuesday, accord ing to WBZ . The students were arrested Friday.
‚ÄòAll of us, frankly, are horrified at these allegations,' school superintendent Tony Pierantozzi said at Friday's news conference in Somerville with the mayor and other school officials. ‚ÄòWe will ensure to the best of our ability that everyone and anyone who needs support will have it.'
Mondol is being held on a $100,000 bail, but his lawyer claims he's innocent.
A retreat: Somerville High School has taken athletes on the three-day retreat for 15 years and this is the first known incident of its kind
Pleading not guilty: Mondol's attorney claims his client is innocent and that 'his parents support him 100 per cent'
‚ÄòWe will plead not guilty Tuesday because my client is not guilty,' attorney William Korman said in a statement to the media. ‚ÄòHe has absolutely no criminal history. He has never been in trouble before. We steadfastly maintain his innocence. His parents support him 100 per cent.'
A total of 165 student athletes attended the camp, 62 boy football players, 61 boy soccer players and 42 girl soccer players, with eight coaches per team as supervisors, according to Pierantozzi.
The school has taken athletes to the camp for the past 15 years, and makes them sign no-hazing pledges before taking part in the three night trip, said Curtatone.
Curtatone stood by the students, praising their courage and pledging support.
‚Äò[This incident] not define us‚Ä¶ our spirit and character is defined by the courage shown by the victims and by the team. They have stood up and spoken out... and we will stand up with them and for them.'
Share. The features that make or break opinions of Microsoft's new console. The features that make or break opinions of Microsoft's new console.
In a survey of 30,000 IGN readers, 43% said they do not plan to purchase Microsoft's Xbox One. 39% of readers surveyed do plan to purchase the console either at launch or within its first year of availability, and 18% said it will depend on additional game announcements.
When asked about the most important features in a next-gen console, the 12,461 readers who do not plan to purchase an Xbox One said a system's price is the most important factor (Xbox One carries a $499.99 price tag) followed by exclusive games, graphics, controller design and feel, hardware specs and storage space.
The survey was held on June 25 and 26 -- a week after Microsoft reversed its policies on used games and DRM -- and readers not planning to purchase Xbox One picked used game fees, the ability to sell used games and DRM as the 11th, 12th and 13th most important features, respectively.
As far as the ‚Äúexclusive games‚Äù factor mentioned above, readers not planning to purchase Xbox One said they're most interested in Watch Dogs, followed by Infamous: Second Son, Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and Killzone: Shadow Fall.
It's worth noting that even Microsoft itself admits it's had trouble with its Xbox One messaging and that several events including Gamescom and the Tokyo Game Show still stand between us and the November launch of the console.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE LITECOIN TRAIN! Ltc/usd On Oct. 18, though litecoin fell to $53 stages, it is speedy climbed again higher and closed above $57.It has considering then controlled to stay above this aid stage. However, presently the cryptocurrency is threatening to fall into the variety another time.If litecoin breaks under $57 and is not able to climb returned quick, it'll invalidate the current bullish setup. PAY ATTENTION TO THE LITECOIN TRAIN!
However, if the cryptocurrency finds assist at the modern ranges and turns up, a protracted function may be initiated at $63. The stop loss for the change may be stored at $55 and the income goal is $71.
In conjunction with the developing bitcoin, litecoin has additionally reached this week's excessive of $70, breaching $55and $60 resistance degrees. Inside the past, we predicted a $55 target in case it would leave the traded range.
As of now, litecoin is buying and selling at $61. As some distance as ltc is worried, there may be a shift from ‚Äúbearish‚Äù to ‚Äúbullish‚Äù moods and purchases are barely higher than sales. Ltc quickly restored its positions after a nearby correction to the $52 level.
A movement in flat in the $f57 to $65 variety is a tremendously possibly situation if there may be no enormous neighborhood correction for bitcoin. The conservative place for sales following the speculative buy of litecoin is near the top boundary. Sales within the $48 to $50 levels are feasible.

China lodged an official protest against the Obama administration's announcement that Taiwan has been cleared to purchase $1.83 billion in US arms, according to The New York Times:
The Obama administration's announcement that it would sell $1.83 billion worth of arms to Taiwan, including two warships and antitank missiles, has drawn a swift rebuke from China, which threatened to penalize the companies that made the armaments and summoned a United States diplomat to register an official protest.
Although the sale is not remarkably large as far as US weaponry is concerned, it is of value to look at the transaction in the context of US weapons sales.
In the last two years, we have repeatedly noted how the US economy is heavily invested in the so-called "defense industry.‚Äù
A BuzzFlash commentary this summer reported on a National Priorities Project analysis which found that 54 percent of all US government discretionary spending in 2015 - more than $598 billion dollars - is going to the military. That does not include funding for intelligence agencies (such as the CIA and NSA, which receive tens of billions of dollars), nor does it include the supplemental funds that were used to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are still not over.
Funding for the military-industrial-complex is also buried in other congressionally budgeted line items, particularly when it comes to covert programs.
War - or just ratcheting up the potential for conflict through stockpiling armaments - is profitable. For example, the National Priorities Project found that Lockheed Martin "saw over $5.5 billion in profit, and paid its CEO more than $34 millionin 2014. And the $32 billion it received from the U.S. government made up more than seventy percent of its total sales."
For the US government and many corporations, there is a plus side to war: Increased conflict increases arms sales to foreign powers - and increased corporate profits. We export war, and we export weapons. As The New York Times reported in April, the "sale of US arms fuels the wars of Arab states":
As the Middle East descends into proxy wars, sectarian conflicts and battles against terrorist networks, countries in the region that have stockpiled American military hardware are now actually using it and wanting more. The result is a boom for American defense contractors looking for foreign business.
Also in April of this year, a Fiscal Times article succinctly stated that the "US defense industry outperforms S&P by 100 percent." The Fiscal Times cite a recent increase in the defense budgets of many nations:
In the Middle East in particular, defense spending has continued at a strong pace, with several countries in the region dedicating more than 5 percent of their GDP to defense spending, while Oman and Saudi Arabia both spend more than 10 percent of GDP on national security.
The war in Iraq brought on a seemingly indefinite state of "insecurity" in the Middle East, creating the need for increased weapons purchases from the US, which is the largest seller of military arms in the world.
Before returning to the sales of weapons - including two warships - to Taiwan, it's telling to look at the US export/import gap. Although the trade deficit narrowed in September, the ongoing large trade gap that the US has experienced for years is likely to increase in the long run, according to The Wall Street Journal:
"The broader trend in the real goods deficit points to the likelihood that net trade will be a drag on growth in coming quarters," Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz said in a note to clients. "With slower growth abroad dampening demand for U.S. exports and solid domestic consumption supporting imports, we do not expect the deficit to continue to narrow in the coming months."
The US government Bureau of Economic Analysis issued a news release on December 4 that offered insight into the gaping US trade chasm: "The average goods and services deficit increased $0.5 billion to $45.1 billion [per month] for the three months ending in October."
Given this economic context, the US government sees the domestic armaments industry as one of the few "stars" in keeping the import/export deficit from widening even more. As a result, it's basically official US policy to assist US "defense contractors" in selling weapons of war abroad, thus inflaming the potential for conflict.
Although there are certainly political advocates for arming Taiwan, dating back to the days when China was touted as a Communist foe - before it became a one-party capitalist provider of inexpensive labor and products to the United States - it is certain that the cash that will be paid by the island nation is a key factor in the arms sales
Although armed conflict between the US and China is unlikely at this point or in the near future, there has been some military taunting between China and other nations in the Pacific in the past couple of years.
As China continues to profit from what Fortune called an "an all-time high" US trade deficit with Beijing, the US is hoping that weaponizing the world will help reduce the gap.

BOONE, NC ‚Äì In response to news of the first diagnosed case of Ebola in the United States, Appalachian State Health Services officials announced Thursday that it is really really unlikely that more than a few people in Boone will contract the deadly disease.
‚ÄúFor the vast majority of students, there is absolutely zero reason to panic,‚Äù said Health Services Director Robert S. Ellison, ‚ÄúI mean, there will probably be a couple, but man would you have to be unlucky to be one of them.‚Äù
‚ÄúWow, it would really suck to be that guy,‚Äù added Ellison.
Health Services also told reporters that, while they were like, 85% sure Ebola wouldn't be a big deal or anything, they could always be wrong.
‚ÄúCan we say that everyone is safe? No, of course not,‚Äù said health services employee Margaret Luntz, ‚ÄúThat would just be crazy to say a thing like that. I mean, even we doctors are only human, incapable of predicting every miniscule little thing can happen in this vast and ever-expanding universe.‚Äù
Even taking that into account, health services officials said that they remain relatively confident that, due to the difficult-to-transmit nature of the disease, it would be pretty damn hard to contract ebola unless some ‚Äúseriously weird shit‚Äù were to happen. Dr. Ellison, in particular, remains hopeful.
‚ÄúSeriously though, it'll probably be like, four people,‚Äù Ellison said. ‚ÄúBut, hey, who knows? I sure as hell don't. But, thankfully, we probably won't have to wait long to find out.‚Äù
Is peaceful protest a waste of time?
The G20 climate camp shut down the City of London and generated a lot of attention before it was broken up by riot police. Les Hutchins under a Creative Commons Licence
We were proud. On 29 September, more than 50,000 of us marched in the Manchester sunshine, fighting ‚Äì metaphorically, of course ‚Äì to save the NHS and other public goods.
In spite of our vast numbers, it was an intelligent, good natured protest, without any incidences of violence or public disorder.
And with hardly any coverage in the national press either ‚Äì even though we were taking our protest right to the journalist-packed heart of the problem, the Conservative Party at conference.
So ‚Äì was it a waste of time?
Advert
Not in terms of building solidarity and showing support for health workers struggling to save the NHS as the government dismembers it, selling bits of it off under the fig-leaf of austerity.
Not if you think of all the families with children or elderly and disabled people who could march freely in a police-light environment, without fear of being kettled and baton-charged.
And if the purpose was to show, through numbers and the sheer ordinariness of the people protesting, the extent of public concern and unwillingness to be taken in by coalition spin.
But in terms of rattling the cages of policymakers and getting them to rethink the damage they are doing, it was a gentle rattle, easily ignored.
If I think of successful protests that have commanded attention ‚Äì the Poll Tax riots or the Kingsnorth climate camp actions, for example ‚Äì these have been far more raucous and disobedient affairs.
Even the recent UK Uncut action that blockaded roads in protest against legal aid cuts, though it involved only 500 people or just one per cent of the number that marched in Manchester, got more news coverage. The reason is simple. There was disruption ‚Äì there was fear of danger and potential violence.
Advert
Getting into the news isn't everything, but if you are protesting about something it is pretty important. By and large, the public prefer peaceful demos, and complain when actions have been hijacked by ‚Äòmindless thugs'. But chances are that those complainers would not have heard of the protest had it lacked that vital newsworthy ingredient ‚Äì a bit of civil disobedience, a touch of criminal damage, some arrests.
As a journalist I recognize that people marching from A to B and then having a rally at the end ‚Äì even if there are lots of you ‚Äì is not a great news story in the conventional sense. As I wrote a recent blog about the Manchester march I have to admit that, enthused as I was by the event and what it represented, making it interesting to readers was a bit of a challenge.
I believe that resisting austerity requires a wide range of tactics. And although I tend towards the peaceful ones, I increasingly believe that it's the actions that seriously disrupt which bring us face-to-face with what is at stake. This is especially pertinent when acts of criminal damage or violence against property are done to prevent a greater violence ‚Äì that against people.
This is the violence that is happening right now. Kill the NHS and you kill people. Take disability benefits away from people who depend on them for their lives and you are encouraging them to commit suicide. Force people out of their homes because they cannot pay ‚Äòthe bedroom tax' and you are making them homeless and knocking years off their life expectancy. Take legal aid away from those who cannot afford lawyers and you kill all hope of justice. Ensure your policies make the rich even richer, and you are committing an act of the most grotesque economic violence.
These are the acts of government violence that are happening right now in every part of Britain. This is what we need to expose and resist. If a bit of serious public disobedience creates the spark to crack open what increasingly feels like a closed debate, let it roll.

At the school district where I am the director of information technology, over 90% of our information systems have been transitioned to open source software. Ubuntu is the server operating systems at the district office and schools, while the Ubuntu desktop is deployed for students, teachers, and administration through the use of diskless clients.
As a result, students and teachers use primarily open source programs which include LibreOffice, Scribus, the Gimp, and Inkscape, to name a very few. We are able to centrally control over 2300 workstations at 16 schools and keep software much more current than many districts attempting to maintain commercial software packages. We have achieved significant energy savings, over 70% on our clients, and greatly reduced licensing costs.
I am frequently involved in discussions that revolve around bringing innovative to education which of course involves a technological aspect. And just as frequently, the requested technology includes utilizing popular commercial software, iDevices, and so forth. Although many teachers have embraced and see the potential of open source-based software, I occasionally hear people indicating how our districts use of open source software somehow diminishes the learning experience of our students. This is particularly curious when there is so much discussion about changing our education system to become more personalized for each student, improve student achievement, incorporate flexibility and choice, while bringing higher standards and empowering learning through technology.
There is no doubt that some open source programs are not as polished or mature as some commercial software but this has to be weighed against the plethora of freely available resources for K-12 and our ability to prepare our students for post-secondary, business and life. There are obvious advantages and disadvantages for both.
Open source advantages
Open source provides several significant benefits to K-12 including:
reduction of licensing costs and overall cost of ownership
provision of education tools anytime, anywhere
customization based on the needs we recognize
administration based on our community and expertise
utilization of energy efficient, low-cost, sustainable hardware
Open source as a driver for innovation
Ironically, perhaps the greatest argument in favour of using open source software is increase innovation and collaboration.
The online Business Dictionary definition of innovation:
The process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value. To be called an innovation, an idea must be replicable at an economical cost and must satisfy a specific need. Innovation involves deliberate application of information, imagination and initiative in deriving greater or different values from resources, and includes all processes by which new ideas are generated and converted into useful products.
As an educational institution we are being encouraged to innovate and collaborate while supporting our students to do likewise. My thesis is: if we insist that our students utilize expensive, commercial software and hardware, we may be reducing opportunities for innovation. Commercial software has been developed for a very specific purpose: generating profit and increasing shareholder earnings. That is not to say there are not opportunities for commercial software in education, however I contend that OpenOffice or LibreOffice are excellent alternatives to commercial equivalents, for example.
Open source software, by its very nature, is the result of a communal need. A community comes together to collaborate and fill a specific demand or requirement. They share the cost of development and provide improvements to the software for no other reason than to satisfy that need. Moodle is an excellent example of this. Moodle was initially developed by Martin Dougiamas, an educator and computer scientist from Perth Australia.
From Wikipedia:
"When his university installed an early learning management system, called WebCT, he was frustrated that the software's intellectual property restrictions prevented him from enhancing the system. This experience convinced him of the need for an open-source solution. Throughout the process of study and research for a master's degree and Ph.D., Dougiamas began developing the set of online tools that would become Moodle."
Moodle is now the world's leading Learning Management System and used extensively at post-secondary institutions and school districts. Our school district has successfully standardized on Moodle for both content and course management. The Kuali Foundation is another example where the post-secondary community has come together to provide solutions that commercial vendors cannot fulfill.
Who uses open source software?
Returning to the assumption that using open source in some way disadvantages our students, it is important to test that statement by modern government and corporate use. Most large organizations use open source software including governments and major corporations. As well over the past decade the impact of cloud-based social networks and services have altered the way we communicate and purchase. Factually, many of the leading social media applications and large service providers incorporate open source as the foundation of their applications. Without open source, many of these organizations and companies would not exist. Although many people are not aware, the Internet runs on open source software and we use it every day when we surf, communicate, purchase, and research on the net.
Companies such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Amazon, eBay all have open source as the foundation for their infrastructure and cloud-based services. May of them have contributed significantly to open source projects such as Linux, Eclipse, Apache while others have spawned important projects, such as Google's Android operating system and Facebook's Open Compute project. Large hardware and service companies like IBM and Hewlett Packard contribute significant resources and financial contributions to open source projects.
If these modern, forward-thinking companies use open source, then...
There are many more examples relating to how important open source software is to business today. When we really consider the implications of this, I feel that our students who have been exposed to open source technologies will have the greatest advantage when they go through post-secondary education and apply for jobs. At our school district, we provide students with open source alternatives and associated skills and concepts which are easily transferable to commercial software applications. Do we earnestly believe that because our students are using LibreOffice this will somehow limit them from quickly adapting to MS Office or Google Docs?
Therefore, if the assumption that open source software stifles innovation is not correct, what other false assumptions have been made? Another argument I hear frequently from teachers is that if we do not expose our students to technology through the use of commercial software, students will incur a significant disadvantage when they enter post-secondary programs. It is assumed that entrance to drafting programs require the use of commercial drafting programs, or business administration students must be proficient with commercial office packages and so forth. Is this an accurate message?
Which post-secondary programs require experience with commercial software as a prerequisite?
If we were to closely analyze course and program requirements for entrance into many college and university programs, we might ask which courses require a secondary student be proficient in propriety office productivity software, commercial drafting packages, digital media software, and so forth. In actual fact, very few, if any.
Certainly not business administration or accounting, as they require math and english skills, not technical drawing/drafting for which prerequisites are hand drafting and sketching, not digital media and so forth. In British Columbia, the Ministry of Education provides standards through Prescribed Learning Outcomes, which rarely specifies specific software program that must be used for a course, however they do talk extensively about teaching skills and concepts. Of course, if our schools do teach concepts and skills and supplement with technology resources such as GNUCash for accounting, the Gimp for digital media, LibreCAD for technical drawing, and so forth, students definitely have an additional advantage‚Äîbut having experience with commercial software is rarely a prerequisite for post-secondary programs or courses.
What are the unstated reasons for not wanting to use open source software in the school system?
So if the premise is correct, that open source software does not hinder students pedagogically or strategically, what might be the real reason for opposition to using it in the classroom? There are often two significant reasons that are understood but infrequently stated.
Firstly, part of a commercial software's marketing strategy often includes resources targeted to teachers‚Äîsometimes freely available or available at-a-cost. These learning resources might include lesson plans, sample documents or files, or published instructional books. There is no denying this makes a teacher's job a lot easier if a particular product comes with a lesson plan structured for that software program. There may also be training materials available to help the teacher transition to a particular software program, again as part of a commercial products marketing strategy.
Second, open source software, by its very nature, is not about marketing, but about the ability to become involved in its ongoing development as part of a community. Fundamentally, it is innovative, collaborative, and fosters community. In that regard it requires some work on the part of developers and users. This can be challenging for people who just want to use whatever software is available. Frequently learning new software can be daunting and extensive training materials are included with commercial software.
This can be a challenge for a teacher when approaching new software. Training resources, including courses, books, and so forth, can provide users with an opportunity for transition from commercial to open source alternatives. Sometimes these resources are lacking.
Can LibreOffice be used as an effective teaching tool in K-12 education? Absolutely, however having additional teaching resources would certainly make this easier. For example BlueJ is a post-secondary project that is not only a very good IDE for software development, but an excellent instructional tool for computer science. Moodle has excellent tutorials and learning resources as another example. Some open source software has gone a long way to do this but more work needs to be done to make the transition from commercial to open source software much easier for teachers.
Therefore, if we can remove possible objections to using open source software through providing associated lesson plans, sample data and/or training problems would provide a significant incentive for teachers. It may be something the individual projects may want to consider. Rather than seeing open source as some sort of diminished or disadvantaged tool set, we could see it as an enormous opportunity to truly enhance our students' future by preparing them for a rapidly changing world.
The Curiosity rover is now well on its way to its first major destination, a site called Glenelg that's only about 100m from its current position. On its drive, which it started over 50 sols (Martian days) ago, it has continued to check out its equipment, almost all of which seems to be working well. In its next test, planned for sometime over the next few days, the rover will start checking out its chemistry lab in preparation for analyzing the material it encounters in future drives.
The system is comprised of a scoop at the end of its robotic arm, which can pick up loose material from Mars' surface and deposit it into a chamber in the rover's body. From there, the material can be sent on to on-board laboratory hardware, which actually performs the analysis. Conceptually, this is similar to the setup that operated on the Mars Phoenix Lander, which found evidence of perchlorates in soil from near one of the Martian poles. The system can also take input from a drill to allow it to sample solid rocks.
Currently, the rover is at Rocknest, a site with (as you might expect) a set of rocks poking out of a sandy bed. Curiosity used one of its wheels to dig into the bed as shown above, confirming that the material is appropriate for accessing with the scoop. The goal is to run a couple of scoops through the sample-handling machinery in order to clear out any material that has gotten into it during the rover's travels to its current location. After two samples a run through, the third will actually be sent off to the different chemistry labs within the rover.
The process will be slow, and personnel at the Jet Propulsion Lab don't expect the first samples to be analyzed for a couple of weeks. During that time, the rover will remain at the Rocknest formation.
This review was originally published in October 2015, shortly after the film's U.S. premiere at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. High-Rise releases nation-wide today.
I was predisposed to like High-Rise, given my admiration for J.G. Ballard's fiction and Ben Wheatley's films. Wheatley is a Fantastic Fest favorite; his previous films Down Terrace, Kill List, Sightseers, and A Field in England all had their US premieres there in previous years, so it's no surprise that High-Rise was one of the hot tickets for this year's festival.
Advance word out of TIFF was fairly polarized, and reactions at Fantastic Fest were similarly split. High-Rise is not to all tastes. Overly literal minds will spend too much time wondering why Laing doesn't just leave the high-rise and go to Tesco instead of doing the notorious thing that he does for food in the opening scene. Some may be slightly disappointed by the fact that it is what they envisioned when they heard ‚ÄúBen Wheatley is directing an adaptation of High-Rise‚Äù and thus lacks some surprise. However, the film largely succeeds‚ÄîBen Wheatley and screenwriter/co-editor Amy Jump have created a visually striking, splendidly acted adaptation that accurately captures the sardonic humour and the gimlet observations of human behaviour of Ballard's novel.
In discussing Ballard, references are often made to his ‚Äúprescience,‚Äù and High-Rise is sometimes described as a ‚Äúwarning‚Äù‚Äîstumbling into the annoying trap of evaluating science fiction by the degree to which it ‚Äúpredicts‚Äù the future. If anything, High-Rise is a still-relevant satire in which Ballard was exaggerating ad absurdum social currents already extant in the 1970s Britain.
The story, for those unfamiliar: the year is 1976; pathologist Robert Laing moves into a brand-new forty-story high-rise apartment building. His flat is on the twenty-fifth floor, in a zone inhabited by other middle-class professionals‚Äîdentists, accountants, psychologists, and the like. Above are jewellers, tax accountants, celebrities, and the designer of the high-rise himself, architect Anthony Royal. Below are artists, TV studio technicians, grocery store clerks, and housekeepers to the upper floors. Families with children‚Äî‚Äùthe real ones,‚Äù one resident says‚Äîalso occupy the lower floors.
Royal's high-rise is a modernist experiment: an attempt to draw people from all walks of life into a purpose-created building with equal access to resources. The building is one of a proposed five, part of a master-planned complex that Laing thinks resembles ‚Äúthe unconscious diagram of some sort of psychic event.‚Äù It's reminiscent of the Barbican, a complex of high-rise towers and low-rise apartment blocks arranged around a center that includes an arts venue, a museum, a plant conservatory, an exclusive school, and one of the oldest churches in London. The actual Barbican may be one of the most Ballardian locations in the world, and it almost certainly inspired the production design in Wheatley's film.
Royal's grand plans notwithstanding, the high-rise residents quickly organize according to the familiar social hierarchy emphasized by their home floors, and a kind of small-town curtain-twitching interferes with the supposed anonymity of high-rise life. There are acts of petty spite and discontent. After a power outage (accompanied in the film by a children's birthday party that goes anarchically out of hand, disrupting a private party at the community swimming pool), relations escalate into literal class warfare. The parties that happen nearly nightly turn into battles. The residents of the lower floors ambush the residents above and torment or kill anyone they catch; the upper-story residents plan to ‚Äúbalkanize‚Äù the lower floors. Conditions decay ferociously; soon the inhabitants are living in warring hunter-gatherer tribes, surrounded by heaps of their own garbage.
The most successful people are those like Laing‚Äî‚Äùthe self-contained types like you, thriving like an advanced species in the neutral atmosphere.‚Äù Early in his residency, Laing admits to having trouble ‚Äúslotting in,‚Äù and he tries to negotiate a position: first within his own stratum; then amongst the inhabitants of the upper floors, who reject him harshly, despite Royal having claimed him as a regular squash partner; and then amid those of the lower floors, in whose insurrection he is not quite comfortable participating. By the end, he has finally found his place. Early on in the film, he calls in sick to work and tells his secretary that ‚ÄúI don't need anything; it's all here.‚Äù Truer words and all that.
Ballard's work has twice been adapted to film‚ÄîCrash by David Cronenberg, and Empire of the Sun by Steven Spielberg. Both directors found in their chosen Ballard novels the material to feed their own cinematic styles and obsessions‚ÄîSpielberg tells a boy's coming-of-age story, and Cronenberg turns his dispassionate eye on one of the most brutal intersections between technology and the human body. High-Rise in turn dovetails perfectly with Wheatley's hallucinatory style and pitch-dark sense of humor. His camera, unlike Cronenberg's, is intimately involved with the characters, jittering and shaking with them, crashing on the floor when they fight. He does encounter a problem inherent to screen depictions of debauchery and degeneracy‚Äîoften, the act of depiction diminishes the scene, which can't match the images the reader might have in their mind. However, Wheatley generally manages to suggest more than he depicts (and he depicts quite a lot), and his florid, exaggerated visuals are a surprisingly good match for Ballard's deadpan satire.
There are times when Wheatley goes just a little too far. A scene at Laing's teaching hospital where he strips the flesh from a skull signals too sharply the sublimated violence beneath the high-rise's banal gloss. Royal's wife throws a party where the guests are kitted out as 18th-century French aristocrats, upper-class decadents plainly ready for some kind of guillotine. In the novel, the reason for the first death in the high-rise is unknown; whether suicide, homicide, or accident, the point is that no one cares. The film departs significantly by making that death the indirect result of an act of spiteful revenge on Laing's part. Such moments are a bit too on-the-nose‚Äîbut then again, the source is already about as subtle as a half-brick in a sock; witness the names Anthony Royal and Richard Wilder for two men on opposite ends of the social ladder. Laing himself shares a name with controversial psychologist R.D. Laing, among whose theories are the idea that mental illnesses, such as psychosis, were in part a reaction to the stresses caused by the conflicting demands of society and family.
Laing is perfectly embodied by Tom Hiddleston, whose good looks and physical grace have always had something louche and ophidian about them. His performance as Loki often deployed those qualities to the point of self-parody; here he is subtler and more restrained. He cultivates a careful exterior blandness, constantly mouthing platitudes about how everything will surely be fine‚Äîthe power will be restored, and all will return to normal soon enough‚Äîeven as he fluidly adapts to the chaos around him.
His restraint almost allows his co-stars to steal the show. Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) starts brash and lively, and devolves to a point where he speaks mostly in guttural growls, rapes ‚Äúpeople he isn't supposed to‚Äù (says one outraged upper-floors man), and eats dog food with relish. Jeremy Irons‚Äîwho has apparently scarcely aged at all since Dead Ringers‚Äîplays Anthony Royal with a touch of arch camp, swanning about in his increasingly bloodstained white safari jacket and brandishing a chrome walking-stick.
Wheatley and Jump notably give more time to the women of the high-rise than they are afforded in the novel. Laing's neighbor and occasional fling Charlotte Melville (Sienna Miller) gains greater significance as someone whose membership on ‚Äúall sorts of committees‚Äù and contacts through all levels of the high-rise make her a sharp-eyed observer and commentator. Wilder's wife Helen (an underutilized but still marvelous Elisabeth Moss) is sharper of tongue and less frustratingly passive, and Royal's wife Ann (Keeley Hawes) and actress Jane Sheridan (Sienna Guillory) create an unsettling double-act made more unnerving by their physical similarity. Initially, the men treat them as possessions, sexual playthings, and bargaining chips, but as time passes, the women draw together in bands for mutual protection, apparently even in defiance of the class lines ferociously defended by the men; they tend to Charlotte after she's been brutalized by Wilder, for instance, and in the final act they avenge themselves on one of their tormentors with many sharp knives. Suggestively, one of the most significant visuals is the presence in Royal's penthouse of Goya's Witches' Sabbath.
That coalition of women that forms as the men tear each other apart strikes the closest thing to any kind of ‚Äúuplifting‚Äù note in High-Rise. As the film closes, lights begin to fail in the next high-rise over, and Charlotte's son sits on the roof, listening to a radio broadcast of (not yet Prime Minister) Margaret Thatcher declaring that ‚ÄúThere is only one economic system in the world, and that is capitalism.‚Äù The microcosm within the high-rise suggests that she may have had a point‚Äîperhaps humans have an innate drive toward capitalist exploitation and hierarchy that even the best-intentioned plans cannot defeat, particularly when people have been conditioned from birth to find their ‚Äúslot.‚Äù However, Wheatley's film is as resistant to tidy interpretation as Ballard's original novel, and like the novel, it goes to artistic extremes to call attention to aspects of human nature that the viewer may not want to see.

Celebrity brand endorsers are not a new concept in brand marketing, particularly in the fashion and sneaker world. So when Kanye West left Nike for Adidas in December 2013, while news breaking, it was just another in the long line of celebrity signings by the German footwear and apparel brand.
Fast forward to today, and Adidas is riding a wave of sneaker- and pop-culture buzz directly and indirectly tied back to Kanye and his Yeezy Boost clothing and shoe line. It's safe to say this deal has flipped the traditional celebrity brand partnership structure on its head.
Kanye's past relationship with Nike was pretty simple: The Portland-based juggernaut would release a namesake sneaker that featured his creative input in limited quantities, and Kanye received a static endorsement fee. Creative control in the product development or in the market deployment strategy were not part of the deal. And in what ultimately broke the business relationship, neither was a financially featured back-end bonus structure, profit sharing, or joint venture-like structure.
Adidas has taken that traditional endorser deal structure and looked at it through the lens of a (well-funded) fashion tech startup. It has given Kanye and the rest of its celebrity endorsers creative freedom while leveraging data from the secondary sneaker market to manipulate and create marketplace hype with strategic release timing and quantities‚Äìall with the goal of increasing relevancy with the sneaker culture 5% sub-market to influence and drive the 95% mainstream footwear sales.
Following are three lessons from Yeezy and Adidas that brands can apply to their celebrity endorsement relationships.
1. Joint-Venture Deal Mindset
The music industry revolutionized the company/artist business relationship with the invention of the 360-degree deal structure. A 360-artist deal is based around a business partnership where the company (record label or artist management company) provides an integrated support system to an artist in exchange for a percentage across the artist's revenue streams, often including sales of music, live performances, publishing, and more.
Adidas has leveraged this same approach by offering joint-venture-type agreements that, while not necessarily taking a percentage in the artist's revenue streams, have given its celebrity partners the sense of having ‚Äúskin in the game.‚Äù
The keys to applying this concept are based on a relatively simple, yet fundamental psychological approach to the artist and brand partnership.
‚Ä¢ Creative deal structure: Get creative with compensation both financially and creatively, and your artist partner will become emotionally invested beyond just a sponsorship deal.
‚Ä¢ Provide more than just a check: Artists need a support system that allows them to bring their creative talent to the marketplace. If you can only sign a check, do a traditional sponsorship deal. If you want an integrated partnership, leverage your corporate infrastructure to provide something that most artists' lack: a multifaceted support team that will allow their creative talent to shine and a brand team to focus on what it does best.
2. Growth Hack Your Brand's Social Reach Through The Celebrity (And Their Friends)
Kanye did something unprecedented in February 2015: Within 72 hours he took over New York Fashion Week with an unannounced show that L.A. Times said drew ‚Äúpossibly one of the highest-wattage front rows in New York Fashion Week history,‚Äù following by free performances during the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend, happening simultaneously. The result: an Adidas takeover weekend that featured zero dollars spent on traditional event sponsorship and was completely earned through the nexus of what Fortune called a ‚Äúmusic-fashion-celebrity thing.‚Äù
While this worked out amazingly for Adidas, not all celebrities have the Q Score, and not all brands have the social footprint like Adidas and its three stripes. The key to leveraging these tactics is looking at your artist's social sphere and understanding the best way to tap into the potential.
‚Ä¢ Fluid two-way dialogue: The lines of communication between talent and brand must be fluid, open, and direct. Artist management, talent agencies, and advertising firms, while necessary, often slow down the communication process. Hack the back and forth by allowing direct contact between the artist and the decision maker(s) and the brand team. This is the only way the brand can hear the artist's creative vision firsthand and provide direct feedback and builds.
‚Ä¢ Take data-driven creative risks: Leading up to that February weekend takeover, Adidas gave Kanye the social authority to release images of his yet-to-be released Yeezy 750 and 350 sneakers on social media through his extended group of friends and family.
While nontraditional, if you analyze the data (the potential social reach of the collective group of influencers Kanye selected to leak the images) and the creative assets leveraged (organic nature and real world connotation of the images shared), you can see it was a growth-hacker approach to a product launch leveraging the ambassador's most unique asset‚ÄìKanye's inner circle with an unparalleled high social clout.
3. Give The Brand Co-Sign And Authority To Create Content
One of Kanye's biggest gripes with his former Beaverton business partner was that it didn't give him the system to showcase his fashion talent. In an interview with New York radio station Hot 97 in December 2013, Kanye shared the story of how Nike told him, ‚ÄúWe're gonna give you a bigger sandbox to play in. We're gonna give you this amount right here to design, and two collections a year, and 30 SKUs‚Äîthat's the amount of items that you have. Would that make you happy, Kanye?‚Äù
Kanye, as an artist, wasn't looking to be limited, much less have his creative freedom patronized. Adidas has, in turn, given Kanye and the rest of its artist stable the room to flex their creative gusto not just in the product development, but in the go-to market strategy and tactics as well.
Kanye has returned the favor by integrating the brand into the fabric of everything he does from a creative standpoint, above and beyond the structure of his letter agreement. From one-of-a-kind product seedings (i.e., President Obama in October) to original creative material (he released the single ‚ÄúFacts‚Äù on New Year's Eve with half the song dedicated to his disdain for Nike and his thoughts on who's winning the sneaker battle heading into 2016), Kanye created original creative content that gave the brand an unquantifiable multiple on its original investment.
Creating Our Own ‚ÄòYeezy-Halo' Effect
When Adidas first signed Kanye West, a ton of criticism and chatter followed about whether the deal would do anything to help bring back the brand's relevancy and allow it to compete with Nike for the top spot in the footwear industry.
While not yet reclaiming the No. 2 spot from Under Armour, Adidas is coming off being the most-liked sneaker brand on Instagram for 2015, having arguably the No. 1 sneaker of year in the Ultra Boost running shoe, and touting unmatched brand buzz across the board, including renewed interest in the Stan Smiths and Superstar heritage shoe lines.
Not all artist relationships are as integrated into the fabric of pop culture or deeply emotional as Kanye and Adidas. But with a real-time holistic approach leveraging artist passion points and a corporate brand marketing infrastructure, we can leverage the same tactics to ‚ÄúYeezy-hack‚Äù the traditional celebrity brand business relationship.
During gamescom we had a nice long chat with Jeff Skalski, senior producer on Dungeon Keeper at EA's Mythic studio. They're remaking Dungeon Keeper from the ground up as a free-to-play mobile game. Yes, there are in-app purchases, which we'll go into in another post but here's a video gameplay demo from Skalski, showing off the dungeon-building features. There's a written summary below.
[UPDATE: Also see part 2, where he talks about the Dungeon Keeper game modes, minion types and in-app purchases]
Your mentor in Dungeon Keeper was always the huge red demon pictured above, named Horny. Mythic have brought back his original voice actor, Richard Ridings for those familiarly ominous warnings like ‚ÄúIt is payday‚Äú.
Your essential rooms are, of course, the treasury for keeping all that sweet dungeon loot and the hatchery for chickens to feed your minions. These are fixed sizes now, rather than the free-room room-design of the original games. Mythic felt that since there was always an optimal size for each room, better to just let players place that and add extras as and when they need them. You can move rooms as well, so there's no worry about screwing up the space for future expansion.
You see, Dungeon Keeper on mobile is about optimising your dungeon against human enemies, not the AI controlled opponents of yore. There are no levels ‚Äì you build a persistent dungeon and other players have ~3 minutes to attack it, taking your dungeon heart. Once the attack is over, you can watch the replay and spot how they broke through your defences.
If you switch Push notifications on, you'll be told when someone attacks. Assuming you're not on an important business phone call, you can swing into action as the Keeper, casting spells like Cluck Off to turn your opponent into a chicken, or summoning a dragon to breathe fire across the enemy.
Check back tomorrow when we'll have another video up showing combat and talking about the in-app purchases.
Dungeon Keeper will be out on iOS and Android later this year.

The green line (reference case) shows projected carbon pollution before accounting for the policies in the Climate Leadership Plan and the federal carbon price schedule. The blue line (B.C. climate plan & federal carbon price) shows projected carbon pollution with those policies included. Chart: PICS/Pembina Institute/CEC
VANCOUVER / COAST SALISH TERRITORY ‚Äî Today, the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions, Pembina Institute, and Clean Energy Canada released the first independent assessment of British Columbia's Climate Leadership Plan in combination with the federal government's recently announced carbon price schedule.
The analysis, prepared by Navius Research, projects that the combined carbon pollution from LNG and natural gas, industry and utilities, transport, and buildings will increase until 2030 and remain above current levels until at least 2050. Carbon pollution from these sources is forecast to hit 66 megatonnes (Mt) in 2050, compared to the province's legislated target of 12.6 Mt.
The modelling used in the analysis did not assess or incorporate the province's commitment to increase the amount of carbon stored in B.C.'s forests. Based on the government's estimates, these actions could close the projected 53-Mt gap in 2050 to 41 Mt.
Growing carbon pollution from LNG and upstream shale gas operations constitutes the largest contributor to the size of the gap. Relative to today, carbon pollution from LNG and natural gas is projected to double by 2050. In comparison, carbon pollution from transport and buildings is forecast to see respective declines of 35% and 50% over the same period. Additional actions will be required in all sectors for B.C. to meet its targets.
B.C. has promised to update its climate plan in 2017. To achieve B.C.'s 2050 carbon pollution target and do its part in Canada's efforts to meet the country's Paris Agreement commitments for 2030, the province will need to further develop the policies and make the investments promised in the current plan. The B.C. government will also need to commit to stronger policies across all sectors of the economy to bridge the sizable gap. The Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions, Pembina Institute, and Clean Energy Canada continue to support the development and implementation of those next steps.
Quick facts
B.C.'s annual carbon pollution from LNG and natural gas, industry and utilities, transport, and buildings is projected to hit 68 Mt in 2030 under B.C.'s climate plan ‚Äî an 8-Mt increase from today.
An 8-Mt increase in carbon pollution is akin to adding two million cars to the province's roads.
The province's legislated emissions targets are 43.5 Mt in 2020 and 12.6 Mt in 2050. In the Climate Leadership Plan released in August, the government renewed its commitment to meeting the 2050 target.
Under the plan, fossil fuels will continue to supply the majority of the province's energy until at least 2030.
Quotes
‚ÄúThis analysis highlights the extent of the gap between B.C.'s legislated emission reduction targets and where this initial plan takes us. As Canada gets ready this week to create its national strategy on climate, this report is a timely reminder of increased effort that is required by all, if we are to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change.‚Äù
‚Äî Sybil Seitzinger, executive director, Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions
‚ÄúFor Canada's climate plan to be successful, B.C. needs to step up its game. The province needs a carbon pollution reduction plan that closes the gap to its climate targets and builds a sustainable economy powered by renewable energy and energy efficiency.‚Äù
‚Äî Matt Horne, B.C. associate director, Pembina Institute
‚ÄúB.C.'s climate plan is out of step with national climate efforts: Canada's carbon pollution has to go down to meet its 2030 target, while B.C.'s plan will see pollution climb. Accelerating a transition to renewable energy would help B.C. reduce carbon pollution and increase jobs in the sector from 11,000 today to over 15,000 over the next 10 years.‚Äù

One of the unique aspects of MLS is the wide variety of its teams, and subsequently, their rivalries. Some are new and some are old. Some involve teams from the same city, while others cross borders (and not just states, but countries). There exist rivalries between fan bases with different languages, teams with drastically different playing styles, and cities of different milieus, climates and elevations.
But if there's one thing that the following rivalries have in common ‚Äì aside from being composed of clubs that don't seem to like each other very much ‚Äì is that they're the most underrated of the bunch.
4) New York City FC vs. Orlando City SC
New York City and Orlando made their MLS debuts against each other back in 2015 and the game was a memorable one: a 1-1 draw with drama and craziness ‚Äì a crowd of more than 60,000, two late goals, six yellow cards and a red. It felt like the beginning of something special. And it was.
In their third season, the two teams provide some of the most intriguing and fiercely contested games on the MLS calendar. It helps that coach Jason Kreis is now in his first full season in charge at Orlando ‚Äì after being fired by New York City at the end of the expansion campaign. It's clear that for Kreis, playing against New York isn't just any other game; and perhaps the same goes for Patrick Vieira, who replaced him at the helm. The two teams have already played each other three times this year and each game has had plenty of intensity and talking points, especially when Vieira claimed that his team had played better than Orlando in all three games, despite the fact that Orlando had won the first two meetings. Kreis didn't appreciate those comments, and a war of words ensued. The next time these two teams meet might well be the playoffs, and that's not something you'll want to miss.
3) FC Dallas vs. Houston Dynamo
Of the in-state rivalries, the Texas derby deserves more attention than it gets. Maybe it won't garner the same kind of fanfare that other rivalries will, but the animosity between the teams is just as high. This might only be one incident, but go have a look at Ricardo Clark kicking Carlos Ruiz in the chest in 2006.
The sporting rivalry between Big D and Space City goes back a long time and spans several sports. The MLS version is more than a decade old ‚Äì and the Dynamo have had the best of things so far, winning consecutive MLS Cups in 2005 and 2006. That hasn't sat so well with Dallas, who have yet to win a title, despite being around since the league's inception (though perhaps that changes this year ‚Ä¶)
These two have played many memorable games against each other. And now that Dallas and Houston are among the top sides in the West, and have some of the league's most exciting attacking players, you might be hard-pressed to find a better fixture to watch. To top it all off, the winner of the overall meetings during a season claims El Capitan: a mountain howitzer cannon.
2) Seattle Sounders vs. Vancouver Whitecaps FC
Seattle vs. Portland deserves much of the hoopla it gets, but what about another Cascadia derby? Seattle vs. Vancouver doesn't get as much notice as it should. Sure, there's also Vancouver vs. Portland, which might be more intense in some ways, but Seattle vs. Vancouver has plenty of bite and lots of traveling fans too. Most importantly, it not only has the longest history of the three Cascadia rivalries, it's the oldest rivalry in North American soccer, period, dating back all the way to 1974. That's something that needs to be cherished and celebrated more.
And what makes the rivalry extra special this year is that the Whitecaps' signed former Seattle star Fredy Montero, much to the Sounders' supporters displeasure. It's been a slow start to the season for Montero, who notably opted against celebrating earlier this year, but he has plenty of time to get his sporting boots on before the next time Vancouver faces Seattle, which will be on August 23 at BC Place. The 'Caps travel to visit the Sounders on September 27.
1) Montreal Impact vs. Toronto FC
If this is the most underrated rivalry, it's in part due to a reluctance to explain the reasons for why it's so heated. ‚ÄúWhat people think, we dare say out loud,‚Äù read one banner on Wednesday at Stade Saputo, when the Impact hosted TFC in the first leg of the Canadian Championship ‚Äì a 1-1 draw. I won't however spell out what the fans did finally dare say, but what I will say is that this rivalry is fierce; from an emotional standpoint, the fiercest team sporting event in Canada. Was anyone really expecting TFC, on the equalizing goal, to kick the ball out with an injured Montreal defender in the box calling for medical attention? Fat chance that was ever going to happen. You won't find any of your customary Canadian friendliness here.
Seattle-Portland aside, this is the best rivalry in MLS. The sporting rivalry between the two cities goes back more than 100 years and the political antagonism goes much further. Comparisons between the two teams are always being made and they seem to be keeping a close eye on what each other's up to. Impact gets Italian DPs; Toronto gets an Italian DP. Toronto has success with a back three; the Impact start playing with a back three. Coincidence? Je ne pense pas. I could go on.
The father of a missing South Carolina woman issued an urgent plea Monday for the public's help in locating his daughter, a day after hundreds of volunteers scoured the area in search of the 20-year-old woman.
Authorities and volunteers combed woods and ponds in Horry County, S.C., over the weekend looking for any sign of Heather Elvis, of Myrtle Beach. Nearly 300 people searched for 10 hours on Saturday for the young woman who was last seen at about 2:30 a.m. on Dec. 17.
"It's a living nightmare," Elvis' father, Terry, told FoxNews.com on Monday. "I can't beg enough for information. If you've seen anything, if you've heard anything, if you have a friend, family member or acquaintance who acted differently on that day, I beg you to come forward."
"Any information -- as trivial as it may seem -- helps us," he said. "This could be anybody's child."
Heather Elvis was last heard from around 3 a.m. Dec. 17 after she went on a date, according to her family. Her car was found abandoned at a boat landing Dec. 18 in Horry County.
A source close to the case said the young man whom Heather met on the date is not considered a suspect. Her cellphone has not been located, the source said.
Lt. Robert Kegler of the Horry County Police Department told FoxNews.com that "several people" are being interviewed in connection with the disappearance. "Some are cooperative, some are not," he said.
Investigators are poring over new leads on Monday and the case remains "very active," Kegler said.
Authorities searching for Elvis last week discovered the skeletal remains of a male in his 20's. The initial discovery had raised questions that the bones could belong to 17-year-old Brittanee Drexel, who was last seen in 2009. Drexel, a high school junior from the Rochester area, went with friends and without her mother's permission to Myrtle Beach on April 23, 2009. Authorities have long said they suspect Drexel is dead, but exhaustive searches for the teenager have never turned up her remains.
A $20,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to Heather Elvis. Anyone with information on the case is urged to call investigators at 843-915-TIPS.
On this day in 1839, the initials ‚ÄúO.K.‚Äù are first published in The Boston Morning Post. Meant as an abbreviation for ‚Äúoll korrect,‚Äù a popular slang misspelling of ‚Äúall correct‚Äù at the time, OK steadily made its way into the everyday speech of Americans.
During the late 1830s, it was a favorite practice among younger, educated circles to misspell words intentionally, then abbreviate them and use them as slang when talking to one another. Just as teenagers today have their own slang based on distortions of common words, such as ‚Äúkewl‚Äù for ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚ÄúDZ‚Äù for ‚Äúthese,‚Äù the ‚Äúin crowd‚Äù of the 1830s had a whole host of slang terms they abbreviated. Popular abbreviations included ‚ÄúKY‚Äù for ‚ÄúNo use‚Äù (‚Äúknow yuse‚Äù), ‚ÄúKG‚Äù for ‚ÄúNo go‚Äù (‚ÄúKnow go‚Äù), and ‚ÄúOW‚Äù for all right (‚Äúoll wright‚Äù).

Of all the abbreviations used during that time, OK was propelled into the limelight when it was printed in the Boston Morning Post as part of a joke. Its popularity exploded when it was picked up by contemporary politicians. When the incumbent president Martin Van Buren was up for reelection, his Democratic supporters organized a band of thugs to influence voters. This group was formally called the ‚ÄúO.K. Club,‚Äù which referred both to Van Buren's nickname ‚ÄúOld Kinderhook‚Äù (based on his hometown of Kinderhook, New York), and to the term recently made popular in the papers. At the same time, the opposing Whig Party made use of ‚ÄúOK‚Äù to denigrate Van Buren's political mentor Andrew Jackson. According to the Whigs, Jackson invented the abbreviation ‚ÄúOK‚Äù to cover up his own misspelling of ‚Äúall correct.‚Äù

The man responsible for unraveling the mystery behind ‚ÄúOK‚Äù was an American linguist named Allen Walker Read. An English professor at Columbia University, Read dispelled a host of erroneous theories on the origins of ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù ranging from the name of a popular Army biscuit (Orrin Kendall) to the name of a Haitian port famed for its rum (Aux Cayes) to the signature of a Choctaw chief named Old Keokuk. Whatever its origins, ‚ÄúOK‚Äù has become one of the most ubiquitous terms in the world, and certainly one of America's greatest lingual exports.

To say that questions of morality are thorny and filled with gray when they aren't being hammered between stark absolutes is putting it mildly. Because of this there can be great drama when characters who represent a wide range of moral viewpoints come together or into conflict.
The strangest of these characters are those who espouse Blue and Orange Morality. These characters have a moral framework that is so utterly alien and foreign to human experience that we can't peg them as "good" or "evil". They aren't a Chaotic Neutral Unfettered, though they may seem to act terrifyingly randomly; nor are they necessarily a Lawful Neutral Fettered, because our and their understanding of "law" as a concept may not even be equivalent. There might be a logic behind their actions, it's just that they operate with entirely different sets of values and premises with which to draw their conclusions. It's also worth noting that such cultures are just as likely to be something we'd find appalling, as they are to be something we'd find benign and/or weird. They may also find us appalling, benign, or weird even if we don't see them that way.

And although they are often likely to commit acts we would see as horrific, some are unusually benign. Either way they tend to act as if nothing were the matter. Because in their world/mind, that's just what they do. This trope is one of the trickier to pull off well, because Most Writers Are Human, and it's often hard to portray alien and truly foreign. Because of this, it's not uncommon for audience members to label these characters as Designated Heroes or villains due to human audiences often lacking the experience or knowledge that these fictional characters have. Audiences must remember that these characters are meant to be Morally Ambiguous.
This is similar to Values Dissonance, but the main difference is that societies with Values Dissonance can, at least on a basic level, generally measure one another by the same concepts of Good and Evil, or even Order and Chaos. With Blue and Orange Morality, the values are so foreign, that such concepts can no longer be applied. They may not even know what these things are, or even if they do, will often find them confusing. The concepts are not necessarily beyond their grasp, mind you, but just aren't something which they'd place any importance on.

Conversely, they may have these concepts, but apply them in vastly different ways. Such as regarding motionlessness as the epitome of evil, or viewing exploration as an element of chaos.
Note that cases involving solely a misapprehension of facts and consequences do not count here no matter how alien the reasons; if, for example, a race of aliens thinks killing is okay because its own members respawn within a day with no harm done, and mistake humans as working the same way, that doesn't mean they wouldn't balk at killing if they realized the degree of harm it causes to other creatures. In this case, they may be working by comprehensible moral standards and just gravely mistaken about the implications of their actions.
Likely candidates for Blue and Orange Morality include The Fair Folk, who follow rules of their own making; Eldritch Abominations that are beyond comprehension; the more exotic Starfish Aliens; AIs and robots, especially when super smart and/or incapable of emotion. An individual human (or single members of any species whose majority falls into darker morality) who operates on this is the √úbermensch of Nietzschean philosophy (a human being who has developed their own Blue/Orange set of morals). A Nominal Hero may have this motivation as well. Moral Sociopathy overlaps strongly with this trope for obvious reasons, though this is not always the case.
Compare Xenofiction, Humans Are Cthulhu, Humanity Is Infectious (all often involving this), Above Good and Evil, Affably Evil / Faux Affably Evil (they sometimes can come across as this), Even Evil Has Standards (when handled poorly or bizarrely), Evil Cannot Comprehend Good (less elaborate forms that resemble this in practice), and Non-Malicious Monster (which occasionally requires this), and Obliviously Evil (when a villain thinks that his actions are acceptable or helpful). When two sides go to war and nothing will stop them except total annihilation, that's Guilt-Free Extermination War. If the character genuinely knows everything will turn out okay, allowing the plot to treat them as a good guy no matter how cruel, irresponsible or fascist this makes them by our standards, that's Omniscient Morality License.
Has nothing to do with the following: Bucknell University, The University of Illinois, The University of Virginia, The University of Florida, Auburn University, Syracuse University, Hope College, Gettysburg College or Boise State University (the colors of all of which are blue and orange, albeit different shades in each case). Nor the Denver Broncos, Chicago Bears, New York Knicks, New York Mets, New York Islanders, Edmonton Oilers, or Mango Sentinels. Or the City of New York, for that matter. Furthermore, do not confuse with Blue and Orange Movies (even if they do overlap). Also has nothing to do with the Karma Meter in Mass Effect nor the Aperture Science Hand Held Portal Device or even the light scheme in TRON and its universe.

They scare children for a living, but do it because it's their job and they simply enjoy it. Subverted in that they're still kind and unwilling to intentionally harm others. Oogey Boogey is the only citizen who is sadistic or murderous. Interestingly, they (including Jack) can't comprehend the basics of Christmas, and when they try to replicate it ... well, things Go Horribly Wrong. "Life's no fun without a good scare." It's debatable how canon this is (for obvious reasons), but in the Kingdom Hearts series, Jack tends to think of new experiences (such as the Heartless) in terms of how he can repurpose them into new Halloween surprises, but also tends to become quite disillusioned with them if it should ever come to light that it can actually cause people harm (such as, again, the Heartless). This is why Oogie Boogie is the villain of the original film: he's the only citizen of Halloweentown who actually wants to do harm to the people he scares.

Mythology and Folklore
At least in older stories (before pop culture made them rather Disney-fied and cute), this is usually one of the defining traits of The Fair Folk. Fairies obsess over seemingly trivial things that may mean nothing to us, and may perform acts of overwhelming kindness or barbarous cruelty for reasons that seem nonsensical to mortals. In some stories, one way of recognizing a fairy disguised as a human is that their emotional reactions may make no sense to us, laughing at tragic things and crying at happy ones.
Newspaper Comics
Roxanne of Candorville views villains as heroic and vice versa, but there are usually qualifiers for it‚Äîfor instance, she views eating meat as immoral, but wearing fur as a way of eternally preserving an animal's beauty. That said, with the exception of her own mother, nobody in the comic thinks this gives her a pass for her behavior. Even multiple murderers think she's scum.
Religion
Probably one of the most extreme examples is the Borborite Gnostic sect, assuming the reports of their existence aren't demonization by mainstream Christians. Imagine having a pretty standard Christian mindset... except that you think that the true version of the Eucharist entails eating semen, menstrual blood and fetuses extracted from pregnant women.
In the Mahabharata the river goddess Ganga bears King Shantanu several children...and drowns them. When he gives her a What the Hell, Hero?, she explains that it's Not What It Looks Like; the children are reincarnations of holy souls that need to transcend reincarnation (they committed a minor offense in a past life, and so were forced to be reincarnated as mortals, so Ganga lets that happen, and then kills them while they're still young and innocent so they can be released from reincarnation). Because she knew that there's no way King Shantanu would be able to comprehend this, she had asked him to never question her...and since he just did, she left him shortly afterwards. This is all a result of Brahma's curse to Shantanu in the latter's previous life. All the gods had gathered for a ritual when Ganga's clothes were blown away by the wind. The gods averted their eyes but Shantanu ogled at her. Brahma cursed him that he would marry Ganga and she would break his heart. If it is any consolation, however, that eighth child turns out to become the legendary Bhishma, who was blessed with wish-long life and had sworn to serve the ruling Kuru king, and grand uncle of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Long story short, when Bhishma died, he was the eldest living ancestor to the equivalent of 5 generations of the Pandava line, and was strong enough to overcome even Arjuna in battle.
To an extent, this tends to happen when dealing with religious and spiritual matters that one may not be affiliated or familiar with. When an outside perspective is perplexed by the perceived arbitrariness and/or contradiction of a belief, a commonly given answer is that the higher powers aren't easily understood and also that the problem is most likely on our end. Thus the best we can do is listen to them and hope for the best. This also comes up in response to the common question of why, in a universe believed to be controlled by a benevolent force, bad things happen to good people. Many philosophies and religions recognize that the needs and wants of an individual and the needs of the universe at large will conflict, and a transcendent being likely isn't exclusively concerned with the former. So while one person might see another's Power(s) That Be as needlessly cruel for an action that doesn't sit with well with them, that other person would say that it is the right thing to do from their own and their divine entity's standpoint.
Theater
Read this statement by Human Rights Watch that was released late Friday and ask yourself how Washington should react to Netanyahu√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s claims that families in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem should be to entitled to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnatural growth.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù One wonders if the demolitions described below were timed to coincide with Obama√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s speech at Cairo University.
Israel: Stop Demolishing Palestinian Homes
West Bank Homes of 18 Families Destroyed; Others Given 24 Hours to Evacuate
(Jerusalem, June 13, 2009) √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú The Israeli government should immediately stop demolishing Palestinian homes and property in the West Bank and compensate the people it has displaced, Human Rights Watch said today.
Israeli authorities destroyed the homes and property of 18 shepherd families in the northern Jordan Valley on June 4, 2009, displacing approximately 130 people, after ordering them on May 31 to evacuate because they were living in a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìclosed military zone.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Some of the families whose homes and property were destroyed had been living in their village since at least the 1950s.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGiving families less than a week to evacuate their homes, without any opportunity for review or appeal, is as heartless as it is unfair,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIsrael should have given these people due process to contest their displacement.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
At 7:30 a.m. on June 4, witnesses said, around 20 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) jeeps, three bulldozers, and several white cars belonging to the Israeli Civil Administration Authority arrived and blocked off the dirt access roads to the shantytown of ar-Ras al-Ahmar. The demolition operation began at 8 a.m. and destroyed 13 residential structures, 19 animal pens, and 18 traditional, underground ovens, according to the UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The 18 displaced families included 67 children, the agency reported. Israeli soldiers also confiscated a tractor, a trailer, and a portable water tank that residents used to truck in water, witnesses said.
Members of the Israel Defense Forces and the Civil Administration Authority delivered eviction and stop-construction orders to 30 families, comprising approximately 250 people, at about 5 a.m. on May 31 in ar-Ras al-Ahmar and the nearby community of Hadidiyya, according to witnesses and Tawfiq Jabarin, a lawyer for some of the families. The orders stated that 18 families in ar-Ras al-Ahmar were living in a closed military zone and gave them 24 hours to leave, without any opportunity for appeal.
Israeli authorities had declared the area a closed military zone years ago and could have issued eviction orders at any time. The District Coordination Liaison Office (DCL) of the Israeli Civil Administration told Human Rights Watch that the eviction orders were issued because √¢‚Ç¨≈ìit is dangerous to live there. They [the residents] could be hurt by ammunition or military exercises.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù The liaison office did not explain the reason for issuing the orders long after the area was declared closed, but this practice is not uncommon, according to Israeli and Palestinian nongovernmental organizations.
Jabarin told Human Rights Watch that after the demolitions on June 4, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmost of the displaced moved to a different part of ar-Ras al-Ahmar about 300 meters away, and the army came back again, at night on Saturday [June 6], and told them that they had to leave.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù The displaced are depending on emergency assistance, he said.
Under an Israeli military order from 1970, the government may evict persons living in a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìclosed military zone√¢‚Ç¨¬ù without any judicial or administrative procedures. Section 90 of the order states that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpermanent residents√¢‚Ç¨¬ù can remain in an area later designated as closed, and that eviction orders cannot change their status as permanent residents. However, the Israeli High Court of Justice has ruled that because the shepherds in the area are pastoralists, the term √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpermanent residents√¢‚Ç¨¬ù does not apply to them.
Residents say that ar-Ras al-Ahmar and al-Hadidiyya date from at least the 1950s. The Israeli settlement of Ro√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢i was built between the two villages in 1978. The two communities and Ro√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢i lie within √¢‚Ç¨≈ìArea C√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of the West Bank, over which Israel retains near-total control under the Oslo Agreements of 1995.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s astonishing to see Israel evict Palestinians from their villages in the West Bank, yet again violating the rights of the occupied population, while allowing a settlement which by law should never have been built in the first place, to remain,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Whitson.
On June 9, Jabarin said, the Israeli High Court of Justice temporarily enjoined the state from further demolitions against the people remaining in ar-Ras al-Ahmar. In al-Hadidiyya, Jabarin said, seven families who received stop-construction orders will have the chance to appeal and to apply for building permits at the hearing.
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in December 2006, the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition against earlier demolition orders for al-Hadidiyya, because the affected buildings were in an area defined as agricultural in master plans from the British Mandatory period and posed a security threat to the nearby Ro√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢i settlement. Israeli authorities demolished homes in al-Hadidiyya in February and March 2008, displacing about 60 people in all. Some of the displaced families returned to the area later, but due to repeated evictions over the years, more than a dozen households from al-Hadidiyya have been permanently displaced.
While Israel, as the occupying power in the West Bank, may in some cases lawfully require residents to leave their homes, it must not do so arbitrarily and must afford affected persons meaningful due process. Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), among other treaties to which Israel is a party that apply in the West Bank, prohibits arbitrary or unlawful state interference with anyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s home.
Israel√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s policy of demolishing the homes of Palestinian residents of the West Bank, while allowing the construction and growth of nearby settlements, is discriminatory. The prohibition against discrimination is spelled out in Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and codified in the major human rights treaties that Israel has ratified, including the ICCPR, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
Ongoing home demolitions prevent residents of the West Bank from enjoying the right to adequate housing. In its General Comment 4, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors the compliance of states parties to the ICESCR, held that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe right to housing should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense which equates it with, for example, the shelter provided by merely having a roof over one√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s head or views shelter exclusively as a commodity. Rather it should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Some of the displaced people from ar-Ras al-Ahmar were previously displaced. One of Jabarin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s clients, Abderrahim Hossein Bisharat, moved to ar-Ras al-Ahmar after Israeli authorities demolished his home in the nearby village of al-Hadidiyya, twice, most recently in 2008.
Background and Accounts
According to Bimkom, an Israeli nongovernmental organization that specializes in planning and zoning issues, Palestinians in the West Bank commonly build homes without first applying for building permits because the application process is expensive, time-consuming, and usually unsuccessful. Israel denied 94 percent of Palestinian building permit applications in the West Bank between 2000 and 2007, according to the UN (OCHA), and there are approximately 3,000 Israeli demolition orders outstanding in the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem. In 2009, prior to the demolitions in ar-Ras al-Ahmar, Israel demolished another 27 Palestinian structures in the West Bank, displacing 120 people.
Earlier in May, OCHA reported that Israeli authorities distributed seven stop√¢‚Ç¨¬êwork orders for construction in Khirbet Samra, north of al-Hadidiyya, affecting 35 persons, including 22 children; and six demolition orders that gave 25 persons, including 15 children, in the Qalqiliya governorate a maximum of 48 hours to evacuate. Their homes may be demolished at any time.
Abu Ahmad, a 62-year-old resident of ar-Ras al-Ahmar, was visiting the nearby village of Tammun when a relative called to tell him his home was being demolished. Ahmad told Human Rights Watch he tried to return, but that Israeli soldiers stopped him until 10 a.m., when it was too late. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOf my property, they destroyed a water tank, three sheep pens, and two tents,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù he said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere were 10 of us living there. Now our house is destroyed, and we have nowhere to go. We had to put up a plastic sheet over where our home was.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Abu Ahmad added that he had moved to ar-Ras al-Ahmar after Israeli authorities repeatedly demolished his residence in al-Hadidiyya, most recently in 2008.
Ahmad√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s son, Salah Abdallah Bisharat, 28, was living in his father√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s household when the demolition was carried out. He told Human Rights Watch that a bulldozer and 14 Israeli army jeeps arrived at the family√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s residence at 8 a.m. The soldiers ordered the family to leave their home, entered it themselves, and removed some of the pieces of furniture and set them aside, and then demolished the tents and sheep pens. Bisharat is now living with his wife and three children in a tent 200 meters from the demolition site.
Fathi Khodirat, a fieldworker with the Ma√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢an Development Center, witnessed the demolitions in ar-Ras al-Ahmar on the morning of June 4. He told Human Rights Watch:
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe soldiers knocked everything down; they even confiscated a tractor that belonged to someone who was just stopping by to collect animal waste to use as fertilizer. But these people can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t leave this area. They depend 100 percent on raising animals. Some of them moved here after their homes were demolished in other villages. Today, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still living there, or a few hundred meters away from where they were, and they have nothing.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Israeli authorities have repeatedly demolished homes and other property in al-Hadidiyya in recent years. Abu Saqqir, a 59-year-old man who was born in the village, told Human Rights Watch:
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn my own case, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve demolished my home four times. Now, we just have some pieces of wood and a tent to live in.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

Ingeborg Steensma grew up with mining. It shaped her everyday life and that of her family. Her father was once a demolition expert in the Sophia-Jacoba coal mine in H√ºckelhoven. He had lived his entire life in the small village between Aachen and M√∂nchengladbach in western Germany.
"When my father died, it was clear to me that I had to help," says Steensma. She moved into her parents' house to take care of her mother and her mentally disabled sister. It wasn't until weeks after moving there that she realized what she had gotten herself into. There are centimeter-wide cracks in the basement, foundation and walls of the house. Moisture penetrates through walls and floors. Some of the windows and doors are warped and can't be opened. The front section of the building is so crooked that her mother's wheeled walker starts moving on its own if the brakes aren't pulled. Life in the house is a "daily nightmare," says Steensma, 64.
She has little doubt as to who caused the damage. For years, Eschweiler Bergwerksverein (EBV), a former subsidiary of Ruhrkohle AG (RAG), mined bituminous coal in giant seams directly underneath the house, says Peter Immekus, an independent expert on mining damage.
In addition, says Immekus, the property is within the range of a crevice several hundred meters in length, which causes ongoing subsidence in the ground beneath the foundations.
The proof of mining damage could hardly be more obvious, says Immekus. Other houses in the neighborhood have been lost in landslides or are full of cracks. Until the 1980s, the mine operator had performed repairs without much fuss. But for many years now the company's behavior has changed.
Seeing No Evil
RAG now claims that fractures and imbalances are attributable to building construction flaws and that the claims of local residents are also past the statute of limitations. The company also closes its eyes to the crevice on its property. In fact, it simply doesn't appear on the mine operator's official mining maps.
For Steensma, all of this is an "appalling injustice." She refuses to accept the notion that her father's former employer is going to look on unapologetically when she and her care-dependent mother and 61-year-old sister end up on the street one day. But she doesn't have the money for a lawsuit involving costly expert witnesses and attorneys.
There is a method to the mining company's coarse approach, say victims. The coal mining industry and Germany's largest industry giant, RAG, are gradually pulling out of the country's industrial Ruhr region, now that lawmakers are no longer willing to pay billions in subsidies for unprofitable German coal. The last mine is expected to be closed by 2018. When that happens, the last shift will come to an end in a region that has seen more than 200 years of coal mining.
But instead of departing from the Ruhr region with decency, the company is apparently doing what it can to minimize costs and expenses. "It is a withdrawal that involves increasingly questionable methods, and it comes at the cost of thousands of home and property owners," says Klaus Friedrichs, the founder of one of the first victims' rights organizations in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The sums in question are in the triple-digit millions, and more than 35,000 damage claims are filed each year. They range from trifles like warped gazebos to road subsidence to the total collapse of houses and factories.
Game of Attrition
The company has set aside about ¬Ä3.3 billion ($4.4 billion) on its balance sheet to pay for the claims. But instead of comprehensively addressing the damage caused by its activities, RAG is apparently playing a wearing game of attrition with the claimants.
Those affected by the damage report that the company systematically contests and ignores damage claims. They say that the intimidated victims are paid off with insignificant amounts and, in return, are often even required to agree not to file any further claims.
The few who reject the company's offers can apparently look forward to years of legal battles with RAG lawyers, while their homes gradually fall apart. "A perfidious system has developed in which every trick in the book is used," says Andreas Mollinga, a civil engineer from the city of Marl who specializes in mining damage.
According to victims' attorneys, RAG hasn't even shied away from illegal practices to fend off millions in claims. For example, for years the company allegedly enhanced official documents and maps and flouted regulations on how they are to be filed, so as to prevent claims from arising in the first place.
The lawyers have forwarded the documents to the state parliament in D√ºsseldorf, which has already addressed the accusations in several committee meetings.
No conclusions have been reached yet, but if the accusations prove to be correct, RAG could face millions more in damage claims. Indeed, the authorities could very well be looking into whether to file criminal charges against company executives.
Mining Maps
RAG "firmly rejects the accusations." According to RAG Director Peter Fischer, "all damage related to mining" is addressed quickly and without red tape to help the victims. More than 90 percent of awards are for less than ¬Ä5,000, says Fischer, while appeals and lawsuits are marginal. The cases cited by the attorneys are old, he adds, and they often involve no damage or significantly less damage than estimated. Fischer denies that there was any "systematic manipulation."
The victims' attorneys disagree. They are specifically concerned with mining maps, which are official documents that are prepared by mine surveyors at RAG and can be used as evidence in court cases. RAG is required to meticulously identify all mining sites on the maps, as well as to regularly note all mining-related and natural abnormalities on the earth's surface.
This includes crevices, shifts or areas of subsidence that occurred in the past as a result of natural conditions, such as earthquakes or tectonic plate movement.
The reason for this measure is simple: If there are mining-related or natural areas of subsidence, crevices or natural terraces, mining coal underneath these areas is associated with significantly higher risks than is already the case.
This means that mining in deeper layers "acts like a catalyst," explains expert Immekus. The earth sinks and, in some cases, entire tectonic plates are set into motion. Mining agency documents refer to these conditions as "discontinuities," and thus as serious indications for the occurrence of "especially severe mining damage."
The process is undisputed. And lawmakers have also created clear rules to address these problems. If visible damage occurs to houses or land in these mining areas, mining itself, in the form of a reversal of the burden of proof, is initially to be viewed as the cause. In other words, it is not up to homeowners to prove that a mine operator is responsible for damage. Rather, RAG must prove that it was not responsible. If it cannot do so, it is required to compensate the injured parties.
Changing Approach
The Sommer family in the Baerl district of Duisburg also assumed that this was the case. After saving for many years, some 24 years ago the couple finally achieved their dream of owning a home: a 240-square-meter (2,580-square-foot) house, lovingly furnished and cared for, on a property with a small swimming pond.
Everything seemed perfect to the Sommers, until the first small cracks appeared 12 years ago. The couple quickly recognized the cause. The house is in an area where coal was mined until a few years ago. Mining damage resulting from tremors and subsiding soil are common.
At first, RAG offered no objections when the Sommers contacted its claims department. "Without any complaint, walls were plastered, and tiles and warped door frames were replaced," says Eveline Sommer.
But in 2007 RAG began to change its previously accommodating approach. The company now informed the couple that the damage to the house was not attributable to mining, and that the company would not pay the Sommers' claim for compensation.
"Our nightmare began that day," says Sommer. The earth continued to shift underneath their house. Heavy floor panels and footings in the basement have cracked since then, and tiles, floors and doorframes are breaking throughout the house. Even the roof has collapsed in some spots.
An Astonishing Discovery
The Sommers hired lawyers and appraisers, who made an astonishing discovery when they reviewed the mining maps: a fracture passes through the entire region. But according to the RAG maps, the discontinuity -- miraculously enough -- stops precisely at the Sommers' property line and begins again immediately on the other side of it.
This is hardly possible, geologically speaking. The discontinuity in the family's garden is visible with the naked eye, even to a layman. But not to RAG. Its mine surveyors cite "inexplicable phenomena" and doggedly refuse to revise the maps.
This has serious adverse consequences for the Sommers. "Without the revision," explains Michael Terwiesche, a victims' attorney in D√ºsseldorf, "the family stands a significantly poorer chance of prevailing against the company." Using expensive geological reports and surveys, the Sommers must now attempt to prove that mining is to blame for the damage. They have already had to take out a ¬Ä125,000 loan.
Even legal protection insurance wouldn't have helped them. All insurance companies operating in Germany refuse to accept cases against mining companies. An arbitration board that has since been established can only become involved in cases with the active consent of the mining company. According to RAG, however, arbitration is only used in rare cases.
Governments in the developed world are losing important sources of tax revenues, according to a landmark report, and a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù reason is that multinational companies are shifting profits to places where they pay little or no tax.
Profit shifting is a ‚Äúcurrent and pressing‚Äù issue and needed urgent reform, says the report, released Tuesday by the 34-country Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which sets international tax guidelines.
The report, which has been sent to G20 ministers, confirms what many tax campaigners, politicians and economists have been warning about since the global economic crisis began in 2008.
Its findings, however, are likely to sound even louder alarms because OECD promotes free-market capitalism and issues reports used by its members to draft policies.
It comes as European governments face increasing pressure to crack down on tax avoiders and force them to pay their share of national welfare programs, many of which are being cut drastically to cope with the budget deficits.
Measure for Measure: How to write a song and other mysteries.
I recently played a show where I did something I hadn't done in years: I performed songs by the band I founded, sang for and became quasi-famous in ‚Äî Soul Coughing,
I put together Soul Coughing in the older, dirtier East Village, in 1992. We eventually recorded three albums for Warner Bros., and a few of our songs made it onto MTV. Behind that success, though, the band was a dark marriage that, among other things, solidified my enthusiasm for drugs. To multiply my unhappiness, I signed away ‚Äî to my older bandmates ‚Äî the rights to the music I'd written. When I finally left the band, I got clean and spent the next few years driving alone around the continent playing solo acoustic shows ‚Äî 9,000 miles on my first tour, in 2000. I felt wildly liberated.
Acting upon a suggestion from the legendary New York Dolls frontman David Johansen ‚Äî ‚ÄúHave you ever written a song that's like, ‚ÄòOh, booze, how I loved you, booze?'‚Äù ‚Äî I started writing you-done-me-wrong songs, addressed to drugs. I wrote some of the best songs of my life. It was how fired up I was about the new work, as much as the darkness of my old band, that led me to abandon the Soul Coughing songs.
My audience for this new work was hard won and ‚Äî particularly after I published a memoir, ‚ÄúThe Book of Drugs‚Äù ‚Äî was deeply supportive of the new self I was trying to become. At some point, though, I began to wonder if I could ever again own my old Soul Coughing songs ‚Äî not legally, but in my own heart.

I'm going to try. I just released an album of reinterpretations, which, for the sake of brevity I'll call here ‚ÄúCircles Super Bon Bon etc.‚Äù (the full title is an unpunctuated list of all the songs on the recording) and I'm about to begin a 32-city tour of an all-Soul-Coughing-songs show.
In some ways, those old songs still lurk in my muscle memory. When I perform a song repeatedly, it becomes like a program that I can run ‚Äî I click on it, and it plays itself. The process of interpreting the song can be like piloting a drone from an air base in Nevada ‚Äî I'm watching myself playing the guitar, and marveling at how weird it is that these words are coming out of my mouth. Playing a song from decades ago is unlike rereading a poem I wrote when I was 23, because I'm becoming it ‚Äî a ghostly, psychedelic feeling.

This is not the case with every song. Sometimes it's more like driving around a neighborhood I used to live in; I foolishly think I still know my way around, and keep getting lost. I may know a certain leap from one chord to another, from a verse to a chorus and back again, but not the entire song as a linear process. Sometimes I find myself in the chorus, absolutely there, and then, just about to tumble into the next chord, I realize in a panic that I don't know which part of the song I'm in.
‚ÄúDid I just play the same verse twice?‚Äù I asked the audience during ‚ÄúThe Idiot Kings.‚Äù
Yes, they confirmed, whoopingly, I had.
In some other songs during that show I made the correct move by the skin of my teeth ‚Äî each time after excruciating microseconds ‚Äî but when I can't hide it, I paint it pink.
There's an inherent strangeness to a performance like this. The songs are alive to me, whereas the audience has a relationship to an unchanging recording. Every time I play a song, there are microscopic alterations in how I phrase this or that word, or play a chord. Over years, it can amount to radical evolution.
As I sang, I could sometimes hear people singing along. I could hear their words dropping slightly earlier, or later, than my words, or a note would be longer, or shorter, or sometimes entirely different. Was somebody out in the darkness of the room completely baffled that I was playing her favorite song incorrectly?
To revisit these songs, I'm going back much further than the recordings, to when I first hammered them out. In fact, assembling those songs back then, in the recording studio, often required a Frankensteinian approach ‚Äî culling the best sections, detaching a verse and affixing it to a different chorus. (It's a method I developed after advice that my college poetry teacher Sekou Sundiata would give when there was a single gem in an otherwise boring piece. ‚ÄúThat poem is a life support system for a killer line,‚Äù he'd say. Toss the poem, keep the line.)
Here is my new acoustic version of ‚ÄúCircles,‚Äù our 1998 on-alternative-rock-radio-almost-as-much-as-Sublime-or-Sugar-Ray-was hit song:
There were two ways that songs landed in Soul Coughing. The first was in a more or less verbatim version of what I wrote in a room, by myself, on acoustic guitar; in current performances, I'm doing the same thing I did with the band, minus the band.
The other way I brought a song into Soul Coughing was as a translated version of an acoustic-guitar song. You sometimes have to trick a band ‚Äî particularly a very musicianly band, as Soul Coughing was ‚Äî into playing what the song needs. I would let them jam, and, when there was an improvised part that suited something that I wrote, I ran to the mike and started singing it. There would often be significant chordal differences, or complexities I had to accommodate. This was manageable ‚Äî I could elongate or curtail elements of the melody. It's like swerving to avoid an obstacle in the road.
The guitar parts from the pre-translated-to-band versions have never been exposed to sunlight ‚Äî they're straight from a bedroom in 1996. The songs have also been altered a little to de-emphasize rhythmic ornaments that were peculiar to Soul Coughing. I think it would be disrespectful to reproduce elements that were written collectively, so I've been assiduous about de-Soul-Coughing-ifying these versions.
‚ÄúSuper Bon Bon‚Äù, which was a big radio hit for us, consists of sections that were were entirely discrete when they were written ‚Äî in fact, they were composed years apart ‚Äî and, though the Soul Coughing version fused them together, when I go back to the process that began it all, they're somehow disconnected again.
Here's an acoustic performance of the final-draft version of ‚ÄúSuper Bon Bon‚Äù:
When played in solo versions, these songs are ineffably different. In the born-and-bred-on-guitar songs, there's a feel to the guitar playing that was semi-disguised by other instruments. I'm glad that the guitar now has more space in which to roam, because I like my idiosyncrasies. When I was a teenager doing the anti-folk open mikes, I was doing my best to sound like the beats of A Tribe Called Quest ‚Äî I failed, but interestingly. The starkness, to me, feels like the song's natural habitat.
The most challenging Borgesian map-versus-territory aspect in playing these songs isn't technical, but ‚Äî if you'll allow me to be a hippie here ‚Äî spiritual. A live performance's intensity of focus ‚Äî both mine and the audience's ‚Äî can't be replicated in rehearsal. There's a communal mind to be navigated. What's gratifying to me about playing to an audience isn't the applause; it's the oceanic feeling of fused consciousness. You can't rehearse that ‚Äî it'd be like rehearsing the Himalayas.

Anonymous has leaked personal details of CEOs, managers and other employees of hotshot companies in Italy to protest against the new labour laws
Last year, hackers leaked 1 terabyte of data from the Milan's Expo 2015 website. Now, the online hacktivist Anonymous Italy ‚Äì LulzSec ITA has hacked into the websites of several Italian job portals and employment agencies leaking personal data of hundreds and thousands of employees and business owners for operation OpNessunDorma to protest against the new labour laws in the country.
The hacktivists from Anonymous Italia and LulzSec ITA also defaced one of the employment agency's websites and left a deface page along with the guy Fawkes logo. The groups also released a list of 45 employment agencies who were targeted during the operation.
HackRead got in touch with one of the attackers who explained that the operation is against new labour laws and temporary employment agencies, corporations, unions and politicians especially Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Minister Giuliano Poletti who have changed the labour laws to ‚Äúenslave all workers in Italy.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe new labour laws mean poor wage for workers, more profit for corporations and more government and union corruptions. In this case, a billion Euros will be transferred to corporations and their allies. We know this is typical exploitation. We know government, corporations and unions don't care workers. We are against this exploitation laws. We think we are able to protect our rights by struggle. We don't want laws like Job Act,‚Äù according to the press release.

Scanning the data:
After scanning the data HackRead found out it to be legit and never been leaked online and at the same point we can confirm that it's a very sensitive one! The data includes full names, emails, addresses, cities, provinces, postal codes, details about the agency's registration address and date, Fiscal Codes (social security numbers) and phone numbers of business owners and whoever using the services of targeted employment agencies.
Another zip file contains personal details (full names, company name, job title, emails, business, private and cell phone numbers) of business owners, CEOs, press managers and other big fishes from high profile companies like MTV Italia, Italian newspaper La Repubblica (The Republic), Facebook Italy, Gucci, FastWeb, Microsoft, Wind Italy, Ducati Italy and literally every digital, telecom, technology and high-profile company working in the country.
HackRead can confirm that the hackers got aforementioned details after breaching the server of Engitel, a Milan-based web agency providing e-commerce solution to the companies.
Although the data is now in the reach of public it is unclear if it will force the authorities to change their views on the new labour law but one thing is certain that cyber criminals will be celebrating tonight as they can now use the data for identity theft, social engineering and sending phishing emails to scam people online.

"We're Down Til We're Underground" by Give Up The Ghost was originally released by Equal Vision Records on September 23rd, 2003. Produced by Jim Siegel (Blood For Blood, Slapshot) and Tim Cossar, "We're Down‚Ä¶" is true milestone of a hardcore album. Encapsulating the personal growth, strife, and struggle of the band members that helped to create it. From the first strummed notes of opening instrumental "(It's Sometimes Like It Never Started)" the album feels intensely personal and thematic. In many ways, it is as if we are listening to the beat of the open heart of the creators. Because of this, it's difficult to pinpoint any high point in the music and lyrical content. Every song on "We're Down Til' We're Underground" effortlessly carries intense emotional weight in all it's layers. After all, it's an album born out of pressure and pain more so than most hardcore records (past or present) will likely ever be.
Deathwish, under exclusive license from Equal Vision Records, are proud to announce the reissue of "We're Down Til We're Underground" on vinyl format.
The album is packaged in a special Gatefold jacket with revamped artwork and each comes an oversized/double-sided poster, never printed before. The album has also been remastered specifically for vinyl by Paul Gold at Salt Mastering (Converge, Fucked Up, etc.)

CISPA danger escalates as bill receives approval
by Dennis K√ºgler on April 27th, 2012
The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) was yesterday approved by the US House of Representatives, in a vote that brings the US one step closer to eradicating the very principle of user anonymity and privacy in the online space.
Having been rushed through a day earlier than expected, the House voted in favour of the bill with a bipartisan vote of 248 to 168. The bill will now go onto the Senate.
Mike Rogers (Rep), the author of the bill, said any organisations that opposed CISPA (which includes the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation) were engaging in ‚Äúobfuscation‚Äù. Rogers called on fellow congressmen to ‚Äústand up for America. Support this bill‚Äù. He added that CISPA was ‚Äúthe last bastion of things we need to do to protect this country.‚Äù
Unhelpful amendments
If you need a recap, CISPA essentially gives new powers to internet service providers, allowing them to bypass existing privacy laws and spy on the personal data (i.e. emails, web browsing history, Facebook activity, you name it) of their users and pass it on to government law enforcement agencies. The bill also allows ISPs and companies such as Facebook and Google, to share user information with each other about any potential, and ill-defined, ‚Äòcybersecurity threats' ‚Äì while protecting them from any privacy lawsuits. It's essentially a bill that invokes the spectre of state-sponsored cyber-terrorism to crack down on free-speech and online civil liberties.
Even worse, due to yesterday's last minute amendments, CISPA has now become even more of a threat to online freedoms. According to TechDirt, the bill now encompasses three more uses ‚Äì the protection of children, the protection of individuals and the prosecution of cyber-security crime.
‚ÄúBasically this means CISPA can no longer be called a cybersecurity bill at all,‚Äù argues TechDirt. ‚ÄúThe government would be able to search information it collects under CISPA for the purposes of investigating American citizens with complete immunity from all privacy protections as long as they can claim someone committed a ‚Äúcybersecurity crime‚Äù. Basically it says the 4th Amendment does not apply online, at all.‚Äù
Presidential opposition
CISPA now allows the government to use CISPA for five specific purposes ‚Äì cybersecurity; investigation and prosecution of cybersecurity crimes; protection of individuals from death or serious bodily harm; protection of minors from child pornography; and the protection of national security. But as the Electronics Frontier Foundation points out, ‚Äúcybersecurity‚Äù and ‚Äúnational security‚Äù are terms that are incredibly vague and could encompass everything from posting copyrighted content, to circumventing digital rights management security on a DVD.
However, CISPA may not have a smooth ride ahead and there is still time to pressure US senators into opposing the bill. In fact, the opposition already has a pretty big player on their side ‚Äì none other than President Obama himself. The Obama administration is wholly opposed to CISPA in its current form (though whether or not the Obama's own proposed bill to address cybersecruity issues is any better remains to be seen.). A statement issued on Wednesday went as far to say The President would veto CISPA as it stands.
‚ÄúLegislation should address core critical infrastructure vulnerabilities without sacrificing the fundamental values of privacy and civil liberties for our citizens,‚Äù read the White House statement. ‚ÄúEspecially at a time our Nation is facing challenges to our economic well-being and national security‚Ä¶if H.R. 3523 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.‚Äù
Still time to fight
Other politicians, from both the Republican and Democratic sides, also expressed their opposition to CISPA.
‚ÄúIn an effort to foster information sharing, this bill would erode the privacy protections of every single American using the internet. It would create a ‚Äòwild west' of information sharing,‚Äù said Republican Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Republican Joe Barton added ‚Äúuntil we protect the privacy rights of our citizens, the solution is worse than the problem.‚Äù
CISPA advocates may have won an important battle, but the war isn't quite over. There's still plenty of political opposition to make sure the bill stalls. However, given that online companies, such as Facebook, support CISPA, the US and global public need to continue to pile on the pressure and keep up the protests. More information on how to add your voice to the CISPA opposition can be found over at the EFF.
Previous Year's Fast Tech Companies: 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003
It has been a rough 12 months for the stock market, including technology stocks. The S&P 500 is off 2.1% over the past 12 months (dividends excluded) and the Nasdaq 100 Tech Index is off 8.7%. But you could have done well owning the really hot technology companies. A year ago we published our annual list of America's 25 fastest-growing technology companies. Those stocks have gained 16% over the same time period.
We are back with a new group of 25 rapidly growing technology companies, 12 of which are repeats from our prior list. One company, sixth-ranked Cognizant Technology Solutions , has appeared every year since the inception of the list six years ago.
America's 25 Fastest-Growing Tech Companies
Our focus is on sales growth--we require at least 10% annualized sales gains over the past five years--but candidates for our list must be profitable over the past 12 months and have Thomson IBES consensus earnings forecasts of at least 10% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years. Our only other financial hurdle is that we require at least $25 million in sales over the past four quarters. We exclude companies with significant legal problems or with possible accounting or corporate governance issues. For the last two items, we are guided by scores from Audit Integrity of Los Angeles.
Topping the list? Google , which generated nearly $15 billion in revenues in the 12 months ending in September.
After falling out of contention last year, two companies, j2 Global Communications , and L-3 Communications , rejoined the list this year. With the exception of 2007, both companies have been Fast Tech members since the list's inauguration.
It is not too surprising the companies on last year's list attracted some corporate buyers. In 2007, shareholders realized healthy premiums when Altiris, WebEx Communications, and Color Kinetics were acquired by other firms. There is more: Finnish telecommunications equipment company Nokia is in the process of acquiring 2007 Fast Tech member Navteq in an $8.1 billion takeover deal.
For the first time this year, we are also listing the "Fast 15." These are attractive technology companies that didn't quite meet all the criteria for our main list, but may have what it takes to qualify in the future. Although we loosened up some of our financial screens for the Fast 15, we still applied the same governance standards and scoured analyst reports and other news sources, as we did for the main list, in order to help us weed out companies with growing pains.
The Fast 15
One member of the Fast 15 is Daktronics , a Brookings, S.D., company that makes large electronic signs and scoreboards. In December, Daktronics landed a deal to build the main video display and scoreboard, as well as other displays, for the new Yankee Stadium, which opens for the 2009 baseball season.

Robbery foiled as good Samaritans chase, tackle would-be armed thief in Brisbane's west
Updated
A would-be armed robber is behind bars in Brisbane after three good Samaritans chased him down the road and crash-tackled him.
The offender allegedly tried to rob a pharmacy in Kenmore in the city's west with a knife on Saturday, demanding the store's employee hand over cash.
Police said the man fled on foot after noticing a member of the public watching him from outside.
That man, a 21-year-old good Samaritan, gave chase and was soon joined by two other men.
The trio crash-tackled the alleged offender in the grounds of a nearby school and held him until police arrived.
The 29-year-old Lawnton man has been charged with entering premises to commit an indictable offence.
He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear in court on Monday.

When we speak, we use much more than just words. We also communicate with our face, our hands, and even our own body. This kind of communication can be called "body language" or "non-verbal communication". Non-verbal communication not only includes how we move our body, but also hand gestures, facial expressions including eye contact, and how we use our voice. Psychologists estimate that between 60% and 80% of all of our communication with other people is non-verbal. We communicate a wide range of information non-verbally. We also show our feelings, attitudes, moods, hopes and wishes far better with non-verbal language than with words.
Not only is a large QUANTITY of communication non-verbal in nature, but the QUALITY is high as well. For example, if a person says something positive while his face looks negative, which are we more likely to believe? In most cases, we will believe the non-verbal facial expression. In the end, his words will not succeed in communicating his message. If we want to succeed in our everyday conversations, we really must learn to "speak" with our body well!
Let me begin by giving you some general advice. The main thing is to relax and be natural. Trying too hard to use "body language" will make you seem a bit strange. Instead, you should allow your body language to naturally follow your words. If you say something positive, then your face, body and hands should show it too. If you are expressing a sad or worried feeling, then your face, body and hands should change with that feeling. As you think about it more and consider how you can use your body to communicate, you will become more and more natural.
More specifically, let's talk about hand gestures. Using our hands, we can emphasize our main points, remind our listener how many main points we have, and let our listener know when we are changing topics. A dramatic movement of the hand or moving our hands wide apart can signal how important something is. We can even use two fingers, either close together or far apart, to show how big something is. To show VERY strong feeling we could clap our hands together loudly or make a fist (put our fingers in a ball as though we want to hit someone) and hit a table or desk. To show that we welcome someone, on the other hand, we can hold our hands out with the palms up, and maybe move them towards a chair to invite someone to sit next to us.
Of course, we can also use our fingers to count, but be careful. People in some countries do not count the same way as in China. In France, for example, people do not count "one" by holding up their first finger, called the "index finger". Instead, they hold up their thumb. In Japan, some people put their thumb DOWN (with the four fingers up) to mean "one"! This can create confusion sometimes, so be sure not to use only non-verbal communication. Use words too, so that your listener will be sure to understand you.
Some hand gestures that are popular are waving to someone as a greeting or holding your index finger and thumb into a circle to mean "okay". However, there are some countries where these can have bad meanings! It's important to be careful when using certain common gestures. Don't assume that everyone in the world understands one gesture in the same way. Still, you can use basic gestures most of the time, then when you see a strange reaction from your listener, you can make sure to emphasize your real meaning by using words and a different hand movement.
Facial expressions are a very common way that we use to communicate every day. When speaking English, it's generally good to smile at your listener from time to time, especially when he or she has made an interesting comment. Also nod your head up and down to show you are really interested. From time to time, you can add a sound of agreement, such as "Uh huh" or even just "mmmm", to show you are listening. Above all, it is important to maintain eye contact while listening. Sometimes it is okay to move your eyes away when you are speaking, because you do have to think about what you want to say. However the listener should almost always look at the speaker without moving the eyes away (without "averting" the eyes).
If you are speaking to someone while standing, it is important to stand neither too close nor too far from the speaker. Stand at a position that is comfortable for both of you. Again, though, you must be careful when talking to people from different countries. People from some southern European countries, such as France or Spain, often stand closer together when speaking than do Chinese people. And people from Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia stand even closer! You do not always have to adapt your behavior when you meet people from around the world, but you should be aware of potential misunderstandings.
If, instead of standing, you are speaking to someone while talking, you can show your friendliness and "openness" by leaning a little bit toward the speaker. Try to avoid folding your arms in front of your chest. Many people consider folding your arms as a cold, "protective" gesture. Instead, you could have your hands on your knees, or one hand on your knee and the other at your side. You can fold your arms sometimes if you wish, but don't hold them there for a long time. As long as your hands move from time to time, the listener will not think that you are unfriendly.
Besides all of the obvious physical ways to communicate non-verbally, we have our voice. We use "intonation", loudness and "pitch" (how high or low our voice sounds) to change our meaning. Even when our voice does not make an actual word, it still can communicate feeling and attitude. Combined with the words we use, our voice can be a very powerful way to express what we mean. A strong voice can communicate confidence while a quiet voice communicates intimacy or some secret message. A loud, high pitched voice (similar to a girl screaming) can communicate nervousness or excitement, while a deep voice might mean we are tired or not enthusiastic.
Body language is one of the basic skills that all students need.
If you're not sure why Mattis needs a waiver to lead the Pentagon, read this for quickie background. Congress passed a law years ago mandating that any veteran tapped to lead the Defense department had to have been retired from the service for a certain number of years. That was a concession to the American ideal of civilian control of the military: You don't want a service member at the top of the military hierarchy. That law was waived once before for George Marshall but it hasn't been tested since. Currently it requires a retirement period of seven years; Mattis has only been retired for four, which means he's ineligible for the post ‚Äî unless Congress passes a bill granting him a waiver too.
And note well: Because this would be an amendment to an existing law, not a simple matter of confirmation, Democrats do have the power to filibuster it. They'll have 48 seats in the Senate in January; all they need are 41 votes to block the waiver and stop Mattis. Sounds like Kirsten Gillibrand's ready for a fight.
Gillibrand's early opposition to the waiver came less than an hour after Trump announced he would tap Mattis for the Pentagon. The popular commander, nicknamed ‚ÄúMad Dog,‚Äù is still expected to become the first defense secretary nominee in more than 60 years to win the congressional waiver that's necessary to install him as the military's civilian leader given his recent service in uniform. ‚ÄúWhile I deeply respect General Mattis's service, I will oppose a waiver,‚Äù Gillibrand said in a statement. ‚ÄúCivilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.‚Äù
McConnell should be able to flip eight Democrats considering how highly respected Mattis is. (The only Republican I'd imagine he might lose is Rand Paul, for the same reason Gillibrand gave.) The list of red- and purple-state Dems whose seats are up in 2018 runs on and on ‚Äî Tester, McCaskill, Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin, Baldwin, Casey, Brown, Nelson. If all of them flipped, Mattis would have enough votes to beat a filibuster on the waiver even if Paul voted no. The suspense has to do, really, with how many liberal activists will make a point of trying to stop him. They're looking for a way to deal Trump an early defeat but they're limited in what they can do on appointments after Harry Reid foolishly nuked the filibuster for presidential nominees a few years ago. The waiver issue gives them an opening. If they make a stink about Mattis, some of those red-state Democrats I named will get nervous about alienating their base and end up voting no on a waiver. Gillibrand's statement, I assume, is a cheap way of showing leadership to the left early in the Trump era, with her eye on 2020 or 2024.
But wait. Even if McConnell can't find 60 votes for a waiver, there's another way Trump and Mattis can overcome Democratic resistance. Shannen Coffin asks a good question: Is the law that imposes a mandatory retirement term for veterans before they can lead the Defense department constitutional?
This statutory limitation on the president's power to appoint officers of his choosing is almost certainly unconstitutional. The constitution vests the President with the sole authority to nominate executive officers of his choosing. The only constitutional limitation is the incompatability clause ‚Äì which prevents a member of Congress from serving in any ‚ÄúOffice of the United States.‚Äù Congress has no role in deciding whom the president can nominate. Congress does have a role in the appointment of those officers, but that is limited to the Senate's ‚Äúadvise and consent‚Äù role. In both the nomination and appointment process, the ultimate power lies with the President. Congress cannot limit who the president chooses to appoint as an executive officer. The Senate can withhold consent, but that is as far as they can go in preventing the president's appointment. So can the legislation be viewed as a condition of the Senate's consent? That's also doubtful ‚Äì or better yet, just plain wrong. The House can have no role in how the Senate exercises its constitutional authority, and even more, no individual Senator can be beholden to a legislative whim of prior Congresses in deciding how to exercise the advice and consent role. So legislation that directs the Senate how to vote on a confirmation would be equally problematic.
Imagine that McConnell had 60 votes to change the law by granting a waiver to Mattis but the House refused to go along and blocked the legislation. The House would, in essence, be vetoing a presidential nominee even though it's supposed to have no role in the confirmation process under the Constitution. If the Senate believes that Mattis is still too fresh from the service to comfortably fill what's supposed to be a civilian role, it can and should take that into consideration in deciding whether to confirm him. If it concludes that that concern, while valid, isn't disqualifying in his particular case, then it should be free per its ‚Äúadvise and consent‚Äù power to make that judgment too ‚Äî except that it isn't because of the law regarding a certain number of years of retirement by military officers. That being so, a court might very well strike down the law as an infringement on the Senate's confirmation power. We may get to find out: If Schumer manages to filibuster the GOP's attempt to pass a waiver for Mattis, McConnell might turn around, hold a floor vote to confirm Mattis anyway, and then dare Schumer to sue Mattis to block his appointment in order to test whether the president's power in choosing nominees and the Senate's power of ‚Äúadvise and consent‚Äù can be restricted by law.
Which, actually, is another reason to believe there'll be no filibuster. Knowing that he'd probably lose that court battle, Schumer might decide that it's not worth alienating voters by trying to block a popular military figure like Mattis when the attempt's almost sure to fail one way or the other.
This dispute is a neat reminder, though, that the only thing protecting some norms of American government is the good judgment and civic-mindedness of the governors themselves. The reason we haven't had a steady stream of generals in charge of the Defense department isn't because there's a statute on the books that ties the president's hands, it's because American presidents have shared the belief that civilian control of the military in a democracy is a good thing and made their appointments accordingly. Trump might not share that belief as strongly; if the public wants to punish him for it, they'll have a chance in 2020. Ironically, though, I think the fact that Trump is more of a black box when it comes to traditional norms (ahem) is part of the case for making an exception for Mattis and confirming him at Defense. He's a scholar and a patriot; he's not a yes-man of the sort that might worry you as Trump's right-hand man at the Pentagon. Like I said in last night's post, I think he'll be a good influence on the commander-in-chief. That's much more important than whether he's been retired for seven years or only four.
Update: One more reason to think a Dem filibuster of Mattis won't come off.
The following guest post is from Regards Citoyens, a French organisation that promotes open data.
For about a year, Regards Citoyens has been working together with the French chapter of Transparency International in order to bring more transparency in the processes of influence and lobbying within the French parliament.
Lobbying is a very controversial subject in France: we discuss it a lot, but we do not know much about it. So we decided to try and study the visible part of this mysterious iceberg by bringing out some new data to the public debate. On a regular basis, MPs publish official reports regarding the preparation of their legislative and government evaluation work. It makes sense that they would listen to anyone concerned with the current topic during this process. But is this done in a fair, plural and transparent way? Are corporations and unions listened on an equal footing? What about NGOs and other actors from the civil society? Much like the European Parliament did, the French Assembly recently created an official register of lobbyists who get granted access to the hallways. But it turns out that this register does not contain more than a hundred names.
A few official reports from MPs A few official reports from MPs
We decided to take a closer look and try to get a more complete list by browsing through all the 1,174 reports published between July 2007 and July 2010. Indeed, some of them propose an appendix with a list of all the hearings organised during the preparation of the report. Unfortunately, we quickly discovered that most reports do not feature such a list: using text analysis tools, we found them in only 38 % of the reports. Even this small visible part of influence seriously lacks in transparency. But that already provided us with an important dataset of 16,000 names, much more than the few officially registered lobbyists.
Our main concern then was to identify each organisation behind all of these names. Doing so was sometimes easy (mentioned along the name in the appendix), sometimes a bit harder (requiring to read pieces of the report, for instance). So we decided to develop a crowdsourcing tool allowing anyone to participate. An application available under a free licence, the AGPL, was built to process each name one by one, at least by three different users to validate the data. The idea was to make anyone able to easily contribute for just a few minutes, without having to register. Registration was only needed to participate in the top 50 contributors ladder. The simplicity and dynamicity of the Ajax-based interface (fields pre-filled and reports pre-loaded and scrolled), the fun of discovering lobbyists while ‚Äúdigitizing them‚Äù and the competitive aspect, provided by the ladder, certainly helped a lot: in a couple days a good Identi.ca/Twitter buzz started, and while we expected the crowdsourcing to take a couple months, everything was achieved in only 10 days thanks to more than 3,000 citizens!
This cool process brought us a database of 16,000 hearings with names, sex, functions and organisations of each one of the lobbyists. After some brief discussions with the national Assembly and the CNIL (French commission for privacy rights), we decided to release only the names of the organisations and not those of the people. Even though they are already public, coming from official reports, these institutions were unable to find an agreement on whether the names of lobbyists were public or private information. In the end, we decided to anonymise the data and make sure no illegal database of religious or union affiliation could be published out of it. Using Freebase GridWorks, we finally refined the data and consolidated it into 9,300 grouped hearings of organizations, which were associated to the theme subjects of each report.
But to be able to draw trends, we needed to categorize these organizations by interests: unions, corporations, individuals, religious organisations, think-tanks, NGO's and associations. We first used the EU registry, but the large number of organisations we needed to classify quickly revealed the limits of the commission's categories, especially regarding the public sector organisations. So we decided to improve it and build progressively our own categorization of interest representatives (fr) while categorizing gradually the data.
Holding all of these enriched data, TI started browsing it and drafted an insightful study based on the results (fr). At the same time, we worked on developping a visualisation in order to present the data in ways people could easily understand and browse. Inspired by WhereDoesMyMoneyGo‚Äòs first design, we used the powerful Raphael JavaScript library to put out in a couple weeks a fully accessible application allowing to browse by themes and in subdetails all of this information.
But what did we learn? First, that on all subjects, there were considerably fewer hearings with women (24 %), with the only exception of the reports regarding‚Ä¶ gender issues, of course! Also, the study reveals that MPs listen mainly during their hearings to administrations and organisations from the public sector (48 %). Trade unions and other professionnal organisations come then, followed at the 3rd place by private companies. NGOs and civil society organisations lobby in only 7 % cases. But the most interesting conclusion probably comes from the comparison of the categories for each specific theme. We can observe that companies are more often listened on topics like economy, energy, environment and probably more suprisingly on transportations, culture or digital issues. On the other hand, civil society organisations are more presents in topics like development aid or veterans. All of these results concern of course only the visible part of the lobbying, but taking a close look at the holes (like the surprisingly low number of hearings for private companies on health issues) provides interesting insights and validates our conclusion: transparency in France is definitely lacking in this area!
Of course, all of the anonymised data that was generated for this study is republished as open data under the ODBL licence and freely reusable. We completed the data with extra information such as the authors and political groups of the reports and such. This means there are certainly plenty other possible uses to these data! We're convinced making it open data can only bring more great projects!

Image caption Protesters in central Moscow shouted "Down with Putin"
International observers have cited numerous violations in Sunday's parliamentary elections in Russia.
The OSCE said the polls were slanted in favour of pro-Kremlin party United Russia, noting apparent manipulations such as the stuffing of ballot boxes.
But President Dmitry Medvedev said the vote was fair, honest and democratic.
On Monday night, at least 2,000 people protested in central Moscow against PM Vladimir Putin, and demanded honest elections.
The election saw a sharp drop in support for United Russia, ahead of Mr Putin's bid to return to the presidency next March.
With nearly all the votes counted, electoral officials said the party had just under 50%, down from 64% in 2007.
United Russia lost 77 seats, in a vote which is being seen as a popularity test for Mr Putin.
'Like a game'
Reading a communique, an official from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the election had in general been "well organised" but there were severe problems with the counting process.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Petros Efthymiou, OSCE: "The contest was slanted in favour of the ruling party"
"The contest was also slanted in favour of the ruling party, the election administration lacked independence, most media were partial and state authorities interfered unduly at different levels," said Petros Efthymiou.
Another observer, Heidi Tagliavini, said the elections had suffered because several opposition parties were barred from taking part.
"To me, this election was like a game in which only some players are allowed to compete," she said.
The OSCE report prompted US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to express "serious concerns" about the conduct of the election.
Analysis Vladimir Putin is facing a slump in popularity that he has not experienced since the Kursk submarine disaster of 2000. There are still many in Russia who do not blame him for the rampant corruption and the stagnant economy. But he is the leader of United Russia, and support for the party has fallen significantly in these Duma elections, which inevitably reflects badly on him. Loss of face for Putin Russian poll sites 'hacked'
Opposition parties have also complained of violations.
The Communist Party said it was preparing to challenge the "absolutely illegitimate" result in court, the RIA news agency said.
Russia's only independent monitoring group, Golos, says it has logged 5,300 complaints alleging violations.
Protests
Several thousand people protested in central Moscow on Monday calling for an end to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's rule.
They denounced the vote as shameful, and shouted "Russia without Putin!"
Correspondents say it appeared to be one of the biggest opposition demonstrations in central Moscow in years.
Several dozen protesters tried to march towards the Kremlin, but at least 30 were detained by riot police and bundled into buses.
About 100 opposition protesters were detained in Russia's second city, St Petersburg, after holding an unauthorised rally on the main avenue, Nevsky Prospekt.
Electoral Commission head Vladimir Churov said United Russia should have a slim majority, with 238 seats out of 450.
This would mean the party losing its current two-thirds majority which had allowed it to change the constitution unchallenged.
Mr Churov said the Communist Party was in second place with 19.2% of the vote, giving it 92 seats.
United Russia's slim Duma majority The Duma has 450 seats. Parties not making the Duma's 5% threshold: Yabloko, 3.3%, Patriots of Russia 0.97%, Right Cause 0.59% Source: Electoral Commission. Results are based on 96% of the vote. Turnout was 60%.
A Just Russia was in third place with 13.2% and 64 seats, and the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) had 11.7% and 56, he added.
The BBC's Steve Rosenberg, in Moscow, says that, if confirmed, the result will be a significant embarrassment to Mr Putin, three months before he is scheduled to run again for the Russian presidency.
But President Medvedev, who headed the United Russia party list, said that despite the slump in its vote, he was looking forward to working with the new parliament.
"A tragedy has not taken place," he said.
"On the contrary, in my view, everything is quite decent and respectable.
"I for one am glad that we shall have a merrier parliament because we understand that truth can emerge only from a debate."
Mr Putin served as president from 2000 to 2008 but was prohibited by the constitution from running for a third consecutive term.
He doesn't expect to win her back but hopes it will bring her happiness
'I wasn't best husband and father and want to say sorry to wife,' he said
But he is currently out of work so bought ¬£800 handset with credit card
She wanted iPhone and he was determined to get her one as apology
A heartbroken husband queued for 44 hours to buy the new iPhone 6 in a bid to win back his wife after she kicked him out - because of his obsession with gadgets.
Darius Wlodarski, 41, started queuing outside the Apple Store in Cabot Circus, Bristol at midday on Wednesday to make sure he would definitely be able to get one of the handsets.
His wife Joanna called an end to the 20 year marriage after she accused him of valuing material possessions over his family.

Darius Wlodarski queued for 44 hours outside the Apple Store in Bristol to buy the new iPhone 6 for his wife
But Mr Wlodarski, who was born in Poland but now lives in Swindon, Wiltshire, decided to make the peace and spend ¬£800 on a new iPhone for her ‚Äì despite being out of work.
He was determined to keep a promise he made to her before their marriage hit the rocks and paid for the device on a credit card.
Mr Wlodarski has admitted the break-up was his fault: ‚ÄòI wasn't the best husband and father unfortunately. I didn't know how important family was to me.
‚ÄòI did so many things wrong and I want to say sorry to my wife and daughter that I wasn't as good as I could.'
He split from his wife of 20 years Joanna last month and admitted he 'wasn't the best husband and father'
To make up for his mistakes Mr Wlodarski made sure he was the first person in the queue, arriving a whole day before anyone else.
‚ÄòLots of people in the queue were very happy but it was different for me because of the circumstances.
‚ÄòIt took me a while to realise what really mattered - and that is my family.
‚ÄòMy wife said to me I should remember that it is now ‚Äúthings‚Äù that matter, that I was worrying too much about saving for things, and she was right.
‚ÄòI know an iPhone is another "thing", but I told her I would get her one and I wanted to keep my promise.'
She wanted new iPhone and he was determined to get her one as a gift and was the first person to join the queue outside the Bristol store, where he was welcomed by staff yesterday (pictured)
Mr Wlodarski met his 41-year-old wife on the doorstep of a house party in their native Poland more than 20 years ago and he said it was ‚Äòlove at first sight'.
It took him three years to convince her to go on a date with him, but after a year together they got married in February 1995.
They moved to England ten years ago with their daughter Daria, 14, but they split up a month ago.
‚ÄòI got the new iPhone for her because she wanted it. The first iPhone I bought for her, she was so happy, I was telling her for a year that she would be happy but she didn't believe me and eventually when she got it she was happy,' he said.
‚ÄòNow she wants the bigger screen so I got her the bigger one.'
Mr Wlodarski (left) doesn't expect the new iPhone (right) will win her back but hopes it will make her happy
He added: ‚ÄòI want to say that ‚Äúmaybe one day you will realise that I could be‚Ä¶good again and maybe you'll trust me again‚Äù, I don't know. Sorry.
‚ÄòI just wanted to make sure that I get what she wanted. 44 hours in total ‚Äì I was the first, nobody was here for another day but I did it to make sure that I got what she wanted.'
Mr Wlodarski does not expect that the gift will win her back but hopes it will bring her happiness.
The iPhone 6 went on sale across the world yesterday and thousands of eager Apple fans who camped out overnight finally got their hands on the new handsets.

It was 1975. Rubik's cubes, pet rocks, bell bottoms and leisure suits abound. The Captain was still with Tennille, and Jaws and SNL made their premieres. Antion, then a graduate assistant with head coach Bobby Bowden's Mountaineers, was in charge of the advance scouting, meaning he worked one game ahead. Antion's brother, Tom, was a backup offensive lineman on a team which had gone into Berkeley and beaten Cal 28-10 and the Cotton Bowl in Dallas to dash SMU 28-22 in a 4-0 start.
West Virginia split the next four, leaving WVU at 6-2 entering the Backyard Brawl against Johnny Majors' No. 20 Panthers. Meanwhile, Klausing had sent Antion ahead two weeks previously when Pitt played host to Navy at old Pitt Stadium.
‚ÄúWhat happened was Klausing is actually from Pittsburgh, and he knows everybody in Pittsburgh,‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúSomehow, he finagled a 16mm camera from WTAE channel 4, the flagship station for Pitt. He tells them something to the effect that he wanted to film a family reunion picnic, and they actually loaned him a camera.‚Äù
Which Klausing promptly gave to his son, Tommy, then a WVU student and spotter for play-by-play voice Jack Fleming who would go on to postgraduate education at Carnegie Mellon before a long career in government administration in the Washington, D.C. area. Tommy secured a field pass for the Navy-Pitt game, toting the 16mm camera along. Antion is in the press box, charting plays, situations, downs and distances, personnel‚Ä¶and one more key Chuck Klausing had requested.
‚ÄúWatch the signals,‚Äù Antion recalls him saying. ‚ÄúHe referred to the whole thing as ‚ÄòThe Deal.' Everything back then was shot with an over-the-shoulder 16mm. How in the world he got a field pass ‚Äì on the field! ‚Äì for Tommy I'm not sure.‚Äù
Pitt was among the few teams in the nation signaling plays in the mid-70s; instead, most ran them in with the change of personnel. The Panthers had just one coach, offensive coordinator George Haffner, signaling, so the focus was easy. While Tommy Klausing recorded the action, including the signals, Antion was in the booth filling in all the columns for his scouting report, including an open one.
‚ÄúI left a few spaces for me to draw stick figures (of the signals),‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúI drew them with the signals the offensive coordinator was giving. Tommy would film the signals and the scoreboard, so we'd know when in the game it was. Between the film and the scoreboard, we could document my notes with down and distance and other details, and have the signals and the stick figure drawings line up.
‚ÄúAt halftime, (Pitt play-by-play announcer) Bill Hillgrove comes over, and they want to interview me,‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúThey come over, and I have all these stick figure drawings, so I scramble to cover them up, because what the hell are they gonna think? Tommy and I come back, compare notes and it doesn't take us but a few hours and we both have the signals broken down. The only people who know about this are me and Tommy and Tommy's dad and (assistant coach) Greg Williams.‚Äù
The foursome stayed after some lead-up practices and worked on the signals, recognition from the opposing sideline, the best sightlines and other aspects. There were questions from fellow coaches, like why was this group, made of two defensive coaches, a graduate assistant, and a coach's kid, staying so late?
‚ÄúThey started to get nervous because we would stay late and be hush hush until George Henshaw and others would leave,‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúDonnie Young would look at us funny. Klausing just made something up and we would wait them out and go practice and I proved to them that I knew the signals.‚Äù
Henshaw, from Richmond, Va., played at WVU from 1967-69, then served as a graduate assistant and the junior varsity coach before being named the defensive line assistant. He would work with Bowden in his next stop at Florida State before embarking on a long NFL career that's still going as a tight ends coach with the Tennessee Titans. Young became a fixture at West Virginia as an assistant and recruiting coordinator under Bowden, Frank Cignetti and Don Nehlen, all of whom are in the College Football Hall of Fame.
‚ÄúIt's game day, and still and nobody knows except us four,‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúKlausing goes to (offensive coordinator) Frank Cignetti, and tells Frank, and he's like a kid at Christmas. His eyes light up, he thinks it's great, and we decide to go in and tell coach Bowden. We walk in with Cignetti and Klausing says ‚ÄòOk, Bob, tell them.' I said ‚ÄòCoach, I know their signals. I know Pitt's signals, I've seen them in the game and I know the plays before they run them.‚Äù
Now Cignetti, along with several players interviewed, seem to float around the subject, preferring to say they don't quite recall such an episode, or that, like with placekicker Bill McKenzie and quarterback Dan Kendra, they were unaware because, well, the coaching staff never told the players.
‚ÄúI've heard about that,‚Äù said McKenzie, whose 38-yard field goal won the game as time expired. ‚ÄúAs a kicker, you just sort of stand there waiting. I won't say we were the first ones to do that, or that it was the only time anybody ever did that.‚Äù
Bowden expressed concern with the sign stealing, saying it wasn't ethical, and instructing his staff not to do it, Antion said, unless the Mountaineers really needed it.
‚ÄúBobby looked at Frank, and asked if we really needed this,‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúAnd Frank said ‚ÄòYes, we do.' Bobby said he didn't know if it was the right thing, but if we really need it, go ahead. But this is Pitt, let's be real. We walked out of the office, I looked at coach Klausing and he nodded.‚Äù
Antion was in the box, alongside Williams, with Tommy Klausing on the field, all with headsets. Antion and Klausing would confer on the signals ‚Äì WVU placed them in opposite spots in case one viewpoint was blocked ‚Äì and relay Pitt's play to Williams, who would confer with Chuck Klausing on the call. Plays at that time were typically 30-plus seconds apart.
‚ÄúThere's no way you could do it in today's game,‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúAnd even then, the players were complaining we weren't getting the calls in fast enough. But they had no idea all game. They just thought the coaches were really smart. I missed two calls. One, they ran a play in with (tailback) Elliott Walker, and another time I called draw, and they went to more signals, and I tried to change it. We were in position for the draw, and they hit Gordon Jones for a touchdown.‚Äù
Pitt went three and out on four of its initial five drives, and turned the ball over on its last two possessions of the first half. The Panthers managed just 86 yards on 24 plays with a fumble and interception in a scoreless game. WVU clogged the middle, taking away the dive within the veer scheme and forcing Matt Cavanaugh to the outside, where it became basic option football without an exceptionally mobile quarterback.
Chuck Klausing noted West Virginia switched its 5-2-4 alignment to a 5-3-2-1 set, allowing the nose guard, two tackles and a linebacker to handle the dive, with the safeties in run support. Ends Jack Eastwood and Andy Peters would take Dorsett, along with Ray Marshall, an undersized but quick linebacker who was converted from safety early in his career. Klausing's hope was that WVU's defenders could run four yards as fast as Dorsett could run eight.
The All-American finished with 107 yards on 22 carries and no scores, and Pitt essentially began the second half where it ended the first, with a fumble and three and out before touchdowns on their next two possessions. West Virginia kept pace with touchdowns of its own, and the game was tied 14-14 late in the fourth when Pitt regained possession off a fumble inside the red zone with 57 seconds left. WVU had all three timeouts, however, and was aided by a tackle for loss and pass to the sideline. The series burned just 39 seconds off the clock before Pitt punted.
With the ball at the Pitt 48-yard line, Kendra hit Randy Swinson on a wheel route that put the ball at the 22 with four seconds left. That lined up McKenzie's kick, and it sailed through as the clock hit zero.
‚ÄúWe were hitting curl, hitting curl, and the sucker bit on a curl, and Swinson ran a wheel route,‚Äù said Kendra, who will be back in Morgantown for the first time in 38 years this weekend for the team's 40th anniversary and Bowden's induction into the WVU Sports Hall of Fame. ‚ÄúWe were getting lucky; they were giving us a curl, and again because we did fake draw, that draw fake held the linebackers a bit and allowed guys to get open in a hook area.
‚ÄúBack then, it's not like it is today, with every college game on TV every week. This was the ABC Game of the Week with Keith Jackson. They had their A team covering. And that atmosphere at the old stadium where people were sitting right on you. It seemed like the loudest crowd by far.‚Äù
And as far as the signal stealing?
‚ÄúYou talk to guys from Pitt, and it's sour grapes about that,‚Äù Kendra said. ‚ÄúI don't think it takes away anything. They still had to stop them, and they ran downhill and were aggressive. The defense played a heck of a game. That's Bill Belichick-type stuff. The winning side, it's fine. The losing side, it's sour grapes. It was a physical game, and I think our guys were more physical. I thought between Artie Owens and Tony Dorsett, Owens got the best of him that game.‚Äù
Owens finished with 101 yards on 17 carries, a 5.9 average. He also scored once. Kendra completed 7-of-12 passes for 96 yards, the longest his 26-yarder to Swinson. WVU outgained Pitt 385-281 and was plus-two in turnover margin with 10 more minutes of possession back when that mattered.
‚ÄúKlausing, to his credit, has always said ‚ÄòYeah we stole the signals, we put the kids in the best defense, but the kids won the game,'‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúHe's reluctant to take any credit away from the players, and I understand that. During the game no one knew we had the signals. They're just playing their ass off and thinking the coaches were smart. Everybody hates Bill Belichick for what a ‚Äòlousy cheater' he was, but shoot, we did that years ago. Hey, we tried to do it again the next week at Syracuse, but the guy signaling the plays in was an old Navy guy, and he used Navy flags. Once the saw what we were doing, they covered them up.
‚ÄúAfter the game, we could never get out of the press box with all the fans. It was difficult to get over to the locker room. There were women jumping on us and kissing us. My younger brother was on the team as a back-up, and my mom and dad were at the game. They tried to drive through Sunnyside with PA plates on, and there were people beating on dad's already beat-up 69 Chevy until my mother pulled out of a bunch of blue and gold stuff. Then instead, they ushered my mom and dad through the crowd to get out of town. We basically couldn't go anywhere. We kinda hung out in the locker room for about half an hour to let things cool off.‚Äù
McKenzie still has the ball from the kick, though much like some memories and people involved, the signatures have started to fade.
‚ÄúBack at the time I had everybody sign it,‚Äù McKenzie said. ‚ÄúBut they didn't invent Sharpies yet. We used ball point pens. And as you can imagine, after 40 years you can barely make it out. It always amazes me, everybody says they were there. There must have been 100,000 at that game.‚Äù
Which turned out to be the last at Mountaineer Field for Bowden, who will be one of six new members inducted into the WVU Sports Hall of Fame at noon on Saturday. The ceremony will be held inside the Caperton Indoor Practice Facility adjacent to Milan Puskar Stadium and Mountaineer Field. West Virginia then plays Maryland at 3 p.m., and the school will honor Bowden and the members of the 1975 Peach Bowl team that went 9-3, beating Lou Holtz's NC State squad 13-10 to finish ranked 20th. There are expected to be 50-plus members of the team in town for the 40th anniversary of the season, and that Nov. 8 defeat of Pitt.
Bowden has called the game his greatest of collegiate memories, and it's been paired with the 1970 defeat at Pitt as his most dreaded. Remarkable, really, that a coach with two national titles, and one who made his hay as the program builder at Florida State ‚Äì at one point a lowly collegiate doormat ‚Äì would call the bookends of thrills and spills contained within the Brawl as his zenith and rock bottom.
‚ÄúThe greatest high was that '75 game, when we beat Pitt on that last-second kick by Bill McKenzie,‚Äù said Bowden, who even to this day can recall such intricate details as the student managers which served decades ago. ‚ÄúThe worst was the 1970 game at Pitt. We were ahead 35-8 and Pitt had no intention of trying to win. They just started running it, trying to keep us from running up the score, and started going for every fourth down. They were bigger, and they started making it and I sat on the ball. I'll never do that again. That was the last time I sat on the ball. People accused us of running up the scores at Florida State. Well, I always coached from then on.‚Äù
Including using a bit of extra help from Antion and Klausing.
‚ÄúAnything that's part of one of the five greatest wins in school history is kinda special,‚Äù Antion said. ‚ÄúThe inscription on the inside of my ring from the Peach Bowl says ‚ÄòSign Stealer.' When I die, my kids will have something to remember that. I still wear that ring most every day.‚Äù

Several locally-owned garages in Vancouver say they've been overwhelmed by the number of people dropping off used motor oil and motor oil products, after several major retailers like Canadian Tire, Mr. Lube and Midas stopped their used oil recycling programs at some locations.
The BC Used Oil Management Association ensures that garages provide drop-off bins for people who change their own motor oil, so that they can safely dispose of the used product.
The oil is then picked up by a company called Terrapure, and recycled.
Alfred Lal, owner of Vancouver West Motors, said ever since retailers shrank their recycling programs, the increase in drop-offs has "swamped" his four-person operation.
"We have limited capacity because we're a small garage, and a lot of times I've had to turn people away saying sorry, the barrel's full," Lai said.
Alfred Lal, owner of Vancouver West Motors, said the increase in oil drop-offs has "swamped" his four-person operation. (Google Maps)
Vancouver West Motors has a 650-litre barrel to store the oil, which is emptied once a week. Lal said desperate customers have begun leaving oil in various types of containers outside his shop after it closes.
Once, Lal encountered a plastic ice-cream bucket filled with used oil.
"Last week, someone left four litres of oil at the door, they just dumped it and walked away."
Consumers in B.C. pay a so-called eco-fee when purchasing oil, which later pays for services like oil recycling. Garages are paid 30 cents for every litre of oil they take back from the public.
According to the BC Used Oil Management Association, there are 10 remaining locations to recycle used oil in Metro Vancouver. (BCUOMA)
Ed Wong, manager at Grandview Tire and Auto Centre, said that his garage has also been affected.
"We've always been an advocate for recycling so I'll gladly take the oil, but it's had a negative impact because we don't have the manpower to manage the amount of oil that's being dropped off at times," Wong said.
"I'll come into work and there will be a whole pile of used oil outside, it's leaking all over the pavement and then I need to go clean that up too."
According to the used oil management association, there are 10 remaining garages in Metro Vancouver that continue to take used oil.
"I think more people need to step up to the plate and offer oil recycling, everybody's got to do their part, " said Wong.
The BC Used Oil Management Association said it's currently working with smaller facilities so they can increase their infrastructure. (BC Used Oil Management Association/Facebook)
Employees cite leaks
It's not clear why some large retailers have stopped offering to recycle oil, however employees cited environmental dangers stemming from poor consumer practices.
In a statement, a representative for Canadian Tire said that "participation varies from store to store based on their capacity and capability," but would not comment on why some locations stopped the service.
Employees at three Canadian Tire locations said service was halted because people were bringing in oil contaminated with other products.
Canadian Tire's White Rock location continues to offer the service.
A representative for Midas could not be reached for comment, but two employees said they were no longer offering the service because customers were leaving oil on the street in unapproved bins, leading to spills.
A representative for Mr. Lube also could not be reached for comment, but employees at three locations said the city no longer wanted them to offer the service. Mr. Lube's Kingsway location continues to recycle used oil.
The city's Waste Reduction & Recovery Management Team said there had been no policy change or ban regarding Mr. Lube.
After publication, a representative from the city said they had received multiple complaints that spills and leaks at some Canadian Tire and Mr. Lube locations had entered storm sewers, and that they asked the retailers to take measures to prevent further spills.
Program restructuring
David Lawes, the executive director of the BC Used Oil Management Association, said he's aware of the increased pressure on small garages, and his organization is working with smaller facilities to increase their infrastructure.
Lal said he's concerned about the long-term impact if people are unable to conveniently dispose of used oil products.
"We're supposed to be a green city and this is supposed to be a forward-thinking province," he said.
"I really hope people don't start dumping it down drains or into the Fraser River."
Long story short: A few days ago, cartoonist MariNaomi wrote an op-ed about being harassed by professional comic-book writer Scott Lobdell on a panel at a convention. MariNaomi was very careful to avoid identifying information, but Lobdell apparently read the piece and recognized himself‚Äìmaybe because the shit he had pulled was extreme even in an industry and environment with a long, gross history of tolerance of and complicity with misogyny and harassment.
Lobdell responded by contacting Heidi MacDonald, a self-described friend of his. He sent Heidi an open apology of sorts, which Heidi ran at The Beat, and which is such a spectacular load of equivocation and dodges that my spit-takes are doing spit-takes.
I'm gonna break this shit down, because someone needs to:
‚ÄúFirst and foremost and without any conditions I would like to formally and publicly apologize for offending a fellow comic book creator.‚Äù
Not, you will note, for behaving inappropriately.
That said, this is the best sentence of the apology, because it's the only one in which Lobdell appears to have even the faintest inkling that his actions were the problem.
‚ÄúI am also sorry because if I had realized my failed attempt at humor had offended MariNaomi or her husband in the moment that I made those statements, I would have certainly apologized in then and not have left her to feel victimized in the hours and days that followed.‚Äù
Let me be really fucking clear here: what happened on the PRISM panel was not an off-color but innocuous joke falling flat. It was Lobdell persistently, systematically, and explicitly sexually harassing a peer, on stage, for an hour. This wasn't a slip of the tongue: it was a display of power and an exercise in intimidation.
Nor was it an accident: Lobdell's spontaneous apology to MariNaomi's husband at the panel makes it clear that he knew then and knows now that his actions were inappropriate. He knew he was violating someone's boundaries‚Äìhe just didn't give a fuck as long as those boundaries belonged to a woman. It's telling, I think, that Lobdell has now apologized to Naomi's husband twice: the only thing he seems to recognize as actively wrong on his part was the incursion onto the territory of another man.
I've written a lot about harassment and abuse in the comics industry. As a result, a fair lot of women have written to me with their own stories of harassment. Today, a number of those stories involved Scott Lobdell, and they were fucking horrifying. What happened at the PRISM panel was not a fluke: this is a guy whose treatment of women in the comics industry has been habitually, flagrantly predatory; and who has been called out on it before. Either Lobdell knows exactly what he is doing and doesn't care; or he lacks even a remote baseline concept of what constitutes acceptable behavior.
‚ÄúI am particularly saddened because I was completely blown away by not only her talent as both a writer and artist, but more importantly by the fact she was using her talent to speak so openly and freely about her own life experiences and how they informed the artist that she is today.‚Äù
This would ring truer if he hadn't used the panel as an opportunity to punish her for exactly that, treating her frank discussions of her personal history as an invitation to ask lewd questions and outright proposition her.
‚ÄúAs someone who has only ever written superheroes, I marvel at the type of courage it takes for someone to put their whole life out on paper (or blogs) for the world to see.‚Äù
I wonder if Lobdell is at all aware of the irony here: that assholes like him are why publishing personal work‚Äìespecially when you're female‚Äìtakes so much courage. He is part of the reason so few people do what MariNaomi does.
‚ÄúFinally I am sorry that my presence on the panel caused her experience to be anything other than a celebration of her work.‚Äù
This is the part where I actually lost it. This passive, slimy dodge. No, bro, it wasn't your presence that caused her experience to be anything other than a celebration of her work. It was the fact that you treated her like a sexual object and held her up to the audience as the same. It's that you ignored her work entirely in order to interrogate her about her sexual experiences. You straight up propositioned her‚Äìand then, after spending the entire panel doing the professional equivalent of one dog humping another into submission, apologized not to her, but to her husband, for overstepping his boundaries.
It's the fact that you made comics that much more hostile and unwelcoming an environment for women. It's the fact that you felt entitled, by virtue of your gender, or your professional reputation, or your institutional power, that it was okay to piss in someone else's sandbox. It's the fact that, in your world, some people are more people than others.
‚ÄúPresence,‚Äù my ass.
Heidi MacDonald, meanwhile, has lauded this asshole for ‚Äúgetting out in front of this and apologizing once he became aware of the ramifications of his actions,‚Äù for which she should be seriously embarrassed as both a journalist and a human being.
Which ramifications would those be? The idea that being called out for aggressively harassing a woman might hurt Lobdell's own reputation, I assume, since his apology demonstrates absolutely no understanding of or concern for their impact on others. Look, I know you have known this dude for a while and consider him a friend, but Jesus fucking Christ, Heidi. You are better than this.
I am, at least, inclined to agree with Heidi's conclusion that Lobdell's ‚Äúapology‚Äù means ‚Äúwe're moving to the next level.‚Äù He's certainly set a new bar for bullshit and prevarication.
There are a few common threads in the discussion surrounding MariNaomi's article and Lobdell's response that bear examination as well, one of which is the basis of this plum from writer Mark Waid. The fallacy Waid is echoing comes up a lot in this particular conversation, but Waid's response is particularly tone deaf:
"A word to young freelancers, for what it's worth: despite what you may hear (or fear), I wouldn't even have to take off my shoes to count how many people in this industry can single-handedly ruin your chances at success. Here's a good litmus test: can they sign checks or approve vouchers? No? Then they can't do shit to you, especially if you have real talent. There are a lot of established freelancers out there who can (and will) help young talent, but despite what the creepier ones might want you to believe, almost none of them can actually blockade you these days, not with as many outlets for your work as exist. Your fears of burning bridges are understandable and rational, but‚Äìagain, especially if you have real talent‚Äìthey are grounded in myth and stem from a time when comics was a much, much smaller community.‚Äú
What? Marc Waid, I don't know what comics industry‚Äìor, hell, universe‚Äìyou've been working in, but please let me know if they're hiring, because it sounds awesome.
In the reality where I work, though, the truth is that calling out harassment does destroy women's careers, and not only if the harasser in question is someone with direct hiring power. All it takes is an industry or individual that values you less than your harasser, or even just less than lack of controversy. There are a lot of Scott Lobdells in the world. They don't need hiring power‚Äìthey just need the complicity of the folks who have it.
The aphorism "The squeaky wheel gets the grease‚Äù does not, for the most part, apply to wheels which lack significant institutional power. Women who call out harassment get branded as malcontents and drama queens and troublemakers; harassers, meanwhile, insulated by privilege and the fact that their behavior is part of a long-established status quo, get a pass. Do you seriously think that it's Lobdell, not MariNaomi, who will feel the primary professional repercussions of this‚Äìeven though it was Lobdell who outed himself as her harasser?
A few weeks ago, a friend of mine wrote an article about her experiences with sexual harassment in professional settings in the comics industry, and one of her former bosses‚Äìfrom a job where none of the incidents in question had occurred, a dude with whom her working relationship had been affable, who had or should have had no personal stake in the conversation‚Äìimmediately tried to intimidate her into taking it down. He was worried, you see, that it might harm someone's career, or that someone might blame an innocent party. And he found it more offensive that this woman was calling out harassment than that the harassment was happening in the first place.
Now imagine what would have happened if she'd written the post while still his employee, and tell me again that women who call out harassment only face consequences from their harassers.
Here's the thing: for most women, in comics or any other industry, and in daily life, this is not an exceptional experience. When someone with privilege abuses someone without it, nine times out of ten their mutual community will close ranks around the abuser, and the more they identify superficially with the abuser, the more quickly they will leap to his defense.
Pop quiz: With whom do you think most people in comics with hiring power have more in common‚ÄìMariNaomi, or Scott Lobdell?
Do you really think that any woman's career and safety and dignity, let alone fostering a culture of equality and respect, are more important to the comics industry than not rocking the boat, when we've seen otherwise over and over and over? That Lobdell's behavior‚Äìof which DC has good reason to be well fucking aware‚Äìwill matter more to DC than not losing a writer with his fanbase?
Maybe you are basically a good person. Maybe you are patting yourself on the back that you would never do what Scott Lobdell did, or that you would have spoken up if you'd been there.
Maybe what you should actually be thinking about is the fact that when you read what had happened, MariNaomi, not Scott Lobdell, was the person you decided to spend your time taking to task.
Are Iron Branches Worth It?
Note: Before you turn your nose up at this post because you're better than it, keep in mind that not everyone has a deep understanding of the items, and I haven't seen it explained in mathematical terms before.
If you're like me, as soon as you discovered build guides, you began mindlessly following them like they were the greatest thing since sliced bread. After playing for a while, you may have started questioning the rationale behind those guides. You may have wondered why 3 Iron Branches seems to be present on most skill builds. After all, all they do is offer a measly 1 point per attribute. How good can they possibly be?
The answer is very, if we look at things not in terms of overall impact, but in terms of value. Doing some quick napkin math, it turns out we are paying a mere 17 gold per stat. Let's compare that to something like the Staff of Wizardry ‚Äì which gives +10 intelligence for 1000 gold ‚Äî and we see that we're now paying 100 gold per stat.
Wait, but isn't that a ripoff? Shouldn't those ‚Äúbetter‚Äù items be more valuable, not less? The answer is no, not necessarily. These items have less value in terms of gold because they offer something else: value of inventory space. Rather than having a trailer (err, ‚Äúmanufactured home‚Äù) on a 1 acre lot, you now have a 2 story house. Yes, you've paid more, but you now have more room in the same space. It may be less bang for your buck, but you can do more with it.
Let's go back to that trailer example though, because it might give the wrong impression. A trailer is fine if you're just moving out on your own and need a lean way to get by while you can work and build up savings. That's exactly what branches do. Let's also consider just how much of an impact those branches have at the first level.
Consider this chart, noticing all heroes attribute growth (i.e. how much they will gain for things like strength every time they level):
Each hero tends to gain a total of around 6 points in the three attributes per level. That means that buying 3 branches (for a total of +9 in attributes) is the equivalent to about a level and a half. Not too shabby considering that's a 150% level increase right out of the gate. Given that the previously mentioned Staff of Wizardry wouldn't be acquired until quite a few levels later for essentially the same cost, it's not too shabby!
This is also why things like the Circlet (+2 all attributes, 185 gold) are frequently included as well. Not as valuable as a branch (30 gold per attribute), but now we've got double the punch packed into the same space.
If you didn't know, now you know, Naga.
Exploratorium cuts 18% of staff as attendance lags
The Exploratorium projected daily attendance of 6,000 to 7,000 at the Embarcadero, but the actual crowd was 3,000 to 4,000.

The Exploratorium, San Francisco's acclaimed science museum, has decided to eliminate 80 of its 435 paid positions after attendance in the four months since it opened at its new waterfront location reached only half of what had been anticipated, its directors said.
"We were just not hitting our mark," said Executive Director Dennis Bartels.
The museum had projected a daily attendance of 6,000 to 7,000, but actual attendance at its new digs at Pier 15 on the Embarcadero was between 3,000 and 4,000, said Sabrina Smith, the museum's director of communications and marketing.
The cuts include laying off workers, leaving unfilled positions vacant and letting all seasonal employees go. A total of 34 full-time, permanent employees will be terminated within 30 days.
The reductions amount to more than 18 percent of the staff and are across the board, Exploratorium officials said.
Some of the staff members who will lose their jobs have been with the Exploratorium for years. One of them is Kua Patten, 52, who is director of exhibit services. "There are a lot of emotions after being here for 20 years," he said.
"It's part of the reorganization after the move," he said. "It's sad and a little scary, but if it keeps the organization going, you do what you have to do."
Revenue below projections
In addition to the low attendance, ticket revenue fell well below projections. The museum projected average ticket revenue of $15.50, but the actual revenue per ticket was more like $12.50, Smith said.
The Exploratorium had advertised an adult admission price of $25, but ticket prices were heavily discounted. Bay Area residents were allowed in for $20, and children, seniors and tour groups also paid less for tickets. The result was revenue about 20 percent less than projected.
The museum had expected to sell more of the higher-priced tickets, especially to visitors to the area, but that did not work out.
"We were expecting more tourists," Bartels said.
The Exploratorium's new home cost $300 million and has more than 600 exhibits spread over 330,000 square feet of space. It has an operating budget of $43 million a year.
Early praise for new site
The new site, in what was an old shipping pier, was hailed for its location right on the water, because of the interplay of the building, the weather and San Francisco Bay with its tides, currents and wildlife, which the museum used to its advantage.
"Here we can make the invisible more visible, like the colors of the bay's water, the chaos of the winds on-site," Bartels said when the Pier 15 museum opened last spring.
It was also praised as a major addition to the city's waterfront - "a facility that is making our waterfront more accessible for residents and visitors," Mayor Ed Lee said at the time.
Rebuilding the old shipping piers, turning them into museum space and moving hundreds of exhibits across town was "a herculean effort," Smith said. "It was above and beyond."
But many of the employees who made the move will no longer be on the payroll.
"We are making an adjustment," Smith said. "We now are an Exploratorium that is running, as opposed to an Exploratorium that is moving."
Smith explained the staff cuts as "something that was anticipated" once the new location was up and running. "It is no surprise to us," she said.
After a splashy opening and heavy advertising, however, the attendance in the first four months was clearly a surprise.
"Attendance," Smith said carefully, "was a little bit slower than we anticipated."
Facing economic reality
Patten, one of the laid-off employees, said he understood why the museum staff had to be scaled back.
"We have to face the economic reality and be a nonprofit," he said. "We don't have the flexibility of other organizations."
"The hardest part," Bartels said, "is telling anybody that there is no longer a position for them and that it has nothing to do with their performance or the great job they've done."
Orlando City is not yet sure on the severity of the knee injury suffered by defensive midfielder Darwin Cer√©n in a World Cup qualifier with El Salvador.
Cer√©n was stretchered off in the Salvadoran's 1-0 win over Curacao last week, but he remains with the national team and thus Orlando City has not yet been able to evaluate one of their most important players.
‚ÄúI'd like to be able to say yeah, we've had a thorough examination, unfortunately that's not the case,‚Äù Lions' coach Adrian Heath said on Open Mike on 740 The Game. ‚ÄúWe're trying to get more information daily, we tried to get him home straight after the game. ‚Ä¶ It's very frustrating when someone you pay for, you buy, we pay the salary and we're still a little bit in the dark three days later with the extent of the injury.‚Äù
Heath said the club had been told Cer√©n has a ligament strain in his right knee and that it is too early for him to play in the second qualifier between El Salvador and Cura√ßao on Tuesday.
The club hopes to get Cer√©n back by Wednesday or Thursday so they can evaluate his availability down the stretch.
‚ÄúWe won't know until we have a doctor look at him and get an MRI,‚Äù Heath said.
Orlando City plays Sunday against Sporting Kansas City. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. and the game will air on Fox Sports 1.

It's been 12 long years since Elizabeth Laird, a woman living in central Texas, began a sweet tradition of sending off soldiers and welcoming them home with a hug. Known as ‚Äúthe hug lady,‚Äù her routine has been to show up at the airport and wait to give as many warm hugs as she can.
Addressing the value of the gesture, 87-year-old Elizabeth says,
‚ÄúIt brings a little light to you, to know that someone cares enough about you to love you‚Ä¶ and a complete stranger at that,‚Äù one soldier told kxan.
But now sad news has struck. Elizabeth is in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital as she has been battling breast cancer for the past 11 years. But with that, the tables have turned. To show how much her sweet hugs have meant to them, soldiers are flocking to the hospital to embrace Elizabeth just as she's done for them for more than a decade.
Many people are also contributing to a GoFundMe account started to help Elizabeth pay for her medical bills. Watch the full story of this sweet woman in the video below.
It is not known when the McGrath was built, but research shows that it had been used as a barn on the Isaac Witter farm and could have been built around 1890. (Photo: Contributed photo)
In celebration of south Wood County's rich history, Vintage Venues ‚Äî a Daily Tribune weekly feature ‚Äî puts the spotlight on the past and the story behind some of the most historically significant local sites.
McGrath Home, 811 Elm St., Wisconsin Rapids
Brief history: The home that Ken and Sue McGrath bought in 1972 was moved to that location in 1921. It is not known when the home was built, but research shows that it had been used as a barn on the Isaac Witter farm and could have been built around 1890. The Witter farm encompassed much of the land east of Third Street, now including a couple of churches and Assumption High School.
Dr. Joe Goodrich purchased lot 1 and half of lot 2 of the Wisconsin Heights addition in the city, and the house was moved to the corner of Elm and Fourth streets. Fourth Street later was renamed Chestnut Street. Goodrich lived there with his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Goodrich, and their two sons, Joe Jr. and Jim. Joe died in World War II, and Jim lives in Indiana. Both are graduates of Lincoln High School.
The McGrath family moved in with two sons and later added two more children. It might be the only home in the city where a Miss Wisconsin played the grand piano in the living room. Their daughter Molly won the title in 2004. The McGrath family now has five grandchildren with another due to arrive this year.
The first project the McGraths tackled after moving in was to add a fireplace in the living room. The footings were already there, so they just finished a plan that was started years earlier.
An open stairway leads to three bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor. A small bedroom and half bath on the first floor is used as an office. The first time the McGraths looked at the home they realized it was a shrine to the son who died in World War II. The first landing going to the second floor opens to a large sundeck.
Also on the first floor is a dining room, kitchen and gathering room that once was an enclosed porch. French doors lead from the entry hall to the living room. Any changes that have been made have stayed true to the original footprint of the home. There are hardwood floors throughout and crown molding in many of the rooms.
An attached garage was converted to a three-season porch/spa when an unattached garage was built.
The McGraths rented a home when they moved to Wisconsin Rapids with their two young children. Ken is a retired history teacher from Lincoln High School, and Sue is a nurse retired from Riverview Hospital, where she managed emergency services and later was a nursing supervisor. She rode her bike to work and went past the house every day. When they heard it was for sale, they immediately checked into it.
The McGraths have decorated and furnished the home in ways to enhance this early 20th century structure. A traditional style fits well in this treasure of a home.
Dr. Joe Goodrich was born in 1884 in Athens, Maine. After graduating from college, he studied Osteopathy in Missouri and earned his medical degree in 1915. He worked in Indiana for a year before coming to Wisconsin Rapids, where he was appointed hospital manager and served as administrator for many years. He enjoyed playing tennis, golfing, fishing and hunting.
Interesting fact: Before going to medical school, Goodrich decided to see the world. Not having any money, he became a tramp riding rail cars. He traveled with the then-famous King Hobo Pat Butterworth. They also rode in many foreign countries, cooking all their meals as well as sleeping in the open. He loved to entertain people with stories of his travels. Goodrich died at the age of 88 in 1972 and his wife, Elizabeth, died the year before.

I was thinking about doing some zap apple related things after the last episode, but couldn't find any zap apple vectors.Wanting to get better at vectoring myself, I thought it was a good opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. (Also it was much easier, at least I'm assuming, then doing a full pony vector. Doing one of those, you would need to worry about line width and all that.)It's a trace of this apple, [link] the one from Granny Smith's flashback / story. I got the colors from a screen-cap later in the episode.(Though the colors of the leaf, base and top of the stem are best guesses, as the zap apples in the 'present day' have a different leaf and stem. The base of the stem is also shrunk slightly, as in full color it looked slightly too big.)I'll probably do a vector of another zap apple, just so I can help avoid repetition if/when I make some zap apple related things.Cheers!
A crazed Brooklyn driver rammed into a cop, then drove more than three miles before crashing into a brick wall as police gave chase early Saturday, cops said.
Cops were responding to an assault in a bar at Kings Highway and McDonald Avenue in Gravesend around 5 a.m. when they spotted the 24-year-old suspect in his car, revving up his engine and driving back and forth.
As the officers approached the driver, he took off, hitting one of them, according to police.
He drove with a police cruiser on his tail to Langham Street and Shore Boulevard in Manhattan Beach. He finally came to a stop when he hit a three-foot brick wall in a residential yard.
The officer was taken to NYU Lutheran Medical Center where he was treated for cuts and swelling to his right leg, and released. The driver was not injured.
He was arrested and taken to the 78th Precinct, according to police. Charges are pending.
Following President Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, and his avowal to push for the country's ‚Äúenergy dominance‚Äù through a concentration on coal, one issue that will likely worsen in the coming years is air pollution. The only way to truly combat the decreasing quality of our air is by government policy, support for environmental research, and serious attention to sources of carbon dioxide emissions. However, small-scale design projects have the potential to increase awareness and offer solutions for ways to build greener cities.
One such recent green initiative is the CityTree by the Berlin-based Green City Solutions. The name is a bit misleading, as CityTree is really a 13-foot wall of moss, with the possibility for public seating on either side, intended to be a self-sustaining, wifi-ready environment through solar panels and rainwater collectors. Green City Solutions states that the CityTree ‚Äúhas the same effect as up to 275 urban trees‚Äù with its ‚Äúspecific moss cultures with vascular plant that eat particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide and ozone ‚Äî offsetting 240 tons of CO2-equivalents per year in total.‚Äù
CNN reported that 20 CityTress have been installed in cities including Paris, Oslo, Hong Kong, and Brussels. Two CityTrees were recently deployed in Glasgow, although the rollout of these pop-up air cleaners has not been without challenges. Co-founder Zhengliang Wu told CNN that in Modena, Italy, ‚Äúeverything was planned and arranged, but now the city is hesitant about the places we can install because of security reasons.‚Äù Perhaps a greater hurdle is funding for the devices, which is not cheap. Curbed notes that each costs around $25,000. Arguably, you could plant a lot of hardy street trees for much less money.
Yet the CityTree is not meant for parks or to replace street trees, but to add greenery to concrete-heavy spaces where planting is not an option. Paris, one of the inaugural CityTree cities, has a very thin tree canopy; the newly launched Treepedia from MIT's Senseable City Lab ranked it among the lowest in its tree study of major cities. Nevertheless, as anyone who has attempted to keep a home terrarium knows, even moss requires care for its water needs, and it's hard to imagine the mini-gardens making it through a harsh winter. Further, the CityTree lacks many benefits of having 275 trees, such as shade.
According to the World Health Organization, seven million deaths were attributed to air pollution exposure in 2012 (resulting from things like strokes, lung cancer, and ischaemic heart disease). There is no easy solution to this global problem. Still, socially conscious design can offer more grassroots responses. For instance, Daan Roosegaarde is partnering with the Beijing-based bike-sharing company Ofo to make smog-inhaling bikes available to the public (Studio Roosegaarde's previous projects include a 23-foot-tall structure in Rotterdam that vacuums smog and compresses it into jewelry). Air Ink by Graviky Labs in India is transforming airborne pollutants into consumer safe inks and paints. Each of these cannot reverse the environmental catastrophes of climate change and air pollution, but they can draw our attention to them.
All the hard work this foundation it's pumping into the world will one day not exist. Richard Dawkins is building his own glory upon lies of the truth. People actually look up to him and it's sad to know Richard will one day die and all his hard work against God will burn in fire. God is Merciful and will exhaust all of His love so that Richard repents and returns to the arms of his CREATOR the Almighty God. ‚ÄúWhat if your wrong,‚Äù a woman asks Richard in a speaking seminar. Mr. Dawkins replies with nothing. He did not answer the question, why? What if your wrong? Mr. Dawkins. What if one day you meet your CREATOR? Richards Dawkins puts his faith in science, but science leads you to dead ends. If there's nothing no good, no evil, no God, no purpose, no meaning‚Ä¶. Then why does Mr. Dawkins care? His purpose in life is to lead many away from God, but what does he care if in the end we all die? I'll keep him in prayer and ask Jesus to help him see the truth. The blind leading the blind will need a guide one day and Jesus Christ will never turn you away. Ask Him to lead you. God bless you and God love you.

CORAL GABLES, Fla. - During Local 10 News' last Neighborhood Crime Alert, Andrew Perez exposed an elaborate burglary ring going on in the Pinecrest area.
This time, instead of homes and businesses, it's bicycles that thieves are targeting.
The crime has become such a problem in Miami and Coral Gables that a task force was setup to take these crooks down.
"What we're hearing from our detectives is that they're pawning the bikes," said Coral Gables police Officer, Kelly Denham. "They're taking them out of our city through various means of transportation."
The police department said it started seeing increases in bike thefts last year and believes crooks are going out of their way to make the pricey grabs.
"You don't have to be a professional bike rider to have a nice bike," said Denham. "Some of these bikes are $300 to $5,000."
Surveillance cameras were rolling on a bike thief who broke into the underground garage of a Coral Gables condo.
The suspect is seen carrying large bolt cutters and manages to take off with two bicycles early in the morning.
Detectives in the city started placing decoy bikes with trackers built into them in an effort to fight back against the trending crime.
Investigators tracked the stolen bikes, and learned that criminals were using the Metrorail and county buses to take them to pawn shops in an effort to sell the stolen goods.
In a little over a year, Coral Gables police have made at least 30 arrests using decoy bikes which are strategically placed at parking garages, apartments and public areas.
But police said many cases have yet to be solved. Authorities are encouraging the public to stay alert.
Tips to prevent bicycle thefts:
- Take a photo of your bicycle
- Write down the serial number so police can identify it, should it end up at a pawn shop
- Bike thieves have admitted to police that they will not target a bike that has a heavy duty U-lock around it.
- Police said the crime has become so popular because the thieves think it's easy.
Authorities encourage citizens to report suspicious activity, reminding the public that if something seems out of place, it probably is.

Fan controllers are a lot like, I don't know, adjustable suspension systems on a road car. Even on a car with sporting pretensions, the fact is that unless you intend to take it to your local race track and indulge in regular cycles of hot lapping, you would never experience the benefits of changing the spring rates, anti-roll bar stiffness levels, bump and rebound damper settings, and camber angles.
But fan controllers on a computer are not as pretentious as fully adjustable suspensions are on anything less than a racing car. For example, let's say you live in an area where your ambient temperatures tend to soar, especially in the summer, and then dip down low during the winter. I used to live in an apartment that was so poorly insulated and didn't have air conditioning where summertime temperatures reached 110¬∞F/43.33¬∞C, and then plunged to around ~60¬∞F/15.56¬∞C during the winter.
To combat these ridiculously high summertime temperatures, I equipped my PC with dual 120mm x 38mm 3700RPM Delta fans for its CPU cooler just to keep my overclocked dual-core Opteron 170's temperatures in check. This PC also had high-RPM 120mm x 25mm intake and exhaust fans mounted on my TJ09 case. Needless to say, this was a loud PC. But the noise was a necessary evil if I wanted to preserve my machine.
Once the dreaded summer heat was over, though, the noise became unacceptable. Consequently, I had the option of either swapping out all my fans for slower-running units, or somehow slowing down my fans. Software-based solutions (including the BIOS) back then were just not as good and capable as they may be today, so I had to come up with a different solution.
Enter the fan controller.
Thermaltake's Commander F5 is a super-practical accessory for users with a need to manually control their systems' fan speeds. It is designed to fit in a 5.25‚Ä≥ optical drive bay, where it should be easily accessible to the end-user.
The Commander F5 is visually a very simple affair: Five vertical sliders in red, five blue LEDs to indicate active fan channels, a single red LED to show that the Commander F5 is powered up, and a discrete Thermaltake script on the left edge of the mesh panel. This should ensure that it will look at home installed in any 5.25‚Ä≥ optical drive bay, no matter what chassis it's in. And by the way, Thermaltake includes a baggie with four bay installation screws.
The view behind the mesh panel is a good bit busier, dominated as it is by the black PCB and a bundle of cables. The six cables run off the PCB. The left-most cable is the Molex 4-pin power cable which supplies power to the fan channels controlled by the Commander F5. The other five cables, then, are the five fan channels. These all support fans with either 3-pin or 4-pin connectors.
Let's see the Commander F5 in action.
Pardon the mess, but my dinner table is barely big enough to hold all the gear I've piled onto it. I've got the Commander F5 plugged into a Molex connector from the PSU that powers my dedicated Techgage test bench PC. And plugged into the Commander F5 are five fans: Two Cougar 120mm LED fans (mounted on a XSPC RS240 radiator, just as a prop right now), a 120mm x 38mm Delta tri-blade EFB1212SHE capable of 3700RPM (modified with the surround of a gutted 120mm x 38mm fan functioning as a shroud ‚Äì I used to perform all sorts of cooling experiments with these things years ago), a 140mm x 25mm fan from my NZXT Havik, and one of Cooler Master's 200mm case fans.
The Commander F5 handled all five fans without any problems. Pulling the sliders down to zero position did not stop the fans completely; clearly, 4V are enough to keep every fan, even the monstrous Delta EFB1212SHE tri-blade, spinning. And with the sliders turned all the way to the top, every fan is fed around 10.5V. I wish I had a tachometer to measure each fan's RPMs, but the effect on the Delta tri-blade was dramatic: Lots of RPMs, lots of CFM, and lots of dBA as well.
So how do we finish up this quick look at the Commander F5?
For sure, I think the F5 is worthwhile if you need to keep fan speeds under precise control. In my opinion, manual fan controllers make the most sense for users who run super-fast (and therefore super-noisy) fan set-ups, primarily to combat super-high ambient temperatures during the summer: Instead of swapping out fans when the weather changes, you can just dial your fans' capabilities according to your current needs.
Cosmetically, it's simple yet aggressive. Black and red is a tried-and-true color combination, and the mesh front panel should work in most applications, especially if you have a case with an all-mesh front facia. The vertical sliders are also a handy visual cue as to just how much power you're feeding your fans with.
If you want to take full command of up to five fan channels, the Commander F5 might just be the perfect fan controller for you.
Given the current pace of the PS4 scene, this release is fairly old (it pretty much happened right after SpecterDev released his implementation of the exploit) but is quite important: Developer IDC has been working on a fork of SpecterDev's exploit, and added significant modifications to it. From an end user's perspective, the most visible change with this fork is that the FTP payload that's been circulating (more on that in a follow-up article) is granted full root access instead of being constrained to the webkit process permissions.
In IDC's changelog compared to SpecterDev's release:
Modify loader to be fully relocatable.
Move fix to its own file.
Change memory allocation to behave similar to how 1.76 payloads ran.
Improve overall stability in WebKit exploit:
Add automatic prisonbreak (remove sandbox) and payload run loop.
Revert to original payload address.
Clear payload memory area before each run.
I think some of these changes are significant, in particular if they make the 4.05 exploit behave closer to the 1.76 one: most of the payloads that are circulating for now are directly inherited from the 1.76 scene, and simply recompiled with an updated SDK. Any changes can have an impact, and I would not be surprised if this is why the FTP server (recompiled from 1.76 version) was behaving strangely for some.
In other words, I do recommend to start using this fork for now, unless people come up with very good reasons not to.
For those of you who have been following my tutorial on how to hack your PS4 4.05, there's also good news: Developer Al-Azif has been frenetically updating his awesome tool ps4-exploit-host, which is now at version 0.3.6.1. It ships with both SpecterDev and IDC's versions of the exploits, and lets you choose which one you want to run. Ps4-exploit-host is the swiss army knife of PS4 4.05 hack, and I strongly recommend that you update (or get it for the first time if you haven't used it yet). You'll need Python 3 (formerly Python 2) in order to update the tool.
Download and run PS4 4.05 PS4 Exploit (IDC Fork)
Important: You need a PS4 running firmware 4.05 in order to use this exploit. If you have that, great! If you have a PS4 running a firmware lower than 4.05, see my tutorial on how to update your PS4 to Firmware 4.05. If you have a PS4 running a firmware higher than 4.05, you need to buy a PS4 with a lower firmware. Here are tips on how to find one.
For those who have been using ps4-exploit-host, just grab the latest version, which contains IDC's exploit: you can download directly ps4-exploit-host (version 0.3.6.1 or higher) on Al-Azif's github.
If you'd rather just get the exploit, you can fetch it from IDC's github.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) ‚Äî It was inevitable that Microsoft Corp. would take another look at Yahoo Inc. after the Internet giant began to consider an auction.
So it was a bit of a surprise that Yahoo shares YHOO leaped more than 10% on Wednesday on a report that Microsoft and Chief Executive Steve Ballmer might kick the tires again. But Yahoo shareholders need anything they can get right now.
Microsoft MSFT, +0.69% was quick to deny the report through the AllThingsD blog, whose Kara Swisher has led the reporting on this story. See Swisher's report on AllThingsD. But Ballmer & Co. would be foolish to not at least consider how Yahoo or parts of it might help them in a tech world that's changed a lot in the three years since they first offered to buy Yahoo. With the poker game just getting started, Ballmer has a serious hand to play.
If Microsoft liked Yahoo at $33 a share, which was the almost $50 billion offer it had on the table in 2008, it would love it at today's $17 billion market cap. True, naysayers would argue that the decline in Yahoo's value reflects the fact that it is a collection of declining assets. But at a price of $20 billion to $23 billion, there are plenty of ways to make some money out of them.
For all the hardship Yahoo's management and board of directors have taken from investors for lack of leadership and direction, it is still a stunning group of Internet assets, with a massive reach of almost 700 million unique users.
The question of whether Yahoo is a tech company or a media company was actually resolved by ousted CEO Carol Bartz before she was fired. Her vision was that it would be a media company, and at the time of her firing she had made several steps to head in that direction. One of them was to hire Jai Singh as editor-in-chief of the news products.
Singh helped build the newsroom at The Huffington Post, but more famously, built the news operation at CNet back in the day of the original Internet bubble. He's brought on several other strong journalists since joining this past spring, but has still only begun the process of turning Yahoo's news and programing fiefdoms into a single news operation.
Microsoft never had any pretense about what it was ‚Äî a tech company ‚Äî despite its dalliances with MSN.com and its MSNBC.com partnerships. So it could spin the news business, and its 80 million monthly readers, off to another news empire, such as News Corp., parent of MarketWatch, which supplies Yahoo with news. Or it could give news a second chance, this time being a news provider instead of just an aggregator.
In any event, the news business is just one set of assets Microsoft would acquire in Yahoo. It would also acquire Yahoo's 40% stake in Alibaba ALBCF in China, and its 35% stake in its Japanese affiliate. Both could be sold off to help pay for the deal. As Doug McIntyre from 24/7 Wall Street argued to me over a beer a few weeks ago, Ballmer could sell them back to the partners on his terms. He would have leverage over his Chinese and Japanese partners because unlike Yahoo or a private equity buyer, he could afford to wait them out if they didn't accept his offer or until a better offer emerged.
Yahoo also reportedly holds more than a thousand patents, and of course, its search and advertising display partnership with Microsoft.
The auction is in early days right now, so everybody is posturing, and as Swisher points out in her blog, the bankers are leaking scenarios like there's no tomorrow. But what happens when a valuable asset goes on auction is that everybody plays it cool until a real bidder emerges, and then things go crazy.
Microsoft may be over its interest in Yahoo. After all, it has the search partnership already. But Ballmer knows the tech world is consolidating and that Microsoft can't just chug along forever, clutching its cash reserves while Apple, Facebook and Google steal all the limelight. It needs to get in the game, which thanks to the likely auction of Yahoo, has just turned into an Internet content arms race.
House Bill 114, which was introduced to the West Virginia House, would decriminalize and permit the personal use, growth and possession of certain amounts of marijuana. (WCHS/WVAH photo)
In the midst of a special legislative session aimed at solving West Virginia's budget deficit, five delegates introduced a bill that would legalize marijuana in the mountain state.
Delegates Mike Pushkin (D-Kanawha), Michael Folk (R-Berkeley), Pat McGeehan (R-Hancock), Bill Flanagan (R-Monongalia) and Shawn Fluharty (D-Ohio) introduced House Bill 114 Wednesday that would decriminalize and permit the personal use, growth and possession of certain amounts of marijuana by anyone over the age of 21.
The bill would also decriminalize first offense distribution of 30 grams or fewer. The introduced bill says new criminal penalties for the sales and manufacturing of marijuana would be established.
The introduced bill would also create a tax stamp that would be issued by the tax department. The tax stamps would allow certain residents to lawfully possess up to two ounces of marijuana.
The bill was referred to the Committee on Health and Human Resources and will then head to the Judiciary and Finance committees.
House Bill 114 was presented on the same day that the Ohio House approved medical marijuana in a bill that just need Gov. John Kasich's signature.
Here is the complete House Bill 114 that was introduced Wednesday:
Reach, the planet, falls to the Covenant forces and is destroyed by aerial bombardment.
That can't be a spoiler at this point, can it? The 2001 Halo novel was called The Fall of Reach, for crying out loud. It's not a subtle reference in the world of Halo. We know that Master Chief is the last surviving Spartan throughout the other Halo games, making Reach something like the Star Wars prequels; we get to see other Spartans fight at the height of their power. Noble Team is ready for anything, eminently capable, and tough as nails. The game details their efforts on a planet we know is doomed. It feels like a tragedy from the beginning, and the ending scene... well, it's something you'll have to experience. People are going to talk about it.
This is Bungie saying goodbye to the Halo series, and handing things off to Microsoft and 343 Industries before moving onto whatever the next project is going to be. Reach may be a prequel to the existing games, but it brings everything to a close with grace and spirit. If ODST was a major stumble, Reach is the recovery.

These are Spartans
Halo Reach is the story of a group of Spartans called Noble Team, and you are the newest recruit. It follows these characters, each with personality and a face, through their adventure as we slowly learn how their story ties into the greater lore of Halo. Yes, this is a very important game in the timeline of the series, unlike the side-story nature of ODST. The game also features a much darker feel than the other entries in the series; while no one really thought that humanity would be wiped out while playing Halo 3, we know going into Reach that the Spartans have been wiped out, save Master Chief. This doesn't give us much hope for the characters we'll be spending time with.
This is a game about sacrifice, and by the time the game is over, that will have been hammered into your skull time and time again.
While past Halo games had regenerating armor and ODST had a standard health system, Reach mixes the two by having shields that regenerate if you can find a place to rest between firefights, as well as a health bar that requires health packs to repair. It's the best of both worlds, and works very well as a throwback to the classic Halo experience.
The weapons have also been re-worked, and they feel great: powerful and loud. The Plasma Launcher that shoots up to four sticky, explosive rounds is a personal favorite, as is the grenade launcher, which allows you to hold the trigger to choose when to detonate the grenade round. I'm not going to list all the weapons and what they do‚Äîpart of the fun is exploring the ordnance and finding favorites as you play‚Äîbut I was very happy with the selection of guns throughout the game. Some are only used once or twice, others pop up throughout the game, but everyone will find something to love.
The armor abilities also bring variety to the play. The game begins by giving you the ability to sprint by holding the left bumper, but soon you'll be given the option of using a holographic decoy, a jet pack, a portable energy shield, and more. Each one gives you different tactical options that change how you play through a section, and some (like the jet pack) are used for specific sections in the game.
These features also come to life in the different multiplayer modes, and it's thrilling to take to the skies and fire down on your opponents, or use the armor lock power to make yourself temporarily invincible, although you'll be locked in place.
The Halo series has always been about firefights, and how to approach combat situations tactically. Do you throw a grenade? Use an ability? What weapon should you be carrying? You'll be asking yourself these questions constantly as you assess each situation and find the best way to move forward, and this is what gives the games so much lasting power.
I played through the game in one sitting with a friend, and I can't wait do it again; there are a lot of other things I'd like to try. We left the game session with tons of great stories about what happened and why, and we often cursed the screen or cheered depending on how our strategy worked out. Some people hate Halo because it's popular or they don't like consoles or blah blah blah... tune out the whiners: Reach delivers finely tuned action with a very distinct look and feel. This series is successful for a reason.
A group of employees working for the oil company Vaxxilon are working on a boat in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. One night a boss, Karsen, sends four of his men, Engel, Mitchell, Jones and Hurst, down in the diving bell to fix a damaged oil pipe. Having completed the work they make the ascent but the support ship is hit by a storm, causing the cables holding the bell to break. Desperately trying to make contact with the ship, one of the crew members goes out to assess the damage, only to find the body of Karsen and the wreck of the supply ship on the bottom of the ocean. The four men then have to use their wits and knowledge of diving and the bell to try and escape from the ocean floor, 670 feet (200 m) down, with a limited oxygen supply.
Against orders, Hurst decides to search for the ship for more oxygen in an act of desperation. However, Hurst develops hypothermia and enters a delusional state. He refuses to return to the bell and the other men realize that he will freeze to death. To save oxygen and to spare Hurst a slow death, Jones cuts Hurst's oxygen supply in an act of euthanasia. Unknown to the other three men, Hurst dies just feet from the cylinder he had set out to find.
While Vaxxilon leaves the men to die, their distress signal is picked up by a Chinese fishing boat. They quickly lose communication with the fishing boat which was damaged in the storm as well and all appears lost. The men are later contacted by the navy frigate HMS Marlborough, learning that the fishing boat relayed their distress call to the frigate. However, the men do not know their exact coordinates and as a result, it will take hours for the Marlborough to find them. Running out of air, Engel makes a near-fatal dive to recover more cylinders from the pipeline's drywall chambers. With the Marlborough still struggling to find the men, Mitchell makes a dive to bring their locator beacon closer to the surface. However, while Mitchell succeeds, he is stung several times by jellyfish in the process and dies.
The Marlborough is able to locate the bell, but requires at least an hour to get rescue divers to Jones and Engel. Lacking enough time, Engel attempts to float the bell to the surface, but it gets stuck 170 feet (52 m) away. With no other choice, Engel realizes that one of the men must use the remaining dive helmet and swim to the surface. Engel chooses to sacrifice himself to save Jones, sharing a story of how his selfishness in the past cost a young boy his life. Though Jones develops bleeding from the mouth due to decompression sickness given his fast ascent, he reaches the surface and is rescued by teams from the Marlborough. After learning that Jones has been rescued and with the bell out of oxygen and flooding, Engel tries and fails to make the swim himself and drowns.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump scolded U.S. lawmakers on Thursday for clamping down on Moscow with new sanctions, his message clashed with the one that Vice President Mike Pence pushed during a four-day trip this week to Eastern Europe.
As he toured Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro, Pence said the sanctions passed overwhelmingly by Congress would send a unified message to Russia that it must change its behavior.
Trump, by contrast, took to Twitter to complain that the sanctions legislation, which he grudgingly signed, would send U.S.-Russia relations to ‚Äúan all-time & very dangerous low.‚Äù
While some Republicans played down the divergence, critics said it exemplified an incoherent policy that would unsettle allies and fail to placate Moscow.
‚ÄúThere are some policies where a good cop/bad approach can work,‚Äù said Michael McFaul, a U.S. ambassador to Russia under former Democratic President Barack Obama.
But McFaul added that in the case of the Trump administration's policy toward Russia, Moscow was likely to view the mixed signals as a sign of policy disarray.
If the Republican president continues to want improved relations with Russia, ‚Äúhe's not achieving his goal,‚Äù McFaul said.
The White House's two-track approach is mirrored in Moscow.
After Trump signed the new sanctions into law on Wednesday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the No. 2 in the Russian ruling hierarchy, launched a blistering attack on the White House.
Yet Russian President Vladimir Putin ‚Äî who has tried to cultivate a personal rapport with Trump in phone conversations and face-to-face meetings at a summit in Germany ‚Äî has not uttered a word in public about the sanctions since Trump approved them.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants better ties with Russia. But the country has loomed large over the first six months of his administration as a special counsel and U.S. congressional panels investigate allegations Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump and also examine any potential role by Trump aides.
Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.
After Congress passed the sanctions legislation with a large enough margin to override a presidential veto, Trump signed it on Wednesday but criticized it as infringing on his authority and said he could make ‚Äúfar better deals‚Äù with governments than Congress could.
As a countermeasure to the sanctions, Putin called for reducing the staff of the U.S. diplomatic mission by 755 people and for the seizure of two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats.
‚ÄòSMALL AND BULLYING LEADER'
Jarrod Agen, deputy chief of staff to Pence, insisted that Trump and Pence were ‚Äúcompletely aligned‚Äù on Russia.
‚ÄúIt was the president's decision to send the vice president to the region. It was the president's decision to deliver the message that the vice president delivered,‚Äù Agen told Reuters.
He added that Pence and Trump spoke every day during his trip and sometimes multiple times a day.
The disconnect between Pence and Trump on Russia is an anomaly. Pence usually goes to lengths to emphasize his loyalty to his boss and to downplay any differences.
Their different tone on Russia dates back to the U.S. presidential campaign. While Trump often praised Putin, Pence called the Russian president a ‚Äúsmall and bullying leader‚Äù during a vice presidential debate last October.
During his trip this week, Pence condemned Russia for its ‚Äúoccupation of Georgia's soil‚Äù as he spoke to U.S. and Georgian troops engaged in joint exercises only 40 miles (64 km) away from Russian troops in South Ossetia.
In Montenegro, Pence accused Russia of trying to ‚Äúdestabilize‚Äù the western Balkans - a message criticized by Moscow.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was ‚Äúregrettable to note that Washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideology of the Cold War era, which is completely detached from reality.‚Äù
Traditional Republican conservatives - who favor a hard line on Moscow - have taken some comfort in Pence's message, as have foreign leaders concerned about the impact of a rapprochement between Trump and Putin.
‚ÄúWhat he (Pence) is saying is good and helpful and should be the policy of the Trump administration ‚Äì and so for those of us who want it to be that way, we're happy to embrace it,‚Äù said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
‚ÄúNone of us know what Donald Trump thinks in his heart of hearts about Russia,‚Äù Pletka said. But she added: ‚ÄúIf (Trump) were not comfortable with Pence making this trip, Pence would not be making this trip.‚Äù
Republican Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would not ‚Äúread a lot‚Äù into the different tones struck by Pence and Trump, although he welcomed Pence's trip to the European countries.

Corker described Pence as the administration's ‚Äúombudsman‚Äù on policy and said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, were key to developing Trump's foreign policy.
A former U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was at pains to explain the disconnect between Pence and Trump on Russia.
‚ÄúWe are dealing with a major, open split between the president and basically the rest of his administration with the possible exception of Tillerson,‚Äù the former official said.
After a tumultuous week marred by a disappointing U.S. Open Cup loss to Miami FC and a Cyle Larin DUI, Orlando City SC looks to get back on track with an Eastern Conference matchup against the Montreal Impact.

Alright. On my way to the stadium now. Let's see what happens tonight.
Kak√° reiterated a similar sentiment, saying the Montreal match is a chance to show his team is together.
And, as I said, it's a great opportunity to help them and to say, to show them that we are together. Of course, we are not agreed with the situation and with what Cyle did. And we know how serious is that. But, as I said, here, we are his teammates, and we are going to support him in this situation to get out of that the best way and with the best lessons for him. I think he's gonna pay a lot in all sense, and now, as a teammate, I think our behavior and what we need to do now it's being with him, saying that we are not agree with this situation, but we still love Cyle Larin.
It's a great opportunity to be together as well. So, we are gonna show how strong this group is. So, again, this is a great opportunity to show them that we are together, that we are going to face this situation together. And what a great opportunity we have tomorrow.
Tonight's match against Montreal is a chance for Kreis' Lions to show resolution in the face of adversity.
Again, part of the message this morning, for me, is that this is a little bit about life now. We all go through very difficult circumstances. We all make mistakes. We all have things that happen bad in our lives that we don't like and we don't want to deal with. And so now it's about how are we going to react to that. And from my point of view, I look at this and want to spin this immediately and say really, really difficult situation that we're in, both on the match and from Cyle's decision the night after the match. And it's on us to have a positive reaction to that. It's on us, now‚ÄîI think we‚Äîthis is a moment and an opportunity for us to come together tighter than we ever have before and show our fans and our people what we're made of and who we are.
Between the Lions' first-ever opening U.S. Open Cup loss and Larin's DUI, Kreis has had a personally trying week.
I have not [had a situation like Larin's DUI before]. I would say that that adds to a little bit of my disappointment because I intend to lead the group in a certain way. I intend to be clear in my communication of what is acceptable and what is not. We intended‚Äîwe went into this offseason trying to do something a little different, to make sure that the players understood that how they act in this community and the decisions that they make when they were in public are really, really important things to us. So, to have this situation occur after we give that communication was difficult‚Äîvery, very difficult. But, for me, on a personal level, I hope that that I lead a group based on my actions to show that this type of situation is also unacceptable. And I take it as a little bit of a mark on myself as well.
Despite his lack of a team-curfew policy, Kreis told his team during the offseason that excessive partying would no longer be acceptable.
You know, during the offseason, we had several occasions where we were with some of our most ardent fans, and we‚ÄîI had heard directly from some of those fans that [a lot of partying was] happening a little bit too much. That's why we went into the preseason and were very clear with our messaging for the players that this was no longer gonna be acceptable.
Kreis isn't one to keep tabs on his players, with regard to curfews.
You know, it's a‚Äîfrom a philosophical-leadership point of view, it's not something that I try to keep tabs on. I think these are grown men, and so I'm not going to‚Äîwe don't set curfews. We don't set strict rules about players not being able to go out or be out at a certain time. But at the same point, then, if we're gonna give players that much respect and that much leeway, they need to be held accountable for their decisions, as Cyle is now. And as I said before, this isn't just a Cyle Larin situation. When it comes to the discipline of this, it's now affecting the entire team and the entire club.
‚ÄúTogether‚Äù has been a common theme for Kreis in his first full season as the Lions' head coach.
It affects the entire team. But then we need to move on from that and say that we're family. And family members forgive. And we try to help each other in these times of need.
Here's Kreis with his statement to the media at training on Friday.
Cyle is obviously distraught and very, very disappointed, I think, in himself and his decision but is wanting to move forward as quickly as possible. And so‚Äîyou know, at the moment, I think that the most important thing‚Äîare two things, really. I think from a leadership of this club and this team, this organization, it's important that we make it very clear that we're not happy with his decision. We disagree vehemently, and it goes against what we've tried to establish here in this club and how we want to comport ourselves publicly.
Not any specific storylines relating to tonight's game, but I will pull some significant quotes from Friday's training from head coach Jason Kreis and team captain Ricardo Kak√°.
Orlando City SC will be without forward Cyle Larin because of a DUI charge that has him suspended from league play until he completes the Major League Soccer Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health program. The Lions will also miss midfielder Antonio
Nocerino after he earned a red card in a 0-0 draw with the Chicago Fire on June 4.
Malatya, the town where I was born, hosts one of the 25 refugee camps across the plains of southeastern Turkey. With our NATO allies, the United States has helped provide 2,083 shipping containers in Malatya alone that serve as homes for 7,625 refugees. In the dusty summer heat and in the windy, rainy winter, they serve as shelter for men, women, and children who have escaped the Syrian conflict. A small commitment of our tax dollars early in a refugee crisis is an investment in the future.
According to NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center, the Turkish government and private sector have diligently clothed, fed, and housed over 3.1 million people fleeing conflict. This makes Turkey the host country with the largest refugee population in the world.
From Nov. 3 to 14, President Trump and the first lady will travel across Asia. While the itinerary is not fully set, according to the White House, U.S. goals include profiling the ‚Äúlongstanding United States alliances and partnerships, and reaffirm[ing] United States leadership in promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region.‚Äù
On Sept. 7, the first lady of Turkey, Emine Erdoƒüan, visited Bangladesh. Over the course of just the twelve prior days, the United Nations estimated that 146,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees had fled ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.
Entire communities being burnt to the ground are still visible by satellites in space. Women are being raped. Children are being killed. Men are being executed. Emine Erdoƒüan took a risk in traveling to a conflict region and witnessed these horrors with her own eyes.
At the crossroads of difficult geopolitics with growing Indian and Chinese influence in the region, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world. Roughly the size of my home state of Pennsylvania, Bangladesh has over 160 million citizens. Since the September visit of the Turkish first lady, this number has grown to include approximately 900,000 Rohingya refugees. As American taxpayers, in 2016 alone, we invested $211 million in this multiparty Muslim majority democratic country.
To date, the U.S. has primarily just offered critical statements not backed with clear action or comprehensive strategy. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley have raised the prospect of punishing the Mynamar military. Vice President Mike Pence, a man of deep faith, has called the situation a ‚Äúgreat tragedy‚Äù and a ‚Äúheart-breaking assault on human rights.‚Äù
Bipartisan congressional leaders have taken notice of the worst ethnic cleansing of the 21st Century. On Sept. 28, 21 Republican and Democratic senators led by Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Md., and John McCain, R-Ariz., wrote an open letter to Tillerson requesting, among other points, that the U.S. re-evaluate our relationship with Myanmar. Democrats and Republicans in Congress and previous administrations have devoted significant time and resources to the U.S.-Bangladesh alliance. Knowing that early investment is the most cost effective, $95 million in taxpayer dollars for this tragedy are being committed.
In May, Trump visited Saudi Arabia to ‚Äúdeliver a message of friendship and hope‚Äù to the Muslim world. In his May speech, the president shared with the assembled heads of state from the Muslim world, ‚ÄúWe in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers, and for action.‚Äù
I immigrated to Pennsylvania over three decades ago to pursue my education. While not a refugee, the realities behind leaving one's home, learning a new language, and embracing a new culture are difficult for many in Washington to grasp. Our first lady is an exception. Like many in Bangladesh, Melania Trump was born in a country that no longer exists. At age 21, the country she knew, Yugoslavia, became embroiled in bloody conflict. While Slovenia emerged after just a few days, practically unscathed and with minimal fighting, it did play a similar critical role in subsequent years absorbing refugees fleeing conflict in Croatia and Bosnia.
As the itinerary is still being finalized, I hope our first lady visits with the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, just as the first lady of Turkey has done. Mrs. Trump would not only visit a Muslim-majority state led by a female leader, but also, as her husband stated so eloquently in Saudi Arabia, she would ‚Äúlook back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice.‚Äù American leadership ended the war in the former Yugoslavia and, so too, American leadership and values can bring justice to the Rohingya people.

Ah, was it only a month ago that we feared signing up for $60-$80 million worth of Dion Waiters, a player who has barely (and rarely) scraped the surface of "good" over his four-year NBA career? A classic "Philly Guy" ‚Äî which really makes you hope for an eventual reevaluation of our home city's cultural priorities ‚Äî the perennially over-confident Syracuse swingman had been regularly (if erroneously) linked to the Sixers for the majority of his pro career, and the rumor mill began churning again this offseason, with the Sixers one of several teams linked to the free agent. Chances seemed at least decent that we would wake up to an Instagram of Waiters at Geno's signing his new contract in cheese wiz ‚Äî one of those four-year, $70 million-type deals NBA teams seem to be giving out to middling players like complementary after-dinner mints this summer.
Well, turns out the Sixers didn't have any interest in giving Dion Waiters that kind of money, and neither did anybody else. Neon Dion ended up signing with the Miami Heat for a blockbusting two years and $6 million dollars, and Sixers nation breathed a collective typhoon of relief. Short of trading Jahlil Okafor for every Boston Celtic under the age of 25, this was just about the best news the Colangelos could offer us at this point in the offseason.
And speaking of: It might ‚Äî might ‚Äî now finally be safe to say that the Colangelos aren't as dumb as we feared. With Dion off the board, there just aren't any free agents left to worry about the Sixers overpaying. Well, J.R. Smith technically, but the chances of him leaving Cleveland for Philadelphia under any circumstances are even worse than him being the starting two-guard on a championship team to begin with. (And technically of technicalliest, LeBron James too, but we could give him all our remaining cap space and half the Liberty Bell to boot and he'd still be dramatically underpaid.)
Anyway, point is: We've worried since the Colangelo clan took over that they would make one dramatically dumb move to hamstring this team in the name of Winning Now-ish, and it would look silly in the short term and be absolutely befuddling in the long-term. The Sixers have even been attached to a couple such deals in reports from NBA experts, deals that had them offering Nerlens Noel and further bounty for the No. 5 pick, or offering absurd free-agent dollars to Jamal Crawford, or being in the mix for ol' DW. Maybe there was truth to some or all of it, but the more rumored deals that sizzle-then-fizzle, the less likely it seems that any of them were ever actually going to come to fruition.
Dion may represent the smoking gun. Here's a player, that as final evidence would suggest, the Sixers could have had virtually uncontested at any point this offseason ‚Äî a player that ended up signing a two-year make-good deal for what essentially amounts to the veteran's minimum. Forget four years, $80 million, the Sixers could've offered eight mil for one and Dion probably woulda lunged at the opportunity. (Sure, there are market benefits that might've given Miami a competitive edge, but South Beach ain't what it used to be: With Dwyane Wade gone to Chicago and Chris Bosh unsure to ever even play again, the Heat are only predicted by ESPN to finish two spots ahead of Philly in the East next season.) There's really no conclusion to be reached except that the Sixers were never actually that interested in signing Waiters in the first place.
So, offseason crisis averted, time to rest easy as we count the days to most exciting Sixers training camp in franchise history? Perhaps, but there is still one shoe left to drop: The Sixers are all but pot-committed to trading one of Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor before the season proper finally tips off. It's mostly encouraging that the Colangelos have waited this long; they said that they weren't going to jump at an early deal that wasn't the right deal, and so far their patience has borne their words out. But as the summer begins to peter out and teams begin talking themselves into the roster they already have ‚Äî while urgency increases for Philly to make a deal before their opening-night lineup is bottlenecked with blue-chip bigs ‚Äî a desperation trade certainly isn't out of the question just yet.
Still, after a month of respectable draft choices, measured free-agent signings, and zero totally thoughtless panic moves (even if they tried unsuccessfully to make one or two) it's getting on time to start giving the Sixers' new front office the benefit of the doubt. It'll never feel quite as safe as we did with Our Once and Future Dark Lord ‚Äî and the overflow of assets Hinkie equipped Jerry and Bryan with will be all the body armor they really need anyway ‚Äî but we need no longer fear for our lives with every passing Woj Bomb, and we just might be able to root for the Sons of Sam next year without being constantly interrupted by pangs of crippling regret. Not having to watch Dion Waiters jump and shout for the ball so he can jack a contested 20-foot fadeaway is a pretty good start.
Steve Carell sent ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù fans into a frenzy on Wednesday when he tweeted that the show was being rebooted. While the NBC sitcom ‚Äî which ended in 2013 ‚Äî is not, in fact, returning to NBC, it seems some former cast members are open to the idea.
Speaking to the International Business Time last week about hosting Spike's new musical game show ‚ÄúCaraoke Showdown,‚Äù Craig Robinson, who played Dunder Miflin's Darryl Philbin, revealed that he and his former co-stars are occasionally in touch. In fact, he said ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù stars Rainn Wilson and Creed Bratton recently hosted an event that brought him, Kate Flannery and Angela Kinsey together.
‚ÄúCreed and Rain just put on a benefit so Angela came through, I was there. Kate was there, who played Meredith, so a few of us got together for that,‚Äù Robinson said. ‚ÄúYou know, every once in awhile there will be an email chain. So once in awhile we keep in touch. Not that often, but if people are available we come running.‚Äù

Prior to the release of Carell's tweet, Robinson assured IBT that no ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù reboot was being planned by NBC or otherwise, but said there was no doubt he'd be interested in appearing in one.
‚ÄúAnything to do with ‚ÄòThe Office' I would revisit,‚Äù he said.
Rumors regarding the potential return of ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù began circulating after a confusing tweet from Carell. The actor shared a message with his 4.96 million Twitter followers that the show, on which he played severely misguided boss Michael Scott, had been picked up by NBC again. He corrected himself moments later telling followers it was merely a ‚Äútypo.‚Äù
Carell's revival joke popped up shortly after it was announced that NBC executives had ordered up a 10-episode revival of ‚ÄúWill & Grace.‚Äù The original core cast of the show, which went off the air in 2006, as well as creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan and director James Burrows will be working on the revival. It's not clear what the premise of the show will be nor when it will premiere, but that hasn't stopped fans from speculating.

Danone, a food company most famous for its yogurt, is investing up to $60 million in a plant-based beverage facility in Mount Crawford, Virginia.
Earlier this year, Danone (known as Dannon in the U.S.) acquired WhiteWave Foods for nearly $12.5 billion . Now the company plans to invest in WhiteWave's manufacturing facility in Virginia, expanding the warehouse, increasing production capacity, and creating 49 new jobs. Now operating as DanoneWave, the company has several plant-based brands, including Silk So Delicious , and Vega
Danone knows that the future is vegan. In its efforts to purchase WhiteWave Foods quickly, the corporation dropped its animal-based dairy company Stonyfield to eliminate unfair competition with WhiteWave's plant-based brands.
DanoneWave isn't the only company investing in vegan alternatives. Just recently, Campbell's decided to join the Plant Based Foods Association , a vegan lobbying group. Additionally, Unilever invested in a study on plant-based meats earlier this year, and the corporation owns Ben & Jerry's, which has launched vegan versions of its popular ice cream flavors.
Similarly, Tyson invested in the plant-based company Beyond Meat and launched a $150 million venture capital fund to invest in startups that develop meat substitutes. In fact, Tyson CEO Tom Hayes stated in an interview that ‚Äúplant-based protein is growing almost, at this point, a little faster than animal-based," so he thinks "the migration may continue in that direction.‚Äù
As even more proof of a vegan future, this year Canadian meatpacking company Maple Leaf Foods announced that it would buy U.S.-based vegan protein producer Lightlife Foods
DanoneWave's investment in vegan dairy alternatives is not only a smart business move; it is great news for the cows who suffer horribly in the dairy industry.

I've been seeing a lot of misinformation flying around the web lately about the zfs dataset-level feature copies=n. To be clear, dangerous misinformation. So dangerous, I'm going to go ahead and give you the punchline in the title of this post and in its first paragraph: copies=n does not give you device fault tolerance!
Why does copies=n actually exist then? Well, it's a sort of (extremely) poor cousin that helps give you a better chance of surviving data corruption. Let's say you have a laptop, you've set copies=3 on some extremely critical work-related datasets, and the drive goes absolutely bonkers and starts throwing tens of thousands of checksum errors. Since there's only one disk in the laptop, ZFS can't correct the checksum errors, only detect them‚Ä¶ except on that critical dataset, maybe and hopefully, because each block has multiple copies. So if a given block has been written three times and any single copy of that block reads so as to match its validation hash, that block will get served up to you intact.
So far, so good. The problem is that I am seeing people advocating scenarios like ‚Äúoh, I'll just add five disks as single-disk vdevs to a pool, then make sure to set copies=2, and that way even if I lose a disk I still have all the data.‚Äù No, no, and no. But don't take my word for it: let's demonstrate.
First, let's set up a test pool using virtual disks.
root@banshee:/tmp# qemu-img create -f qcow2 0.qcow2 10G ; qemu-img create -f qcow2 1.qcow2 10G Formatting '0.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=10737418240 encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off Formatting '1.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=10737418240 encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off root@banshee:/tmp# qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 /tmp/0.qcow2 ; qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd1 /tmp/1.qcow2 root@banshee:/tmp# zpool create test /dev/nbd0 /dev/nbd1 root@banshee:/tmp# zpool status test pool: test state: ONLINE scan: none requested config: NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM test ONLINE 0 0 0 nbd0 ONLINE 0 0 0 nbd1 ONLINE 0 0 0 errors: No known data errors
Now let's set copies=2, and then create a couple of files in our pool.
root@banshee:/tmp# zfs set copies=2 test root@banshee:/tmp# dd if=/dev/urandom bs=4M count=1 of=/test/test1 1+0 records in 1+0 records out 4194304 bytes (4.2 MB) copied, 0.310805 s, 13.5 MB/s root@banshee:/tmp# dd if=/dev/urandom bs=4M count=1 of=/test/test2 1+0 records in 1+0 records out 4194304 bytes (4.2 MB) copied, 0.285544 s, 14.7 MB/s
Let's confirm that copies=2 is working.
We should see about 8MB of data on each of our virtual disks ‚Äì one for each copy of each of our 4MB test files.
root@banshee:/tmp# ls -lh *.qcow2 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9.7M May 2 13:56 0.qcow2 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9.8M May 2 13:56 1.qcow2
Yep, we're good ‚Äì we've written a copy of each of our two 4MB files to each virtual disk.
Now fail out a disk:
root@banshee:/tmp# zpool export test root@banshee:/tmp# qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd1 /dev/nbd1 disconnected
Will a pool with copies=2 and one missing disk import?
root@banshee:/tmp# zpool import pool: test id: 15144803977964153230 state: UNAVAIL status: One or more devices are missing from the system. action: The pool cannot be imported. Attach the missing devices and try again. see: http://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-6X config: test UNAVAIL missing device nbd0 ONLINE Additional devices are known to be part of this pool, though their exact configuration cannot be determined.
That's a resounding ‚Äúno‚Äù.
Can we force an import?
root@banshee:/tmp# zpool import -f test cannot import 'test': one or more devices is currently unavailable
No ‚Äì your data is gone.
Please let this be a lesson: no, copies=n is not a substitute for redundancy or parity, and yes, losing any vdev does lose the pool.
On the south side of Chicago, in one of the city's most dangerous neighborhoods, brazen criminals occasionally hit the gangster's jackpot: they loot freight containers carrying shiny, new guns.
The guns ‚Äì boxes and boxes of them ‚Äì are part of shipments that are destined for gun companies or gun shops across the country. But as gangsters have caught on to the practice, they are ransacking these trains and stealing weapons that eventually make their way to the city's blood-soaked streets.
"Any time you have individuals who can go in and steal guns from a train, that makes the environment very toxic," said Pastor Cory Brooks, who leads a church around the corner from the freight yard.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said that since 2013, more than 150 firearms have been reported stolen from freight trains. An Associated Press investigation revealed that some were traced to violent crimes and only 16 were recovered.
CHICAGO RECORDS 762 HOMICIDES IN 2016, UP 57 PERCENT FROM PREVIOUS YEAR
In a city already reeling from one of the most violent crime waves in years, where tens of thousands of firearms are recovered from the streets every year, 150 stolen guns might not seem like a big deal. But one single gun can be linked to at least 14 fatal shootings, according to the ATF.
"How in the world are these kids getting these guns? I see them on Facebook. Everybody got guns. They can't go purchase a gun, so where are they getting them from?" said city alderwoman Emma Mitts of the 37th Ward.
In one instance, thieves stole more than 100 new Ruger handguns described as "pretty" in comparison to the shoddy, makeshift guns criminals in Chicago's rough streets often use.
Brooks and Mitts both partially blame Norfolk Southern, the rail yard, saying it could easily beef up security to protect the sitting freight on its tracks. They said the company needs to do something before the weapons get in the hands of more dangerous criminals.
"We need to be concerned about terrorists who could get into these areas unprotected here and steal things and explosives and really hurt our communities," Brooks said.
Norfolk Southern told Fox News that it's fully liable for any stolen property. The company said it takes the issue seriously, working with all law levels of law enforcement and recently increasing security around its tracks.
POLITICS OF POLICING MAKING CHICAGO CRIME WAVE WORSE?
"While we can't discuss the specifics of the ongoing investigations, we are taking significant steps to evaluate and adapt our security protocols, prevent criminal trespass and address community concerns," Norfolk Southern spokeswoman Susan Terpay wrote in an email.
While working on this story, Fox News noticed a very responsive presence of security near the train yard.
"Norfolk Southern's Chicago-based police department, the largest freight railroad law enforcement force in the city, is increasing patrols of rail yards using uniformed officers in marked cars and K-9 units,‚Äù Terpay wrote. ‚ÄúIn addition, the department is conducting undercover surveillance investigations."
The company is hoping that beefed-up security at the rail yard would appease neighbors trying to keep guns out criminal hands in one of America's deadliest communities.
"It only compounds that damage being done to our city,‚Äù Brooks said, ‚Äúand it only hurts the individuals who are trying to live here and have a safe environment."
‚ÄúTime to Pretend‚Äù
MGMT was formed by Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden in 2001. The song ‚ÄúTime to Pretend‚Äù was one they wrote early in their career. It first came out on their debut: the Time to Pretend EP in 2005. And three years after that, they put out a new version of the song, on their first full-length album, Oracular Spectactular, which was named album of the year by NME and was one of Rolling Stone's top 20 albums of the decade. It went on to sell over a million copies worldwide. In this episode, Ben and Andrew trace how the song ‚ÄúTime to Pretend‚Äù was made, from its dorm room origins, to its first recording, to re-envisioning it with Grammy-winning producer Dave Fridmann. They also uncover the hidden sounds and Easter eggs within the recording.
MGMT is giving away an exclusive white label pressing of the Time to Pretend EP on vinyl, signed by the band. If you'd like to enter to win the record, all you have to do is share a link to this episode, and tag MGMT and Song Exploder in your post. On Twitter and Instagram, their handle is @whoismgmt, and Song Exploder is just @songexploder. A winner will be announced on January 31 on Song Exploder's Twitter.
You can buy ‚ÄúTime to Pretend,‚Äù from Oracular Spectacular on iTunes. You can also get the EP version of the song.
Push the Sky Away is the 15th official album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, but it could almost be their first. After 30 years together, the band has effectively come full circle, having completed its evolution from untamed beast to rock dignitary and, via the fearsome alter-ego offshoot Grinderman, back again. Factor in the recent resignation of Mick Harvey (Cave's right hand man since their Boys Next Door days in the late 1970s), and the sudden deep-sixing of Grinderman (as a recording entity, at least), and the Bad Seeds' reliably black essence now more closely resembles a blank canvas.
Push the Sky Away scans as the Bad Seeds' post-Grinderman comedown album, to be filed alongside statelier turns like 1997's The Boatman's Call and 2001's No More Shall We Part. But where the Bad Seeds' mellow records usually find Cave in pensive, piano-man mode, Push the Sky Away presents an uncharacteristically weightless, eerily atmospheric sound; in lieu of crossover ballads like "Into My Arms" and "People Ain't No Good", we have foggy reveries built upon ominously rumbling bass lines, twitchy rhythmic tics, and hushed-voice intimations. It may not erupt with same force as the Bad Seeds' stormiest gestures, but the underlying menace fuelling it remains.
The approach bears the influence of Grinderman as much as the Bad Seeds' decidedly more raucous 2008 release, Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!. Though Grinderman was often seen as the Bad Seeds' wild child offspring, it was also a vehicle through which Cave and his increasingly prominent foil, Warren Ellis, could experiment with textures and loops (to the point of spawning a remix album). These production intricacies form the bedrock of Push the Sky Away, which is less a showcase for Bad Seeds' powerhouse prowess than a reconstructed fever-dream memory of it, transmuting the familiar into something foreign. There's a sense of the Bad Seeds expanding their sound and unlearning it at the same time. (Drummer Jim Sclavunos wins the Take One for the Team Award here, tempering his usual thunderous thrust for stragetically timed snare-rim taps and brushed-skin driftiness.)
The freer, more exploratory bent extends to Cave's lyric sheet. True to the album's desolate, dead-of-night air, his songs are less narratively focussed, more stream-of-consciousness haze, countering Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!'s gritty urban milieu with impressionistic images of mermaids and the sea that reinforce the sense of a mind floating away. Tellingly, Cave has said his writing for the album was inspired by "Googling curiosities," and his lyrical logic follows the same circuitous path as an extended, after-hours web-surfing session, bouncing between subjects profound and frivolous, indulging life-long obsessions and newfound, fleeting fascinations. Bad Seeds albums used to inspire you to reacquaint yourself with folk tales and the Old Testament; this one will have you brushing up on quantum physics, astronomy, and "Hannah Montana".
That last bit shouldn't come as a surprise: Over the past decade, Cave has shown a greater eagerness to interact with contemporary pop culture, from the Oprah shout-out on Grinderman's "Kitchenette" to the comically perverse Avril Lavigne fixation that formed a subplot in his 2009 novel, The Death of Bunny Munro. But where This namedrops have felt like humourous incongruities in Cave's fire-and-brimstone universe, Push the Sky Away straight-facedly acknowledges how modern phenomena like Wikipedia and Miley Cyrus hold as much sway over the populace as the Bible and Robert Johnson once did, while translating brooding ballads into text-speak and slang ("We No Who U R"). And where more recent Bad Seeds standouts like Abattoir Blues' "There She Goes, My Beautiful World" and Lazarus' "We Call Upon the Author" saw Cave writing songs about writing songs, Push the Sky Away goes one meta: The album's most elaborate track, "Jubilee Street", is answered by "Finishing Jubilee Street", a spartan, spoken-word account of a dream Cave had just after he completed work on the former.
For all the album's wandering spirit, the first eight tracks on Push the Sky Away are neatly structured into two complementary, four-song halves that mirror one another: each comes outfitted with an ominous opening salvo ("We No Who U R", "Mermaids"), an icy glare that thaws into an open-hearted address ("Wide Lovely Eyes", "We Real Cool"), and a scenery-chewing set piece ("Water's Edge", "Finishing Jubilee Street") that hearkens back to early Bad Seeds storytelling turns like "The Carny". (Fittingly, original bassist Barry Adamson rejoined the band following the album's recording.) The simmering tension of each side is eventually unleashed through a slow-boiling, show-stopping epic. The aforementioned "Jubilee Street" is built upon a repeated "Hey Joe"-like chord progression that, thanks to Ellis' mesmerizing violin lines, grows more grandiose with each passing cycle, reaching such dizzying heights that you almost forget you're listening to a song about a murdered prostitute. But even that pales in comparison to side two's colossal "Higgs Boson Blues", which begins as a solitary 3 a.m. strum in the vein of Neil Young's "On the Beach" but, over seven writhing minutes, ends up traversing the entirety of modern history, from "the missionary with his small pox and flu" to the birth of the Devil's music to the anticipated death of a certain teen-pop starlet who "floats in a swimming pool."
"Higgs Boson Blues" is named for the elementary particle whose discovery last year was hailed as the most significant breakthrough in contemporary physics, one that essentially provides the missing piece in explaining the structure of our entire universe. But its discovery after 50 years of intense research has also led to something of an existential crisis among physicists, who are now left with no theory to prove, and asking themselves, "What now?" One can imagine Nick Cave asking himself the same question as he entered his fourth decade fronting a deviant rock band that had seemingly mined every last shade of noir. But in this album's quietly defiant title-track denouement, he finds a renewed mission statement: "If you got everything and you don't want any more/ You've got to just keep on pushing, keep on pushing/ Push the sky away." Because when you can't see the sky, you can't see your limits.

Over the past few years, online comedians have become increasingly popular in Saudi Arabia, where younger generations are turning away from TV shows in favour of the self-produced skits that have been popping up all over YouTube. These videos have emerged a small bastion of freedom in the conservative kingdom.
Though the comedians are generally inexperienced, some web series have become so popular that they've surpassed 10 million views per episode. They broach everyday problems using a very sarcastic tone, but they also touch on big issues like unemployment, the housing crisis, racism, sexism and sometimes ever censorship.
‚ÄúThese YouTube channels act as sort of pressure valves,‚Äù explains Mohammed Al-Saeedi, one of our Observers in the Saudi kingdom. ‚ÄúIt's a place where people can vent their frustrations, so that they don't boil over. That's why the authorities have allowed them to continue, and in fact sometimes even encourage the comedians.‚Äù Still, there are lines that comedians must not cross, says Al-Saeedi: ‚Äúthe royal family, religion and sex remain taboo subjects.‚Äù
Omar Hussein is one of the most popular online comedians in Saudi Arabia. He is also one of the bravest ‚Äì he notably participated in anti-racism campaigns and supported the movement to lift the ban on women driving . His show, @3al6ayer , is a veritable YouTube phenomenon that has garnered more than 60 million views since its creation in 2010.
Even in his earliest shows, Hussein has been testing the Saudi authorities' limits, as shown by this excerpt below.

The comedian is also not afraid of poking fun at politicians.
However, these performances come at a risk. Imams have repeatedly criticised the comedian, and in July 2012, he was arrested while shooting a video with his friends, supposedly because he lacked authorisation.

When the voters of Colorado decided to legalize use of marijuana, pot became legal statewide. When voters in the state of Washington decided to legalize use of marijuana, pot became legal there, too. And this year, voters in Washington, D.C., went to the polls and overwhelmingly agreed to legalize up to 2 ounces of marijuana for adult, recreational use.
The difference is, unlike every state, the people of the District of Columbia have to worry whether Congress will allow these Americans ‚Äì who pay federal taxes but have no voice in federal lawmaking ‚Äì to approve their own policies.
In theory, this shouldn't be too big a problem. After all, congressional Democrats don't care if D.C. voters voted to legalize small amounts of pot, and congressional Republicans claim to believe in a small federal government that emphasizes local control.
But the funny thing about Republican principles is just how malleable they can be. The Washington Post reported overnight:
The District will be prohibited from legalizing marijuana for the much of the coming year under a spending deal reached Tuesday‚Ä¶. The development ‚Äì upending voter-approved Initiative 71 ‚Äì shocked elected D.C. leaders, advocates for marijuana legalization and civil liberties groups who earlier in the day had grown confident that the measure would be at least partially protected while Democrats still controlled the Senate. However, with Republicans set to take control of the chamber in January, the defeat suggested that the will of D.C. voters ‚Äì who approved marijuana legalization last month by a margin of more than 2 to 1 ‚Äì may be suspended indefinitely.
To be sure, Senate Democrats tried to push back against the change, but House Republicans were insistent ‚Äì and with a deadline looming, Dems didn't see this as an issue worthy of a shutdown.
So, at the demand of far-right Republicans, the big federal government will crush the popular will of local voters, simply because conservative lawmakers feel like it.
Indeed, D.C. is now left in a very awkward policy position, forced on the city by a Congress in which voters have no voice.
Specifically, the provision in the spending bill doesn't undo local voters' decision, but rather, it prevents any resources ‚Äì federal or local funds ‚Äì from being used to implement the voter-approved law. As German Lopez explained
At first glance, this might seem like a weird approach. DC's legalization initiative costs nothing; it actually saves the district money to not enforce laws against marijuana possession. The ballot measure actually couldn't cost money in the first place, since DC ballot initiatives, by law, can't have a direct impact on the local budget. But the budget bill would prohibit DC Council from spending its time and resources to approve the legalization initiative and send it to Congress. Under federal law, that's a necessary step for legalization to take effect.
U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN) speaks to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, March 16, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Representative Michele Bachmann is being probed by the Office of Congressional Ethics for allegedly misusing campaign funds, media reports said on Monday.
Bachmann, a Tea Party-backed conservative congresswoman from Minnesota was among a large field of Republicans who ran unsuccessfully for their party's presidential nomination before last year's election.
She is being investigated over alleged violations of campaign finance rules, according to the Daily Beast, which first reported the story, citing a former Bachmann campaign staffer.
‚ÄúThere are no allegations that the congresswoman engaged in any wrongdoing,‚Äù William McGinley, a lawyer representing the Minnesota Republican, said in an emailed statement.
‚ÄúWe are constructively engaged with the OCE and are confident that at the end of their review the OCE Board will conclude that congresswoman Bachmann did not do anything inappropriate,‚Äù the statement said.
The Office of Congressional Ethics is an independent, non-partisan body that reviews allegations of misconduct against staff and members of the House of Representatives.
By surprising markets and slashing the one-year lending rate by 31 basis points to 6 percent and the deposit rates by 25 basis points to 3 percent, Beijing is signaling that it is getting serious about bolstering the economy by lowering borrowing costs for businesses and lifting private-sector investment, economists tell CNBC.
‚ÄúThe timing is earlier than expected, even if we already penciled-in one more cut in the third quarter. This may foreshadow worse than expected growth numbers that are due to release next week,‚Äù HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Sun Junwei wrote in a report on Thursday.
China is due to release closely-watched indicators, including inflation and trade figures for June and second-quarter GDP growth, which economists say may show that the Chinese economy is slowing faster than the government would like. Beijing is targeting a growth rate of 7.5 percent for the economy for 2012.
‚ÄúThe indication is that the data coming out next week will probably be on the weak side,‚Äù Zhiwei Zhang, Chief China Economist of Nomura told CNBC Asia's ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù.‚ÄúThis is a much stronger signal than a triple-r cut and this indicates urgency on the very senior level of the government certainly becoming stronger, and that the government is becoming less tolerant of a growth slowdown.‚Äù
The Chinese economy may expand 7.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, its sixth straight quarter of slowing growth and its weakest performance since the 2008-09 financial crisis, according to a poll by Reuters Thursday, ahead of the rate move.
If the economy continued to weaken and there is indication that the Chinese government could miss its official target, there will certainly be more stimulus measures, Zhang said. He expects the People's Bank of China to make at least one more cut of 50 basis points to the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), currently at 20 percent, in July.
China has lowered the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve in three 50-basis point steps since November, freeing up an estimated 1.2 trillion yuan ($190 billion) for fresh lending. The last cut was in May.
Similarly, economists at Barclays said some policymakers ‚Äúmay have underestimated the weakness of sentiment and economic activities‚Äù in the first half of the year and that there will be two more RRR reductions in the second half, one in July and another in October.
While boosting domestic lending is a ‚Äúpositive move‚Äù, the move on its own may not be enough to boost sluggish growth in China as foreign demand for Chinese goods remains ‚Äúweak‚Äù, said Charles Dallara, Managing Director of Institute of International Finance.
‚ÄúIf you step back and think about it, just a little over two years ago, in 2009, it was not surprising at all to see Chinese exports growing at a 30-plus percent clip,‚Äù Dallara told CNBC. ‚ÄúNow you see the value of their exports averaging, in the first part of the year so far, below 10 percent. Clearly, the global environment is weakening and I am afraid we are getting negative synergies among the major economic zones of the world right now.‚Äù
Governments all over the world need to do more to prop up the global economy, Dallara said, such as solving the sovereign crisis in Europe, the ‚Äúfiscal cliff‚Äùin the U.S.

Within hours, Timothy Caughman, a black man from Queens, stumbled to a midtown police station bleeding. He had been stabbed , ultimately fatally, with a 26-inch sword. "What are you doing?" Caughman had asked his assailant.
James Harris Jackson gave police officers his answer : He hates black men and has since his youth. His plan was to kill more people than Caughman. He considered taking an officers' gun and shooting more black men.
The tragic killing of Timothy Caughman is a heinous hate crime. It is also an act of domestic terrorism. And it matters that we begin to name white supremacist murders in this way.
His crime bears eerie similarity to that of Dylann Roof , who committed mass murder in Emanuel AME Church in April 2015. Like Roof, Jackson chose the location for his alleged crime to heighten the public significance of his act. New York, Jackson told police, was ideal because it is the "media capital" of the country. Roof, who lived in North Carolina, chose Emanuel Baptist in Charleston, South Carolina, after he learned about the historic significance of the church. Jackson claims to have left a manifesto, like Roof, on his computer, which he says will "explain" his actions.
Crimes like these certainly seem to be acts of terrorism, but our federal terrorism law doesn't account for prosecution of true homegrown terrorism, that which comes from Americans, against Americans, and without foreign influence.
Of course, Dylann Roof was convicted of murder and is the first federal hate crime defendant sentenced to death in federal court, although many family members of his victims opposed the death penalty. And James Jackson has been charged with second-degree murder in New York and faces decades in prison. The District Attorney's Office has indicated it is considering classifying Jackson's alleged acts as terrorism under state law, which would make him eligible to be charged with first-degree murder, carrying the possibility of life in prison.
The terrorism designation is significant, not only because of the possible sentence. Even if he is convicted of second-degree murder, Jackson will be imprisoned for a very long time. The designation is significant because it properly recognizes the way in which African-American and other minority communities can be victims of white supremacist terrorism within the United States.
This failure to establish a federal penalty for domestic terrorism has historical roots as well.
Lynching -- the indiscriminate killing of (mostly) black people in the American South during the late 19th and 20th centuries by hanging, burning, dragging, drowning and shooting -- unleashed a wave of terror in African-American communities. The randomness and brutality of the violence was central to the way in which it spread terror. Black victims were lynched for any reason at all: failing to tip one's hat, insisting on repayment of a debt, false charges of rape or murder, and even being too prosperous.
The public nature of the crime was also deliberate. Lynchings were "message" crimes, designed not just to harm the individual but also to let all African-Americans in the community that they were not full citizens. Thus lynching, as with all forms of terrorism, differs from other violent crimes in that it is designed to intimidate particular groups and to use fear to make citizens complicit in limiting their own freedoms.
Throughout the first half of the 20th century, civil rights activists fought to pass a federal anti-lynching law. Those efforts were unsuccessful, a shameful history for which the United States Senate apologized in 2006 . State law enforcement and prosecutors almost never arrested or prosecuted lynchers -- certainly not for murder -- and thus the impunity with which perpetrators could commit these crimes became part of the terror as well.

Understanding the ideological forces that promote violent extremism is essential to developing strategies to prevent future killers from carrying out their plans. In addition, properly designating white supremacist acts of terror could provide the proper law enforcement lens from which to investigate these cases.
Most of all, designating these crimes as terrorism sends a message to vulnerable communities that their fears are understood, and that violent white supremacy is recognized as a threat to American security as well as to individual victims.
US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a campaign stop in Long Beach, California. Thomson Reuters The campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released a statement on Sunday slamming her Republican rival Donald Trump for his response to the Orlando, Florida, massacre.
Trump reacted to the shooting, in which a gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, by criticizing Clinton and President Barack Obama for what he sees as a weak response to terrorism.
Clinton campaign representative Jennifer Palmieri hit back by implying that Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, wasn't providing a serious response to the attacks.
"This act of terror is the largest mass shooting in American history and a tragedy that requires a serious response," Palmieri said in a statement to Business Insider. "Hillary Clinton has a comprehensive plan to combat ISIS at home and abroad and will be talking to the American people in the coming days about steps she would take to keep the country safe."
She continued: "In contrast, Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes, and self-congratulations."
This is most likely a reference to a tweet by Trump about people congratulating him for "being right" about "radical Islamic terror."
"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!" Trump wrote.
Palmieri said Americans deserve better.
"Trump has offered no real plans to keep our nation safe and no outreach to the Americans targeted, just insults and attacks," Palmieri said in the statement. "In times of crisis more than ever, Americans are looking for leadership and deserve better."
A year ago at SIHH in Geneva I had the luxury of introducing the Panerai PAM616 Suberisble Carbotech which was met with a lot of fans fair within the Panerai community. Today, Officine Panerai released the PAM661 Luminor Marina Carbotech 44mm, which is part of their P.9010 series of watches.
The PAM661 is the first ever Luminor Marina that has been created with the Carbotech composite material. The composite is made up of very fine leaves of carbon fiber that are pressed together at a controlled temperature under high pressure with a polymer known as PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone) which binds it all together making it even stronger.
The dial of the new Luminor Marina Carbotech 3 Days Automatic is black in color and features a painted ecru (patina lume) markers and inscriptions. Instead of the normal batons you see on the Luminors, the PAM661 features small dots that you normally see in Submersible models. To add a bit of contrast to the dial Panerai went with a blue sub second dial hand. The regular hands are done in gold which compliment the lume very nicely on the dial. They finish off the watch with the brown Ponte Vecchio leather strap.
The heart of this piece is the new P.9010 movement which is a 3 Day automatic calibre that was recently created and is thinner than the P.9000 movement that was previously used in these 1950's cases models. The automatic P.9010 entirely developed in the Panerai Manufacture in Neuch√¢tel, consists of 200 components and 31 jewels. The balance, fixed by a bridge with twin supports, oscillates at a frequency of 28,800 vibrations per hour. It is associated with the device which tops it as soon as the winding crown is pulled out, enabling the watch to be perfectly synchronized with a reference signal.
I think that Officine Panerai really heard the clamoring from a lot of Panerai fans to use the Carbotech material in something a bit smaller. I think they did a great job with the 44mm Luminor case in this material. I have a feeling it's going to be a hot seller given the price point and size of the watch. This gives the clients a new option other than PVD and Ceramic if they are in the market for a black watch in the Panerai lineup. The Carbotech material gives the watch a very nice subtle texture you don't find with the other two materials.
The only thing I would have personally changed would have been to use the batons instead of the small circles as indicators, but at the end of the day that's just my preference.
There is now timetable on the release date for the Luminor Marina Carbotech but the price is set to be $11,800 USD.

Workers are looking to overturn Mayor Nutter's ruling on a bill that would require employers to pay for sick leave. NBC10's Daralene Jones has the story. (Published Thursday, April 4, 2013)
Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter has struck down the City Council's earned sick time bill.
The controversial "Promoting Healthy Families and Workplaces‚Äù ordinance called for workers to earn paid sick leave passed in March. The measure wouldn't have affected companies with five or fewer employees but employers with six to 19 workers would have had to offer up to four paid sick days a year and up to seven days for larger employers.
Nutter vetoed the bill claiming, in a letter dated April 3 that was obtained by NBC10's Daralene Jones, that the measure ‚Äúwould harm our ability to attract new businesses."
In a press release, bill sponsor Councilman At-Large Bill Greenlee called the veto a "disappointment" for approximately 180,000 workers -- many of them earning modest wages -- that would have benefited from enforced paid sick leave.
‚ÄúThis Administration claims to be about fairness for the little people and good public health for all. The smoking ban it instituted to protect workers and the public is a great example of that. Allowing workers to take care of themselves or a sick child without losing the ability to pay rent is also consistent with the Administration's stated goals," he said.
Nutter has long opposed imposing paid sick leave on employers. Back in 2011, he also shot down a similar measure that would have required businesses with five or more employees to provide paid sick days. That measure never got to the 12 votes need to override the veto.
To override Nutter's veto, Greenlee must now get one of the six council members who voted against the bill to change sides on the issue. The councilman seems up for the fight.
‚ÄúI am confident that by this time next week, workplace rules will become a little fairer for 180,000 hard-working Philadelphians and their families,‚Äù Greenlee said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin defended Moscow's annexation of Crimea on December 4 by invoking Kievan Rus leader Vladimir the Great, who is said to have been baptized on the peninsula in the 10th century and converted the medieval Slavic state to Orthodox Christianity.
Ukrainians, however, could deploy the same logic to justify Crimea's inclusion in the modern Ukrainian state, historians and religious experts say.
‚ÄúFrom the Ukrainian perspective, Crimea is more relevant to Kyiv because Volodymyr was the ruler of Kyiv,‚Äù said Cyril Hovorun, a former senior spokesman for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate, using the Ukrainian rendition of the sovereign's name.
This interpretive impasse is among several competing historical, religious, ethnic and political claims to Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that was home to Greek colonies some 2,500 years ago and controlled by various kingdoms and empires until Russia annexed it from the Ottoman Empire in 1783.
According to legend, in 988 Vladimir the Great converted to Orthodox Christianity on the peninsula in the city of Khersones, also known as Korsun, near modern-day Sevastopol, after which he returned to Kyiv and ordered the baptism Kievan Rus.
In his December 4 state-of-the-nation speech, Putin compared the site of Vladimir the Great's baptism to holy sites for Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem.
"Crimea, ancient Korsun, Khersones, Sevastopol -- all of them bear an enormous civilizational and sacral meaning for Russia, just as the Temple Mount of Jerusalem does for those who profess Islam and Judaism," Putin said.
Given that the conversion of Kievan Rus established the Orthodox foundations for future Russian and Ukrainian states, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko could take the same message to his electorate, said Karl Qualls, a professor of Russian and modern European history at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.
‚ÄúIt's the same conversion, the same person and the same place,‚Äù Qualls told RFE/RL. ‚ÄúYou could see the Ukrainians standing up and saying, ‚ÄòWell, yeah, this is our Temple Mount, too.' ‚Ä¶ If Poroshenko said the same thing, it would resonate with Ukrainians as well.‚Äù
Tatars And Greeks
The Crimean Tatars also have a strong historical claim to the peninsula, with their ancestors having lived there as far back as the 13th century, Qualls noted.
The mainly Muslim Tatars administered their own khanate there in the 15th century and became an Ottoman vassal state until Crimea's annexation into the Russian empire by Catherine the Great in 1783.
‚ÄúI think the Tatars certainly have much more of a claim than Russians or Ukrainians, due to being the oldest settled population on that peninsula since the Greeks up and left,‚Äù Qualls said.
According to the 1897 census taken in the Russian Empire, Crimean Tatars constituted more than one-third of the population on the peninsula.
In May 1944, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ordered the deportation of the entire Crimean Tatar population to Central Asia and Siberia for alleged collaboration with the Nazis during World War II. (Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, transferred Crimea to from the Russian to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954.)
Crimean Tatars began returning to the peninsula in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and currently constitute around 13 percent of Crimea's 2 million population.
Crimean Tatar leaders have accused Moscow-backed authorities on the peninsula of targeting their community for criticizing Russia's annexation of Crimea in March.
After Russia seized the peninsula following Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster in February, Ukraine's parliament recognized the Crimean Tatars as ‚Äúboth Crimea's indigenous population and an official national minority.‚Äù
Qualls said the word ‚Äúindigenous‚Äù is a misnomer when describing any single population in Crimea.
‚ÄúThis territory was so overrun for thousands of years by different nomadic groups, that I don't think we can talk about an indigenous group,‚Äù he told RFE/RL.
Greeks, who constitute a tiny minority in Ukraine according to its most recent census in 2001, could make a solid argument for recognition as an indigenous people of Crimea given that Khersones, mentioned by Putin in his state-of-the-union speech, was an ancient Greek city-state, Qualls added.
‚ÄúI don't see Athens making claims on Crimea, although I think they could,‚Äù he said.
Arcane Reference
During a meeting with Russian historians last month, Putin made a similar reference to the Crimea's central importance to Russia as the site of Vladimir the Great's baptism.
Putin is employing religious themes to ‚Äúgive more legitimacy to the illegal annexation of Crimea, at least in the eyes of the Russians,‚Äù said Hovorun, research director at the Institute of Theological Studies at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.
Qualls said the religious motifs selected by Putin show that ‚Äúhe's a clever politician, whatever we think about his politics.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe knows how to use words for dramatic effect,‚Äù he said.
One poll conducted last year, however, suggests Putin's religious reference may be somewhat arcane for most Russians.
According to the poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation, just 25 percent of Russians surveyed were able to recall that the conversion of Kievan Rus to Christianity took place under Vladimir the Great.

The undercover worker allegedly reported the abuses to his supervisors and called a corporate hotline, but Mercy for Animals says there were no repercussions or changes to the way chickens were handled at the plant.
"The workers were dumping the chickens on top of each other, causing them to suffocate to death," Mercy For Animals spokesman Matt Rice said.
In September, the group Mercy For Animals sent an operative outfitted with a hidden camera to work at a Tyson poultry plant in Carthage, Mississippi. The resulting footage, released on Wednesday, purportedly caught workers "punching, throwing, beating, pushing, and otherwise tormenting frightened animals for fun." The activist group also claims workers were seen shocking and decapitating birds.
An animal rights group is pursuing criminal charges against Tyson Foods and six of the company's employees after undercover video footage from a Mississippi slaughterhouse allegedly showed workers punching and throwing chickens before killing the birds.

The undercover worker allegedly reported the abuses to his supervisors and called a corporate hotline, but Mercy for Animals says there were no repercussions or changes to the way chickens were handled at the plant.

Tyson Foods released a statement on Wednesday that said the company has been investigating the abuses since they received a complaint last week, and that two workers shown in the video have already been fired.
"We believe proper animal handling is an important moral and ethical obligation," the company said. "Everyone who works with live animals in our plants ‚Äî including the person who secretly shot this video ‚Äî is trained in proper animal handling and instructed to immediately report anything they believe is inappropriate."
Tyson also pointed out that authorities have not filed criminal charges against the company or its workers. Mississippi allows citizens to file criminal charges against other individuals, however, and Mercy for Animals has filed 33 animal cruelty charges in connection with its investigation. A judge will review the case for probable cause and decide whether to issue arrest warrants.
Mercy For Animals posted the video of the abuses, narrated by the actress Candice Bergen, on its website with a link to a petition calling on Tyson to change its animal protection practices.
This is the third sting operation by the group against Tyson since July, with at least one case resulting in criminal charges against the owners of a poultry farm, Rice said.
The larger point, according to Rice, is that chickens are the most widely-abused animal in the country and receive no protections from the federal Humane Methods for Slaughter Act despite accounting for about 95 percent of the animals killed for food in the US.
The activist group would like to see Tyson implement more humane slaughter methods. Specifically, they want a "controlled atmosphere system," in which the chickens arrive at a slaughterhouse and are put in a room with inert gases added to the air to put the birds to sleep before they are killed, removing the human aspect of subduing and killing the birds.

Rice speculated that workers become "desensitized" because of the speed and volume of killing the job requires. The facility in Carthage processes some 2.5 million chickens a week, he said. He likened the mentality of slaughterhouse workers to that of soldiers who are taught to hate the enemy so they can do their jobs.
"If you talk to the workers they will tell you they have to learn to hate the animals to go to work every single day," he said. "We'd like to eliminate need for workers to handle live birds at all, which would prevent them from maliciously torturing animals."
Tyson is the largest chicken supplier in the United States, providing poultry to a number of major national food chains, including McDonald's. Rice said that his group's previous undercover investigations have helped lead to corporate policy changes at Nestle and Walmart, and they hope Tyson will begin to consider changes next.

Jane* is a single mother with three children. She's lived in Birmingham, Alabama, for over a decade, and works hard to provide a stable home for her kids. Jane is a responsible provider and resident of her community; she is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit we just filed against the state of Alabama.
The recent passage of Alabama House Bill 56, seeks to punish people like Jane who are present in the state without documents. As Rep. Micky Hammon, one of the sponsors of H.B. 56, explained, the purpose of the bill is to "discourage illegal immigrants from coming to Alabama and prevent those that are already here from putting down roots." H.B. 56 invites police to racially profile people during traffic stops by authorizing immigration investigations on "reasonable suspicion" that someone is in the United States illegally. The law puts officers in the position of relying on stereotypes about what an "illegal immigrant" looks or sounds like.
Alabama's new law targets "illegal aliens," but the truth is that many Alabamians will be caught up in the consequences of its unconstitutional provisions. Jane is one such example. Jane is now cooperating with federal officials who are conducting a criminal investigation, and because of this, the Department of Homeland Security is aware that she is an undocumented immigrant. But because of her ongoing cooperation, the government has decided not to deport Jane. She is now in the process of applying for a visa so she can stay in the country lawfully. In Alabama, however, Jane is considered just another undocumented Latina immigrant. And with H.B. 56 in effect, Jane is fearful that she will be subject to detention and interrogation by Alabama law enforcement.
Jane is also nervous because under this law, allows schools to report students and their parents who are presumed to be "unlawfully present" to the federal government. Her fear that her children may not be able to enroll in school is so strong that she is contemplating home-schooling. And if forced to home-school, Jane would not be able to work and won't be able to support her family.
For these reasons and others, Jane has signed on as a plaintiff in our fight to challenge H.B. 56. Our class-action lawsuit, which was filed in federal district court today on behalf of civil rights, social justice, labor and faith-based organizations, as well as individuals who would be subject to civil rights violations, charges that Alabama's new law is not just unconstitutional, but that it also targets people who cannot prove their lawful status to the satisfaction of an Alabama police officer.
We are challenging Alabama's extreme law and every other Arizona-inspired anti-immigrant law to defend the rights of all Americans. And federal courts have blocked the most egregious provisions of these laws from taking effect in every state where legal challenges have been filed.
Our country was founded on sacred principles of equality and justice for all, and the ACLU will continue to work to ensure that these fundamental rights are protected and upheld.

Grand Old Party pooper
President Donald Trump's dance with the Democrats may not last. But Capitol Hill Republicans aren't confident he's going to close ranks with them, either.
They worry that Trump has relinquished his role as leader of the party, choosing to put the interests of his own political movement first, The New York Times reported. That could spell big trouble as the GOP looks to the 2018 midterm elections.
Trump has already shown a willingness to undermine incumbents who cross him.
Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been meeting with would-be primary challengers willing to side with Trump over establishment Republicans, and his patron ‚Äî Long Island megadonor Robert Mercer ‚Äî is prepared to spend millions of dollars to back them, Politico reported.
Republicans fear the intramural warfare could drain funds needed to take on the Democrats in the general elections and even imperil the GOP's 52-48 Senate majority, the report said.
The take-away: Junk bonds
Newsday's Dan Janison calls nonsense on the notion that their common New York pedigrees and language brought Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer together for last week's deal on the debt extension and Harvey aid.

Contrary to Schumer's post-mortem ‚Äî ‚ÄúWe're direct, blunt, don't mess around‚Äù ‚Äî New Yorkers can also, on all counts, be the opposite, Janison writes. Just like the rest of America.
Trump and 9/11
Trump will preside over his first 9/11 commemoration in office on Monday. The ceremonies will be solemn, but the anniversary will also be a reminder about Trump's controversial comments during the campaign about the nation's worst terrorist attack.
He has made unsubstantiated claims about what he did and saw on that day, particularly saying when talking about Muslims that ‚Äúthousands of people were cheering‚Äù in Jersey City, New Jersey, across from lower Manhattan as the World Trade Center towers collapsed.
Trump has also said he lost ‚Äúhundreds of friends‚Äù in the attack and that he helped clear rubble afterward.
Watching ‚Äòmonster' Irma
Trump said ‚Äúevery group is coordinating really well‚Äù in the response to Hurricane Irma and he wants to visit Florida soon, reports Newsday's Emily Ngo.
‚ÄúThe bad news is this is some big monster, but I think we're very well put,‚Äù Trump said.
On Saturday, opening a Cabinet meeting, Trump said he will see faster action in the wake of the giant storm on a tax overhaul. ‚ÄúI wanted a speedup anyway, but now we need it even more so,‚Äù he said. The president didn't elaborate to explain the linkage.
No pivot, no paws
Trump is the first president in almost 150 years ‚Äî since Andrew Johnson ‚Äî who doesn't have a pet in the White House, according to The Economist.
Every president since Theodore Roosevelt has had a dog. Are there none that could meet Trump's demands for loyalty?

Domestic and Multilateral Effects of Capital Controls in Emerging Markets
NBER Working Paper No. 20822
Issued in January 2015, Revised in August 2018
NBER Program(s):International Finance and Macroeconomics
Using a novel, high frequency dataset on capital control actions in 16 emerging market economies (EMEs) from 2001 to 2012, we provide new insights into the domestic and multilateral effects of capital controls. Increases in capital account openness reduce monetary policy autonomy and increase exchange rate stability, confirming the constraints of the monetary policy trilemma. Both gross in- and outflows rise, while the effect on net capital flows is ambiguous. Tighter capital inflow restrictions generated significant spillovers, especially in the post-2008 environment of abundant global liquidity. We also find evidence of a domestic policy response to foreign capital control changes in countries that are affected by these spillovers.

Best Atheism Books of the Decade
The first decade of the new millennium is nearing a close. ‚ÄúBest of the Decade‚Äù lists for music, movies, sports, and more are spreading like wildfire across the internet. It is time for my own contribution: the best atheism books of the decade.
Nonbelief claims one of the greatest success stories of the 20th century, having skyrocketed from 0.2% of world population in 1900 to 15.3% in 2000. And, contrary to believers' predictions, societies that secularized freely have become the most well-developed, wealthiest, most democratic, most free, most entrepreneurial, least corrupt, least violent, most peaceful, healthiest, happiest, most egalitarian, best educated, most charitable, and most environmentally compassionate societies in the entire world.
But nonbelief did not see major popular attention in the United States until a few atheistic books hit the bestseller lists: Sam Harris' The End of Faith (2004), Daniel Dennett's Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006), Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion (2006), and Christopher Hitchens' God is Not Great (2007).
These authors were dubbed the New Atheists, but the only thing new about them was that their books were selling. Nonbelievers have been saying many of the same things as the ‚ÄúNew Atheists‚Äù since the dawn of recorded history: from Greek philosopher Epicurus (b. 341 BCE) to Arab philosopher Al Ma'arri (b. 973) to Catholic priest Jean Meslier (b. 1664) to political leader Robert Ingersoll (b. 1833) to the world's greatest living intellectual Noam Chomsky (b. 1928).
I mention the New Atheists because you will not find their books listed here. This is a list of the best atheism books of the decade, not the most popular ones.
So, without further ado‚Ä¶
Former preacher John W. Loftus, who studied under the #1 Christian apologist in the world, William Lane Craig, explains how he lost his faith and why evangelical Christianity is false. American Christians who are sick of Dawkins & company misunderstanding their faith at every turn will be glad to finally read an atheist who thoroughly understands the Christianity they live and believe. Christian apologist Norman Geisler has recommended the book to his students, and Christian philosopher Mark Linville writes that ‚ÄúEvangelicals cannot afford to ignore Why I Became an Atheist.‚Äù This is an atheist book written directly to Christians which has been highly recommended from both sides of the fence. The new edition was just released in October 2009.

Nearly all theistic arguments claim that God is the ‚Äúbest explanation‚Äù of some phenomena: consciousness, apparent design, the universe, and so on. But can ‚ÄúGod did it‚Äù really be a good explanation of anything? This central question has been begging for a thorough examination for centuries, and Dawes has finally delivered. Clear, careful, and readable, Theism and Explanation explains in explicit terms exactly what is wrong with using ‚ÄúGod did it‚Äù as an explanation, and also proposes what a successful theistic explanation would look like. (The problem is, we've never seen one.) If justice prevails, this book will shape a major part of the theism-atheism debate for the next few decades.

Leading philosopher of religion Graham Oppy painstakingly analyzes all the major arguments for and against the existence of God in their strongest forms, and finds that none of them are 100% convincing. (But, because there are no good reasons to believe in God, he is an atheist.) No other book critiques these arguments with such depth and thoroughness (he even examines such obscure arguments as ‚ÄúArguments from Puzzling Phenomena‚Äù), and Oppy is careful to engage the very latest work in the field. Not for the faint of heart or mind.

Theists often argue that without God there are no objective moral facts. Atheists scoff at this assertion, but fail to present a successful case for atheistic moral realism. When I lost my faith in God I surveyed all the approaches to moral realism that were available: virtue ethics, contractarianism, consequentialism, Kantianism, Cornell realism, non-naturalism, and so on. Since all of them failed to make their case (and in fact usually used arguments that looked just like bad theistic arguments), I had to admit there was no better reason to accept moral realism than theism. That is, until, I read A Better Place. Therein, Fyfe presents the first plausible theory of naturalistic moral realism I've ever read. Fyfe has a thorough understanding of the philosophical issues (he took 12 years of graduate study in moral philosophy), but he writes in plain talk, and his case is compelling. This is the cutting edge of moral theory.

Like Arguing About Gods, Everitt's book is another careful examination of the arguments for and against the existence of God by a leading philosopher of religion. It even introduces a new argument against God's existence, the Argument from Scale. But perhaps the most important chapters are the first two, on the role of reason when considering the existence of God, and the prospects for reformed epistemology about God. More readable than Arguing About Gods, Everitt's book is an excellent introduction to the issues for a senior philosophy undergraduate or those of comparable education.

In Logic and Theism, leading philosopher of logic and probability J.H. Sobel turns his skeptical gaze to theism and finds it badly lacking. In his scholarly review of this ‚ÄúAcid Bath for Theism,‚Äù William Lane Craig said ‚ÄúThis is an impressive book, a truly extraordinary achievement. I can think of no other treatment of theism, whether by theist or non-theist, comparable to it.‚Äù Sobel insists that the logical problem of evil is not dead, and presents a reformulated version of it. He also launches new attacks at the ontological, cosmological, teleological arguments, as well as arguments from miracles. Despite its strengths, this is the least accessible and most poorly edited book on this list.
[Buy on Amazon.]
Most books about the existence of God, even Everitt's The Non-Existence of God, consider half a dozen arguments for God and only a single argument against God: the argument from evil. The Impossibility of God is an important collection of 33 articles which present arguments for the impossibility of God. Here you will find definitional disproofs, evil disproofs, single attribute disproofs, multiple attribute disproofs, and doctrinal disproofs. A welcome entry into a field of study normally dominated by theistic talk.
[Buy on Amazon.]
This followup to The Impossibility of God collects 32 articles that argue not for the impossibility of God, but for his improbability. Included are several cosmological, teleological, nonbelief, and inductive evil arguments against God's existence.

One of the best atheism books of the decade was written by a Christian. William Rowe's evidential argument from evil is perhaps the version of the problem of evil most discussed since the 1970s. In The God Beyond Belief, Christian philosopher Nick Trakakis summarizes the debate so far and concludes that neither of the major theistic responses to the argument ‚Äì that ‚ÄúGod is mysterious‚Äù or that ‚ÄúGod has an excuse‚Äù ‚Äì is persuasive. This is a very helpful introduction to an important philosophical argument about theism, which is the same thing I'm trying to do with the Kalam Cosmological Argument in my series Mapping the Kalam.

News broke this week that Tehran's municipal government had ordered the removal of some anti-U.S. billboards in the Iranian capital. The posters, which appear to criticize government nuclear negotiations with Washington, carry the slogan, ‚ÄúThe U.S. Government Styles Honesty,‚Äù and feature an American and Iranian official at the negotiating table, with the American hiding an attack dog beneath the table.
Municipal officials, naturally, said the billboards were put up illegally and therefore removed. But as the move comes at a time of unprecedented diplomatic gestures from newly elected leader Hassan Rouhani and just ahead of the November 4 anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in 1979‚Äîwhich Iranians typically commemorate with anti-American protests‚Äîobservers suspect there's more to the order than just some city bureaucratic muscle-flexing.
Hardliners are vowing to resurrect the billboards by next month. But if Iran is really turning away from billboards baiting the Great Satan, it marks the end of a long, illustrious run of streetscape propaganda.
Here's a sampling of 34 years of Tehran's most memorable anti-American art.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. summer gasoline demand will shrink for the first time since 1991 as skyrocketing pump prices and the wider economic malaise hit holiday plans, the Energy Information Administration forecast on Tuesday.

With some regions seen facing the shock of $4 a gallon gasoline this summer, fuel demand could contract 0.4 percent from 2007 as cars and gas-guzzling SUVs spend more time in driveways and less on highways.
It would be the first decline in summer gasoline use since a recession choked the U.S. economy 17 years ago. Many analysts forecast that this year's housing crisis, credit crunch and high oil prices could cause an economic retraction.
‚ÄúThe economy did have a slight recession in 1991, so that's one similarity between that year and this (year),‚Äù said EIA administrator Guy Caruso. ‚ÄúWe are projecting a small recession for the first half of the year,‚Äù he said.
Meanwhile, several U.S. senators urged the Federal Trade Commission to prohibit manipulation in petroleum markets.
‚ÄúRecord energy prices and industry profits are coming at a time when supply and demand suggest that prices should be significantly lower,‚Äù said Sen. Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine.
Even though gasoline inventories hit a 15-year high on April 1, the EIA forecast record gasoline prices, citing expensive crude oil. The agency said crude should average $97 a barrel this summer, up $30 from last year.

Gasoline prices will peak in June at an average $3.62 a gallon, the EIA predicted, with an average of $3.54 for April-September, up 61 cents from the previous driving season.
Truckers also will feel the sting at the pumps, with diesel prices to average $3.73 a gallon this summer, up 88 cents from last year, after hitting a monthly peak of $3.91 in April.
CRUDE SUPPORTS
U.S crude shot to a record $111.80 a barrel in March as investors seeking to hedge against inflation rushed into commodities, helping to push retail gasoline prices to an all-time high of $3.33 a gallon this week.
The EIA now forecasts the price of oil ‚Äî which accounts for 70 percent the cost of making gasoline ‚Äî should average over $100 a barrel for 2008, and $103 in May and June.
Strong oil demand outside the United States should keep crude prices high this year, despite large fuel supplies and tepid demand in the world's top oil consumer, the agency said.
‚ÄúThe combination of rising world oil consumption and low surplus production capacity is putting upward pressure on oil prices,‚Äù the EIA said.

In absolute terms, the EIA forecast that U.S. summer gasoline demand should slip to 9.404 million barrels per day during the first half of 2008, down 36,000 bpd from last year.
A U.S. economic turnaround in the second half should push annual growth to 1.2 percent for the year, still the lowest rate since 2001, the agency said.
Lower U.S. fuel demand should drag down gasoline imports this summer by 91,000 bpd to 1.074 million bpd against year ago levels, while domestic gasoline production should fall 20,000 bpd to 8.241 million bpd.
A group of Russian nationalists have announced plans for a new party. They will soon submit a request for political party registration and claim they are interested in cooperation with other ‚Äúnon-system‚Äù opposition figures.
The new nationalist party will be formed on the basis of the Russian Public Movement headed by journalist Konstantin Krylov, the Russian Civil Union, headed by Anton Susov and the once-relatively popular, but now banned, Movement Against Illegal Migration, headed by Vladimir Tor (Vladlen Kralin), Izvestia daily reported.
The newspaper quoted Konstantin Krylov as saying that the necessary documents will be submitted to the Justice Ministry as early as this week.
The founders said that the possible names of the new party will be the National-Democratic Party or the Russian National Democratic Party. All politicians who want to participate in this project specialize in defending the interests of ethnic Russians, not all citizens of the multi-ethnic Russian Federation.
Additionally, all key figures have background in the Congress of Russian Communities ‚Äì the organization specializing in protection of ethnic Russians' rights abroad, especially in the former Soviet republics.
‚ÄúWe are not going to become a party of protest or to steal Putin's votes. We count on support from people who have accomplished something in their lives,‚Äù the newspaper quoted Krylov as saying.
The journalist added that the project had already received support from businessmen ‚Äúwho link their future with Russia.‚Äù
What distinguishes the new project from the similar initiatives (like the one recently announced by the head of the ‚ÄúRussians‚Äù political movement Dmitry Dyomushkin) is the fact that the founders invited politicians with pro-market and pro-democracy views to participate in the project.
According to the newspaper report, anti-corruption blogger Aleksey Navalny, business analyst-turned-politician Vladimir Milov and some other similar figures were invited to take part in the party's monitoring council.
All of them are known for their nationalist remarks and Navalny was even expelled from the pro-democracy party Yabloko at an early stage of his career for his nationalist views.
Vladimir Milov has already said that he was interested in the project and hoped to find common ground with nationalists, at least in terms of criticism of the authorities.
I recently wrote a blog on my website about the fact that so many actors, at various stages of their career, have to work for free. Since the courts decided that the Government's Workfare programme was, to all extents and purposes, illegal, as there are more than a few slavery connotations being bandied about because of it, the issue of working for free has been grabbing my attention more and more.
As I explain in my blog (http://lexiwolfe.com/blog/), Working For Free is part and parcel of what we do. In the blind hope that our dedication and talent for our craft will go appreciated (and called upon again by the company we're doing the favour for, when they have a little more in the coffers), we turn up as early as six or seven a.m., work through the day, get fed and leave as late as ten or so, having earned nothing but, hopefully, the crew and director's respect. We too draw the line somewhere. We have to decide if it's worth it, of course, and most of the time, because we specifically want a career in this weird, hand-over-fist business, we go ahead with it.
However. Being asked to work in Poundland for no pay for weeks on end, just to be ‚Äòin work' if I've been unemployed for ages? Look, Bub. I have one friend who is sending out applications for work on an average of ten a day and he's been out of work for nigh on three years. You tell him he's got work to do ‚Äì where ever! ‚Äì and he'll turn up, do a good days' work and go home again. But you tell him he's got work to do and you can't pay him because he's on some trial or what have you, and he's GOT to work otherwise he'll get his benefits rescinded? That's just not damn fair. He barely gets by on what he gets, and that's just living in a bedsit. He'll then have to pay out for what he gets to get to work and such every day, pay out for a uniform and such. How is he better off doing that than getting REAL work that pays him a decent wage?
A friend of mine also responded to my blog and was even more thought-provoking. His point was that the miserliness of such a scheme was symptomatic of a nationwide cancer, in that those of my generation and older can remember a time when money was plentiful, we all got pretty much the same money, but we were able to live much better lives than we now seem to. I myself am very identifiably a middle-class, moderately successful self-employed person who works hard and often, both in my chosen profession and my supplementary one. In contrast to these facts, my other half ‚Äì who also works ‚Äì and I struggle to get by in a bedsit in a (debatably) rather dodgy part of London. Furthermore, I remember being able to rent my own one-bedroom flat with an ex of mine, while he was repeating his A-Levels and I was working in an Argos, just before I went to university. The stories before and since the depression ‚Äì which I call it because, seriously, it is, I don't sugar coat it with the word ‚ÄòRECession' ‚Äì don't make sense.
And for the fact we're having to tighten our belts all of a sudden ‚Äì think how many people you know who have had to downsize or have almost run themselves ragged for a promotion or a better job just to cope over the past few years ‚Äì the people themselves are watching every penny. We want our nurses and doctors to do a good job; we want our military to be able to protect us; we want there to be more and better teachers. But we don't want to have to pay any more tax. Our years of prosperity are behind us and we can't seem to get over that.
That said, it's not the people's fault there are fewer jobs. Fewer new companies are surfacing because they can't get the loans or simply don't want to take the risk in the current economic climate. And who can blame them? According to the Daily Mail, 170,000 businesses went under between 2008 and 2010 alone! HMV can't blame its going into administration solely on iTunes. People can't spend money on music like they used to, and those who really want certain things are more likely to download it illegally anyway, because that doesn't cost anything.
So here's the thing: how do we escape this cycle? The sad fact is that it is not the poor who can actually do anything to stop this problem. It's the rich and the government who can.
Let me leave you with this as a hopeful story. I used to live in Liverpool. Beautiful city, great people, does not deserve the bad rap it occasionally gets and if you get a chance, visit. In the late 1700s-1800s, Joseph Williamson started up The Williamson Tunnels, which is a set of long and complicated tunnels, now partially open to the public, under the Edge Hill area of Liverpool. If you believe the conspiracy theorists, despite being a devout Christian and holding a pew at St Thomas' church, he was also the member of a sect who thought the world was ending and wanted an escape passage for himself and his friends. However, Williamson's own reasoning, as he described them, were so that the out of work had something to do, and earn their wage doing an honest day's work. The tunnels didn't appear to be for anything in particular and if you stand back, you see an eccentric man, paying otherwise destitute men a salary because that's what they needed, and it didn't really matter what they did, because their ‚Äòself-respect' was also important, as he himself said. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamson_Tunnels)
We need a few more eccentrics like Joseph Williamson to make this country work again.

This controlled media piece says these measures are ‚Äútough‚Äù ‚Äî but they are not one one-hundredth as tough as is needed.

LAWMAKERS in Budapest have increased punishments for illegal border crossings as police continue to clash with migrants trying to leave the country. The response to the refugee crisis has divided EU member states.
Hungarian lawmakers have increased penalties for border violators as part of a package of laws passed Friday. Under the new laws, trespassing in border zones will become a criminal act, smuggling people will be punishable by 20 years in prison and registration centers will be erected at points along the border.
But even as lawmakers passed strict new laws, refugees currently inside the country continued to defy police orders and European leaders criticized Hungary's approach.
The conservative Hungarian leader Viktor Orban has been unapologetic for trying to dissuade migrants from trying to enter the country. Budapest says more than 163,000 have crossed its borders this year.
‚ÄúWe have to make it clear that we can't allow everyone in, because if we allow everyone in, Europe is finished,‚Äù the prime minister told state radio Friday. ‚ÄúIf you are rich and attractive to others, you also have to be strong because if not, they will take away what you have worked for and you will be poor, too.‚Äù
Europe Divided on Issue
Orban's defiant stance has angered many European capitals including Berlin and Paris which have appealed for unity in dealing with the crisis.
‚ÄúSometimes one must feel shame because of Viktor Orban. He has spoiled much in Hungary, but also much when it comes to values in the European Union,‚Äù Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told German public broadcaster ZDF.
However, the conservative central European leader has found support among neighbors.
The Visegrad group ‚Äî Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic ‚Äî issued a joint statement following a meeting Friday that stressed the need to defend the EU's borders, as Hungary has done by erecting a razor-wire border fence and deploying soldiers to assist police.
‚ÄúAs an expression of their solidarity, the prime ministers stand ready to provide Hungary with further assistance,‚Äù the statement said.
Refugees on the March
Earlier in the day hundreds of refugees frustrated at being stuck at two train stations in Hungary, set off on foot for Austria on Friday ‚Äî many of them with the aim of traveling on to Germany. One group formed a line nearly a half-mile long (800 meters) as they streamed out of Budapest, the other broke out of a train near a migrant reception center after overwhelming riot police.
In the capital, hundreds marched through city streets with their belongings in bags and backpacks. The 171-kilometer (106-mile) journey to the Austrian border is a long walk but the group appeared determined, reaching the main motorway by mid-afternoon, 20 kilometers from the train station where they had been denied boarding international trains heading deeper into the EU.
Already at least one life has been lost in connection with the confrontations with Hungarian security forces. A Pakistani man died Friday after collapsing on railway tracks after a group of more than 300 migrants broke out of a train station near Bicske, where police had been holding about 800 migrants.
Police say they did not give chase to the unidentified man and Hungarian state television said he had died after falling and hitting his head on the railway tracks. That group of 300 people was later apprehended.
Staggering Numbers
The International Organization for Migration said more than 364,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far ‚Äî and more than 2,800 have died along the way, most drowning while crossing the Mediterranean Sea.
Greece and Italy have been the hardest-hit nations, with more than 245,000 and nearly 117,000 arrivals respectively, the vast majority by boat.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres estimated that Europe would need to make space for about 200,000 additional people trying to reach its shores.
So far, EU member states have fallen short of targets to redistribute 40,000 people. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expected next week to propose a revised goal of relocating 120,000 people from Hungary, Greece and Italy.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said today that Obamacare cost-sharing reduction payments will not be part of a bill to keep the government funded past Friday.
Toward the end of a House leadership press conference Wednesday morning, Ryan said negotiations had brought the two sides ‚Äúreally close‚Äù to an agreement. ‚ÄúObviously, CSR's we're not doing that. That is not in an appropriation bill that is something separate that the administration does,‚Äù Ryan said.
Yesterday the Hill reported that Republicans and Democrats were ‚Äúhorse-trading‚Äù over elements of the bill to keep the government running. The Trump administration is seeking billions in new defense spending and Democrats wanted to fund CSRs:
Democrats have offered to agree to an additional $15 billion in military funding as part of a spending package to keep the government operating if Republicans in Congress agree to fund ¬≠ObamaCare insurer subsidies. Signing off on the Democratic offer would avert a government shutdown set to begin Saturday.
Cost-sharing reduction payments are separate from the subsidies used to lower the cost of insurance premiums for people buying Obamacare plans on the exchanges (those who make under 400% of the federal poverty line). CSRs are additional payments made directly to insurers to lower out-of-pocket costs including copayments and annual deductibles. However, the way the law is written means that insurers must discount those items for people at the low end of the income scale whether or not they are receiving the money to cover it from the federal government. So if the CSRs are cut off, as Democrats worry the Trump administration made decide to do, insurers will be losing, even more on the exchanges than they already are.
However, the way the law is written puts insurers in a difficult spot. Insurers must discount those items for people at the low end of the income scale. That's true whether or not they are receiving the money to cover those costs from the federal government. So if the CSRs are cut off, as Democrats worry the Trump administration may decide to do, insurers will be losing even more on the Obamacare exchanges than they already are.
Realistically, insurers who stand to lose millions on the unreimbursed CSRs will simply drop out of the Obamacare exchanges. Today, Modern Healthcare reports that Anthem, one of the nation's largest insurers, is waiting to see what will happen with CSRs before deciding whether to bail out entirely:
Anthem will submit 2018 rates assuming that the cost-sharing reduction subsidies will be funded, Swedish said. But the insurer told states that if funding for the subsidies is still uncertain by early June, it may make changes to its rate filing. Changes could include increasing rate, pulling products, or even exiting the market entirely. Without funding for subsidies, Swedish estimated that rates could increase 20% or more. Moreover, if the annual tax on health insurance companies isn't repealed, rates could increase an additional 3% to 5%, he said.
So that's why Democrats are so eager to see this funded. It's also why Paul Ryan saying CSRs definitely won't be part of the bill to keep the government going could be very significant. If that stands, the Trump administration could potentially cut off the CSR funding which would result in more insurers getting out of the markets, further decreasing competition. It will also make it necessary for those who remain to raise prices by double digits once again.
As The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported recently, the General Assembly may seek to consolidate the region's alphabet soup of transit agencies to improve service and efficiency. It's using the prospect of significant state funding for transit operations as an incentive.
On Thursday the Senate Study Committee on Regional Transit Solutions finalized its recommendations. The committee called for ‚Äúan all-inclusive solution in the area of transit governance and funding‚Äù that could be enacted by the General Assembly in 2018. In the meantime, the committee recommended hiring a transit consultant work out the particulars and report back by the end of 2017.
There are many opinions about how a consolidated regional transit system might operate. Some say MARTA should operate the entire system. Others say existing agencies ‚Äì including transit systems in Cobb and Gwinnett counties ‚Äì should maintain their autonomy but improve coordination.
One idea that has been floated: MARTA would continue to serve Fulton, DeKalb and Clayton counties, with the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority or a similar agency providing commuter transit service in the rest of the region.
The committee report does not recommend a regional transit model. It says any model and state funding should be considered together. And it says lawmakers should seek a statewide solution.
The report also include several proposals requested by the Association County Commissioners of Georgia. Among other things, ACCG has asked the state to:
*Allow counties that pass a fractional single-county transportation sales tax for less than 1 percent to hold a second referendum for the remaining balance before the existing tax expires. Currently, state law allows counties to have only one such tax at a time. The provision could pave the way for Fulton County ‚Äì which approved a .75 percent tax for road and other transportation improvements in November ‚Äì to hold a second referendum on a .25 percent tax for a MARTA expansion.
*Allow counties to collect any fractional sales tax portion dedicated to transit for up to 20 years. That would make it easier to make big capital investments and could pave the way for federal funding of local transit projects.
Sen. Steve Gooch, R-Dahlonega, the chairman of the study committee, said some transit measures could be enacted in the General Assembly's 2017 session. But he said a comprehensive transit plan ‚Äì including state funding ‚Äì likely won't come until 2018.
‚ÄúThere are a lot of questions that need to be answered before anybody here will commit one way or another,‚Äù Gooch said. ‚ÄúBut this is a good first step.‚Äù

More than half of children use social media by the age of 10!
95% of all teens ages 12-17 are now online and 80% of online teens are users of social media sites. (Pew Research Center Internet Project, 2011). According to a survey, 52% of 8 to 16-year-olds ignored Facebook's age limit and 43% had messaged strangers, starting from an average age of 12.

Cyber Bulling Is A Serious Problem!
The internet has also given a new platform for bullies to harass their victims today. Bashing used to predominantly be done in school, but now it can be done via email, instant messages, and social media at all hours of the day! This bullying is often done by children, who have increasingly early access to online technologies. The abuse can create life altering emotional and psychological damage for the victims.
ActressSusan Sarandondoesn't seem to have any regrets over her staunch opposition toHillary Clintonduring last year's election.
‚ÄúI did think she was very, very dangerous. We would still be fracking, we would be at war [if she was president],‚Äù she told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIt wouldn't be much smoother. Look what happened under Obama that we didn't notice.‚Äù
The actress, who had supported Sen.Bernie Sanders(I-Vt.) during the primaries, also defended her vote for Green Party candidateJill Steinby noting that Trump wasn't going to win in New York anyway.
‚ÄúWell, I knew that New York was going to go [for Hillary]. It was probably the easiest place to vote for Stein. Bringing attention to working-class issues is not a luxury. People are really hurting; that's how this guy got in. What we should be discussing is not the election, but how we got to the point where Trump was the answer.‚Äù
Sarandon also detailed some of the angry messages she has received since the election.
‚ÄúI got from Hillary people ‚ÄòI hope your crotch is grabbed', ‚ÄòI hope you're raped,'‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMisogynistic attacks.‚Äù

Because of the way the contracts on their books are set up in the future, the Miami Heat were sort of compelled to spend a bunch of money this summer.
They preferred to use it on Gordon Hayward, Blake Griffin or Russell Westbrook, but those targets didn't work out. So they ended up dividing it up among a trio of role players in Kelly Olynyk, James Johnson and Dion Waiters over a 24-hour period on Wednesday and Thursday.
There's a reason to do it. Waiters and Johnson were terrific last season for the Heat, overachieving as part of a 30-11 run in the second half of the season that gave the team hope for the future. Olynyk is a skilled big man who is young, and it's hard to find such players, so there was absolutely a market for him.
Maybe Waiters is on the cusp of becoming a true star. Maybe Johnson is the perfect versatile forward for today's game, even though he had been a journeyman for seven seasons until arriving in Miami. Maybe in the Heat's fierce conditioning system, Olynyk will get the kind of bounce many before him have. He can shoot a little, and his plus-minus numbers are promising, though his rebounding and defense are worrisome.
Maybe Pat Riley will flip two of the three for a bona fide star in the next 18 months and this usage of salary-cap space will reveal itself as an asset play. The average annual values -- Olynyk and Waiters around $13 million and Johnson at $15 million -- aren't out of line, though it's debatable just what the other bidders might've been offering.
All of those possible outcomes have a reasonable chance of happening and would make the Heat feel OK about their Hayward backup plan. And the fan base, which continues to support the Heat passionately despite the loss of the stars, will be happy in the short term. It fell in love with Waiters and Johnson last season. Olynyk sometimes toes the line between hustling and playing dirty, a formula that often wins over the home crowd.

The issue here, though, is the length of the contracts: four years handed out to all three. The moment they are signed, they are no longer going to be attractive assets for a while, especially with the league expected to be headed for a bit of a cap squeeze over the next several years after a few heavy-spending summers across the league.
Contracts this summer have been getting shorter, shown by the number of two- and three-year deals on the rise. Now, the Heat's books are stuffed with this new money and they're going to be capped out.
With these new deals on the books, the Heat will have around $100 million committed to Hassan Whiteside, Goran Dragic, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Olynyk and Waiters in the 2018-19 season. That's not exactly the Golden State Warriors' starting lineup, but it's going to be close to the same price.
Over the past two summers the Heat have combined to lock Whiteside, Waiters, Olynyk and the Johnsons into deals totaling more than $310 million. Add Dragic, who signed in 2015, and the outlay is nearly $400 million. The number of All-Star appearances from the group: zero.
There are at least three East playoff teams taking a step back this season, with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers and Atlanta Hawks going through various phases of rebuilding. The Heat will enter the season expected to return to the playoffs after missing them last season. That is an accomplishment.
But with this roster they probably will not be considered a genuine threat. That's a spot they hope they're not locked into for long, even though the roster they now have is indeed locked in for long.
What began as a childcare coop in Seoul, South Korea has grown into a cooperative, urban village and sparked a national movement of urban villages.
In 1994, when city officials threatened to remove trees from the top of Mt. Sungmi, in Mapo-gu, Seoul for the creation of a water facility, a group of neighbors joined forces to oppose the plan. By banding together, a community was created. After defeating the plan for the facility, the community continued to organize, eventually becoming the Sungmisan Village which encompasses a one-kilometer radius at the base of the mountain and now connects over 700 families.
The first project for the village was a childcare cooperative for village families. Following the success of the childcare coop, villagers launched a consumer coop in 2001 for purchasing eco-friendly goods, and created community clubs for hiking, farming, parenting, studying, photography, and more. They started hosting music events, festivals, and theatrical productions. The village stresses social interaction and prioritizes taking care of its elders.
A gathering of some Sungmisan villagers
In 2004, the community opened Sungmisan Village School, the first village school in Seoul. A community-driven alternative to traditional education, the school focuses on hands-on learning from other villagers as an adjunct to a classroom environment. Students have regular school staff, but they also learn about organic farming, ecological responsibility, trades, skills, and our relationship to the earth and each other, from community members. Offering elementary through high school education, the school connects students with potters and other craftspeople, farmers, builders, writers, musicians, and more. In an overview of the school, principal Park Bok Sun explains:
"The villagers feel that the school is their school because they are involved. Children know all teachers well. It's not just about learning information. They can see how a potter makes pottery, exhibits, sells and does bookkeeping. Imagine what a vivid example it is! The teacher isn't someone who just comes to class, teaches few things then runs away to his home and no one knows where the teacher lives. "The children can understand alternative farming by learning what is organic, why it's needed, and what is distribution connecting production and consumption. Furthermore, they can learn about solidarity of the people in the world by learning how people's trade occurs. "The children can learn about organic, ecological activity and fair trade. They learn the significance of the work their parents and adults in their neighborhood do. Then they learn how their table is connected to alternative life. They also learn that they are participating in planning an alternative life. That is a great experience."
The idea for the village school was born of concerns about traditional education. Parents wondered why schools looked like prisons, and how they could draw from the wealth of skills and experience already present in the community create a different kind of school. The vision they held was of an organically-designed school that grows and shifts as the village evolves.
Sungmisan Village School focuses on hands-on eduction and community-building
With a focus on sustainability, healthy food and connectedness, village schools are more than educational institutions‚Äîthey're hubs for learning, sharing, growing and community-building.
Sungmisan Village has inspired numerous urban villages around Seoul. City government officials actively support the creation of more villages through the Seoul Community Support Center. Urban villages rekindle a lost sense of community and, through village schools, provide a way for young people to grow up in a hands-on, educational community rather than an overly-competitive and isolating learning environment.
‚ÄúIt is of great significance that we created a village school in the city,‚Äù writes principal Park. ‚ÄúThis is part of dreaming an alternative life and making it come true one by one.‚Äù

We're moving on up! To the top! Of Lotus Hills at least.
You see, there was a special present in our last video, and that was in the last few seconds. You saw the first pass at Titan City itself. Or at least, the land under it.
The total map for Titan City measures four hundred and seventy five square kilometers. 180 square miles. Sculpted. You've seen the maps before, with waterlines and coves, and mountains.
Now, how'd we do it?
Not by hand, I'll tell you that much. That'd take years to get anything even vaguely plausible.
So‚Ä¶ where'd it come from? Well, as it happens, there's a lot of science funded by the government. And a lot of it is in the public domain. We the People paid for it, We the People get to use it. There are a number of cities that have been scanned by lasers, by the US Geological Survey. And a number of harbors that have been scanned by sonar, by the same people.
And, as it happens, we got our hands on that data. All legit and aboveboard. It's measured in height. Unreal, as it happens, can absorb things measured in height - they're called heightmaps.
Now, I'll admit, they weren't in the same format, and we sort of had to write a converter. Which did a number of other things on all that data. Horrible, horrible things. Turning three cities into one, straightening the curves, flattening the hills. (the mountain may get ‚Äòem but the law never will.)
But at the end of the day, it spit out something we could use.
It's not that simple, though, because even if you use lasers to scan the city at five centimeter resolution‚Ä¶ well, it's a city. There are things in the way. Buildings. Walls. Airports. Traffic lights. No, really, wires and poles get in the way a surprising amount - we can trace the ‚Äòecho' they leave. The map has holes in it.
And we have to find those holes and patch them all, till the map is mathematically sound and whole.
Of course, when you're dealing with 180 square miles, that's a huge file with a lot of data in it. And we can't slice it up because then we might have one side of the slice taller than the other - this was a real issue, because the data was given to us in ten KM chunks.
Just stitching those together (they overlapped slightly) was an adventure. Working with it as a whole required some serious RAM upgrades to the workstation we were using. And an additional hard drive, because the thing was getting thrashed to death.
And then? Holes. Thousands of tiny, tiny holes. And a couple REALLY HUGE ONES. But it's just math, and we can find the holes with math. And then we get to plug them up - the small ones by averaging the areas around them. The larger ones? We have to get creative. Projecting the slope of the nearest solid areas in all directions forwards was one solution - didn't work so well for riverbeds, though.
And finding the ‚Äònearest solid area' isn't as easy as it looks when dealing with graphs.
It's an ongoing struggle, and we're not done yet. And then comes the smoothing‚Ä¶
But it's okay, because Lotus Hills had a fixable amount of holes. So we used it. We're building a new Minihood on top of it. Why? Because we want one with terrain, and it's got a good mixture. Everything from a hill, to flat land, to pirate coves, to a nice beach. Because the old one wound up being a bit too small once we got travel powers in. Because we needed something to test our building construction and roadbuilding tools with, and it's a great mixture to use for that. (All graphics are prototypes and to be replaced.) And because we've learned since building the last one.
See, the last Minihood was an experiment in modular building - make some modules, stack them together. It worked pretty darn well. It gave us the clues we need to move towards building things based on rules sets. It's called ‚Äòprocedural building'. We give the tool the rules, it assembles the legos - but we tell it how the legos go together - and if anyone's played SimCity or Cities: Skylines, you know how much power that can give you.
Problem is, we used something called ‚ÄòBSP Trees' to make the old building walls. They're fine for testing, but they're not actually building parts. They're logic structures. They're a handy technique and fine for most games, but for us, they have one big problem. They don't work with collision detection - and that's a little less than useful if you want people crawling on them. And we used them for everything from the road to the walls.
So, it's got to go.
And in the process, we're making a new place - that will teach us how to make more things, faster. The tools are in development - some of them purchased, some of them built by hand - but we know what we have to build now, it's just a matter of digging deep into the toolbox. Let's see what the next few weeks bring.
And really, that's how it goes. Rebuild, learn, develop.
And, always, have fun.
From Avelworldcreator, Dr. Tyche, W. Arcabbot, and your friends at Titan Labor Company - we take care of the TLC, you take care of you

The world's most demonic lemur is also its most endangered. Meet the creature with the ugliest finger on the planet.
Behold: the devilish claws of the aye-aye. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)
At night, in the forests of Madagascar, a dark specter drifts through the canopy. The creature has black, wiry fur, radar dishes for ears, a witch's broom for a tail, and enormous, haunting eyeballs that shine blood-red in the beam of a flashlight.
Local legend, though, says it's the aye-aye's fingers you need worry about.
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website
On each hand, the aye-aye, which is actually a species of lemur, boasts one extra-long digit that looks like the crooked finger of death itself. Some believe that the aye-aye can curse a person simply by pointing at them. Others believe that the creatures sneak into human homes at night and use their skeletal finger to pick at the hearts of their victims.
The precise threat posed by an aye-aye varies from village to village, but the antidote for it is usually the same.
In the wild, the aye-aye prowls along branches and rotting logs, tapping its digit along the bark and listening with its out-sized ears to the sounds that bounce back.
‚ÄúI was on a trapping expedition back in the early '90s and someone had told us about the location of an aye-aye nest about a day's walk from the nearest paved road,‚Äù says Charles Welch, a conservation biologist who spent 15 years in Madagascar studying lemurs.

Because aye-ayes are nocturnal and generally pretty difficult to find, Welch and company set out into the forest to follow up on the tip.
‚ÄúSo we were walking along the path and we came across what I recognized to be aye-aye fur in the trail,‚Äù he says. Convinced it was evidence that they had come to the right place, Welch eagerly questioned the next group of locals they came across at a small general store. They at once confirmed his suspicions and dashed his hopes.
‚ÄúThe night before, the villagers had come across two aye-ayes by accident,‚Äù says Welch, ‚Äúand as a result of seeing them, they had killed them right there.‚Äù
The aye-ayes were beaten to death in the middle of the trail. For no other reason than that they were aye-ayes.
‚ÄúThe aye-aye is the lemur that shouldn't be,‚Äù says Chris Smith, education specialist at the Duke Lemur Center.
‚ÄúIt doesn't look like a lemur. It doesn't necessarily act like a lemur, but it ends up being one of the most fascinating primates in Madagascar.‚Äù
Located in North Carolina, the Duke Lemur Center is currently home to 14 aye-ayes, but it owns and manages over a dozen more housed in zoos across the United States. All told, the Center accounts for more than half of the captive aye-ayes on Earth.
Smith says the most challenging thing about caring for aye-ayes is meeting their physical and mental demands. The aye-aye has the largest brain-to-body ratio of any lemur. So you can't just give them a treat. You have to give them a problem to solve.
In the wild, the aye-aye prowls along branches and rotting logs, tapping its digit along the bark and listening with its out-sized ears to the sounds that bounce back. This is what scientists call ‚Äúpercussive foraging,‚Äù and it's similar to how some bats and whales hunt.
Once the aye-aye zeroes in on a potential snack, it excavates a hole in the bark using its long, chisel-like teeth. Smith compares these chompers to those of a beaver's because they never stop growing. The aye-aye's teeth are so strong that captive animals have been known to chew through concrete walls when they're bored.
After the teeth have done their work, it's time for the aye-aye to unfurl its primary weapon‚Äîthe finger. Equal parts pipe cleaner and fishing pole, the aye-aye's middle finger is an adaptation without parallel in the animal kingdom.
The middle finger of an aye-aye sits on a ball-and-socket joint, just like the human shoulder. This allows it to swivel in any direction, a full 360 degrees.
The finger slips into the tree trunk and snakes around looking for grubs. If it finds one, a specialized claw on the end of the finger hooks the larva and whisks it away to the aye-aye's mouth. Slurp, crunch, gulp.
In one area of Madagascar, fady might protect the animals by making locals avoid the creatures out of fear.
Back at the Duke Lemur Center, Smith says they have come up with all sorts of contraptions for the captive aye-ayes to simulate foraging. Peanut-butter-and-plywood sandwiches force the animals to gnaw through wood to get their treat. Blocks of wood with holes drilled in them and then sealed up full of wax worms let the aye-ayes practice their tapping.
‚ÄúThey're very good at what they do, but they've ended up not being the prettiest at what they do,‚Äù Smith says.
The aye-aye is considered endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. We don't know how many of the animals may be left, but the population is generally assumed to be trending downwards. In the 1930s and '40s, it was actually thought that the animals had gone extinct, so few and far between were sightings of the cryptic creatures.
Even for people who live in or near their habitat, coming across the animals can be rare. Edward Louis, director of conservation genetics at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, says this elusiveness probably has a lot to do with the aye-aye's distribution and social habits.
Aye-ayes have extremely large home ranges, sometimes stretching as far as 7,000 acres. They also have the largest distribution of any lemur and exist in nearly every habitat on the island. Conversely, Louis says the animals live at very low population densities. That means they're easy to miss, even if you know where to look for them.
Louis has been catching and collaring aye-ayes as part of the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership since 2008, and he says he understands why some people might be spooked by this species of lemur.
‚ÄúThey sort of look like a black hole up in the trees,‚Äù he says.
And when you throw in the crazy fur, the fangs, the finger, and eyes like burning embers, well, you get a creature that looks every part the demon‚Äîespecially if you're not accustomed to seeing them.
But to fully understand the fear, Louis says you need to understand the concept of fady. Translated loosely as ‚Äútaboo,‚Äù the people of Madagascar have fady for all sorts of objects and actions, and the particular fady may differ from town to town, family to family, or person to person. For instance, among the ethnic group known as the Merina, it is fady to hold a funeral on a Tuesday, and violating the taboo is thought to invite another death. There's a fady against handing an egg directly from person to person, and another that forbids singing while you eat.
‚ÄúOne village doesn't eat chicken, but you can go down the road a little ways and they'll eat chicken, but they won't eat pork,‚Äù Louis says. ‚ÄúIt's a matter of region.‚Äù

In one area of Madagascar, fady might protect the animals by making locals avoid the creatures out of fear. In another, it may lead people to kill aye-ayes and string them up at the edge of the village to ward off evil spirits. And then there's a third scenario.
A few years ago, Louis and his colleagues were tracking a collar, but when they arrived at the nest, there was no aye-aye to be found. The tracking signal led them to a pile of fresh dirt nearby. Buried within was the collar, cut in two and dabbled in blood.
The team believes this particular animal was killed for its meat. That's surprising, not only because of the stigma surrounding the aye-aye but also because Louis says the animals barely have any meat on them. The aye-aye is ‚Äúall head and tail,‚Äù skin and bone.
‚ÄúBut if people are hungry, they're going to eat,‚Äù Louis says.
Sadly, it's not uncommon for lemurs to find their way onto the dinner plate. While the country is comparable in size to Sweden, Madagascar posts a Gross Domestic Product lower than countries such as Afghanistan and North Korea. More than 95 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day. According to statistics provided by UNICEF, only 60 percent of children enrolled in first grade will complete their primary school education. And the numbers are even worse for secondary school.
Furthermore, almost 65 percent of the island nation's inhabitants live in rural areas. In many of these places, people have learned to survive by slashing and burning the forest to make way for crops such as rice and manioc. This practice threatens already declining populations of endemic species, leads to erosion and pollution of water sources, and ultimately contributes to climate change. Similarly, hunting animals‚Äîeven endangered ones‚Äîmay be the only way some people have to supply their families with iron and protein.
‚ÄúIt's very complex from a conservation point of view,‚Äù says Welch, who now serves as the conservation coordinator for the Duke Lemur Center. ‚ÄúYou're dealing with people who are just trying to feed their families.‚Äù
Because aye-ayes are so difficult to study, it's tough to say how much of a threat fady killings or trade in bushmeat are to the survival of the species. But one thing is clear, Welch says: If there's no forest, there will be no aye-aye.
Madagascar lost approximately 40 percent of its forest cover between the 1950s and 2000. While some of this destruction is to support trade in highly lucrative hardwoods like ebony and rosewood, Welch says most de-forestation is attributable to slash and burn agriculture.
Interestingly, traditional funeral rites in some areas may both save forests and contribute to negative sentiment toward aye-ayes. Wherever people are buried or laid to rest in tombs beneath rock overhangs, it's forbidden to cut trees. Often, these stands are made up of canarium trees, which produce nuts that aye-ayes positively love. This means that some of the only places where people encounter aye-ayes are the equivalent of cemeteries‚Äîa coincidence that certainly doesn't help the animal's association with death.
‚ÄúOn more than one occasion we have seen aye-ayes strung up along the side of the road after being killed,‚Äù says Erik Patel, project director for the Duke Lemur Center's SAVA Conservation Project.
Patel and his colleagues work to change the attitudes of locals by visiting rural villages and teaching kids about the animals around them. Additionally, the SAVA Conservation Project hopes to protect animals by directly improving the lives of people. The project sponsors re-forestation projects and training for teachers. They partner with human health and family planning initiatives, supply fuel-efficient stoves, and promote yams‚Äîwhich are more nutritious and weather-resistant‚Äîover traditional crops like manioc which take a heavier toll on the environment. They've even built a handful of aquaculture ponds to kick-start fish-farming programs that simultaneously provide people with much-needed protein and cut down on the need for bush meat.
Of over 101 lemur species, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature considers 90 of them to be threatened in some way, making lemurs the most imperiled mammals on Earth. And with Madagascar's population expected to more than double by the year 2050, programs like the SAVA Conservation Project may be some of the only hope these species have in the face of extinction.
After a decade and a half of tracking and studying aye-ayes, Louis says he's become attached to many of the animals. One in particular, an older female named Bozy (pronounced boo-zee), seems to have stolen his heart. ‚ÄúShe's just a really good mom,‚Äù Louis swoons.
But the feeling does not appear to be mutual. Louis says there have been times when they're following her at night both by the collar's signal and the shine given off by her eyes in a flashlight. Then all of a sudden, Bozy disappears. The last time she did it, Louis snapped a few photos in the dark that reveal the aye-aye's trick.
‚ÄúShe's got her eyes closed,‚Äù he says in disbelief. ‚ÄúI think she's learned to close her eyes and keep on walking, and that's how we lose her.‚Äù
Since it was first described in 1782, the aye-aye has gone from bad omen to evolutionary marvel, an animal unlike any other on the planet. We now think that its middle finger only warms up when its in use, that the species has the lowest level of genetic diversity of any primate on record, and that the need to hear its own tapping may have limited the aye-aye's ability to communicate over long distances.
What more will be revealed about this fascinating creature before it shrugs off our surveillance and vanishes into the forest‚Äîperhaps one day for good?

Similar to a previous item involving Yankee great Mickey Mantle, in late 2010 another piece of crude sports-related correspondence surfaced on the Internet, prompting questions about whether scanned images of letters purportedly exchanged between an attorney and the Cleveland Browns football team were genuine.
The first missive, dated 18 November 1974 and addressed to the Cleveland Browns, was signed by Dale O. Cox of the Akron law firm Roetzel & Andress, a season ticket holder who complained about the potential for injury among spectators due to the practice of Browns fans' throwing paper airplanes during games at Cleveland Stadium:
Three days later, Browns general counsel James N. Bailey responded with a terse, dismissive (and somewhat vulgar) reply:
This correspondence is in fact real, as Michael Heaton of the Cleveland Plain Dealer determined by tracking down both of the principals in late 2010, who vouched for its authenticity. Browns general counsel James Bailey, then 66 and living in San Diego, told Heaton that:
It's surprising. I've gotten lots of calls from old friends who have seen the letter on the Internet. I was all of 28 years old when I wrote that letter. I should have been more cautious. I'm just glad my mother's not around to see that letter. After I wrote it, I heard about it right away from [Browns owner] Art Modell. He said something like, ‚ÄòWhat the hell are you doing?' He was not a guy lacking passion.
Dale Cox, formerly of the Roetzel & Andress law firm, who in 2010 was 72 with a private practice in Orofino, Idaho, also recalled for Heaton his memories of the exchange:
In June 2012, Chesapeake Energy Corp. led more than a dozen U.S. EPA officials on a tour of its hydraulic fracturing operations near Sayre, Pa.
Fracking, and how the federal government regulates it, is of great concern to Chesapeake. The energy company spent $1.8 million on lobbying that year -- including lobbying EPA on its hydraulic fracturing study looking into potential impacts on drinking water, according to disclosure records on file with the Senate.
The Chesapeake excursion is among thousands of trips that EPA officials -- including top brass -- have taken on someone else's dime since 2010, according to trip reports obtained by Greenwire. Overall, EPA has accepted more than $4.5 million to pay for hotels, meals, travel and other benefits from outside groups over the past four years.
Corporations, industry associations, nonprofits, foreign governments and others with a stake in EPA's rules -- including groups with registered lobbyists -- regularly pay for EPA official travel, according to reports the agency has filed with the Office of Government Ethics. EPA has reported accepting 3,369 trips that have had some if not all private funding for employees to take tours, attend conferences and meetings, conduct training sessions, and update outsiders on the agency's research and policies since 2010.
In the Chesapeake case, about 13 EPA officials went on the tour of fracking sites to learn more about the process, according to an agency official. The company provided transportation from a central office in Sayre out to nearby well sites. That was noted as "local transportation" on the trip reports with Chesapeake spending $1,250 overall to ferry the officials to the sites.

"None of the travelers would have had an issue pending before them that involved Chesapeake Energy," an EPA official said. "These are more the rulemaking folks, and they need to see what fracking is other than watching it on TV."
One of Chesapeake's entourage of EPA officials included Mark Seltzer, who's based in the agency's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. He's also listed on a government website as a point man for EPA's efforts to get companies to publicly disclose their fracking chemicals.
A Chesapeake spokesman declined to comment for this article.
But the energy company is not alone in funding EPA travel. Dozens of other interests with business before EPA are financing officials' trips.
For example, in January 2012, the Boston-based energy management network Altenex paid $800 for meals and transportation for Blaine Collison, then-director of EPA's Green Power Partnership.
Collison was invited to a meeting in Midland, Mich., to share his expertise at a meeting of large corporate energy users looking to procure renewable power, according to EPA's report. Two years later, he was hired by the company. He's now Altenex's managing director of network services.
Dow Chemical Co. -- which co-sponsored the event with Altenex -- paid $128 for Collison's meals and lodging.
Dow was lobbying EPA that year on a host of issues, including the agency's regulation of dioxin and the pesticide methyl bromide. It was also lobbying Congress on legislation that would have affected EPA's regulation of chemicals. A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment for this story.
The trips reported were all cleared by ethics officials, and EPA says they're all allowable under government rules for accepting gifts.
But the fact that agency employees are having their flights, meals and hotels comped by outside groups is troubling to some who say it might influence their work at one of the government's most influential regulatory agencies.
"My concern is the conflict of interest at stake," said Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist at the watchdog group Public Citizen. "Gifts of travel are usually provided by entities that want to lobby someone, lobby a government official and get some official favors in turn."
EPA and other proponents of the trips say they're a useful -- and legal -- way to get agency workers outside their cubicles to learn about the issues they work on and educate the public.
There's a governmentwide regulation that allows EPA to accept travel expenses from nonfederal sources, as long as the travelers don't have certain matters before them -- like grants under consideration or pending litigation -- that involve the same donors, according to EPA. The agency's Office of General Counsel vets proposed trips to ensure that they don't pose conflicts of interest for the travelers.
An EPA official said the outside funding helps an agency that's seen its travel budget pinched in recent years.
"We're careful to make sure that we're not doing it for visiting a site to do an investigation or an inspection, but where we have an opportunity to learn something, and a regulated entity or the university or the trade association or government says, 'Yeah, we have something that we want you to see because we don't think that you can understand our perspective unless you see our stuff,'" the official said.
As for Collison, the EPA official said the hire didn't present a problem, noting that two years had passed between the trip and the job offer. "What would be a problem -- which is not what happened here -- is if he were simultaneously negotiating for employment with Altenex while doing a trip, which was paid for by them. That would be a problem."
Collison did not respond to requests for comment.
'Registered lobbyist'
Some of EPA's top officials have also had trips, meals and other travel expenses funded by outsiders.
In December 2010, then-EPA air chief Gina McCarthy, Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe and several other top officials attended a conference in Boston sponsored by the Harvard University Center for the Environment to commemorate EPA's 40th anniversary. They were given meals costing $98.91 each, records show. Harvard University has registered lobbyists -- which is pointed out in one of the trip reports.
"Harvard University Center for the Environment is a registered lobbyist. They are not paying any travel expenses," the form says. Because those officials were political appointees who signed President Obama's ethics pledge, they're normally barred from accepting gifts from federally registered lobbyists.
In 2010, Harvard had lobbied both chambers of Congress on a host of issues, including sweeping climate and energy legislation that had passed the House and ultimately died in the Senate. That effort was supported by the Obama administration and would have had major implications for EPA, which would have issued new rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
The meals were considered an exception to the Obama administration's ban on political appointees accepting gifts from lobbyists, according to EPA, because another statute was in play that allows for a governmentwide authority to accept some travel funding.
"There's no lobbying gift pledge violation," according to the EPA official.
Awards and ceremonies
Companies would often pay for EPA officials' travel as part of photo opportunities and celebrations of their own environmental bona fides.
Disney paid for EPA's Julie Anderson to attend an awards ceremony at an Earth Day event in Anaheim, Calif., in 2011. EPA was the co-sponsor of the award that Anderson was presenting. Disney paid for one night's lodging and admission to the theme park, according to EPA's trip report.
Earth Day sparked other trips for agency officials.
In 2013, Beverly Banister of EPA went to Tupelo, Miss., to help turn on a Toyota plant's solar power array and present an award to the plant's president, Masa Hamaguchi, as part of Earth Day celebrations, according to the agency's trip report.
"We'd like for the EPA to present Hamaguchi-san with the award and say words about the award and its significance," the report says.
Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Mississippi paid for Banister's meals, lodging, rental car gas as well as common carrier and local transportation with $628.72.
Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said the company "continually seeks to improve environmental activities in its manufacturing operations" and that the Earth Day event was part of that effort. "An exchange of information and ideas with environmental experts like the EPA is important to our efforts," she said.
'Purely for compliance assistance'
Corporations have also been seeking guidance from EPA in order not to run afoul of the agency.
In 2011, Greg Schaner in EPA's stormwater office took a trip that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. helped fund.
It was for the company's annual "compliance conference" held in Bentonville, Ark., according to Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. The conference has various regulatory officials meet with the retail giant's suppliers and contractors to teach them best practices ensuring compliance with the law.
"Who better than EPA and other agencies to walk them through the process?" Buchanan asked.
The EPA official said "it was an assemblage of people where we could give the agency's perspective on rules" and how stormwater rules apply to them as a regulated entity.
Trade associations also sought direction from EPA.
In 2011, EPA official Sam Sampath traveled to Orlando, Fla., "to present the EPA draft pesticide permit" to the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA). The association paid $537.40 to help cover Sampath's lodging and travel.
Chava McKeel, GCSAA's director of government relations, said the EPA official came to the group's meeting to help its members better understand the agency's new Clean Water Act pesticide general permit.
"I host a public policy program every year at our annual conference and try to identify speakers on important and timely compliance topics," McKeel said. "This was purely for compliance assistance."
Join EPA, see the world
As part of that compliance assistance, EPA officials have traveled the globe, often with their meals and local transportation paid for by private parties.
Senior air officials went to Tokyo and all over Germany to discuss regulations and technology with global automakers.
Margo Oge, then-director of EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), went to Japan on a trip in 2011 that auto companies helped fund.
Oge, who's now retired, traveled to Tokyo for a technology review and meetings with representatives of the Japanese government and Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., according to the records. Each of the three auto companies reportedly paid $210 for her meals and local transportation. Several other EPA air officials also went on the trip to Japan and had meals and local transport funded by the automakers.
Last year, OTAQ Director Christopher Grundler, Assessment and Standards Division Director William Charmley and several other EPA officials traveled to Germany, visiting Stuttgart, Hanover and Munich to discuss with automakers the agency's light-duty greenhouse gas rules.
BMW AG, Continental AG, Daimler AG, Porsche and Volkswagen Group helped pay for their meals and local transportation while in Germany.
EPA officials have seen the world, thanks to privately funded travel. Trip reports show that agency employees have gone to far-flung states like Alaska and Hawaii; major cities such as Las Vegas, London and Paris; and to faraway countries, including Chile, China, Italy, Spain and South Korea.
Sometimes employees' trips do run afoul of government ethics regulations.
An EPA inspector general's report released last week disclosed that one political appointee accepted a private jet flight from a lobbyist in violation of ethics rules. The official was asked to review counseling advice but no further action was taken, according to the watchdog's office (Greenwire, May 13).
But although EPA says the vast majority of its trips funded by outsiders are within the rules, some watchdog groups say it doesn't look good.
If companies or associations with a vested interest in a specific agency can pay for government officials' travel and hotel expenses, "are we placing public servants in a position in which they're going to be more protective or lenient on the industries that they're overseeing?" asked Scott Amey, general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight.
"We need an arms-length relationship from people that are either regulated by or doing business with the federal government," he said.

The Seahawks head to Los Angeles this weekend for a Week 5 matchup with the Rams. Kickoff is set for 1:05 p.m. PT with television coverage on CBS (channel 7 in Seattle).
Here's a look at which team the national media is predicting to win this Sunday, October 8th at L.A. Memorial Coliseum:
Elliot Harrison at NFL.com sees a 23-17 victory for Los Angeles, ‚ÄúThe Rams always play the Seahawks tough, and have actually won three of the last four in the series. The fun part of this rivalry will be seeing how Los Angeles' new-and-improved offense under Sean McVay fares against Seattle's defense. Last year, the Rams won a defensive slugfest. Yet, even though the defense improved against Dallas, Wade Phillips' group is still allowing 26.2 points per game (28th in NFL).‚Äù
Alden Gonzalez at ESPN.com predicts a 23-20 Rams win, ‚ÄúThe Rams are feeling really good about themselves, coming off a big road win against the Cowboys. Their offense is clicking on all cylinders, and their defense finally showed signs of life in the second half Sunday, holding Dallas to a mere six points. They'll be energized, while at home against a tough division rival, and will sneak out another close win.‚ÄùBrady Henderson at ESPN.com gives Los Angeles the advantage, 24-23, ‚ÄúThe Seahawks are coming off one of the more dominant halves of football they've played under Pete Carroll, outscoring the Colts 36-3 and holding them to 32 yards in the second half last week. That was a reminder that their defense remains one of the NFL's best. The offense remains a question mark, however, and could be without starting left tackle Rees Odhiambo because of a chest injury. Even at full strength, Seattle's offensive line will have its hands full against a Rams front four that has given the Seahawks all sorts of trouble during the past few seasons. Russell Wilson‚Äòs QBR in five road games against the Rams is 48.6 compared with 71.5 in his 37 other road games. This has the makings of another close loss.‚Äù Seahawks.com
HILLARY Clinton has been diagnosed with pneumonia, doctors have revealed in a statement that sheds new light on her near-collapse after a September 11 commemoration ceremony on Sunday.
The presidential hopeful's ‚Äúmedical episode‚Äù has reignited the questions about her health, which were first raised by Donald Trump and his supporters.
Dr Lisa Bardack said in the statement that Clinton had been experiencing a ‚Äúcough related to allergies‚Äù and was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.
Clinton was given antibiotics and advised to rest and modify her schedule, but she became ‚Äúoverheated and dehydrated‚Äù at a September 11 memorial service in New York, Dr Bardack said.
‚ÄúI have just examined her and she is now rehydrated and recovering nicely,‚Äù she said.
The Democratic presidential candidate left the commemoration ceremony on the 15th anniversary of 9/11 on Sunday morning after just an hour-and-a-half. According to sources, she nearly fainted shortly before a moment of silence during the event at Ground Zero.
A witness told the New York Post the former secretary of state's knees buckled and she lost a shoe as her aides led her away from the crowds.
Video soon surfaced showing the 68-year-old losing her balance as she waited with her team for a car near the World Trade Centre. Clinton's security detail had to help her into the black van before she was driven to her daughter Chelsea's Manhattan apartment nearby.

‚ÄúSecretary Clinton attended the September 11th Commemoration Ceremony for just an hour and thirty minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen,‚Äù spokesman Nick Merrill said after the incident. ‚ÄúDuring the ceremony, she felt overheated, so departed to go to her daughter's apartment and is feeling much better.‚Äù
Earlier, Clinton was photographed in the crowd at Ground Zero alongside New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and US Senator Chuck Schumer. She was the only person wearing dark sunglasses during the overcast morning. The temperature was around 27C.
Clinton has been dogged by accusations of poor health for months now, with Republican candidate Donald Trump and his top surrogates claiming she does not have the ‚Äúmental and physical stamina‚Äù to be president.
She brushed off concerns about her poor health during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live last month, calling Trump's accusations a ‚Äúwacky strategy‚Äù against her.
Last week, Clinton suffered a two-minute coughing fit during a campaign event in Cleveland, Ohio which she blamed on seasonal allergies ‚Äî and her rival.
‚ÄúI've been talking so much. Every time I think about Trump I get allergic,‚Äù she joked in front of the crowd.
Trump seized the opportunity to cast doubt over Clinton's health again, tweeting, ‚ÄúWhat's up?‚Äù
Mainstream media never covered Hillary's massive ‚Äúhacking‚Äù
or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What's up? ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2016
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a close adviser to Trump, also raised the issue of Clinton's physical and mental health last month. ‚ÄúI think Hillary's tired ... she looks sick,‚Äù he told Fox News Sunday, accusing the mainstream media of hiding evidence and urging people to Google ‚ÄúHillary Clinton illness‚Äù to find support for his theory.
Before Dr Bardack's statement, the former secretary of state's doctor has repeatedly pronounced her health and fitness ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù. But there's no denying Clinton's ‚Äúoverheating‚Äù episode at such a high profile event couldn't have come at a worse time for her campaign.
With just 58 days until election day, Sunday's incident, combined with her coughing fit on Labor Day, is sure to undermine months of hard work from her campaign, which has been fighting to quell speculation about its candidate's health.
‚ÄúThose two things happening within six days of each other to a candidate who is 68 years old makes talk of Clinton's health no longer just the stuff of conspiracy theorists,‚Äù Washington Post political reporter Chris Cillizza writes.
The campaign already released a summary of Clinton's medical records and conditions last year, but Sunday's collapse is sure to fuel the fire and could revive calls for both candidates to release updated detailed health records ‚Äî something Trump has been pushing for.
The Republican candidate, who was also present during Sunday's 9/11 memorial ceremony, didn't immediately comment on Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis. But he referenced the incident on Tuesday morning during an interview with Fox and Friends, saying health is ‚Äúan issue‚Äù in the campaign.
‚ÄúSomething is going on but I hope she gets well,‚Äù Trump added.

Last week, Houston voters rejected the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), a measure that would have provided for comprehensive nondiscrimination protections for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT, community along with a number of other marginalized groups. Although this bill's aim ‚Äî protection from discrimination ‚Äî was straightforward, as Jos covered last week, it came under fire from conservative groups who subjected Houston voters to an intense misinformation campaign.
Acting through a front group known as the Campaign for Houston, conservatives focused in on the ordinance's protections for transgender Houstonians, and in particular, the law's coverage of public spaces like restaurants, stores, or hotels. While HERO would have simply ensured that a transgender person could use facilities in accordance with their gender identity without fear of harassment or discrimination, opponents claimed the ordinance would allow for male predators to infiltrate women's restrooms in order to sexually assault young girls, even nicknaming it the ‚ÄúSexual Predator Protection Act.‚Äù
I was raped as a college student just after my 19th birthday. I know firsthand the threat that gender-based violence poses to people living in Houston and beyond. What is clear to me is that not only is the anti-trans rhetoric employed by the opponents of HERO harmful to my transgender friends and neighbors, it also undermines the broader anti-violence movement.
As an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence, I know that there are no known cases of bathroom harassment resulting from non-discrimination policies like the one Houston was considering. Many jurisdictions ‚Äî 17 states and over 200 cities in fact ‚Äî have passed nondiscrimination laws. As the Center for American Progress notes in a 2014 report, ‚Äúlaw enforcement officers in [‚Ä¶] jurisdictions with protections found no increase in rape or sexual assaults stemming from gender identity and expression nondiscrimination laws.‚Äù Furthermore, nothing about nondiscrimination protections nullifies existing laws against harassing and harming individuals in bathrooms.
The Campaign for Houston was grossly opportunistic when it tapped into fears about rape to deny basic rights to LGBT people. Our trauma is not up for political grabs ‚Äî particularly by the same organizations whose victim-blaming rhetoric fuels rape culture and makes it extremely difficult for victims to come forward in the first place.
These bathroom scare-tactics have a long, sorry history among the right, originating with anti-feminist crusader Phyllis Schlafly. She has held that married women cannot be raped; that feminists routinely manufacture false rape claims; and that young women like me should accept rape as an occupational hazard of attending university.
Not to be outdone, the Alliance Defending Freedom, which served as a leading supporter of the Campaign for Houston, ‚Äúseeks to recover the robust Christendomic theology of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries.‚Äù Their vision would take us back into an era where women were treated as property and could be beaten and raped (in bathrooms nonetheless!) with impunity by their spouses.
And the Family Research Council, another group that opposed equality that has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, supports forcing rape victims to carry fetuses conceived through violence to full-term.
For groups that are prejudiced against survivors to call for discrimination in our names is despicable and offensive. Instead of promoting public safety, this stigmatizing rhetoric has the opposite effect: one study found that 70 percent of transgender respondents had experienced harassment, discrimination, or violence in a public restroom.
As a student survivor, I was protected by Title IX, which establishes that rape is an act of discrimination and requires schools to take action to support survivors. Similarly, we cannot allow discrimination against LGBT people to go unchecked. The real lesson from Houston is not that intolerance prevailed; it is that we need Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would provide the comprehensive non-discrimination protections that LGBT people and their families deserve.

A poor first half was followed with a more positive second, but neither side stamped their authority on the game.
Kenny Dalglish went with the expected side ‚Äì Steven Gerrard returned to play just behind Luis Suarez, with Dirk Kuyt in the side on the right.
Sir Alex Ferguson's line-up was far from expected ‚Äì he used Phil Jones in midfield, with Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernandez and Nani all on the bench.
Liverpool probably had the better of the game ‚Äì 15 shots (to United's 11), five on target (to United's two) and more clear-cut chances. The overall tactical battle was uninteresting, however ‚Äì static, pedestrian and cautious for the majority of the 90 minutes.
Formations
A high-tempo start resulted in many passes going astray. Liverpool's pass completion ratio in the first ten minutes was was 68%, compared to 75% in the rest of the game, whilst United's was 64% early on, and 73% thereafter.
Formations and positioning had much to do with the lack of creativity from both sides. The central midfield battle saw obvious individual clashes ‚Äì Lucas Leiva was close to Ryan Giggs, Charlie Adam was closed down by Phil Jones, and after a spell of freedom early on, Darren Fletcher was marshalled by Steven Gerrard from around the 15 minute mark. Giggs probably had the most space of any of the midfielders, since Lucas was keen to occupy a space in front of the defence rather than track his man across the pitch, but Giggs' impact upon the game was negligible.
The interesting early feature concerned Gerrard and Kuyt. The Dutchman would drift inside into the centre of the pitch, and then Gerrard would drift wider to the right (see below) meaning Darren Fletcher and Patrice Evra had to pass players on rather than follow them and get dragged out of position. This combination aside, there was little movement to develop passing angles or get players into space, and the first half was static.
by Guardian Chalkboards
Jones
One feature of the line-ups that did provide interest ‚Äì in theory rather than in the game ‚Äì was the use of Jones in midfield. He was expected to be used as the holding role in front of the back four, but instead played higher up to the right, told to stick tight to Adam. It was slightly surprising that he and Fletcher played this way around ‚Äì if you want someone to do a job on Adam, you'd expect the energy of Fletcher to be more appropriate than the physicality of Jones, who looked uncomfortable positionally and prevented United's attacks from flowing forward. At least Fletcher had some time on the ball in deeper positions when Gerrard moved to the right, and played some decent forward passes. Jones' role was similar to Pepe's against Barcelona at points in the Clasico series last year ‚Äì a nominal centre-back fielded high up the pitch.
The battles on the flanks rarely looked like contributing to a goal. Park Ji-Sung was tracking Jose Enrique rather than looking to take him on, Martin Kelly remained defensive and in position against Ashley Young, Stewart Downing couldn't outpace Chris Smalling, and Kuyt was coming inside. Downing sometimes drifted to the right, but Liverpool became lopsided and too compressed into one zone.
The strikers had to fend for themselves. Danny Welbeck's movement and link-up play was good, but no-one ever ran in behind him. Luis Suarez was a handful and stereotypically won lots of free-kicks (five, from Liverpool's 12 won overall) but could never quite beat both United centre-backs on his own.
by Guardian Chalkboards
Second half
The second half continued in similar fashion, although the game was less frantic and passing was crisper ‚Äì this contributed to a more enjoyable game, and more goalscoring chances.
Tactically, the first change was Dalglish removing Lucas and bringing on Jordan Henderson, who played the Gerrard role with Gerrard dropping deeper alongside Adam. Gerrard-Adam is not an ideal central midfield partnership ‚Äì it lacks structure with both players naturally moving forward and leaving space between the lines ‚Äì but against Giggs and Jones it was hardly like to be an issue. It did seem to invite the introduction of Rooney to play in the number ten role, however.
By the time Rooney arrived, United were 1-0 down after Gerrard's free-kick, and it seemed that Ferguson had left it too late to exploit Liverpool's weakness behind their midfield. At 1-0 up, the home side could play a defensive-minded game and leave Suarez to cause problems on the break.
In truth, there didn't seem to be much invention or imagination in the way Ferguson got United back into the game, it simply involved bringing on the three obvious attacking options ‚Äì Rooney, Hernandez and Nani ‚Äì with Park, Young and Jones off. United went to 4-2-3-1ish, or maybe 4-2-1-3ish, since Rooney was very deep in midfield and Welbeck and Nani were high up on the wings. Sheer weight of attacking numbers pushed United forward, but they created little and like Liverpool, relied on a set-piece for their equaliser.
Liverpool didn't attempt a shot between the two goals, but then stormed forward again and took advantage of the lack of structure in United's midfield. Henderson, their only substitute, was the brightest player and got himself into good positions, but maybe Andy Carroll could have come on to provide an aerial option for their late corners.
Conclusion
This game lacked a creator. There were functional midfielders and those trying to direct the game from deep, but no-one to provide a threaded through ball. The players in that zone were all too occupied with nullifying their opponents rather than creating; when Henderson came on, the question about his role was not ‚ÄòWhich position will he play in?' but ‚ÄòWhich opponent will he track?'
It wasn't an attractive game, nor a fascinating tactical battle.

Learn every language
Ozan Onay Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 30, 2016
In my first few days as a freshman, I met a classmate who claimed that he could code in any programming language I could name. Astonished, I challenged ‚Äúwhat about that unreadable esoteric language where the handful of commands merely simulate a Turing machine!?‚Äù He dryly replied ‚Äúyes it's called brainfuck; I know brainfuck‚Äù.
I was brainfucked. It was no trick, he could legitimately code in any language after a trivially brief refresher. How could an 18 year old kid know every language?
A brainfuck interpreter, written in brainfuck by Daniel B Cristofani (not my classmate)
While I'm still impressed by his feat, I'm not so astonished. After learning a few more languages myself, I came to realize that they were all less diverse than I had anticipated. After some more study, I started appreciating some of the underlying models of computation and programming language theory that make most languages look like different versions of the same basic ideas.These days my standard advice for students is ‚Äúaim to learn every language‚Äù.
Given that we're approaching the new year and folk will have new year's resolutions to learn Go or Rust or something, I want to encourage the alternative resolution: aim to learn every language! Hopefully this article will help you on your way!
Disclaimers :)
This isn't actually about becoming competent with 500+ languages. It's about understanding the common paradigms and implementation patterns so as to be confidently language agnostic
This is a long journey. You can make a lot of progress in a year, but depending on your current level it may take another ten
Some concepts may not seem relevant for a while, roll with it
Depending on your job and/or goals, this may not actually help you with your job and/or goals!
Why do it?
If you see yourself as reading and writing software for the bulk of your career, you owe it to yourself to be generally familiar with languages:
Even without picking your languages yourself, you will likely end up using a large number of them
Given the choice, being able to select the right tool for the job will make you more effective
As the popularity of languages ebb and flow, you will have a wider choice of jobs, companies and projects if you're not limited by language choice
Many high impact projects require fundamental understanding of compilers and languages, from general purpose language implementations and libraries to DSLs, databases, browsers, IDEs, static analysis tools and more
To me, the last point is the most important. Ras Bodik would emphasize this when convincing his students at Berkeley of the importance of his compilers course:
Don't be a boilerplate programmer. Instead, build tools for users and other programmers. Take historical note of textile and steel industries: do you want to build machines and tools, or do you want to operate those machines?
Step zero: stop calling yourself a Rails (etc) dev
This step is easy, but important. While you should be proud of yourself for mastering a language or technology, self-identifying as a specialist in any language creates a mental barrier to embracing another. Call yourself a software engineer and strive to live up to that title whatever the context.
Alex Gaynor loves Python enough to have served on the board of its foundation and contributed large portions of Django and PyPy, but that didn't stop him from tolerating Classic ASP for a couple of years to help the USDS. He calls himself a software engineer, and so should you.
Step one: go meta
There is an old joke about an applied physicist who finds himself at a string theory conference. Turning to a theoretical physicist he asks ‚Äúgee how do you all manage to think about things in 11 dimensions?‚Äù The theoretical physicist replies ‚Äúthat's easy, we just image N dimensions and substitute 11 for N.‚Äù
Strong programmers use the same trick. You may see Go as a new and challenging language; strong programmers see it as a compiled statically typed language with garbage collection and CSP style concurrency. Swift is new and carefully designed, but a strong programmer can pick it up easily: it is just a general purpose compiled language with objected-oriented features like protocols, implemented with LLVM.
The meta level of languages is the undergraduate compilers class. Unfortunately, the name is misleading for two reasons: firstly, the class isn't strictly about the mechanics of compilers; its main purpose for most students is to deeply understand languages. Secondly, some people see ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù and ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù as opposites, so assume that a compilers class will not teach them about the implementations of their favorite dynamic languages‚Ä¶ this is not true, there is a tremendous amount of overlap, and most compilers courses include a section on bytecodes and virtual machines. But the name ‚Äúcompilers‚Äù has generally stuck.
For those who never had the opportunity to take a compilers course, there are some great books and online courseware available. In particular I would suggest Alex Aiken's course which was previously available on Coursera and now on Stanford's own MOOC platform Lagunita. Berkeley's CS164 is also a good option‚Ä¶ unfortunately Berkeley has stopped publishing video from newer sessions, but Ras Bodik's 2012 session is still available.
The canonical text in compilers is Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools, commonly called ‚Äúthe Dragon Book‚Äù. Like all canonical texts, it has both rabid fans and thoughtful detractors; my overall view is that it is the best single book, but expect to cover it in multiple passes through your career. Myles particularly likes Language Implementation Patterns by Terence Parr. It is written more directly for the practicing software engineer who intends to work on small language projects like DSLs, so you may find it more approachable than the Dragon Book as a first stop.
The ‚ÄúDragon book‚Äù, still the best single book on compilers if you had to pick one
For those located in San Francisco who prefer more hands on instruction, you may be interested in Bradfield's languages, compilers and interpreters course.
Step two: select archetypal languages
With a good theoretical foundation it will be easier to pick up new languages, but not easy enough to go off and learn 500+ of them. The trick now will be to identify and learn languages that are archetypal of the powerful ideas and common paradigms across all others. With a good selection, it should be trivial to then triangulate toward new languages.
Peter Norvig makes his own suggestion of what are the important paradigms, as well as their archetypal languages:
Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one language that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that emphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), and one that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).
This is a great starting point in my opinion, but you may want to go a little further to cover a broader field.
Firstly, I would suggest learning C as early as possible. It is so ubiquitous and influential, for better or worse, that it will make it much easier to learn other languages on your list (particularly C++, on Norvig's). More rationale here, advice for self-teaching here.
I would also recommend learning an assembly language, MIPS for the easiest path or x86 for the most practical. This will probably teach you more about computer architecture than languages, but it provides the lowest common denominator, too, when reasoning about language implementation. Maybe one day I will recommend LLVM intermediate representation instead.
Norvig recommends learning a declarative language, but I would be more specific and say learn a logic programming language. This could be Prolog as he suggests, or miniKanren via the book The Reasoned Schemer.
In my opinion, a great choice for Norvig's ‚Äúparallelism‚Äù requirement is CUDA. This is parallelism at a much more dramatic scale than your 4 core CPU and exposes you to the new and interesting architecture of your GPU, increasing in relevance given its use in machine learning. This has different lessons to teach though than languages that emphasize concurrency, so Go, Clojure or Erlang may still be a good bet.
Array based programming is another very powerful paradigm. Norvig may have omitted it given that it has found most of its application in highly quantitative fields, but I feel that it is interesting to non-quantitative programmers too, as an example of a dramatically different set of starting primitives. APL/J/K/Q are mind-bending archetypal languages in this category, although Matlab/octave may be more accessible.
Not quite a paradigm, but it's worth becoming familiar with a handful of narrow purpose languages, if nothing else to realize that writing a narrow purpose language may be a good solution to a problem one day. Frink is a personal favorite, AWK is another exemplar.
It is hard to stop there! Some would insist that Forth is essential so as to understand stack-based languages; I personally feel like we have enough exposure to stack-based languages through stack-based virtual machines in dynamic languages. Others will tell me I missed something else. This is not a definitive list! Hopefully it will get you started.
Step three: practice
It is easy to make a list of target languages, but it will take more work to build up your familiarity with them. If you are lucky, you will be able to use some of these for your work or projects. For the others, in my opinion you must combine both study and deliberate practice. Without study, progress will be slow; without practice, your understanding is less likely to stick.
A good way to start approaching a new language is to read relevant entries in Hyperpolyglot and Learn X in Y Minutes. These will introduce some of the key ideas of the language as well as start to remove the syntax barrier. If you already have a language in the same family under your belt, Hyperpolyglot's side-by-side comparison can take surprisingly far.
Another worthwhile exercise is to seek out the design rationale for the language. This will make it easier to see the intended purpose of the language and give you some extra motivation to learn it. For instance, if you are wary of learning C++ or skeptical of Bjarne's decisions, you should definitely read his history book The Design and Evolution of C++. There are similar motivating resources for most languages.
Understanding a language designer's rationale before attempting to learn their language may instill the respect that you'll need to open-mindedly explore its novel aspects. This book is a good example for C++, others exist for most languages.
After that it may make sense to either read a reference book or jump straight into solving some small problems.
It is hard to make general recommendations for reference books, but I would say seek out the oldest, most canonical books aimed at experienced programmers new to that particular language. These books will have detractors, but older books tend to be better at conveying the important ideas and design decisions behind a language, and are more often written by its designers and key implementers, whereas newer books tend to focus on applications or optimize for approachability.
The most rapid way to ramp up in a new language, in my opinion, is to find a set of small problems and progressively work through them. Exercism.io is a good source, and it may even have a test suite for problems in the language you're targeting. Small problems are easy to fit in around work and other projects, can be calibrated to your level of difficulty, and on aggregate can cover most of the surface area of the language, removing the syntax familiarity barrier.
Once you feel familiar with the key ideas and comfortable with the syntax, I would suggest finding a larger project, but specifically one for which the language was intended. If it is a systems language like C or Go you may want to write a command line tool that makes a lot of syscalls, if C++ then perhaps a raytracer, if a scripting language like Python or ruby then a performance non-critical algorithmic problem like a tic-tac-toe AI, and so on.
Keep looking
Given the number of languages in the world, and the continued use of older languages like C, it's easy to conclude that we have already invented all of the languages we need. This is a highly constricting response.
There is a huge gap between what we know to be computable and what we have managed thus far to instruct computers to do. This is not due to a lack of resources: between Moore's law and the increasing accessibility of cloud resources, we have enough compute to do much more sophisticated and impactful work than we're doing currently. The problem must be in our interfaces, being languages and our tools for using them.
Gerald Jay Sussman makes this point in his tremendous talk We Really Don't Know How To Compute. He uses an existing (and old!) language in his examples, so may argue that our tools are not the problem. But for whatever reason, our current tools haven't enabled us to address the opportunity he highlights of dramatically more effective computing.
Kanizsa's triangle illusion. Sussman points out that it is trivially easy for the computers in our heads to see the triangle, but still exceedingly difficult to program our silicon computers to do so.
One of many interesting frontiersmen right now is Chris Granger, working on Eve. He did not set out to write a language so much as a tool for thought on the scale of the spreadsheet. The language has ended up being a critical and tightly coupled component of the platform; languages are so important to our ability to harness computers that that is no surprise.
Whether on not Eve becomes the next big programming platform, language-centric tools for thought will be part of our future, at least if we hope to harness all to compute now at our disposal. Like Ras Bodik, I would encourage you to be part of this movement, learn languages rather than a language, and use your foundational understanding doing high impact work.
Finn Makwan Amirkhani will make his debut in Sweden on January 24th at the Tele2 Arena. The FinnFighters Gym fighter out of Turku will enter the Octagon at 10 wins and 2 losses and take on five time UFC veteran Englishman Andy Ogle.
The Finish featherweight has won 8 of his past 9 bouts, most recently winning a unanimous decision over Yohan Guerin at Cage 26 in April. Before this bout, he dropped a unanimous decision to Adam Ward at Cage 24 in November of 2013.
MMAViking.com's 2012 ‚ÄòShowman of the Year‚Äò always puts on a show outside the cage, and his grappling ability has helped him with an array of fight finishing submissions inside. 8 of his 10 wins have come by submission, including 2 brabo chokes, 2 triangles, 2 rear-naked chokes, a guillotine, and a heel hook.
Ogle is no stranger to the Octagon, but has had limited success. In his five UFC bouts he has lost four of them, and is currently on a three fight losing streak. The Team Kaobon fighter most recently lost to Maximo Blanco in May on the UFC Fight Night ‚Äì Munoz vs Mousasi card.
Amirkhani becomes the first Finn to fight at a UFC in Sweden, and only the fifth from Finland to compete in the Octagon. The bout will be on the prelim card, which will start at 23:00 Stockholm / 24:00 Helsinki time.

Has anyone else noticed that we've been seeing fewer algorithm update announcements from Google in recent years? That Google's PR campaigns about changing search results has been quieting down?
If you have, rest assured: you're not crazy.
I scrolled through Moz's Google Algorithm Change History recently and graphed the number of changes by year (an imperfect study, probably, but a pretty good general standard).
Since a dramatic peak in 2012, the number of update announcements has been dropping. (That low number for 2015 is my own projection, based on what we've seen so far and on what you're about to read.)
Why?
Two Reasons For Fewer Google Algo Update Announcements
I don't think that Google will ever kick back, put up their collective feet, and stop updating. So why the drop?
1. Mind Control: Google Wants To Change SEO Behavior
First, Google doesn't make those big announcements just to ensure sure that all their friends in the SEO community are on the same happy page. They announce algorithm updates because they want to change SEO behavior.
The war on links is a great example. Google doesn't want its bots fooled by spammy backlinks, so along comes Penguin. They could have released the algorithm change, and all its subsequent updates, without a word; but, in addition to actually devaluing bad links, they also want black hat SEOs to just stop it already.
In that regard, fewer updates means Google sees less of a need to change our behavior. Have they beaten the SEO world into submission? Whipped us into shape? Or just stopped caring if we're on board?
2. Conditioning: Google Wants To Switch To Constant, Imperceptible Updates
Second, at the risk of sounding like a dramatic sci-fi narrator: artificial intelligence. Google is already releasing algorithms that learn. The latest, dubbed ‚ÄúDQN,‚Äù is learning and mastering Atari games all on its own.
Google search results are always gettings smarter. The changes in results are becoming deliberately more subtle and more intuitive, such that most users hardly notice them at all. If Google's algorithms are in the early stages of learning, they can easily make small, undercover changes on the fly.
The number of unnamed and unconfirmed updates bears this out. Just last month, SERP-trackers and webmasters noticed some major shifts in search results, but Google has yet to officially confirm the update. Are those relatively minor updates unannounced because they're not worth the PR effort, or because Google didn't intend for us to notice?
If it weren't for tools like MozCast and other SERP-tracking utilities, many of those updates might go unnoticed. On the other hand, the MozCast might make these sneaky updates even easier for Mountain View engineers ‚Äî even they can watch the MozCast to make sure their changes stay just below the radar.
This begs the question: How many changes do go unnoticed? Are we catching them all? Is Google's future in AI learning machines that can make quiet, invisible updates day in and day out?
Google Is Investing Heavily in AI
It's no secret that Google has a lot of skin in the game when it comes to artificial intelligence. Google has been slowly collecting researchers and developers, scattering the purchase of various departments over continents and years‚Ä¶ probably in hopes that no one would notice. Oh, we noticed.
March 2013: Google acquires DNNresearch, a neural network startup out of the University of Toronto, and gets the team refocused on expanding traditional search algorithms.
Google acquires DNNresearch, a neural network startup out of the University of Toronto, and gets the team refocused on expanding traditional search algorithms. January 2014: Google acquires DeepMind and sets up the artificial intelligence team to work directly with the Knowledge team on Google's search algorithms. (They also, almost immediately, set up an AI ethics board ‚Äî presumably, to save the human race from AI-wrought extinction.)

Google expanded research surrounding quantum computing by hiring John Martinis and his research team out of UCSB. October 2014: Google acqui-hires two teams of AI researchers from Oxford (and announces a partnership with the University) to ‚Äúenable machines to better understand what users are saying to them.‚Äù
Google has put up a pretty penny to build a team of researchers that can push machines to the very edge of artificial intelligence.
Google Is Already Smarter Than We Realize
The new development may not impose dramatic changes on Google search right away, but not because it's not applicable.
The truth is, soft AI is pretty much everywhere these days, and Google has been employing machine learning techniques since the Panda update (and probably further back still). Google's own super-smart Knowledge Graph is friendly enough to inform us that machine learning is, in fact, a type of artificial intelligence.
Is it possible that the reason we have only seen one major update so far in 2015 (and an unnamed update at that) is that Google no longer needs to launch major algorithm changes? If its AI bots are busily making small, under-the-radar updates every minute of the day, Google might never have to launch (and therefore announce) another update ever again.
The Future Could Get Even Weirder
That the future of algorithm updates is up in the air is somewhat unsettling, but it may only be the beginning.
Google already curates its own medical information, in part to protect us from misinformation I'm sure. (Has anyone else noticed that medical keywords are some of the most expensive keywords Google Ads has to offer?)
Next, it might be checking facts for us to determine rankings. No matter where you land on the political spectrum, there is a valid concern that this type of algo could stifle bold new voices in the scientific community.
It could make it more difficult for bright young people to bring about the next revolution in science. After all, most of today's established science came about because someone challenged the herd mentality of yesterday. Jim Purtilo, Associate Professor of Computer Science at U of Maryland
What's A Marketer to Do?
Will Google's search algorithms soon be driven primarily, or completely, by artificially intelligent machines?
Even though Google's tactics are changing, their endgame is not. That means the intersection of SEO and content marketing is still the sweet spot for marketers to focus on:
Identify specific, measurable attributes of high-quality content, and put them into practice. Google's algorithm updates may be more like ninjas than Goliaths from here on out, but the goal is the same. Keep your eye (and your SEO) on the prize.
and put them into practice. Google's algorithm updates may be more like ninjas than Goliaths from here on out, but the goal is the same. Keep your eye (and your SEO) on the prize. Think user intent , not just keywords. The later are still valuable, but only in the context of the former. Keep improving how you talk to your audience, not how you talk to search engines.
The later are still valuable, but only in the context of the former. Keep improving how you talk to your audience, not how you talk to search engines. Kill the silos and blend SEO into your broader marketing efforts. SEO is marketing, and marketing needs SEO. Welcome to the future.
It also may be a good idea to understand Google's Knowledge Graph, as it is probably the harbinger of what is coming.
The Certainty Of Change
The future of search is simultaneously settled and uncertain. Google wants to deliver the best user experience possible, but how they do it and what it looks like on SERPs is (still) constantly changing.
And until you can beat its high score on Space Invaders, it doesn't have to tell you about updates if it doesn't want to.

Trump lacks team and clear plan for quick tax reform
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax reform, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts.
In an echo of its attempt to roll back Obamacare that ended in an embarrassing collapse in Congress, the Trump administration has vowed quick action on taxes.
But it has yet to appoint people with the skills to evaluate complex tax laws, draft legislation and sell it to deeply divided lawmakers.
Burned by last week¬¥s failed healthcare measure largely authored by House of Representatives Republicans, Trump is determined not to count on Congress so much this time for handling the details on taxes, his second major legislative initiative.
But that only underscores his need for a strong White House tax team, which the administration still lacks.
Many policy options are still being studied, from deficit-funded tax cuts to a European-style value-added tax.
"They¬¥re still sorting out who¬¥s in charge, who¬¥s going to take the lead," said William Hoagland, a longtime Senate Republican aide who worked on the last successful comprehensive tax reform effort in 1986."You need someone who has the ear and support of the president who can sell a tax plan, and you need the technical support for that person,‚Äù said Hoagland, now senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.
Financial markets have been reassessing expectations of fast action on taxes that have helped fuel a Trump stocks rally.
Members of Trump¬¥s tax team are known, but not their exact duties. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are senior team leaders.
Others include White House advisers Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
Trump huddled with Mnuchin on Thursday to discuss taxes. ‚ÄúWe are at the first stages of this process, beginning to engage with members of Congress, policy groups, business leaders, industry, constituents from around the country, and other stakeholders,‚Äù White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday, Trump¬¥s 69th day in office.
When Trump was elected in November, Republican lawmakers enthusiastically joined his call to rewrite the tax code and dismantle Obamacare in the first 100 days of his presidency.
In early February, Trump promised a "phenomenal" tax plan by early March that never appeared.
Mnuchin spoke on Feb. 23 of enacting tax reform by August.
Spicer acknowledged this week that the timetable could be slipping.
Another senior White House official said the administration had assumed it would still be working on healthcare at this point, not tax reform yet.
The official, not authorized to speak publicly, spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
So far, Trump¬¥s tax campaign is a far cry from President Ronald Reagan¬¥s 1986 effort, in which Don Regan, as Treasury secretary and then White House chief of staff, spent many months developing legislation that won bipartisan support in Congress.
CodePath goes back to school
To bridge the gap between industry best practices and what's taught in academia we plan to have CodePath classes running in hundreds of universities within the next three years. CodePath has spent years training senior engineers and designers inside of companies like Facebook, Dropbox, and Google on the latest technologies in mobile and web development. We believe that bringing the same classes to universities and introducing modern technologies like iOS, Android, and Node.js in the context of building practical apps will complement the traditional computer science curriculum.
As students near graduation, this can also help expose and prepare them for the thousands of opportunities in tech companies in Silicon Valley as well as other tech hubs. However, this program is not just for existing computer science students. We believe that introducing technology through building web and mobile apps will attract a diverse population who had not previously considered computer science.
The gap between school and industry
By the time I entered college as a Computer Engineering major, a nerd father, nerd summer camps, and years of nerd training prepared me well for my freshman year. With several programming languages under my belt, I felt at ease in the early logic and algorithm classes. And yet, in 1999, I had a vague sense that I was on the sidelines as my more adventurous friends were tackling PHP and throwing around words like ‚Äúshopping cart‚Äù and ‚Äúsession cookies‚Äù. By the time I decided to explore more, it seemed like the crowd had already moved on to Cold Fusion and ASP. I still remember the general sense of frustration and confusion I felt after graduation as I was trying to understand the actual technical landscape that was so different from my textbooks.
This is not a condemnation of computer science programs. Critics of traditional degree programs will sometimes cite the fact that, in practice, most programmers don't write compilers or operating systems or rebalance binary trees or route through graphs. While it's true that web and mobile apps require a completely different set of tasks, I don't regret learning the fundamentals. You can be a successful car mechanic without ever learning about the principles of combustion or aerodynamics, but you'll probably never build your own race car.
However, there is a distinct gap between what's taught in school and what's practiced in industry. Our courses are designed to run in conjunction with university programs and bridge that gap. As students prepare for the transition into industry, the practical skills we give them will open thousands of doors. On the flip side, companies spend millions on university recruiting, focusing on only the top 50 schools and running interview drills that they know to be imperfect assessments. We hope that our program will pave the way for students from thousands of colleges and universities to discover and prepare for the opportunities they're looking for.
‚ÄúStarted from the bottom, now I am an intermediate iOS developer. Bootcamp fulfilled all the promises Tim made. ‚Äù ‚Äì Stanford Student in Spring 2015 iOS Class
CodePath pilots iOS Class at Stanford
Earlier this year, we ran our first university class in iOS development for a group of 20 Stanford students sponsored by Andreessen Horowitz. Our instructor co-taught with a student instructor and a team of three TAs, and students participated either for independent study credits or no credits. We used the same policies that we have for our professional classes: unexcused absences or incomplete weekly projects will result in being withdrawn from the class. Despite having overburdened class schedules and other commitments, 15 students were able to successfully submit all projects and present a final group project which is an app they designed and built. Students in the program connected with senior iOS engineers from Wealthfront, Amazon, Linkedin, and Nest. Andreessen Horowitz also agreed to provide access to their portfolio of companies to all students in the program. To top it off, CodePath provided a $5,000 cash prize to the top student projects.
This program is not just for senior computer science students. Over the past few years, we've run an extremely successful program teaching designers how to build native mobile apps that was initially created for Facebook. Even though the designers have limited or no programming experience, they're driven to create the apps they can see in their imagination. The class isn't just about building apps like the one shown below. Designers gain confidence in their ability to pursue their own ideas, can work more seamlessly with engineers, and earn greater respect from their more technical peers.
WorkDay
Teaching designers successfully has helped us confirm that programming can be learned relatively quickly even by those with no prior experience. Unfortunately, in many universities there is a belief that only those who have been programming since childhood or with exceptional abilities in math or logic can learn new languages in a reasonable timeline. Furthermore, programming is rarely thought of as a field for those seeking to express creativity in their work.
We believe that a big part of the achievement gap in programming is in fact a motivation gap.
Most non-technical people are puzzled when programmers refer to themselves as the creative type or go on about the joys of seeing their ideas come to life. It doesn't help that most introductory programming courses emphasize that the field is only for the ‚Äòlogical' and the ‚Äògifted'. It's no wonder that most creative, intelligent young people steer clear of dreary computer science classes. We believe that a big part of the achievement gap in programming is in fact a motivation gap. By motivating students with a clear vision of the things they can create, they'll be inspired to learn more and to get through the difficult parts of the learning process. We're in the early days of our university program, but we're excited by the impact that we'll have in this community and beyond.
"Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis."
A significant theme of President Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address was that the United States economy has come back from the brink. One of the metrics he used to make this claim was unemployment rate.
During his address, Obama said that "our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis."
We decided to check whether that's correct.
The most recent reported monthly unemployment rate was 5.6 percent for December 2014. The last time it was that low was in June 2008, when it was also 5.6 percent.
The financial crisis occurred after June 2008 -- it's generally dated to the implosion of the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers in September 2008. So Obama clearly has a point.
That said, there are a few caveats.
First, while we have no quarrel with Obama using the most basic version of the unemployment rate, it's worth mentioning that there's another version of the unemployment rate, known as U-6, that isn't as favorable to the president's case.
The U-6 statistic tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the more familiar unemployment rate. It takes into account not just people who are unemployed but also people working part-time who would rather have full-time work, as well as people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. Because it includes these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher.
As it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the more basic unemployment rate -- hasn't returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, which is higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008 and the 10.8 percent rate one month earlier in August 2008.
Second, while economists cheer the clear improvement in the basic unemployment rate, they also fret that a portion of that improvement stems from Americans leaving the labor market rather than finding jobs after experiencing joblessness. (The unemployment rate can improve either if someone goes back to work, or if they leave the labor market entirely.)
A way to measure this is by looking at a statistic called the labor force participation rate, which measures the number of people in the labor force divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up hope of finding a job.
The labor force participation rate has decreased markedly since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66.0 percent, but that fell to 62.7 percent by December 2014, the most recent month available. It's now at its lowest point since the late 1970s, a time when fewer women were working.
Part of this is explained by the retirement of the large Baby Boom generation, but not all -- and the trendline worries many economists. So Obama has justification for celebrating the unemployment rate's decline, but it's worth remembering that that's not the only important labor-market statistic out there.
Our ruling
Obama said "our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis." He's correct when using the basic unemployment rate -- the most commonly cited figure -- but it's worth noting that other measures of the labor market are not quite so rosy. The unemployment rate may be dropping, if only in part, because people have stopped looking for work.
The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

We then issued a warning to remove the illegal content from their server, which they refused to do. -- At apprx 11:30pm CST on October 14, 2011 We infiltrated the shared hosting server of Freedom Hosting and shutdown services to all clients due to their lack of action to remove child pornography from their server. -- At apprx 5:00pm CST on October 15, 2011 Freedom Hosting installed their backups and restored services to their child pornography clients. We then issued multiple warnings to remove all child pornography from their servers, which Freedom Hosting refused to do. -- At apprx 8:00pm CST on October 15, 2011 despite new security features, we once again infiltrated the shared hosting server at Freedom Hosting and stopped service to all clients. -- ------------------------ Our Statement ------------------------ The owners and operators at Freedom Hosting are openly supporting child pornography and enabling pedophiles to view innocent children, fueling their issues and putting children at risk of abduction, molestation, rape, and death. For this, Freedom Hosting has been declared #OpDarknet Enemy Number One. By taking down Freedom Hosting, we are eliminating 40+ child pornography websites, among This is Lolita City, one of the largest child pornography websites to date containing more than 100GB of child pornography. We will continue to not only crash Freedom Hosting's server, but any other server we find to contain, promote, or support child pornography. ------------------------ Our Demands ------------------------ Our demands are simple. Remove all child pornography content from your servers. Refuse to provide hosting services to any website dealing with child pornography. This statement is not just aimed at Freedom Hosting, but everyone on the internet. It does not matter who you are, if we find you to be hosting, promoting, or supporting child pornography, you will become a target. ------------------------ Images & Misc ------------------------ Dead Server Screenshot: http://i55.tinypic.com/vy9w7k.jpg -- Freedom Host PR Screenshot: http://i53.tinypic.com/o5qlip.jpg -- Our Manifesto: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuJp_zPIlU -- #Antisec | #Anonymous | #FreeTopiary | #AnonOps | #FreeAnons | #OccupyWallSteet | #OWS We are Anonymous.
